these services…, it may be cost prohibitive to return to the current City-owned and operated
structure.” The analysis also cautioned that “Several findings in this report, including the fact that
the proposed system costs more than the current system, the potential operational impact from
stopping the use of Microsoft Office, the shift in control over the City's e-mail and office applications
to an outside vendor, and uncertainty surrounding security issues, illustrate the potential risks of
approving this contract.”

The City of Los Angeles was able to negotiate a number of security and privacy-related
items into the SaaS E-mail and Collaboration Solution (SECS) contract that would be of
interest to most government agencies [CSC10, Ove10, Wil10]. For example, the police
and fire departments expressed concern that arrest records and other sensitive criminal
data they handle could be vulnerable when maintained on external servers. This resulted
in the requirement to protect the City’s data through mandatory encryption, segregation
from other data maintained by the cloud provider, and constraints on data storage location
[LAPD10, Wil10]. As an added measure, the cloud provider’s employees who have
access to the City’s data must pass background checks by the California Department of
Justice.

Other important negotiated features include on-site audit rights of the contractor’s security
program, service level requirements with monetary penalties, electronic discovery
functionality, well-defined data ownership and exit rights, mandatory subcontractor flow-
down, and a broad indemnification obligation with unlimited liability for certain breaches
[Ove10, SECS09, Wil10]. Data remains permanently the sole and exclusive property of
the City [Cra10]. The cloud provider requires written approval from the City to open any
files in the clear; all accesses are logged and the City has a means to self-audit accesses
[Cra10].

As with nearly all software changeovers, training, integration, data migration, and other
related issues exist and their impact on productivity should not be underestimated or
discounted when planning cloud computing initiatives [Mic10]. For example, there were
some striking differences in features between L.A.’s legacy electronic mail services and
those of the SaaS [DPW10]: the cloud provider's mail service did not support classifying
outgoing electronic mail with High, Standard, and Low priority; it also did not support a
feature to track replies from recipients; nor did it support the use of folders to organize
email, relying instead on labels. City employees were also required to carry out important
migration-related tasks that include such things as cleaning up existing mail accounts by
deleting all unimportant electronic mail and canceled appointments; archiving all mail by
year; and individually saving any mail attachments larger than 25 megabytes, since they
would not be automatically migrated to the new system [DPW10].

The security of sensitive data from the police department and other city agencies proved
to be a more difficult requirement to satisfy than thought originally, and caused a delay in
implementation [CLA10, LAPD10, Sar10]. Because of the delay, the legacy system
continued to operate in parallel with the replacement system longer than originally planned
and at additional cost, until a solution could be put into place. Hundreds of police
department accounts that were switched over to the new system had to be restored to the
legacy system in the interim. The Director of Operations for the cloud provider noted: “LA’s
move to the cloud is the first of its kind, and it’s not surprising that it’s taken a little longer than
anticipated to identify and address all of the City’s unique requirements” [Din10].

In December 2010, the City of LA issued a Notice of Deficiencies to the contractor raising
concerns about the failure of the system to meet all security requirements and its impact
on City departments [CWD10, Vij11]. In April 2011, it was reported that if this issue was
not resolved by June 2011, the end of the fiscal year, City officials would consider
terminating the agreement, and possibly look into whether a breach of contract occurred
[Sar11a, Vij11].
