                                                                                     GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



    (NFS), or database services (e.g., Open Database Connectivity [ODBC]). The network protocols to
    be used for each service (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) should also be identified.

 Identify any network service software, both client and server, to be installed on the server and any
  other support servers.

 Identify the users or categories of users of the server and any support hosts.

 Determine the privileges that each category of user will have on the server and support hosts.

 Determine how the server will be managed (e.g., locally, remotely from the internal network,
  remotely from external networks).

 Decide if and how users will be authenticated and how authentication data will be protected.

 Determine how appropriate access to information resources will be enforced.

 Determine which server applications meet the organization’s requirements. Consider servers that
  may offer greater security, albeit with less functionality in some instances. Some issues to consider
  include—

    –   Cost

    –   Compatibility with existing infrastructure

    –   Knowledge of existing employees

    –   Existing manufacturer relationship

    –   Past vulnerability history

    –   Functionality.

 Work closely with manufacturer(s) in the planning stage.

The choice of server application may determine the choice of OS. However, to the degree possible,
server administrators should choose an OS that provides the following: 7

 Ability to granularly restrict administrative or root level activities to authorized users only

 Ability to granularly control access to data on the server

 Ability to disable unnecessary network services that may be built into the OS or server software

 Ability to control access to various forms of executable programs, such as Common Gateway
  Interface (CGI) scripts and server plug-ins for Web servers, if applicable

 Ability to log appropriate server activities to detect intrusions and attempted intrusions
