Hash-based message    A message authentication code that uses an approved keyed-
authentication code   hash function.
(HMAC)
Hash function         A function that maps a bit string of arbitrary length to a fixed
                      length bit string. Approved hash functions satisfy the following
                      properties:
                       1. (One-way) It is computationally infeasible to find any input
                           that maps to any pre-specified output, and
                       2. (Collision free) It is computationally infeasible to find any
                           two distinct inputs that map to the same output.
Hash value            The result of applying a hash function to information.
Identifier            A bit string that is associated with a person, device or
                      organization. It may be an identifying name, or may be
                      something more abstract (for example, a string consisting of an
                      IP address and timestamp), depending on the application.
Integrity             The property that sensitive data has not been modified or
                      deleted in an unauthorized and undetected manner. In this
                      Recommendation, the statement that a cryptographic algorithm
                      "provides integrity" means that the algorithm is used to detect
                      unauthorized modifications or deletions.
Key                   See Cryptographic key.
Key agreement         A key-establishment scheme whose resultant keying material is
                      a function of information contributed by two or more
                      participants, so that no party can predetermine the value of the
                      keying material.
Key Bundle            A set of keys used during one operation, typically a TDEA
                      operation.
Key component         A parameter used in conjunction with other key components in
                      an approved security function to form a plaintext cryptographic
                      key or perform a cryptographic function.
Key distribution      The transport of a key and other keying material from an entity
                      that either owns or generates the key to another entity that is
                      intended to use the key.
Key-encryption key    A cryptographic key that is used for the encryption or
                      decryption of other keys.
Key establishment     A procedure that results in keying material that is shared among
                      different parties.
Key management        The activities involving the handling of cryptographic keys and
                      other related security parameters (e.g., IVs and passwords)
                      during the entire life cycle of the keys, including their
                      generation, storage, establishment, entry and output, and
