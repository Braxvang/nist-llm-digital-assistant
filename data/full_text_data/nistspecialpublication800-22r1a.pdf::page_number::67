Large values of Χ 2 indicate that the sequence has clusters of ones; the generation of “random'” sequences
by humans tends to lead to small values of ν n (see [3, p. 55]).

3.5 Binary Matrix Rank Test
Another approach to testing for randomness is to check for linear dependence among fixed-length
substrings of the original sequence: construct matrices of successive zeroes and ones from the sequence,
and check for linear dependence among the rows or columns of the constructed matrices. The deviation of
the rank - or rank deficiency - of the matrices from a theoretically expected value gives the statistic of
interest.

This test is a specification of one of the tests coming from the DIEHARD [1] battery of tests. It is based
on the result of Kovalenko [2] and also formulated by Marsaglia and Tsay [3]. The result states that the
rank R of the M x Q random binary matrix takes values r = 0, 1, 2, …, m where m ≡ min(M,Q) with
probabilities

                                                                      i−Q         i− M

                                  pr = 2   r(Q +M −r)−MQ
                                                           ∏          1− 2 i− r
                                                           i= 0


The probability values are fixed in the test suite code for M = Q = 32. The number M is then a parameter
of this test, so that ideally n = M2N, where N is the new “sample size.” In practice, values for M and N are
chosen so that the discarded
                        €       part of the string, n - NM2, is fairly small.

The rationale for this choice is that
