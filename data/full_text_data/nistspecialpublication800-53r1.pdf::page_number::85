CM-5      ACCESS RESTRICTIONS FOR CHANGE

          Control: The organization: (i) approves individual access privileges and enforces physical and
          logical access restrictions associated with changes to the information system; and (ii) generates,
          retains, and reviews records reflecting all such changes.
          Supplemental Guidance: Planned or unplanned changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware
          components of the information system can have significant effects on the overall security of the
          system. Accordingly, only qualified and authorized individuals obtain access to information
          system components for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades, and modifications.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to enforce access restrictions and support
                auditing of the enforcement actions.


           LOW Not Selected              MOD CM-5                  HIGH CM-5 (1)



CM-6      CONFIGURATION SETTINGS

          Control: The organization: (i) establishes mandatory configuration settings for information
          technology products employed within the information system; (ii) configures the security settings
          of information technology products to the most restrictive mode consistent with operational
          requirements; (iii) documents the configuration settings; and (iv) enforces the configuration
          settings in all components of the information system.
          Supplemental Guidance: Configuration settings are the configurable parameters of the information
          technology products that compose the information system. Organizations monitor and control
          changes to the configuration settings in accordance with organizational policies and procedures.
          OMB FISMA reporting instructions provide guidance on configuration requirements for federal
          information systems. NIST Special Publication 800-70 provides guidance on producing and using
          configuration settings for information technology products employed in organizational
          information systems. Related security controls: CM-2, CM-3, SI-4.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to centrally manage, apply, and verify
                configuration settings.


           LOW CM-6                      MOD CM-6                  HIGH CM-6 (1)
