Information Technology Security Training Requirements


Performance-Based           — a method   for designing learning objectives based on behavioral
outcomes, rather than on content that provides benchmarks for evaluating learning effectiveness.


Residual Risk       —   the potential for the occurrence of an adverse event after adjusting for the
impact of all in-place safeguards. (See Total Risk, Acceptable Risk, and Minimum Level of
Protection.)


Risk   —   the probability that a particular security threat will exploit a system vulnerability.


Risk [\/lanagement       —   the on-going process of assessing the risk to IT resources and
information, as part of a risk-based approach used to determine adequate security for a system, by
analyzing the threats and vulnerabilities and selecting appropriate cost-effective controls to
achieve and maintain an acceptable level of risk.


Roles and Responsibilities           — functions performed by someone     in a specific situation and
obligations to tasks or duties for which that person is accountable.


Role-Based        — mapped    to job function, assumes that a person will take on different roles, over
time, within an organization and different responsibilities in relation to IT systems.


Sensitivity     —   the degree to which an IT system or application requires protection (to ensure
confidentiality, integrity, and availability) which is determined by an evaluation of the nature and
criticality of the data processed, the relation of the system to the organization missions and the

economic value of the system components.

System     —   see IT System.


System Environment           —   the unique technical and operating characteristics of an IT system
and its associated envirormient, including the hardware, software, firmware, communications
capability, organization, and physical location.


System Interconnection           —   the requirements for communication or interconnection by an IT
system with one or more other IT systems or networks, to share processing capability or pass data
and information in support of multi-organizational or public programs.


Technical Controls          — hardware and software     controls used to provide automated protection
to the FT system or applications. Technical controls operate within the technical system and
applications.


Threat     — an   activity, deliberate or unintentional, with the potential for causing harm to an
automated information system or activity.
