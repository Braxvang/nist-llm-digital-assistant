2.1.3    Web Portals

A Web portal provides a human readable interface to the functionality provided by a Web service. Web
portals are essential because many Web services are designed to be initiated on behalf of a user. 9 Figure
2-3 shows how messages pass between the user and the portal. When the user indicates that a particular
action should be performed, the portal sends a SOAP request to the appropriate Web service, receives a
SOAP response with the result of the action, and displays an appropriate response to the user. Web
portals can provide access to more data sources than Web services alone, but almost all data sources can
be implemented as Web services.

                                          Figure 2-3. Example Portal Interface

In the bank loan example, shown in Figure 2-3, a user accesses a Web portal that gives the user the option
of taking out a new loan. The user initiates the loan request, causing the Web portal to send a SOAP
request to the loan service. Once the loan service completes its calculations, a SOAP response is sent
back to the Web portal. The Web portal processes the SOAP response and generates an associated
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) page for the user.

2.1.4    Web Service Roles, Modes, and Properties

The following sections summarize the overarching roles of the constituent components of a Web service-
based SOA: requester, provider, and intermediary. These roles are not exclusive: a single Web service
may be designed to act as a requester, provider, and intermediary depending on the context of the Web
service transaction.

2.1.4.1 Requester Web Services

The requester initiates a Web service transaction on its own or on behalf of a user via a portal. The
requester service is tasked with ensuring messages are in the proper syntax and taking the security
measures required by the provider.

In the loan Web service example, when a user accesses the bankâ€™s Web site and makes a request for a
loan, the loan service acts as a requester service and sends requests to the rate service and credit service.

    Other Web services may be initiated as part of a business-to-business (B2B) transaction or an application action.
