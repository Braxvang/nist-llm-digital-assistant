evidence to support measures development and data collection. 8 Implementation evidence
points to aspects of security controls that would be indicative of the information security
performance objective being met, or at least that actions leading to the accomplishment of the
performance objective in the future are performed. The information system security
requirements, processes, and procedures that have been implemented can be extracted by
consulting multiple sources, including documents, interviews, and observation.

The following sources may contain information from which measures data can be generated:

       •    System Security Plans; 9
       •    Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) reports;
       •    Latest GAO and IG findings;
       •    Tracking of information security-related activities, such as incident handling and
            reporting, testing, network management, audit logs, and network and information system
            billing;
       •    Risk assessments and penetration testing results;
       •    C&A documentation (e.g., security assessment reports);
       •    Continuous monitoring results;
       •    Contingency plans;
       •    Configuration management plans; and
       •    Training results and statistics.

As information system security practices evolve and the documents that describe them change,
existing measures will be retired and new measures will be developed. To ensure that the newly
developed measures are appropriate, these and similar documents will need to be examined to
identify new areas that should be captured in measures.

5.5         Measures Development and Selection

Phases 5, 6, and 7 of the measures development process, depicted in Figure 5-1, involve
developing measures that track process implementation, efficiency/effectiveness, and mission
impact. The performance measures development process presented in this section describes how
to develop measures in these three areas for information security. (Appendix A provides
candidate measures, some of which correspond to selected security control families in NIST SP
800-53.) To support continuous improvement of security for information systems and programs,
the process explicitly connects information security activities to the organization’s strategic goals

    Implementation evidence refers to the data collected to support an information security performance measure. Implementation
       evidence is discussed in greater detail in Table 2 contained in Section 5.6.
