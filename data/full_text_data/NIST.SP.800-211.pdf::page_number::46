     FOCUS AREA 9



     and hardware testing for reliability, safety, and security.10 NIST’s focus is on empirical
     test results and their impact on real-world problems. In FY 2019, NIST was able to
     advance such testing by developing and demonstrating methods for generating very
     large (> 2000 variables) test arrays. This tool is being applied by industry to evaluate
     the quality of their test suites for commercial products. NIST also conducted a joint
     project with Idaho National Labs and Virginia Commonwealth University to demonstrate
     combinatorial methods for software assurance in reactor safety systems as well as
     a similar project with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to
     demonstrate combinatorial coverage measurement for spacecraft software assurance.


     National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
     How does a system administrator know if some of the hardware or software in their
     systems contain vulnerabilities? Chances are that they utilize information that is freely
     available from the NVD. The NVD is a comprehensive cybersecurity vulnerability
     database that tracks vulnerability discovery trends over time, enabling users to
     assess changes in vulnerability discovery rates within specific products or types of
     vulnerabilities. The NVD includes databases of security configuration checklists for the
     National Checklist Program (NCP), which is comprised of listings of publicly known
     software flaws, product names, and impact metrics.
     NVD data is represented using the Secure Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)
     specifications. The use of SCAP data by the commercial security products deployed in
     thousands of organizations worldwide has extended NVD’s effective reach.
     The graphic below demonstrates the significant impact of the NVD and why it is a
     critical element of NIST’s advancement of information security testing, measurement
     science, and conformance. NIST staff have worked diligently to significantly increase the
     information available from the NVD repositories, expand the automated mechanisms
     to access that information, and provide timely evaluations of new and evolving
     vulnerability data. The numbers reflected in this chart illustrate these improvements,
     such as an increase of 556% of modified Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE)
     analysis compared to 2018, 160% increase in the listed Common Platform Enumeration
     (CPE) platforms, and considerable reduction of the historical backlog of CVEs waiting to
     be processed.
