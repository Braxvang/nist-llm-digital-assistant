NIST has made significant progress during FY 2019 in advancing methods and guidelines
for managing organizational risk related to cybersecurity, systems engineering, and
privacy. While risk management has been a fundamental driver for organizations for as
long as there has been information to protect, advances in technology increasingly call for
a collaborative approach to engineering secure systems, securing systems managed by
external partners, and applying risk management to an ever-evolving range of products.
Notable achievements during FY 2019 included updates to several NIST endeavors that
are described below.


The Next-Generation Risk Management Framework
The Risk Management Framework (RMF) is one of NISTâ€™s most highly used products.
Initially created for federal agencies, organizations around the globe use the RMF
because it provides a structured and flexible process for managing security and privacy
risk. The RMF includes processes for information security categorization; control
selection, implementation, and assessment; system and common control authorizations;
and continuous monitoring. It also includes activities to prepare organizations to execute
the RMF at appropriate risk management levels.
In FY 2019, NIST published SP 800-37, Revision 2, Risk Management Framework for
Information Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security
and Privacy [2]. SP 800-37, Rev. 2, represents the next-generation Risk Management
Framework (RMF) for systems, organizations, and individuals. The updates include an                        5
