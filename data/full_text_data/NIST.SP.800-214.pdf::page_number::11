In FY 2020, NIST issued a request for public comments on NIST SP 800-55, Revision 1,
Performance Measurement Guide for Information Security. NIST also created a website to
aggregate guidelines, tools, research, and resources for improving the quality and utility of
information to support decision making.
Cyber Risk Analytics
This project promotes technical solutions that enable organizations to bridge new and existing
data sets to advance cyber risk analysis and enhance the ability to report trends. The goal is
to facilitate information sharing among risk owners about historical, current, and future cyber
risk conditions. NIST is leveraging past and present efforts such as using a data repository
for cyber incident analysis, predictive analytics and strategic analysis on threat coverage, and
prioritization and gap identification. In FY 2020, research involved developing a proof-of-concept
sandbox for a trusted and secure repository in which enterprise risk owners can anonymously
share, store, aggregate, and analyze cyber incident data. As such, initial efforts explore the
enabling of capabilities such as anonymization, provenance, data enrichment, and data quality.
NIST will continue to explore data analytics to improve the understanding of cybersecurity risks
and inform management practices.
Additional software assurance projects included:
• Software Assurance Metrics and Tool Evaluation (SAMATE) improves software assurance
  by developing methods to enable software tool evaluation, measure the effectiveness of
  tools and techniques, and identify gaps in tools and methods.
• The Bugs Framework (BF) provides precise definitions of software bugs and language-
  independent taxonomies for describing software vulnerabilities. In FY 2020, BF published
  models and definitions.
• Software Assurance Reference Dataset (SARD) is a large collection of programs that
  contain known software flaws. In FY 2020, NIST enhanced SARD with a large collection of
  test cases contributed by the National Security Agency's Center for Assured Software.
• Static Analysis Tool Exposition (SATE) advances research in static analysis tools to find
  security-relevant source code weaknesses. NIST provides reference test cases to software
  assessment product vendors, and those vendors return the results of their products’ analyses
  to NIST to help better understand how to identify and report software weaknesses.
Automated Combinatorial Testing
Automated Combinatorial Testing (ACT) research focused on the application of
combinatorial methods for assurance of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)
systems. ACT developed a new method and tool for analyzing and explaining the decisions of
AI/ML algorithms, presented this research to U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army researchers, and
collaborated with Virginia Tech on autonomous systems assurance.
