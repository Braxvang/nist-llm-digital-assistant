1199   3.4.3. Configuration Change Control
1200           REQUIREMENT: 03.04.03

1201           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
1202           Determine if:
1203           A.03.04.03.a: the types of changes to the system that are configuration-controlled are defined.
1204           A.03.04.03.b[01]: proposed configuration-controlled changes to the system are reviewed.
1205           A.03.04.03.b[02]: proposed configuration-controlled changes to the system are approved or
1206           disapproved with explicit consideration for security impacts.
1207           A.03.04.03.c[01]: approved configuration-controlled changes to the system are implemented.
1208           A.03.04.03.c[02]: approved configuration-controlled changes to the system are documented.
1209           A.03.04.03.d[01]: activities associated with configuration-controlled changes to the system are
1210           monitored.
1211           A.03.04.03.d[02]: activities associated with configuration-controlled changes to the system are
1212           reviewed.

1214           Examine
1215           [SELECT FROM: configuration management policy and procedures; procedures for system
1216           configuration change control; configuration management plan; system architecture; configuration
1217           settings; change control records; system audit records; change control audit and review reports;
1218           agenda, minutes, and documentation from configuration change control oversight meetings;
1219           system security plan; other relevant documents or records]
1220           Interview
1221           [SELECT FROM: personnel with configuration change control responsibilities; personnel with
1222           information security responsibilities; members of change control board or similar; system
1223           administrators]
1224           Test
1225           [SELECT FROM: processes for configuration change control; mechanisms that implement
1226           configuration change control]
