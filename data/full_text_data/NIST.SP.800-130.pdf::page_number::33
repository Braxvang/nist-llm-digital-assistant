metadata. That is to say, entity B in no way distinguishes the protections provided to the
received key and/or metadata from those provided to its own keys and/or metadata.
Before entity A sends the key and/or metadata, it must have assurance that the protection
requirements in domain B’s security policy are at least as good as those in domain A’s
security policy. Also, entity B would desire assurance that the protection requirements in
domain A’s security policy are at least as good as those in domain B’s security policy. In
essence, the two domains must have equivalent domain security policies

The protection assurances required for data sent from entity A to entity B are shown in
Figure 8.

FR:4.16 The CKMS design shall specify the source and destination authentication
policies that it enforces when sharing a key and/or metadata with entities in differing
security domains.

FR:4.17 The CKMS design shall specify the confidentiality and integrity policies that it
enforces when sharing a key and/or metadata with entities in differing security domains.

FR:4.18 The CKMS design shall specify what assurances it requires when
communicating with entities from other security domains.
