SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



If different keys are used; one set for the internal view and another set for external zones, the zone
administrator needs to keep operations separate to prevent using the wrong set for a zone. If this happens,
it will appear as if there was an incorrect key rollover, which will result in validation failures.

11.7.5 Considerations for Mobile End Users

The main issues with split horizon DNS deployments come from mobile users moving from the internal
LAN to an external network and vice-versa. If the mobile host always relies on an internal recursive
server for resolution and validation (via a Virtual Private Network tunnel or some other method), then
there is not much that a mobile client needs to be concerned about. The user just needs to be sure that
there is a secure connection back to the internal network and an internal recursive server that can accept
queries.

It is recommended that mobile hosts have a means to securely access internal hosts via the ability to use
an internal recursive DNS server. The client (or administrators) may wish to configure the mobile client
to send all DNS queries back through the local internal recursive server if there is any question as to the
security of the remote network the mobile system is currently using.

If the client does its own validation (i.e., does not rely on validation being done at the recursive caching
server), then it needs to be configured with any internal and external keys as trust anchors. This adds
complexity to the DNS management of the end system and may require the end system to change
configuration when moving across network boundaries.

It is recommend that a mobile host that does its own validation have the internal DNSSEC key configured
as a trust anchor along with any other trust anchors. This would allow the mobile host to perform its own
validation even when the local network may not be fully trustworthy. However, when traveling across
network boundaries, the mobile client must be able to reconfigure its validator to not use the internal zone
key as a trust anchor when not on the internal network.

11.8 Recommendations Summary

The following items provide a summary of the major recommendations from this section:

    •   Checklist item 30: The (often longer) KSK needs to be rolled over less frequently than the ZSK.
        The recommended rollover frequency for the KSK is once every 1 to 2 years, whereas the ZSK
        should be rolled over every 1 to 3 months for operational consistency but may be used longer if
        necessary for stability or if the key is of the appropriate length. Both keys should have an
        Approved length according to NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 [800-57P1], [800-57P3].

    •   Zones that pre-publish the new public key should observe the following:

        –   Checklist item 31: The secure zone that pre-publishes its public key should do so at least one
            TTL period before the time of the key rollover.

        –   Checklist item 32: After removing the old public key, the zone should generate a new
            signature (RRSIG RR), based on the remaining keys (DNSKEY RRs) in the zone file.

    •   Checklist item 33: A DNS administrator should have the emergency contact information for the
        immediate parent zone to use when an emergency KSK rollover must be performed.
