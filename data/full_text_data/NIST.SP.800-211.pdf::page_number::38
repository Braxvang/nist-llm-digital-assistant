     FOCUS AREA 7



     During the workshop, NIST introduced some notional ideas of a high-level reference
     architecture, supporting components of 5G deployments, and a proposed preliminary
     approach for gathering existing cybersecurity guidance to develop practical practices
     that can be applied as potential NCCoE demonstration projects.


     National Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN)
     Federal statutes direct NIST to conduct research and development that support the
     acceleration and advancement of a nationwide broadband network that will help police,
     firefighters, emergency medical service professionals, and other public safety officials
     stay safe and do their jobs. Having a common and reliable National Public Safety
     Broadband Network (NPSBN) enables these officials to effectively communicate and
     conduct their missions. In FY 2019, NIST continued to research and advance methods
     and guidelines for this community, including:
       •   Publication of draft NISTIR 8196, Security Analysis of First Responder Mobile
           and Wearable Devices, which reviews the current and potential use cases of
           these mobile and wearable devices by ﬁrst responders and analyzes them from a
           cybersecurity perspective [25]. The goals of this analysis were to enable industry
           to design and produce more secure public safety devices and to assist jurisdictions
           in identifying security objectives and selecting secure devices.
       •   Collaboration with the NIST Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR)
           Division’s prize challenge. Contestants explored whether mobile Subscriber
           Identity Module (SIM) cards could be used as storage containers for public
           safety mobile application credentials. PSCR reached out to providers globally to
           participate in a competition aimed at improving public safety operations through
           innovative improvements to SIM card functionality. The goals of this research
           were to raise awareness of the need for convenient, standards-based, two-factor
           authentication for emergency responders while demonstrating an innovative
           approach to authentication that could lead to future innovations.
       •   NCCoE released a second draft of NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide SP 1800-13,
           Mobile Application Single Sign-On: Improving Authentication for Public Safety
           First Responders [26]. This revision of the guide was updated at the request of the
           public safety community to incorporate iOS version 12.

     Zero Trust Architecture
     Zero Trust is the term for an evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms that move
     network defenses from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and
     resources. A zero trust architecture (ZTA) uses zero trust principles to plan the enterprise
     infrastructure and workflows. Zero trust assumes that there is no implicit trust granted
     to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location (i.e., local
     area networks versus the internet). Authentication and authorization (both user and
30
     device) are discrete functions performed before a session with an enterprise resource
