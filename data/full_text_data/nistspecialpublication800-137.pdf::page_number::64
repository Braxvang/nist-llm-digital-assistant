The Open Checklist Interactive Language (OCIL), discussed in Section D.3.1, may be used to
partially automate certain controls that require human interaction and can be verified in a question
and answer type format. For example, it may be possible to create an automated questionnaire to
gather information related to annual security awareness training.

The validity of the security-related information collected continuously or on demand from
automated tools assumes the continued effectiveness of the underlying management and
operational security controls. As such, the value of automated tools and technologies, including
those that perform direct data gathering and aggregation and analysis of data, is dependent upon
the operational processes supporting their use. For organizations to realize the operational
security benefits and for the tools and technologies to provide an accurate security status,
knowledgeable staff should select, implement, operate, and maintain these tools and technologies,
as well as all underlying security controls, interpret the monitoring data obtained, and select and
implement appropriate remediation.

This appendix discusses the role of tools and technologies in automating many ISCM activities. It
discusses common tools, technologies, and open specifications used to collect, analyze, and
meaningfully represent data in support of continuous monitoring of an organization’s security
posture, including providing visibility into the information assets, awareness of threats and
vulnerabilities, and status of security control effectiveness. Examples of security controls that can
be automated using the various technologies are included. This is not an exhaustive set of
examples. New products and technologies continue to reach the market. Controls commonly
automated but that do not appear as examples associated with the technologies named below
include those where automation is achieved through capabilities built into operating systems,
custom tools and scripts, or a combination of several tools and capabilities. 45

D.1 TECHNOLOGIES FOR DATA GATHERING
Data gathering technologies are those that provide the capability to observe, detect, prevent, or
log known security threats and vulnerabilities, and/or remediate or manage various aspects of
security controls implemented to address those threats and vulnerabilities. These technologies are
primarily implemented at the information systems level (Tier 3). However, they can be
configured to support an organization’s ongoing security monitoring needs up through
mission/business processes and information security governance metrics. Implementing a tool
across an organization allows systems within that organization to inherit and leverage said
capability.

A security automation domain is an information security area that includes a grouping of tools,
technologies, and data. Data within the domains is captured, correlated, analyzed, and reported to
present the security status of the organization that is represented by the domains monitored.
Security automation provides standardized specifications that enable the interoperability and flow
of data between these domains. Monitoring capabilities are achieved through the use of a variety
of tools and techniques. The granularity of the information collected is determined by the
organization, based on its monitoring objectives and the capability of the enterprise architecture
to support such activities.

     Examples of such controls that lend themselves to full or partial automation through security engineering or the
     use of proprietary/third party software and log management tools include account management, security training
     records, incident reporting, and physical access control.
