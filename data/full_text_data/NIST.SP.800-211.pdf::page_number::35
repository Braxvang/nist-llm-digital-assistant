AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION
NIST works with industry to develop the measurement science and standards necessary
to ensure the robustness, scalability, and security of important infastructures, including
mobile telecommunications networks and the global internet. Research focuses on the
measurement and modeling techniques necessary to understand, predict, and control
the behavior of internet-scale networked information systems. The NIST staff uses these
insights to guide the design, analysis, and standardization of new technologies aimed at
improving the robustness and reliability of the global communications infrastructure.
Much of the research and industry collaboration occurs at NISTâ€™s National Cybersecurity
Center of Excellence (NCCoE). As shown in Figure 2 below and in the accomplishments
described in this focus area, the center represents the significant benefit of government-
industry partnership.
