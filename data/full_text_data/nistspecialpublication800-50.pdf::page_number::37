courses for a number of different audiences. The methodology in the NIST publication will be discussed
in this section. Other sources of training courses and material will also be identified and discussed.

4.2.1     A Model for Building Training Courses: NIST Special Pub. 800-16

The methodology in NIST Special Publication 800-16 provides a useful tool with which to develop IT
security training courses. This section provides background information on the purpose of the publication
and describes how to use the methodology to develop training courses.

Purpose and Methodology: Special Publication 800-16 represents the IT security training needs in the
current distributed computing environment, as opposed to the mainframe-oriented environment of the
mid- to late-1980s. The document identifies 26 roles that have some degree of responsibility for IT
security. Special Publication 800-16 provides flexibility in its methodology for extension of roles and
other parameters to accommodate future technologies and organizational roles. The methodology also
allows for training courses to be developed at the beginning, intermediate, and advanced levels of
training. Sample learning objectives are provided for each level to guide the course developer. Agencies
should consider using the publication to map needed training to new and existing roles that have
significant IT security responsibilities.

Using the Special Publication to Develop a Training Course: NIST Special Publication 800-16
includes a number of resources that a course developer can use to build a training course. The resources
are: the IT security learning continuum model, 26 roles and role-based matrices, 46 training matrix cells,
12 body of knowledge topics and concepts, 3 fundamental training content categories, and 6 functional
specialties.

Once an audience has been identified as needing IT security training, Appendix E of the NIST Special
Publication can be used to assist in course selection.20 Agencies can tailor this approach based on specific
positions used in their organizations. Appendix E contains 26 matrices, one for each of the 26 roles
identified in the publication. Figure 4-1 provides a sample matrix for a course for system administrators.

     Once training needs are identified, some agencies rely on curriculum builders – professional training development
     specialists – to develop the training material. Since training development specialists are usually not IT security
     professionals, the specialist will work closely with the IT security staff to ensure accuracy of the material as well as the
     proper level of complexity.
