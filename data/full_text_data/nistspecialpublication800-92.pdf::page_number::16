GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



This section notes any log sources that work in batch mode because this can have a significant impact on
the usefulness of their logs for incident response and other time-sensitive efforts.

2.1.1   Security Software

Most organizations use several types of network-based and host-based security software to detect
malicious activity, protect systems and data, and support incident response efforts. Accordingly, security
software is a major source of computer security log data. Common types of network-based and host-
based security software include the following:

     Antimalware Software. The most common form of antimalware software is antivirus software,
      which typically records all instances of detected malware, file and system disinfection attempts,
      and file quarantines. 3 Additionally, antivirus software might also record when malware scans
      were performed and when antivirus signature or software updates occurred. Antispyware
      software and other types of antimalware software (e.g., rootkit detectors) are also common
      sources of security information.
     Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention Systems. Intrusion detection and intrusion
      prevention systems record detailed information on suspicious behavior and detected attacks, as
      well as any actions intrusion prevention systems performed to stop malicious activity in progress.
      Some intrusion detection systems, such as file integrity checking software, run periodically
      instead of continuously, so they generate log entries in batches instead of on an ongoing basis.4
     Remote Access Software. Remote access is often granted and secured through virtual private
      networking (VPN). VPN systems typically log successful and failed login attempts, as well as
      the dates and times each user connected and disconnected, and the amount of data sent and
      received in each user session. VPN systems that support granular access control, such as many
      Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPNs, may log detailed information about the use of resources.
     Web Proxies. Web proxies are intermediate hosts through which Web sites are accessed. Web
      proxies make Web page requests on behalf of users, and they cache copies of retrieved Web
      pages to make additional accesses to those pages more efficient. Web proxies can also be used to
      restrict Web access and to add a layer of protection between Web clients and Web servers. Web
      proxies often keep a record of all URLs accessed through them.
     Vulnerability Management Software. Vulnerability management software, which includes
      patch management software and vulnerability assessment software, typically logs the patch
      installation history and vulnerability status of each host, which includes known vulnerabilities
      and missing software updates.5 Vulnerability management software may also record additional
      information about hostsâ€™ configurations. Vulnerability management software typically runs
      occasionally, not continuously, and is likely to generate large batches of log entries.
     Authentication Servers. Authentication servers, including directory servers and single sign-on
      servers, typically log each authentication attempt, including its origin, username, success or
      failure, and date and time.
