of legal defense information will have only a limited adverse effect on government operations,
government assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: For legal defense information, when
evidence or other defense information has been compromised the legal proceedings can be
jeopardized. As a consequence, the cost to the government and other entities in terms of finance,
time, and disruption to normal operations may be severe. If suspicion is raised concerning
government complicity or negligence, serious loss of public confidence in government agencies
or the legal process may result. In this case, the integrity impact level will be moderate.

When the modification or destruction of legal defense information endangers public safety (e.g.,
release of a terrorist or other murderer), the integrity impact will be high. Even if public safety
is not endangered, the modification or destruction of legal defense information may result in
expensive and disruptive civil or criminal proceedings.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: Given the legal consequences of unauthorized modification
or destruction and potential consequences for human life, the provisional integrity impact level
recommended for legal defense information is high.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to legal defense information. Most legal
defense processes are tolerant of delay. Delays can impact court schedules, cause significant
taxpayer expense, and potentially jeopardize legal proceedings (see C17.2.2). In most cases,
disruption of access to legal defense information can be expected to have only a limited adverse
effect on government operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: In exceptional cases (e.g., information
affecting a ruling regarding an impending execution), loss of availability of information can have
a severe adverse effect. The consequent availability impact level would be high.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: The provisional availability impact
level recommended for legal defense information is low.

D.17.3 Legal Investigation Information Type

Legal investigation supports activities associated with gathering information about a given party
(government agency, citizen, corporation) that would be admissible in a court of law, in an
attempt to prove guilt or innocence. The recommended provisional categorization of the legal
investigation information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of legal investigation
information on the ability of responsible agencies to gather information about a given party
