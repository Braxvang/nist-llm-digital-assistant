cybersecurity program. This is briefly summarized in Section 3.3.6 and further elaborated in
Section 4.
The OT cybersecurity program should also address policy exceptions and deviations. In a
demanding OT environment, situations may arise that require a temporary deviation from the
security policy in order to maintain the mission or goal of the OT system. Such deviations or
exceptions must be handled with great care and receive approval from management and the
cross-functional team. The security program can establish a policy and procedure for handling
these policy exceptions. All of these guidance documents recognize that one size does not fit all.
Rather, domain knowledge combined with site-specific constraints should be applied in adapting
this guidance to a specific organization.

3.3.1. Establish OT Cybersecurity Governance
OT governance should include the policies, procedures, and processes for managing the
organization’s regulatory, legal, risk, environmental, and operational requirements. The
governance should ensure that the policies, procedures, and processes are well understood by
staff and inform the management of OT cybersecurity risk. To establish an effective OT
cybersecurity governance capability, develop a process and assign responsibilities and
accountability to appropriate roles in the corporate risk management function. Typically, a
cybersecurity governance process should include the following:
   •   Ensure that the OT cybersecurity policy is established and communicated.
   •   Ensure that OT cybersecurity roles and responsibilities are coordinated and aligned with
       internal roles and external partners.
   •   Ensure that legal and regulatory requirements regarding OT cybersecurity, including
       privacy, are understood and managed.
   •   Ensure that cybersecurity risks are integrated into corporate risk management processes.
Further guidance for establishing OT cybersecurity guidance can be found in Section 6.
Additional information with specific examples for establishing a cybersecurity governance
capability are also provided in NIST Internal or Interagency Report (NIST IR) 8183A,
Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile Low Impact Level Example Implementations
Guide [IR8183A].

3.3.2. Build and Train a Cross-Functional Team to Implement the OT
       Cybersecurity Program
It is essential for a cross-functional cybersecurity team to share their varied domain knowledge
and experience to evaluate and manage risk in OT. The OT cybersecurity team should consist of
representatives from the following departments: IT staff, control engineer, control system
operator, security subject-matter expert, and enterprise risk management. For completeness, the
information security team should also include any cybersecurity service providers.
From a safety perspective, major accident hazards and the loss of containment due to equipment
failure or operator mistakes can have serious consequences. Cybersecurity is another threat to the
safety and reliability of industrial processes, so including safety experts as part of the
