                      of the salt.
          rv          The randomly generated part of the salt.
          S           The salt, represented as a binary string.
         sLen         The length of the salt in bits.
    T<0, 1, â€¦, r-1>   The truncation of the binary string T that retains its first r bits.


4       General Discussion

This Recommendation specifies a family of functions to derive cryptographic keying
material from a password or a passphrase. The derived keying material is called a Master
Key (MK), denoted as mk. The MK is used either 1) to generate one or more Data
Protection Keys (DPKs) to protect data, or 2) to generate an intermediate key to protect
one or more existing DPKs or generated from the MK using an approved Key Derivation
Function (KDF) as defined in [2]. The MK shall not be used for other purposes.


5       Password-Based Key Derivation Functions

A password or a passphrase is a string of characters that is usually chosen by a user.
Passwords are often used to authenticate a user in order to allow access to a resource.
Since most user-chosen passwords have low entropy and weak randomness properties, as
discussed in Appendix A.1, these passwords shall not be used directly as cryptographic
keys. However, in certain applications, such as protecting data in storage devices, the
password may be the only secret information that is available to the cryptographic
algorithm that protects the data. This section specifies a family of PBKDFs for such
applications.

KDFs are deterministic algorithms that are used to derive cryptographic keying material
from a secret value, such as a password. Each PBKDF in the family is defined by the
choice of a Pseudorandom Function (PRF) and a fixed iteration count, denoted as C. The
input to an execution of PBKDF includes a password, denoted as P, a salt, denoted as S,
and an indication of the desired length of the MK in bits, denoted as kLen. Symbolically:
