[RFC 4253, Sec. 7.2]. This key-derivation function has been approved in [SP 800-135].
Therefore, the Diffie-Hellman key exchange in [RFC 4253, Sec. 8], combined with the
key-derivation function in [RFC 4253, Sec. 7.2] is an approved key-agreement method
for SSH TLP.

10.2.2 UAP Issues
There are many authentication methods that the server can use to authenticate the client.
The required method that the server must support is public-key authentication, named
“publickey” in the UAP [RFC 4252, Sec. 7]. This requires the use of a digital-signature
algorithm as specified in Section 10.2.1.3 except the digital signatures using SHA-1.
SHA-1 digital signatures shall not be used for client authentication. See [RFC 4252, Sec.
7] for specific details on how client authentication using one of the digital-signature
algorithms is done. For Federal Government applications, the digital-signature algorithms
used for client authentication shall meet the requirements specified in [SP 800-131A].

In the “publickey” authentication method, proof-of-possession of the valid private-key is
considered to be a proof of the identity of the client. Therefore, sharing a private-key
among different clients (users) is prohibited. However, in current practice, many
organizations allow multiple clients (users) to share a private key. To address this issue
and other issues related to identity management, NIST recently published Draft NISTIR
7966, Security of Automated Access Management Using Secure Shell (SSH) [NISTIR
7966].

Beside the “publickey” method, two other authentication methods have been defined for
this protocol. The first method is using passwords. The second method is using the
private key of a host system that is trusted by the server in this SSH connection; the latter
method is called “host-based authentication”.
     For Federal Government use, authentication using passwords shall not be used if
        the TLP does not provide an encrypted tunnel, because the password would be
        sent as cleartext.
      For the “host-based authentication” method [RFC 4252, Sec. 9], the client is a
       user of the host system that is attempting to authenticate to the server. In this
       method, the client knows the private signature key of the host. The client uses this
       private key to generate a digital signature on behalf of this host during the
       authentication process with the server in the SSH connection. The server verifies
       the digital signature to authenticate the host system. If the authentication is
       successful, and the client (user) is an authorized user associated with this host,
       then this user (the client) is considered to be authenticated by the SSH server.
       This “host-based authentication” method should not be used for client
       authentication because the method does not provide direct, cryptographic
       assurance of the identity of the client to the server - the server must trust the host
       system to obtain the correct identity of the client.
Also, client authentication using Kerberos (see Section 6) is also described in [RFC
4462]. It is important to note that RFC 4462 specifies an authentication method called
“Authentication Using GSS-API Key Exchange” [RFC 4462, Sec. 4]. This authentication
