NIST SP 800-82r3                                         Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

       Respond (RS)
The Respond Function supports the ability to take the appropriate course of action and activities
to contain a cybersecurity incident when it occurs.

6.4.1. Response Planning (RS.RP)
When responding to events, organizations should attempt to capture the details associated with
executing the documented response plans. This may help organizations identify gaps or potential
opportunities for improvement in the response plan during the post-incident review process. Due
to the time sensitivity of response efforts, organizations may want to consider other techniques
(e.g., reviewing logs, reviewing video footage captured during the response activities, or
interviewing response personnel) if capturing execution details impacts safety or increases the
time to complete the response plan.

6.4.2. Response Communications (RS.CO)
Responding to a cybersecurity incident includes coordinating with internal and external
stakeholders. An incident response team should be assembled. Depending on the complexity and
impact of the incident, the incident response team could consist of one or many individuals who
have been trained on incident response. The FEMA National Incident Management System
(NIMS) can be used to standardize common terminology and roles for incident response.
Prior to an incident, organizations should consider how to communicate with response personnel
and external entities, including:
   •   Developing an email distribution list for incident response
   •   Leveraging an emergency notification system
   •   Establishing backup communication plans for radio, phone, or email if primary
       communication systems fail
   •   Designating a spokesperson for external communications
   •   Designating a scribe for internal incident communications
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should consider FEMA’s guidance on crisis
            communications when establishing their communication plans and
            strategies.
            The personnel responsible for responding to an incident should be
            informed of and trained on their responsibilities.
            The response plan should include a detailed list of organizations and
            personnel that should be contacted for incident response and reporting
            under various circumstances. Each individual should be assigned roles
            that are required for incident response, which could include incident
            commander; operations, planning, logistics, or finance/administration
