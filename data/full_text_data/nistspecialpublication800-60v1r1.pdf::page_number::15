The security categorization process documented in this publication provides input into the
following processes:
   •   Step 2: Select an initial set of security controls for the information system based on the
       FIPS 199 security categorization and apply tailoring guidance as appropriate, to obtain a
       starting point for required controls as specified in FIPS 200, Minimum Security
       Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems and NIST SP 800-53,
       Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems. Utilizing NIST SP
       800-53 and SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems,
       supplement the initial set of tailored security controls based on an assessment of risk and
       local conditions including organization-specific security requirements, specific threat
       information, cost-benefit analyses, or special circumstances.
   •   Step 3: Implement the security controls in the information system.
   •   Step 4: Assess the security controls using appropriate methods and procedures to
       determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as
       intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security
       requirements for the system. (Reference NIST SP 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the
       Security Controls in Federal Information Systems).
