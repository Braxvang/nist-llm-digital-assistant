use of new types of PIV authenticators (i.e., derived PIV credentials) via federation. The revision
also aims to facilitate the issuance of PIV cards by enabling remote identity proofing. These
changes closely align with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Policy Memorandum
M-19-17, Enabling Mission Delivery through Improved Identity, Credential, and Access. For FY
2022, the PIV team will actively work on Special Publications associated with FIPS 201 to further
specify the standard’s technical details while continuing outreach to federal stakeholders.
Digital Identity Guidelines
The four-volume set of Digital Identity Guidelines (NIST SP 800-63-3) was published in June
2017. Following three years of federal agency experience implementing the controls and
requirements and recognizing the need to stay ahead of online identity attacks, ITL revised
and updated all volumes of SP 800-63-3 in June 2020.
In June 2020, NIST also published the pre-draft Request for Comments for the anticipated
revision of SP 800-63-3. The Request for Comments identified topics for potential updates,
and more than 40 federal agencies and industry organizations responded with over 300
comments to the request. ITL subsequently published a public roadmap for key activities,
milestones, and target dates for the development of SP 800-63 Revision 4, and published all
comments received by the comment closing date. As indicated in the roadmap, ITL completed
the adjudication of comments received in the first and second quarters of FY 2021. ITL posted
six SP 800-63, Revision 4 topic items for additional discussion in February 2021 to present
revisions for consideration. The discussion items encouraged federal agency and industry
feedback and discussion on the prospective revisions. The open discussion period ended in
May 2021. ITL anticipates publication of draft SP 800-63, Revision 4 in the third fiscal quarter
of 2022.
With the publication of the third set of conformance criteria for Federation and Assertions (SP
800-63C), following on the release of conformance criteria for volumes SP 800-63A and SP
800-63B in June 2020, the full set of conformance criteria for all volumes of SP 800-63-3 has
been completed. The conformance criteria present all normative requirements and controls
for the SP 800-63A, B, and C and provide supplemental guidance, control objectives, and
recommended test and conformance assessment methods for all of the normative requirements
and controls at the designated assurance levels. The conformance criteria are used by federal
agencies, independent assessment and certification bodies, auditors, and implementers so
that all of the normative requirements and controls for SP 800-63-3 are understood for proper
implementation, conformance assessment, and audit.
Mobile Driver’s License
NIST contributed to the development of an international standard for mobile drivers licenses
(mDL). The mDL is a secure digital representation of DL data that is provisioned onto a smart
mobile device, such as a smart phone or tablet, for use by the proper, intended mDL Holder.
It can also contain information relevant to additional state privileges or national context. The
standard was developed in coordination with other countries and with the cooperation of identity
management experts from around the world. The standard provides a specification for an
interoperable interface between the reader device and mDL. As is currently the practice with
the physical license document, an mDL can now be presented to a human or digital verification
authority in exactly the same way using a mobile device. The standard defines what is known
as “mdoc” (mobile documents) technology. The standard is not limited to drivers licenses and
is a launching pad for other identity documents/cards, such as passports, travel documents,
birth certificates, voting registration/cards, vaccination cards, and organization identity cards.
