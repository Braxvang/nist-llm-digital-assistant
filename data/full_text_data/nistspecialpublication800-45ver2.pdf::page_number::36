GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



4.2.3    Information Systems Security Officers

Information Systems Security Officers (ISSO) are responsible for overseeing all aspects of information
security within a specific organizational entity. They ensure that the organization’s information security
practices comply with organizational and departmental policies, standards, and procedures. ISSOs are
responsible for the following activities associated with mail servers:

 Developing internal security standards and procedures for the mail server(s) and supporting network
  infrastructure
 Cooperating in the development and implementation of security tools, mechanisms, and mitigation
  techniques
 Maintaining standard configuration profiles of the mail servers and supporting network infrastructure
  controlled by the organization, including but not limited to operating systems, firewalls, routers, and
  mail server applications
 Maintaining operational integrity of systems by conducting security tests and ensuring that designated
  IT professionals are conducting scheduled testing on critical systems.
4.2.4    Mail Server and Network Administrators

Mail server administrators are system architects responsible for the overall design, implementation, and
maintenance of a mail server. Network administrators are responsible for the overall design,
implementation, and maintenance of a network. On a daily basis, mail server and network administrators
contend with the security requirements of the specific system(s) for which they are responsible. Security
issues and solutions can originate from either outside (e.g., security patches and fixes from the
manufacturer or computer security incident response teams) or within the organization (e.g., the security
office). The administrators are responsible for the following activities associated with mail servers:

 Installing and configuring hosts in compliance with the organizational security policies and standard
  system/network configurations
 Maintaining hosts in a secure manner, including frequent backups and timely application of patches
 Monitoring system integrity, protection levels, and security-related events
 Following up on detected security anomalies associated with their information system resources
 Conducting security tests as required.
4.3     Management Practices

Appropriate management practices are critical to operating and maintaining a secure mail server.
Security practices entail the identification of an organization’s information system assets and the
development, documentation, and implementation of policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines that
ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information system resources.

To ensure the security of a mail server and the supporting network infrastructure, organizations should
implement the following practices:

 Organizational Information System Security Policy—A security policy should specify the basic
  information system security tenets and rules and their intended internal purpose. The policy should
  also outline who in the organization is responsible for particular areas of information security (e.g.,

                                                    4-4
