of compensating security controls must be reviewed, documented in the system security
plan, and approved by the authorizing official for the information system.

2.5.3 Common Security Controls
An agency-wide view of the information security program facilitates the identification of
common security controls that can be applied to one or more agency information systems.
Common security controls can apply to: (i) all agency information systems; (ii) a group
of information systems at a specific site (sometimes associated with the terms site
certification/accreditation); or (iii) common information systems, subsystems, or
applications (i.e., common hardware, software, and/or firmware) deployed at multiple
operational sites (sometimes associated with the terms type certification/accreditation).
Common security controls, typically identified during a collaborative agency-wide
process with the involvement of the CIO, SAISO, authorizing officials, information
system owners, and information system security officers (and by developmental program
managers in the case of common security controls for common hardware, software,
and/or firmware), have the following properties:

   •   The development, implementation, and assessment of common security controls
       can be assigned to responsible agency officials or organizational elements (other
       than the information system owners whose systems will implement or use those
       common security controls); and

   •   The results from the assessment of the common security controls can be used to
       support the security certification and accreditation processes of agency
       information systems where those controls have been applied.

Many of the management and operational controls (e.g., contingency planning controls,
incident response controls, security awareness and training controls, personnel security
controls, and physical security controls) needed to protect an information system may be
excellent candidates for common security control status. The objective is to reduce
security costs by centrally managing the development, implementation, and assessment of
the common security controls designated by the agency—and subsequently, sharing
assessment results with the owners of information systems where those common security
controls are applied. Security controls not designated as common controls are considered
system-specific controls and are the responsibility of the information system owner.
System security plans should clearly identify which security controls have been
designated as common security controls and which controls have been designated as
system-specific controls.

For efficiency in developing system security plans, common security controls should be
documented once and then inserted or imported into each system security plan for the
information systems within the agency. The individual responsible for implementing the
common control should be listed in the security plan. Effectively maximizing the
application of common controls in the system security planning process depends upon the
following factors:
