GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



A.2.2     Examination and Analysis

    ! Analysts should use a methodical approach to studying the data. The foundation of forensics
      is using a methodical approach in analyzing the available data so that analysts can either draw
      appropriate conclusions based on the available data, or determine that no conclusion can yet be
      drawn. If evidence might be needed for legal or internal disciplinary actions, analysts should
      carefully document the findings and the steps that were taken.
    ! Analysts should examine copies of files, not the original files. During the collection phase, the
      analyst should make multiple copies of the desired files or filesystems, typically a master copy
      and a working copy. The analyst can then work with the working copy of the files without
      affecting the original files or the master copy. A bit stream image should be performed if
      evidence may be needed for prosecution or disciplinary actions, or if preserving file times is
      important.
    ! Analysts should consider the fidelity and value of each data source. Analysts should have
      more confidence in original data sources than in data sources that receive normalized data from
      other sources. Analysts should validate any unusual or unexpected data that is based on
      interpreting data, such as IDS and SEM alerts.
    ! Analysts should rely on file headers, not file extensions, to identify file content types.
      Because users can assign any file extension to a file, analysts should not assume that file
      extensions are accurate. Analysts can identify the type of data stored in many files by examining
      their file headers. Although people can alter file headers to conceal actual file types, this is much
      less common than altering file extensions.
    ! Analysts should generally focus on the characteristics and impact of the event. Determining
      the identity of an attacker and other similar actions are typically time-intensive and difficult to
      accomplish, and do not aid the organization in correcting operational issues or security
      weaknesses. Establishing the identity and intent of an attacker may be important, especially if a
      criminal investigation will ensue, but it should be weighed against other important goals.
    ! Organizations should be aware of the technical and logistical complexity of analysis. A
      single event can generate records on many different data sources and produce more information
      than analysts can feasibly review. Tools such as SEM can assist analysts by bringing information
      from many data sources together in a single place.
    ! Analysts should bring together data from various sources. The analyst should review the
      results of the examination and analysis of individual data sources, such as data files, OSs, and
      network traffic, and determine how the information fits together, to perform a detailed analysis of
      application-related events and event reconstruction.
A.2.3     Reporting

    ! Analysts should review their processes and practices. Reviews of current and recent forensic
      actions can help identify policy shortcomings, procedural errors, and other issues that might need
      to be remedied, as well as ensuring that the organization stays current with trends in technology
      and changes in law.
