GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



them. One solution is to encrypt the data separately and then paste it into the browser for transmission
(this is easily done with OpenPGP).

Enabling Web-based access often requires a weakening in the overall security posture of the mail server.
Organizations must be aware of the risks and carefully consider whether to implement Web-based access
to their mail server (see Section 6.6).

A serious risk with Web-based mail systems is access from public computers (e.g., college computing lab,
Internet café, public library). In these situations, the browser may be configured to store and recall
usernames and passwords automatically. If it is configured this way, an unauthorized person may use
these credentials to obtain access to the organization’s mail server. Another danger is that a public
computer may have a keystroke logger that registers and saves all keystrokes entered by the mail user,
including username and password. Again, this data could be used to access and compromise the
organization’s mail server. Web browsers also temporarily cache a user’s credentials for a fixed period
after the user logs in. If the user fails to empty the browser cache and close the browser after completing
access to the mail server, it is possible for an unauthorized person to employ the cached credentials to
access the organization’s mail server. The use of SSL/TLS does not generally protect against these
dangers. Web browsers also cache downloaded files and create temporary files that may contain email
messages, email attachments, and other information from Web-based mail access. If the Web browser
does not clean the cache and temporary files after the session ends, other users of the computer could
potentially access these files.

The security of Web-based mail is based in large part on the expertise of users. For example, some Web-
based mail applications ask users if they are using public or private computers; users should select the
public option to further protect their email information. Thus, users should be made aware of what they
should do before being granted access to Web-based mail. Organizations should also consider creating a
“Rules of Behavior” agreement that each user signs, in which he or she acknowledges responsibility and
accountability for the appropriate use of Web-based mail.
