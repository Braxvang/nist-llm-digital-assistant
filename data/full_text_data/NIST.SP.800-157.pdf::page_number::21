Appendix A—Digital Signature and Key Management Keys (Informative)

In addition to the PIV Authentication key, [FIPS201] also requires each PIV Card to have a digital
signature key and a key management key, unless the cardholder does not have a government-issued email
account at the time of credential issuance. A Subscriber who has been issued a Derived PIV
Authentication certificate for use with a mobile device may also have a need to use a digital signature and
key management key with that mobile device.

For most Subscribers, it will be necessary for the key management private key and certificate on the
mobile device to be the same key as the one on the PIV Card. Similarly it will be necessary for copies of
all of the retired key management private keys and certificates on the PIV Card to be on the mobile device
as well. Neither [FIPS201] nor [COMMON] precludes a key management private key from being used on
more than one device (e.g., the PIV Card and a smart phone) as long as all of the requirements of the
policy under which the key management certificate was issued are satisfied. Note that this means that in
order to be able to use a copy of a key management private key in a [FIPS140] Level 1 software
cryptographic module, the corresponding certificate would have to be issued under a certificate policy,
such as id-fpki-common-policy, that does not require the use of a [FIPS140] Level 2 hardware
cryptographic module. This should be taken into account at the time that the key management certificate
that will be placed on the PIV Card is issued. Key recovery mechanisms are encouraged for key
management keys issued to mobile devices.

As the digital signature key on a PIV Card cannot be copied, a mobile device will have to be issued a new
digital signature private key and certificate. The issuance of this private key and certificate is completely
independent of the issuance of the PIV Card, although the issuer may choose to leverage the Applicant’s
PIV Card to identity proof the Applicant prior to issuing the digital signature certificate. As the certificate
policies associated with digital signature certificates in [COMMON] (id-fpki-common-policy, id-fpki-
common-hardware, and id-fpki-common-High) are not limited to use with PIV Cards, a digital signature
certificate for a mobile device may be issued under one of these policies, as long as all of the
requirements of the policy are satisfied.
