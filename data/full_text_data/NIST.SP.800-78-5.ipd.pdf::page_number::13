      NIST SP 800-78-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                                                    Cryptographic Algorithms
      September 2023                                                                                                    and Key Sizes for PIV

284        On-Card Cryptographic Requirements
285   FIPS 201-3 identifies a suite of objects that are stored on the PIV Card for use in authentication
286   mechanisms or other security protocols. These objects may be divided into three classes:
287   cryptographic keys, signed authentication information stored on the PIV Card, and message
288   digests of information stored on the PIV Card. Cryptographic requirements for PIV keys are
289   detailed in Section 3.1. Cryptographic requirements for other stored objects are detailed in
290   Section 3.2.

291              PIV Cryptographic Keys
292   FIPS 201-3 and NIST SP 800-73 specify six different classes of cryptographic keys to be used as
293   credentials by the PIV cardholder:
294        •     The mandatory PIV Authentication key,
295        •     The mandatory asymmetric Card Authentication key,
296        •     An optional symmetric Card Authentication key (deprecated),
297        •     A conditionally mandatory digital signature key,
298        •     A conditionally mandatory key management key, 1 and
299        •     An optional asymmetric key to establish session keys for secure messaging and to
300              authenticate the cardholder using the SM-AUTH authentication mechanism.
301   All cryptographic algorithms employed shall provide at least 112 bits of security strength.
302   Cryptographic keys that will remain in use after 2030 should provide 128 bits of security
303   strength 2. Federal departments and agencies should consider potential cryptographic key length
304   migrations as part of their moderate-to-long term cryptographic transition and modernization
305   plans, including the need to plan and invest for a future migration to post-quantum algorithms.
306   Capital investments for PIV issuance and relying party systems should be selected with an
307   emphasis on ensuring a timely migration to post-quantum algorithms once standards,
308   technologies, and services are available. If a migration to longer cryptographic keys would
309   require significant resources or infrastructure upgrades, federal departments and agencies may
310   elect to defer these improvements until the post-quantum migration. Post-quantum algorithms
311   will be specified in a future revision of this document once foundational standards supporting
312   their use have been adopted.
313    Table 1 establishes specific requirements for cryptographic algorithms and key sizes for each
314   key type.

      issuance.
