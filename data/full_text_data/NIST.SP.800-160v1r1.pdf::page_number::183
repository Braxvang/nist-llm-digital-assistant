NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                              Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems

J.2.2. Security Outcomes
-      Protection needs for the infrastructure are defined.
-      Security capabilities and constraints of infrastructure elements are specified.
-      Infrastructure elements that satisfy infrastructure security specifications are obtained.
-      Secure infrastructure is available.
-      Prioritized infrastructure security-relevant improvements are implemented.

J.2.3. Security Activities and Tasks
IF-1      ESTABLISH THE INFRASTRUCTURE
          IF-1.1 Define the infrastructure security protection needs.
          Note: The security aspects of infrastructure resource needs are considered in context with other
          projects and resources within the organization. Security constraints that influence and control
          the provision of infrastructure resources and services for the project are also defined.
          IF-1.2 Identify, obtain, and provide the infrastructure resources and services that satisfy the
                 security protection needs to securely implement and support projects.

IF-2      MAINTAIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE
          IF-2.1 Evaluate the degree to which delivered infrastructure resources satisfy project
                 protection needs.
          IF-2.2 Identify and provide security improvements or changes to infrastructure resources as
                 project requirements change.
          Note: Any mismatch between project security needs and the security provided by infrastructure
          resources may result in gaps in assurance.
