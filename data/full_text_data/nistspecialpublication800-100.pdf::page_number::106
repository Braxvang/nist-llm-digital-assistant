Chapter 11                       Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments


    By accrediting an information system, an agency official accepts the risks
associated with operating the system and the associated implications on agency
operations, agency assets, or agency individuals. Completing a security accreditation
ensures that an information system will be operated with appropriate management
review, that there is ongoing monitoring of security controls, and that
reaccredidation occurs periodically in accordance with federal or agency policy and
whenever there is a significant change to the system or its operational environment.
    In May, 2004, the Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) published National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-37, Guide
for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems. It
provides specific recommendations on how to certify and accredit information
systems, and it is applicable to all federal information systems other than those
systems designated as national security systems as defined in 44 United States Code
(U.S.C.), Section 3542. 11. State, local, and tribal governments, as well as private
sector organizations, are encouraged to use the guidelines, as appropriate. The goals
of the guidelines are as follows:
       • Enable more consistent, comparable, and repeatable assessments of security
         controls in federal information systems;
       • Promote a better understanding of agency-related mission risks resulting from
         the operation of information systems; and
       • Create more complete, reliable, and trustworthy information for authorizing
         officials to facilitate more informed security accreditation decisions.
   NIST SP 800-37 provides augmented, updated security certification and
accreditation information to federal agencies and replaced Federal Information
Processing Standard (FIPS) 102, Guidelines for Computer Security Certification and
Accreditation, September 1983, when it was rescinded in February 2005.

11.1 Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments Roles and
     Responsibilities
    While federal agencies have in place widely varied naming
conventions/nomenclatures for IT security or security certification and accreditation
roles, most basic functions in security certification and accreditation process are
essentially the same throughout all agencies. 71 The security certification and
accreditation process described in this Special Publication is flexible, allowing each
agency to accomplish the intent of the specific tasks within their respective
organization.

11.1.1 Chief Information Officer
    The chief information officer (CIO) works closely with authorizing officials and
their designated representatives to ensure that an agency-wide security program is
implemented effectively, including all aspects of the security certification and
accreditation program component. The CIO has the following responsibilities in
relation to security certification and accreditation:
       • Promulgate cost-effective practices such as encouraging maximum reuse and
         sharing of security-related information to include:
