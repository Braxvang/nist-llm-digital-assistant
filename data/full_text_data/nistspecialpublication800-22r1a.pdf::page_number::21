A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



χ2                The [theoretical] chi-square distribution; used as a test statistic; also, a test statistic
                  that follows the χ2 distribution.
χ2(obs)           The chi-square statistic computed on the observed values. See Sections 2.2, 2.4, 2.5,
                  2.7, 2.8, 2.10, 2.12, 2.14, and the corresponding sections of Section 3.
Vn                The expected number of runs that would occur in a sequence of length n under an
                  assumption of randomness See Sections 2.3 and 3.3.
Vn(obs)           The observed number of runs in a sequence of length n. See Sections 2.3 and 3.3.
