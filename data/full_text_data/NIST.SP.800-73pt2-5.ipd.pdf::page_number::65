       NIST SP 800-73pt2-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                       Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 2
       September 2023                                                          PIV Card Application Card Command Interface

1409   Appendix C. Glossary
1410   application identifier
1411   A globally unique identifier of a card application. [ISO7816, Part 4, adapted]

1412   algorithm identifier
1413   A 1-byte identifier that specifies a cryptographic algorithm and key size. For symmetric cryptographic operations,
1414   the algorithm identifier also specifies a mode of operation (i.e., ECB).

1415   Authenticable entity
1416   An entity that can successfully participate in an authentication protocol with a card application.

1417   BER-TLV data object
1418   A data object coded according to ISO/IEC 8824-2:2021.

1419   Card
1420   An integrated circuit card.

1421   Card application
1422   A set of data objects and card commands that can be selected using an application identifier.

1423   Card management operation
1424   Any operation involving the PIV Card Application Administrator.

1425   Card Verifiable Certificate
1426   A certificate stored on the card that includes a public key, the signature of a certification authority, and the
1427   information needed to verify the certificate.

1428   Data object
1429   An item of information seen at the card command interface for which is specified a name, a description of logical
1430   content, a format, and a coding.

1431   Key reference
1432   A 1-byte identifier that specifies a cryptographic key according to its PIV Key Type. The identifier is part of
1433   cryptographic material used in a cryptographic protocol, such as an authentication or a signing protocol.

1434   MAC Chaining Value
1435   A 16-byte value that is an input to the CMAC function and used to detect communication errors in duplicate or
1436   missing commands.

1437   Object identifier
1438   A globally unique identifier of a data object. [ISO8824, adapted]

1439   reference data
1440   Cryptographic material used in the performance of a cryptographic protocol, such as an authentication or a signing
1441   protocol. The reference data length is the maximum length of a password or PIN. For algorithms, the reference data
1442   length is the length of a key.

1443   status word
1444   Two bytes returned by an integrated circuit card after processing any command that signify the success of or errors
1445   encountered during said processing.

1446   template
1447   A (constructed) BER-TLV data object whose value field contains specific BER-TLV data objects.
