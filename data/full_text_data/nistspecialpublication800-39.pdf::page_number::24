to require additional grounds for confidence in the effectiveness of selected safeguards and
countermeasures or prefer safeguards and countermeasures that are more mature and have a
proven track record. Such organizations may also decide to employ multiple safeguards and
countermeasures from multiple sources (e.g., antivirus software at clients and servers that are
provided by different vendors). Another example illustrating the impact of risk tolerance on risk
response is that risk tolerance can also affect the organizational requirements for trustworthiness
provided by specific information technologies. Two organizations may choose the same
information technologies, but their relative degree of risk tolerance may impact the degree of
assessment required prior to deployment.

There is no correct level of organizational risk tolerance. Rather, the degree of risk tolerance is:
(i) generally indicative of organizational culture; (ii) potentially different for different types of
losses/compromises; and (iii) highly influenced by the individual subjective risk tolerance of
senior leaders/executives. Yet, the ramifications of risk decisions based on risk tolerance are
potentially profound, with less risk-tolerant organizations perhaps failing to achieve needed
mission/business capabilities in order to avoid what appears to be unacceptable risk; while more
risk-tolerant organizations may focus on near-term mission/business efficiencies at the expense of
setting themselves up for future failure. It is important that organizations exercise due diligence in
determining risk tolerance—recognizing how fundamental this decision is to the effectiveness of
the risk management program.

2.3.4 Investment Strategies
Investment strategies30 play a significant role in organizational risk management efforts. These
strategies generally reflect the long-term strategic goals and objectives of organizations and the
associated risk management strategies developed and executed to ensure mission and business
success. Underlying all investment strategies is the recognition that there is a finite amount of
resources available to invest in helping organizations effectively manage risk—that is, effectively
addressing risk to achieve on-going mission/business success.

Mission and Risk Priorities
Organizations generally conduct a variety of missions and are involved in different types of
business functions. This is especially true for large and complex organizations that have different
organizational components, each of which is typically focused on one or two primary missions.
While all of these organizational components and associated missions/business functions are
likely to be important and play a key role in the overall success of organizations, in reality they
are not of equal importance. The greater the criticality of organizational missions and business
functions, the greater the necessity for organizations to ensure that risks are adequately managed.
Such missions and business functions are likely to require a greater degree of risk management
investments than missions/business functions deemed less critical. The determination of the
relative importance of the missions/business functions and hence the level of risk management
investment, is something that is decided upon at Tier 1, executed at Tier 2, and influences risk
management activities at Tier 3.

Anticipated Risk Response Needs
There is a great variation in the nature of potential threats facing organizations, ranging from
hackers attempting to merely deface organizational Web sites (e.g., cyber vandalism), to insider
30
   Investment strategies can include organizational approaches to: (i) replacing legacy information systems (e.g.,
phasing items in gradually, replacing entirely); (ii) outsourcing and using external providers of information systems and
services; and (iii) internal development vs. acquisition of commercially available information technology products.
