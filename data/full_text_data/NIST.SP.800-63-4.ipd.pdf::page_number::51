       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


1471      4. All compensating controls and their comparability or residual risk associated with
1472         compensating controls
1473      5. All supplemental controls
1474   Federal agencies SHOULD include this information in the system authorization package
1475   described in [SP800-37].

1476   5.4. Continuously Evaluate and Improve
1477   Threat actors adapt, user expectations and needs shift, and missions evolve. As such,
1478   risk assessments and identity solutions are not to be set and forgotten. To maintain pace
1479   with the constantly shifting environment in which they operate, organizations SHOULD
1480   implement a continuous evaluation and improvement program that leverages input from
1481   people interacting with the identity system. These programs SHOULD consider feedback
1482   from application performance metrics, threat intelligence, fraud analytics, assessments of
1483   equity impacts, privacy impact analysis, and user inputs.

1484   5.5. Cyber, Fraud, and Identity Program Integrity
1485   Typically, identity solutions are the front door for a critical business or service function.
1486   Accordingly, they should not operate in a vacuum. Close coordination of identity
1487   functions with cybersecurity teams, threat intelligence teams, and program integrity
1488   teams can enable a more complete protection of business capabilities, while constantly
1489   improving identity solution capabilities. For example, payment fraud data collected
1490   by program integrity teams could provide indicators of compromised subscriber
1491   accounts and potential weaknesses in identity proofing implementations. Similarly,
1492   threat intelligence teams may receive indication of new TTPs that may impact identity
1493   proofing, authentication, and federation processes. Organizations SHOULD establish
1494   consistent mechanisms for the exchange of information between critical security and
1495   fraud stakeholders.
1496   Where supporting service providers, such as CSPs, are external, this may be complicated,
1497   but SHOULD be considered in contractual and legal mechanisms. All data collected,
1498   transmitted, or shared SHALL be minimized and subject to a detailed privacy and legal
1499   assessment.
