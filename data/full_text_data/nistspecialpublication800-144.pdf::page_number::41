            is identifying scalable and usable cryptographic key management and exchange strategies
            for use by government, which could help to alleviate the problem eventually.16

            A guiding principle is for employees of the organization to be in control of the central
            keying material and to configure the key management components for cloud-based
            applications [Bar05]. Before proceeding in cloud environments where the cloud provider
            provides facilities for key management, the organization must fully understand and weigh
            the risks involved in the processes defined by the cloud provider for the key management
            lifecycle [SCA11]. Cryptographic operations performed in the cloud become part of the
            key management process and, therefore, should be managed and audited by the
            organization.

           Data Sanitization. The data sanitization practices that a cloud provider implements have
            obvious implications for security. Sanitization involves the expunging of data from
            storage media by overwriting, degaussing, or other means, or the destruction of the media
            itself, to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information.17 It applies in various
            equipment refresh or maintenance situations, such as when a storage device is removed
            from service or repurposed. Data sanitization also applies to backup copies made for
            recovery and restoration of service and residual data remaining upon termination of
            service.

            In a public cloud computing environment, data from one consumer is physically
            collocated (e.g., in an IaaS data store) or commingled (e.g., in a SaaS database) with the
            data of other consumers, which can complicate matters. Many examples exist of
            researchers obtaining used drives from online auctions and other sources and recovering
            large amounts of sensitive information from them (e.g., [Val08]). With the proper skills
            and equipment, it is also possible to recover data from failed drives, if they are not
            disposed of properly [Sob06]. Service agreements should stipulate sufficient measures
            that are taken to ensure data sanitization is performed appropriately throughout the
            system lifecycle.

4.8        Availability
In simple terms, availability is the extent to which an organization’s full set of computational
resources is accessible and usable. Availability can be affected temporarily or permanently, and
a loss can be partial or complete. Denial of service attacks, equipment outages, and natural
disasters are all threats to availability. The concern is that most downtime is unplanned and can
impact the mission of the organization.

           Temporary Outages. Despite employing architectures designed for high service
            reliability and availability, cloud computing services can and do experience outages and
