1.1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
NIST Special Publication 800-39 is the flagship document in the series of information security
standards and guidelines developed by NIST in response to FISMA. The purpose of Special
Publication 800-39 is to provide guidance for an integrated, organization-wide program for
managing information security risk to organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image,
and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation resulting
from the operation and use of federal information systems. Special Publication 800-39 provides a
structured, yet flexible approach for managing risk that is intentionally broad-based, with the
specific details of assessing, responding to, and monitoring risk on an ongoing basis provided by
other supporting NIST security standards and guidelines. The guidance provided in this
publication is not intended to replace or subsume other risk-related activities, programs,
processes, or approaches that organizations have implemented or intend to implement addressing
areas of risk management covered by other legislation, directives, policies, programmatic
initiatives, or mission/business requirements. Rather, the risk management guidance described
herein is complementary to and should be used as part of a more comprehensive Enterprise Risk
Management (ERM) program.

This publication satisfies the requirements of FISMA and meets or exceeds the information
security requirements established for executive agencies9 by the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) in Circular A-130, Appendix III, Security of Federal Automated Information
Resources. The guidelines in this publication are applicable to all federal information systems
other than those systems designated as national security systems as defined in 44 U.S.C., Section
3542. The guidelines have been broadly developed from a technical perspective to complement
similar guidelines for national security systems and may be used for such systems with the
approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems. State,
local, and tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations are encouraged to consider
using these guidelines, as appropriate.

1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE
This publication is intended to serve a diverse group of risk management professionals including:
•    Individuals with oversight responsibilities for risk management (e.g., heads of agencies, chief
     executive officers, chief operating officers);
•    Individuals with responsibilities for conducting organizational missions/business functions
     (e.g., mission/business owners, information owners/stewards, authorizing officials);
•    Individuals with responsibilities for acquiring information technology products, services, or
     information systems (e.g., acquisition officials, procurement officers, contracting officers);
•    Individuals with information security oversight, management, and operational responsibilities
     (e.g., chief information officers, senior information security officers,10 information security
     managers, information system owners, common control providers);
