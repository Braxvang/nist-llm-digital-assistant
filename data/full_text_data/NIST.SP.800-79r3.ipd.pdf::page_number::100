       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                    Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers


          Identifier                                 Issuer Control                                           Source

                         (iii) If the biometric verification decision is negative or no alternative
                               biometric data records are available, the cardholder provides
                               another primary identity source document, which is inspected and
                               compared to the cardholder with the electronic facial image retrieved
                               from the enrollment data record and the photograph printed on the
                               PIV Card (review, observe).
           MP-23       When an OCC reset is performed at a supervised remote identity proofing [FIPS201], Sec. 2.9.3 – OCC Reset
           (NEW)       station, the operator initiates a biometric verification to ensure that the
                       cardholder’s biometric characteristics captured at the station elicit a positive
                       biometric verification decision when compared to biometric data records
                       stored in the PIV enrollment record or when compared to the biometric data
                       records on the PIV Card using the BIO-A authentication mechanism. If the
                       biometric verification decision is negative or the cardholder’s biometric
                       characteristics are not successfully acquired, the cardholder provides
                       another primary identity source document via the scanners and sensors
                       integrated into the station. The remote operator inspects the document and
                       compares the video feed of the cardholder with the electronic facial image
                       retrieved from the enrollment data record and the photograph printed on the
                       PIV Card.

                       Assessment
                       Determine that:
                          (i) Both fingerprints used for OCC are replaced during an OCC reset
                              (observe, test).
                         (ii) All protections and requirements of [FIPS201], Sec. 2.7.1 are
                              observed during the procedure (review, observe).
                        (iii) The PIV Card OCC is only reset after a positive biometric
                              verification decision (review, observe).
                        (iv) If the biometric verification decision is negative, the cardholder
                              provides another primary identity source document via the scanners
                              and sensors integrated into the station. The remote operator
                              inspects the document and compares the video feed of the
                              cardholder with the electronic facial image retrieved from the
                              enrollment data record and the photograph printed on the PIV Card
                              (interview, observe).
