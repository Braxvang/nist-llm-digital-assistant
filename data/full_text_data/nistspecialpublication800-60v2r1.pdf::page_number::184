Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to space operations information.
Space operations are typically characterized by critical operational timing and safety
parameters and low tolerance for error. Loss of availability of time-critical information
necessary to these functions can result in large-scale property loss and in loss of human lives.
Also, air operations are not tolerant of information loss.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
space operations information is high.

D.12 Education
Education refers to those activities that impart knowledge or understanding of a particular
subject to the public. Education can take place at a formal school, college, university or other
training program. This mission area includes all government programs that promote the
education of the public, including both earned and unearned benefit programs.

D.12.1 Elementary, Secondary, and Vocational Education Information Type

Elementary, secondary, and vocational education refers to the provision of education in
elementary subjects (reading and writing and arithmetic); education provided by a high school or
college preparatory school; and vocational and technical education and training. The
recommended provisional categorization of the elementary, secondary, and vocational education
information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of elementary,
secondary, and vocational education information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide
guidance and consultative services. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most
elementary, secondary, and vocational education information would have a limited adverse effect
on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for elementary, secondary, and vocational education information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of elementary, secondary, and
vocational education information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
agency assets, or individuals. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting
external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations
and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.
