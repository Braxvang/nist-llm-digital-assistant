          Cryptography Applications in
          Wireless and Mobile Security
              Today, wireless networks have been integrated into
          modern communication systems that connect mobile devices
          using multiple radio technologies. Such heterogeneous
          networks demand integrated security solutions. The NIST
          team has worked closely with different working groups in the
          IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee since 2006 and                                          Figure 14: Example of a Blockchain
          made solid contributions to the security solutions for wireless
          networks. The NIST team has been involved in the IEEE 802.11                        Figure 14: Example of a Blockchain illustrates three
          and IEEE 802.21 working groups to develop standards for                        blocks in a blockchain, where each block contains at least one
          cryptographic key management schemes for the mobility                          transaction, a nonce and the hash value of the previous block
