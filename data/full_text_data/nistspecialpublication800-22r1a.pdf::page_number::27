A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



(4)        Compute P-value = igamc (N/2, χ2(obs)/2) , where igamc is the incomplete gamma function for
           Q(a,x) as defined in Section 5.5.3.

           Note: When comparing this section against the technical description in Section 3.2, note that
           Q(a,x) = 1-P(a,x).

                                                            3 1
           For the example in this section, P-value = igamc  ,  = 0.801252.
                                                            2 2

2.2.5 Decision Rule (at the 1% Level)
If the computed P-value is < 0.01, then conclude that the sequence is non-random. Otherwise, conclude
that the sequence is random.

2.2.6 Conclusion and Interpretation of Results
Since the P-value obtained in step 4 of Section 2.2.4 is ≥ 0.01 (i.e., P-value = 0.801252), the conclusion is
that the sequence is random.

Note that small P-values (< 0.01) would have indicated a large deviation from the equal proportion of
ones and zeros in at least one of the blocks.

2.2.7 Input Size Recommendation
It is recommended that each sequence to be tested consist of a minimum of 100 bits (i.e., n ≥ 100). Note
that n ≥ MN. The block size M should be selected such that M ≥ 20, M > .01n and N < 100.

2.2.8 Example
(input)    ε = 11001001000011111101101010100010001000010110100011
               00001000110100110001001100011001100010100010111000

(input)            n = 100

(input)            M = 10

(processing)       N = 10

(processing)       χ2 = 7.2

(output)           P-value = 0.706438

(conclusion)       Since P-value ≥ 0.01, accept the sequence as random.


2.3   Runs Test

2.3.1 Test Purpose
The focus of this test is the total number of runs in the sequence, where a run is an uninterrupted sequence
of identical bits. A run of length k consists of exactly k identical bits and is bounded before and after with
a bit of the opposite value. The purpose of the runs test is to determine whether the number of runs of
