Application-Specific Key Management Guidance, Part 3 of the Recommendation for Key
Management is intended primarily to help system administrators and system installers
adequately secure applications based on product availability and organizational needs and
to support organizational decisions about future procurements. This document also
provides information for end users regarding application options left under their control
in normal use of the application. Recommendations are given for a select set of
applications, namely:

         Section 10 – Secure Shell (SSH)

The following is provided for each topic:

    •    A brief description of the system under discussion that is intended to provide
         context for the security guidance,
    •    Recommended algorithm suites and key sizes and associated security and
         compliance issues,
    •    Recommendations concerning the use of the mechanism in its current form for the

         management processes,
    •    General recommendations for purchase decision makers, system installers, system
