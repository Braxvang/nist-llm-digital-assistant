                                                    GUIDE TO STORAGE ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES FOR END USER DEVICES



 Deploying storage encryption software to additional devices

 Updating storage encryption software (e.g., patching, upgrading)

 Configuring storage encryption software, such as specifying encryption algorithms and setting
  authentication policies (in some cases, the policies are specific for types of devices, groups of users,
  and/or individual users)

 Managing storage encryption authenticators and cryptographic keys 28

 Collecting and reviewing storage encryption-related logs

 Recovering stored information from device failures

 Performing routine system maintenance

 Enabling the encryption of data and managing encrypted storage

     –   For FDE, this involves encrypting the computer’s hard drive. Some products allow the initial
         encryption to be done while the computer is in use, but it can cause a substantial performance
         impact if not configured properly, and additional hard drive space may be needed. Other
         products require that the computer not be in use while the drive is initially encrypted.

     –   For volume encryption, this could involve either encrypting an existing volume, or creating a new
         volume, encrypting it, and then having the user add files to the volume as needed.

     –   For virtual disk encryption, this simply involves creating a container. Files can then be added to
         the container by the user as needed.

     –   For file/folder encryption, this could involve encrypting existing files, setting up an encrypted
         folder for future files, or establishing policies to automatically encrypt certain types of files.

Some storage encryption products, particularly ones intended for standalone deployment, can be managed
locally. Local management is typically performed by a system administrator (for managed devices) or a
user (for unmanaged devices) who has physical access to the device running the storage encryption
technology. A common local management task is recovering data; many products allow users to recover
their own data by running a recovery utility. For example, a device using FDE might experience a failure
that prevents it from booting the OS; a user could run a recovery utility from the pre-boot environment or
a CD to extract the data from the device.

Organizations may choose to deploy storage encryption without a centralized management capability and
perform all management locally. This is generally acceptable for standalone deployments and very small-
scale deployments, particularly ones that need to be done quickly, without waiting for a centralized
management infrastructure to be implemented. However, for all other deployments, centralized
management is recommended because it is more effective and efficient for most management tasks,
including policy verification and enforcement, key management, authenticator management, and data
recovery.
