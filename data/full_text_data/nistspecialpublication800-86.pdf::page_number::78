GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



           is primarily related to concerns about sharing information with external organizations; also, the
           owner of an IP address could be the person attacking the organization.
      ! Send Network Traffic to the IP Address. Organizations should not send network traffic to an
        apparent attacking IP address to validate its identity. Any response that is generated cannot
        conclusively confirm the identity of the attacking host. Moreover, if the IP address is for the
        attacker’s system, the attacker might see the traffic and react by destroying evidence or attacking
        the host sending the traffic. If the IP address is spoofed, sending unsolicited network traffic to the
        system could be interpreted as unauthorized use or an attack. Under no circumstances should
        individuals attempt to gain access to others’ systems without permission.
      ! Seek ISP Assistance. As mentioned in Section 6.3.1, ISPs generally require a court order before
        providing any information to an organization about suspicious network activity. Accordingly,
        ISP assistance is generally an option during only the most serious network-based attacks. This
        assistance is particularly useful in relation to attacks that involve IP address spoofing. ISPs have
        the ability to trace ongoing attacks back to their source, whether the IP addresses are spoofed or
        not.
      ! Research the History of the IP Address. Analysts can look for previous suspicious activity
        associated with the same IP address or IP address block. The organization’s own network traffic
        data archives and incident tracking databases might show previous activity. Possible external
        sources include Internet search engines and online incident databases that allow searches by IP
        address.113
      ! Look for Clues in Application Content. Application data packets related to an attack might
        contain clues to the attacker’s identity. In addition to IP addresses, valuable information could
        include an e-mail address or an Internet relay chat (IRC) nickname.
In most cases, organizations do not need to positively identify the IP address used for an attack.

6.5      Recommendations

Key recommendations presented in this section for using data from network traffic are as follows:

      ! Organizations should have policies regarding privacy and sensitive information. The use of
        forensic tools and techniques might inadvertently disclose sensitive information to analysts and
        others involved in forensic activities. Also, long-term storage of sensitive information
        inadvertently captured by forensic tools might violate data retention policies. Policies should also
        address the monitoring of networks, as well as requiring warning banners on systems that indicate
        activity may be monitored.

      ! Organizations should provide adequate storage for network activity–related logs.
        Organizations should estimate typical and peak log usage, determine how many hours’ or days’
        worth of data should be retained based on the organization’s policies, and ensure that systems and
        applications have sufficient storage available. Logs related to computer security incidents might
        need to be kept for a substantially longer period of time than other logs.
      ! Organizations should configure data sources to improve the collection of information. Over
        time, operational experience should be used to improve the organization’s forensic analysis
        capabilities. Organizations should periodically review and adjust the configuration settings of
        data sources to optimize capture of relevant information.
