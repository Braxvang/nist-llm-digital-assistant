                                               Prologue

“... Through the process of risk management, leaders must consider risk to U.S. interests from
adversaries using cyberspace to their advantage and from our own efforts to employ the global
nature of cyberspace to achieve objectives in military, intelligence, and business operations...”
“... For operational plans development, the combination of threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts
must be evaluated in order to identify important trends and decide where effort should be applied
to eliminate or reduce threat capabilities; eliminate or reduce vulnerabilities; and assess,
coordinate, and deconflict all cyberspace operations...”
“... Leaders at all levels are accountable for ensuring readiness and security to the same degree
as in any other domain...”
