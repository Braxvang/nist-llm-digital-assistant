The DRB charter should also specify the DRB’s composition. To be effective, the DRB
should include representatives from multiple groups and experts in both technology and
privacy policy. Specifcally, DRBs may wish to have as members:
    • Individuals who represent the interests of potential users (such individuals need not
      come from outside of the organization)
    • Representation from among the public, specifcally from groups represented in the
      datasets if they have a limited scope
    • Representation from the organization’s leadership team, such as the Senior Agency
      Offcial for Privacy [4, Appendix II, section 4] (such representation helps to establish
      the DRB’s credibility with the rest of the organization)
    • A representative of the organization’s senior privacy offcial
    • Subject-matter experts
    • Outside experts
The charter should establish rules for ensuring a quorum and specify whether members can
designate alternates on a standing or meeting-by-meeting basis. The DRB should specify
the mechanism by which members are nominated and approved, their tenure, conditions
for removal, and removal procedures.24
The charter should set policy expectations for record keeping and reporting, including
whether records and reports are considered public or restricted. For example, the char-
ter could direct the DRB to issue an annual report with a list of every dataset that was
approved for release. The charter should indicate whether it is possible to exclude sensitive
decisions from these reporting requirements and the mechanism for doing so. Ideally, the
charter should be a public document to promote transparency.
To meet its requirement of evaluating data releases, the DRB should require that writ-
ten applications be submitted to the DRB that specify the nature of the dataset, the de-
identifcation methodology, and the result. An application may require that the proposer
present the re-identifcation risk, the risk to individuals if the dataset is re-identifed, and
a proposed plan for detecting and mitigating successful re-identifcation. In addition, the
DRB should require that when individuals are informed that their information will be de-
identifed, they also be informed that privacy risks may remain despite de-identifcation.
The DRB should keep accurate records of its request memos, their associated documen-
tation, the DRB decision, and the actual fles released. These records should be appropri-

24 For example, in 2022, the Census Bureau’s DRB had 12 voting members: two technical co-chairs, a repre-

 sentative from the Policy Coordination Offce, a representative from the Associate Director for Communica-
 tions, two representatives from the Center for Enterprise Dissemination-Disclosure Avoidance (CED-DA),
 two representatives from the Economic Programs Directorate, two representatives from the Demographic
 Programs Directorate, and two representatives from the Decennial Programs Directorate [29].
