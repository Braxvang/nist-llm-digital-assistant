       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                        Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

2499   B.5.3. Reseeding an RBG3(XOR) Construction
2500   The Hash_DRBG must be reseeded at the end of its designed seedlife and may be reseeded on
2501   demand (e.g., by the consuming application). Reseeding will be automatic whenever the end of
2502   the DRBG’s seedlife is reached during a Generate_function call (see [SP800-90A]). For this
2503   example, whether reseeding is done automatically during a Generate_function call or is
2504   specifically requested by a consuming application, the Reseed_function call is:
2505                               status = Reseed_function(additional_input).
2506       •   The state_handle parameter is not used in the Reseed_function call since a state_handle
2507           was not returned from the RBG3(XOR)_DRBG_Instantiate function (see Appendix
2508           B.5.1).
2509       •   The security strength for reseeding the Hash_DRBG is recorded in the internal state as 256
2510           bits.
2511       •   Additional input is optional.
2512   Section 6.3.1.3 refers to Section 5.2.3 for reseeding the Hash_DRBG. Since entropy is obtained
2513   directly from the entropy source and no conditioning function is used (case 2 in Section 6.3.2), the
2514   implementation has replaced the Get_randomness-source_input call used by the
2515   Reseed_function in [SP800-90A] with a Get_ES_Bitstring call.
2516   The Hash_DRBG is reseeded with a security strength of 256 bits as follows:
2517                           (status, entropy_bitstring) = Get_ES_Bitstring(256).
2518   If status = SUCCESS is returned by the Get_ES_Bitstring call, entropy_bitstring consists of at
2519   least 256 bits that contain at least 256 bits of entropy. These bits are used to reseed the
2520   Hash_DRBG. Status = SUCCESS is then returned to the calling application by the
2521   Reseed_function.
2522   If status = FAILURE, entropy_bitstring is an empty (e.g., null) bitstring. The Hash_DRBG is not
2523   reseeded, and status ≠ SUCCESS is returned from the Reseed_function to the calling application
2524   (e.g., the Generate_function).

2525   B.6.    Example of an RBG3(RS) Construction
2526   This construction is specified in Section 6.3 and requires an entropy source and a DRBG (see the
2527   left half of Figure 24 outlined in green). The DRBG is directly accessible using the same
2528   instantiation that is used by the RBG3(RS) construction (i.e., they share the same internal state).
2529   When accessed directly, the DRBG behaves as an RBG2(P) construction (see the right half of
2530   Figure 24 outlined in blue).
