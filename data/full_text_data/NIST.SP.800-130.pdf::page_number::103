   The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) defines the Extended Master Session
   Key (EMSK) generation process. RFC 5295 defines how EMSK is used to derive root
   keys. Root keys are master keys that can be used for multiple security services, such
   as authentication, integrity, and encryption.

20. [RFC 5480]
    Elliptic Curve Cryptography Subject Public Key Information,
    http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5480.txt.
    RFC 5480 defines the format and structure of elliptic curve public keys in X509
    certificates.

21. [RFC 5652]
    Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS),
    http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5652.txt.
    RFC 5652 describes the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) format. This syntax is
    used to digitally sign, digest, authenticate, or encrypt arbitrary message content.

22. [RFC 5914]
    Trust Anchor Format, http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5914.txt.
    RFC 5914 describes a structure for representing trust anchor information. A trust
    anchor is an authoritative entity that is represented by a public key and associated
    data. The public key is used to verify digital signatures, and the associated data is
    used to constrain the types of information or actions for which the trust anchor is
    authoritative. The structure defined in this document is intended to satisfy format-
    related requirements defined in the Trust Anchor Management Requirements.

23. [RFC 5934]
    Trust Anchor Management Protocol (TAMP), http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5934.txt.
    RFC 5934 defines a security protocol to securely update the trust anchor stores held
    by devices, equipment and applications.

23. [RFC 6024]
    Trust Anchor Management Requirements, http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6024.txt.
    RFC 6024 describes some of the problems associated with the lack of a standard trust
    anchor management mechanism and defines requirements for data formats and push-
    based protocols designed to address these problems.

    SP 800-37-rev1: Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal
    Information Systems â€“ A Security Lifecycle Approach, February 2010
    http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
    SP 800-37-rev1 continues the evolution to a unified framework by transforming the
    traditional Certification and Accreditation process into the six-step Risk Management
    Framework (RMF). The revised process emphasizes: (i) building information security
    capabilities into Federal information systems through the application of state-of-the-
                                           95
