2           Background

Information disposition and sanitization decisions occur throughout the information system life
cycle. Critical factors affecting information disposition and media sanitization are decided at the
start of a system’s development. The initial system requirements should include hardware and
software specifications as well as interconnections and data flow documents that will assist the
system owner in identifying the types of media used in the system. Some storage devices support
enhanced commands for sanitization, which may make sanitization easier, faster, and/or more
effective. The decision may be even more fundamental, because effective sanitization procedures
may not yet have been determined for emerging media types. Without an effective command or
interface-based sanitization technique, the only option left may be to destroy the media. In that
event, the media cannot be reused by other organizations that might otherwise have been able to
benefit from receiving the repurposed storage device.

A determination should be made during the requirements phase about what other types of media
will be used to create, capture, or transfer information used by the system. This analysis,
balancing business needs and risk to confidentiality, will formalize the media that will be
considered for the system to conform to FIPS 200.

Media sanitization and information disposition activity is usually most intense during the
disposal phase of the system life cycle. However, throughout the life of an information system,
many types of media, containing data, will be transferred outside the positive control of the
organization. This activity may be for maintenance reasons, system upgrades, or during a
configuration update.

    2.1 Need for Proper Media Sanitization and Information Disposition

Media sanitization is one key element in assuring confidentiality. Confidentiality is defined as
“preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for
protecting personal privacy and proprietary information…” 10 Additionally, “a loss of
confidentiality is the unauthorized disclosure of information.” 11

In order for organizations to have appropriate controls on the information they are responsible
for safeguarding, they must properly safeguard used media. An often rich source of illicit
information collection is either through dumpster diving for improperly disposed hard copy
media, acquisition of improperly sanitized electronic media, or through keyboard and laboratory
reconstruction of media sanitized in a manner not commensurate with the confidentiality of its
information. Media flows in and out of organizational control through recycle bins in paper form,
out to vendors for equipment repairs, and hot swapped into other systems in response to
hardware or software failures. This potential vulnerability can be mitigated through proper
understanding of where information is located, what that information is, and how to protect it.
