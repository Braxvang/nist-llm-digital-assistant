the number of attendees at awareness sessions, the number of people trained on a particular topic, and the
number of people yet to attend awareness and training sessions.

This fully decentralized program management model is often deployed by agencies that:

     Are relatively large;
     Have a very decentralized structure with general responsibilities assigned to the headquarters (central)
      and specific responsibilities assigned to unit levels;
     Have functions that are spread over a wide geographical area; or
     Have quasi-autonomous organizational units with separate and distinct missions, so that awareness
      and training programs may need to differ greatly.
Once the model to be employed is identified, the approach to conducting a needs assessment should be
defined consistent with the organizational model selected.

3.2     Conducting a Needs Assessment

A needs assessment is a process that can be used to determine an organization’s awareness and training
needs. The results of a needs assessment can provide justification to convince management to allocate
adequate resources to meet the identified awareness and training needs.

In conducting a needs assessment, it is important that key personnel be involved. As a minimum, the
following roles should be addressed in terms of any special training needs:

     Executive Management – Organizational leaders need to fully understand directives and laws that
      form the basis for the security program. They also need to comprehend their leadership roles in
      ensuring full compliance by users within their units.
     Security Personnel (security program managers and security officers) – These individuals act as
      expert consultants for their organization and therefore must be well educated on security policy and
      accepted best practices.
     System Owners – Owners must have a broad understanding of security policy and a high degree of
      understanding regarding security controls and requirements applicable to the systems they manage.
     System Administrators and IT Support Personnel – Entrusted with a high degree of authority over
      support operations critical to a successful security program, these individuals need a higher degree of
      technical knowledge in effective security practices and implementation.
     Operational Managers and System Users – These individuals need a high degree of security
      awareness and training on security controls and rules of behavior for systems they use to conduct
      business operations.


A variety of sources of information in an agency can be used to determine IT security awareness and
training needs, and there are different ways to collect that information. Figure 3-4 suggests techniques for
gathering information as part of a needs assessment.10

      The needs assessment process should only be as complex as is needed to identify an organization’s awareness and training
      program needs. Similarly, the tools that are employed to identify those needs should be selected with an understanding of
      the organization’s culture and conventions, as well as knowledge of the organization’s size, workforce complexity, and
