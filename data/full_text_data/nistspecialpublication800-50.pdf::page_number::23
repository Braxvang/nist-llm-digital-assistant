Model 1: Centralized Program Management Model (Centralized Policy, Strategy, and
Implementation)

In this model, responsibility and budget for the entire organization’s IT security awareness and training
program is given to a central authority. All directives, strategy development, planning, and scheduling is
coordinated through this “security awareness and training” authority.




                           Figure 3-1: Model 1 – Centralized Program Management

Because the awareness and training strategy is developed at the central authority, the needs assessment –
which helps determine the strategy – is also conducted by the central authority. The central authority also
develops the training plan as well as the awareness and training material. The method(s) of implementing
the material throughout the organization is determined and accomplished by the central authority.
Typically, in such an organization, both the CIO and IT security program manager are organizationally
located within this central authority.

Communication between the central authority and the organizational units travels in both directions. The
central authority communicates the agency’s policy directives regarding IT security awareness and
training, the strategy for conducting the program, and the material and method(s) of implementation to the
organizational units. The organizational units provide information requested by the central authority. For
example, to meet its responsibilities, the central authority may collect data on the number of attendees at
awareness sessions, the number of people trained on a particular topic, and the number of people yet to
attend awareness and training sessions. The organizational unit can also provide feedback on the
effectiveness of awareness and training material and on the appropriateness of the method(s) used to
implement the material. This allows the central authority to fine-tune, add or delete material, or modify
the implementation method(s).
