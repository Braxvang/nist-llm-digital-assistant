      NIST SP 800-92r1 ipd                                                   Cybersecurity Log Management
      October 2023                                                                          Planning Guide

471      TS, Define Target State
472   [Tasks]                                                                [Previous Play] [Next Play]
473   Summary: Define the target state for your organization’s cybersecurity logging. The target state
474   is a combination of (mandatory) requirements from all applicable laws, regulations, standards,
475   and internal policies and (desired) goals and objectives for log management based on balancing
476   the organization’s reduction of risk and the need for logging resilience with the time and
477   resources needed to perform log management functions. The desired outcome is an integrated set
478   of prioritized requirements, goals, and objectives for your organization’s cybersecurity logging.
479   This set should be updated periodically and as major changes occur, like the impending
480   implementation of a new law or regulation, the introduction of new technology, or the
481   observation of new threats.
482   Tasks to perform include the following (not necessarily in order):
483      1. TS-1, Forecast Future Changes to Logging Inventories
484      2. TS-2, Define Target State for Log Generation
485      3. TS-3, Define Target State for Log Storage and Transfer
486      4. TS-4, Define Target State for Log Access
487      5. TS-5, Define Target State for Log Disposal
488   Supporting information for tasks: There are interdependencies between these tasks. For
489   example, generating a higher volume of logs may necessitate increasing resources for log
490   storage. Conversely, a firm limit on log storage resources may necessitate generating less log
491   data, being more selective about which generated log data is stored, or reducing how long some
492   log data is stored.

493             TS-1, Forecast Future Changes to Logging Inventories
494   [Tasks] [Examples]                                                     [Previous Play] [Next Play]
495   Summary: Forecast future changes to the organization’s logging inventories (e.g., log source
496   types, infrastructure, use cases, requirements, and work roles), and consider their potential
497   effects on each other and the organization’s logging practices. This includes known changes and
498   educated guesses about future changes. The desired outcome is a set of prioritized future changes
499   that inform the target states for the organization’s logging.
500   Tasks to perform include the following (not necessarily in order):
501      1. TS-1.1: Forecast future changes to log source types.
502      2. TS-1.2: Forecast future changes to the logging infrastructure.
503      3. TS-1.3: Forecast future changes to logging use cases.
504      4. TS-1.4: Forecast future changes to requirements.
505      5. TS-1.5: Forecast future changes to work roles.
506   Supporting information for the tasks: There are interdependencies between these tasks. Future
507   changes identified by one task may necessitate other types of changes.
