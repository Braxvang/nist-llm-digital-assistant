                                  ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



programs to give consumers of WLAN products assurance that their systems comply with IEEE 802.11
specifications and can interoperate with similar equipment from other vendors. The following
certifications have been created to test interoperability of IEEE 802.11i implementations:

    WPA, which addresses a subset of the IEEE 802.11i specification that addresses the weaknesses
     of WEP
    WPA2, which extends WPA to include the full set of IEEE 802.11i requirements.
Federal agencies should procure WPA2 products that have been FIPS-validated; WPA products cannot be
FIPS-validated because they do not support FIPS-approved encryption algorithms. WPA and WPA2
have both Personal and Enterprise modes of operation. Organizations that plan to deploy authentication
servers as part of an IEEE 802.1X and EAP implementation should procure products with the Enterprise
level certification; government organizations should also require FIPS conformance or NIST approval.
