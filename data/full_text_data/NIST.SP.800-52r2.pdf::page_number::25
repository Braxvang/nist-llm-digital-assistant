NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                             GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


By removing requirements that specific cipher suites be supported, system administrators have
more freedom to meet the needs of their environments and applications. It also increases agility
by allowing administrators to immediately disable cipher suites when attacks are discovered
without breaking compliance.

If a subset of the cipher suites that are acceptable for the server certificate(s) are supported, the
following list gives general guidance on choosing the strongest options:

   1. Prefer ephemeral keys over static keys (i.e., prefer DHE over DH, and prefer ECDHE
      over ECDH). Ephemeral keys provide perfect forward secrecy.
   2. Prefer GCM or CCM modes over CBC mode. The use of an authenticated encryption
      mode prevents several attacks (see Section 3.3.2 for more information). Note that these
      are not available in versions prior to TLS 1.2.
   3. Prefer CCM over CCM_8. The latter contains a shorter authentication tag, which
      provides a lower authentication strength.

   This list does not have to be strictly followed, as some environments or applications may
   have special circumstances. Note that this list may become outdated if an attack emerges on
   one of the preferred components. If an attack significantly impacts the recommended cipher
   suites, NIST will address the issue in an announcement on the NIST Computer Security
   Resource Center website (https://csrc.nist.gov).

3.3.1.1.1 Cipher Suites for ECDSA Certificates

TLS version 1.2 includes authenticated encryption modes and support for the SHA-256 and
SHA-384 hash algorithms, which are not supported in prior versions of TLS. These cipher suites
are described in [61] and [56]. TLS 1.2 servers that are configured with ECDSA certificates may
be configured to support the following cipher suites, which are only supported by TLS 1.2:

   •   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0xC0, 0x2B)
   •   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0xC0, 0x2C)
   •   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM (0xC0, 0xAC)
   •   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CCM (0xC0, 0xAD)
   •   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8 (0xC0, 0xAE)
   •   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CCM_8 (0xC0, 0xAF)
   •   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 (0xC0, 0x23)
   •   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384 (0xC0, 0x24)

TLS servers may be configured to support the following cipher suites when ECDSA certificates
are used with TLS versions 1.2, 1.1, or 1.0:
