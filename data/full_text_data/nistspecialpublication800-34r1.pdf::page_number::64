                                              CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



      Automate backup of data. Client/server systems should have software installed that
       automatically schedules data backups to a central data backup location. Data for backup should
       be stored at a common directory name (such as \My Documents) to ease in automated backup and
       to make sure that only pertinent data is backed up. If the client system backup process is not
       automated from the network, users should be encouraged to back up data on a regular basis.
       Automated backup schedulers should be set up for stand-alone desktops and portable devices
       whenever possible.
      Provide guidance on saving data on client computers. Instructing users to save data to a
       particular folder on the computer eases the IT department’s client support requirements. If a
       machine must be rebuilt, the technician will know which folders to copy and preserve during
       recovery.
      Store backup information at an alternate site. If users back up data on a stand-alone system
       rather than saving data to the network, a means should be provided for storing the media at an
       alternate site. Software licenses and original system software, vendor SLAs and contracts, and
       other important documents relevant to the stand-alone should be stored with the backup media.
       The storage facility should be located far enough away from the original site to reduce the
       likelihood that both sites would be affected by the same contingency event.

Contingency considerations for servers in a client/server system rely extensively on LAN and WAN
connectivity to communicate with their clients. Because of this, server components must consider system
contingency measures similar to those for LANs and WANs.

      Standardize hardware, software, and peripherals. System recovery may be expedited if
       hardware, software, and peripherals are standardized throughout the client/server system.
       Recovery costs may be reduced because standard configurations may be designated and resources
       may be shared. Standardized components also reduce system maintenance across the
       organization.
      Document systems configurations and vendors. Document the server architecture and the
       configurations of its various components. In addition, the contingency plan should identify
       vendors and model specifications to facilitate rapid equipment replacement after a disruption.
      Coordinate with security policies and security controls. Server contingency solution(s) should
       be coordinated with network security policies where similar security controls and security-related
       activities (e.g., risk assessment, vulnerability scanning) in the production environment should be
       implemented in the contingency solution(s) to ensure that, during a system disruption, executing
       the technical contingency solution(s) does not compromise or disclose sensitive data. Security of
       data within a client/server system is key as most systems are multi-tenancy, having multiple users
       and applications residing on the same system, with different security requirements and controls.
      Coordinate contingency solutions with cyber incident response procedures. Because many
       application servers use Web services to provide an image of the organization to the public, the
       organization’s public image could be damaged if the application server were defaced or taken
       down by a cyber attack. To reduce the consequences of such an attack, contingency solutions
       should be coordinated closely with cyber incident response procedures designed to limit the
       impacts of a cyber attack.
      Use results from the BIA. Impacts and priorities discovered through the BIA of associated
       LANs and/or WANs should be reviewed to determine recovery requirements and priorities.
