A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



2.6.5 Decision Rule (at the 1% Level)
If the computed P-value is < 0.01, then conclude that the sequence is non-random. Otherwise, conclude
that the sequence is random.

2.6.6 Conclusion and Interpretation of Results
Since the P-value obtained in step 8 of Section 2.6.4 is ≥ 0.01 (P-value = 0.029523), the conclusion is that
the sequence is random.

A d value that is too low would indicate that there were too few peaks (< 95%) below T, and too many
peaks (more than 5%) above T.

2.6.7 Input Size Recommendation
It is recommended that each sequence to be tested consist of a minimum of 1000 bits (i.e., n ≥ 1000).

2.6.8 Example
(input)    ε = 11001001000011111101101010100010001000010110100011
               00001000110100110001001100011001100010100010111000

(input)         n = 100

(processing)    N1 = 46

(processing)    N0 = 47.5

(processing)    d = -1.376494

(output)        P-value = 0.168669

(conclusion)    Since P-value ≥ 0.01, accept the sequence as random.


2.7   Non-overlapping Template Matching Test

2.7.1 Test Purpose
The focus of this test is the number of occurrences of pre-specified target strings. The purpose of this
test is to detect generators that produce too many occurrences of a given non-periodic (aperiodic) pattern.
For this test and for the Overlapping Template Matching test of Section 2.8, an m-bit window is used to
search for a specific m-bit pattern. If the pattern is not found, the window slides one bit position. If the
pattern is found, the window is reset to the bit after the found pattern, and the search resumes.

2.7.2 Function Call
NonOverlappingTemplateMatching(m,n)

           m    The length in bits of each template. The template is the target string.

           n    The length of the entire bit string under test.

Additional input used by the function, but supplied by the testing code:
