Special Publication 800-73-4         Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification – Part 1: PIV
                                  Card Application Namespace, Data Model and Representation


Appendix A–– PIV Data Model

The PIV data model number is 0x10, and the data model version number is 0x01.

The SP 800-73-4 specification does not provide mechanisms to read partial contents of a PIV data
object. Individual access to the TLV elements within a container is not supported. For each container,
compliant cards shall return all TLV elements of the container in the order listed in this appendix.

Both single-chip/dual-interface and dual-chip implementations are feasible. In the single-chip/dual-
interface configuration, the PIV Card Application shall be provided the information regarding which
interface is in use. In the dual-chip configuration, a separate PIV Card Application shall be loaded on
each chip.

with larger containers may be produced and determined conformant.
