SP 800-152                                              A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


FR:11.14 The CKMS design shall specify the circumstances under which an incremental
security assessment should be conducted.

FR:11.15 The CKMS design shall specify the scope of incremental security assessments.

                CA-2      A Federal CKMS shall undergo an incremental security
PR:11.10
                          assessment after any change is made to any part of the
                          FCKMS when the change is not a major change, and the
                          change is not the result of a security compromise.
                CA-2      If a change is major or the result of a security compromise,
PR:11.11
                          then a Federal CKMS shall undergo a full security
                          assessment as specified in Section 11.1.
                          An incremental security assessment for a Federal CKMS
PR:11.12
                          shall include the identification of any changes to the system
                          since the last security assessment, an architectural review of
                          any design changes, and functional and security testing of the
                          FCKMS.
                           A Federal CKMS shall support producing a report following
PR:11.13
                           an incremental security assessment that includes the
                           following:
                            a) The reasons for any changes;
                            b) Inconsistencies that could have arisen between the
                               CKMS design, the FCKMS implementation, and this
                               Profile;
                            c) The results of the assessment, including all discovered
                               security defects; and
                            d) Any corrective actions to be performed and the dates by
                               which the actions must be completed.

                          A Federal CKMS could automatically initiate an incremental
PF:11.3
                          or full security assessment (as appropriate) after any change
                          to an existing security policy associated with an FCKMS.

11.4 Security Maintenance

While an FCKMS could be designed, implemented, and operated to provide a specific
impact-level (e.g., Low, Moderate, or High), the protection provided could be reduced if
configuration changes are made or when new threats are identified. In order to maintain
or enhance the security of an FCKMS, it should be upgraded in accordance with
hardening guidelines (see Section 8.2.1).
