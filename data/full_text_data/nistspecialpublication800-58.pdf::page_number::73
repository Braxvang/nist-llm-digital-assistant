       heterogeneous packets, despite the lesser urgency of these large packets. The
       non-uniform pattern of data traffic also contributes to a great deal of jitter in
       VOIP. The variation in the bandwidth usage caused by heterogeneous packets
       wreaks havoc with the delay times of the fairly uniform VOIP packets, causing
       them to arrive in spurts. If these spurts exceed the timing mechanism associated
       with the buffer, then packet loss can occur. The development of VOIP-aware
       crypto schedulers would help to relieve this problem.

 8.7   Expanded Packet Size

       IPsec also increases the size of packets in VOIP, which leads to more QoS issues.
       It has been shown that increased packet size increases throughput through the
       crypto-engine, but to conclude from this that increased packet size due to IPsec
       leads to better throughput would be fallacious. The difference is that the increase
       in packet size due to IPsec does not result in an increased payload capacity. The
       increase is actually just an increase in the header size due to the encryption and
       encapsulation of the old IP header and the introduction of the new IP header and
       encryption information. (see 8.1). This leads to several complications when
       IPsec is applied to VOIP. First, the effective bandwidth is decreased as much as
       63% [9]. Thus connections to single users in low bandwidth areas (i.e. via
       modem) may become infeasible. The bandwidth performance reductions for
       various encryption algorithms are presented in [8]. The size discrepancy can also
       cause latency and jitter issues as packets are delayed by decreased network
       throughput or bottlenecked at hub nodes on the network (such as routers or
       firewalls).

 8.8   IPsec and NAT Incompatibility

       IPsec and NAT compatibility is far from ideal. NAT traversal completely invalidates
       the purpose of AH because the source address of the machine behind the NAT is
       masked from the outside world. Thus, there is no way to authenticate the true sender
       of the data. The same reasoning demonstrates the inoperability of source
       authentication in ESP. We have defined this as an essential feature of VOIPsec, so
       this is a serious problem. There are several other issues that arise when ESP traffic
       attempts to cross a NAT. If only one of the endpoints is behind a NAT, the situation
       is easier [32] If both are behind NATs, IKE negotiation can be used for NAT
       traversal, with UDP encapsulation of the IPsec packets.
