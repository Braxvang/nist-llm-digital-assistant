772   5.2.1. Manual Registration
773   In the manual registration model, the operators of the IdP and RP manually provision
774   configuration information about parties with which they expect to interoperate, prior to
775   involvement of the subscriber.




                                    Figure 4. Manual Registration

776   As shown in Figure 4, manual registration involves three steps:
777      1. The RP’s system administrator shares the RP’s attributes with the IdP’s system
778         administrator, who associates those attributes with the RP.
779      2. The IdP’s system administrator shares the IdP’s attributes with the RP’s system
780         administrator, who associates those attributes with the IdP.
781      3. The IdP and RP then communicate using a standard federation protocol.
782   IdPs and RPs MAY act as their own authorities on who to federate with as in Sec. 5.1.1 or
783    MAY externalize those authority decisions to an external party as in Sec. 5.1.2.

784   Protocols requiring the transfer of keying information SHALL use a secure method
785   during the registration process to exchange keying information needed to operate the
786   federated relationship, including any shared secrets or public keys. Any symmetric keys
787   used in this relationship SHALL be unique to a pair of federation participants.
788   Federation relationships SHALL establish parameters regarding expected and acceptable
789   IALs and AALs in connection with the federated relationship.
