GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



fingerprint of the information (i.e., the message being sent) using a cryptographic hash, which can be
signed more efficiently than the entire message. 9

Federal organizations are required to use cryptographic algorithms that have been approved by the
Federal government. 10 Other organizations may wish to choose encryption schemes approved by the
Federal government because these are well-tested and secure. Table 3.1 presents general
recommendations for selecting cryptographic suites for protecting email messages.

                                           Table 3.1: Recommended Cipher Suites

        Recommended Use                                                     Cipher Suites
    Highest Security                  Encryption: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 11 128, 192, or 256-bit
                                      encryption
                                      Authentication & Digest: Digital Signature Standard (DSS) or RSA with a key size
                                      of 2048 bits or higher and SHA with a digest size of 256 bits (SHA-256) 12
    Security and Performance          Encryption: AES 128-bit encryption
                                      Authentication & Digest: DSS or RSA with a key size of 1024 bits or higher and
                                      SHA-1
    Security and Compatibility        Encryption: Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) 13 168/112-bit encryption
                                      (note: 3DES is considerably slower than AES)
                                      Authentication & Digest: DSS with a key size of 1024 bits or higher and SHA-1
    Authentication and Tamper         Authentication & Digest: DSS with a key size of 1024 bits or higher and SHA-1 or
    Detection                         SHA-256



3.1      OpenPGP

OpenPGP is a protocol for encrypting and signing messages and for creating certificates using public key
cryptography. It is based on an earlier protocol, PGP, which was created by Phil Zimmerman and
implemented as a product first released in June 1991. The initial PGP protocol was proprietary and used
some encryption algorithms with intellectual property restrictions. In 1996, version 5.x of PGP was
defined in IETF RFC 1991, PGP Message Exchange Formats. Subsequently, OpenPGP was developed
as a new standard protocol based on PGP version 5.x. OpenPGP is defined in RFC 2440, OpenPGP
Message Format, and RFC 3156, MIME Security with OpenPGP. 14

       Federal agencies are required to use Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) approved cryptographic algorithms
       contained in validated cryptographic modules. The Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) is a joint effort
       between NIST and the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) of the Government of Canada for the validation of
       cryptographic modules against certain FIPS publications. The CMVP Web site is located at http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval/; it
       includes a complete list of FIPS-approved algorithms.

       Standard (SHS), http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-2/fips180-2withchangenotice.pdf. NIST has recommended
       that the use of SHA-1 be phased out by 2010 in favor of SHA-224 and other larger, stronger hash functions. See
