      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                              Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                                                     and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



276   Executive Summary
277   Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 [HSPD-12] established a policy for the creation,
278   issuance, and use of personal identification credentials to identify federal employees and
279   contractors securely and reliably. In response, NIST developed and published FIPS 201,
280   Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors [FIPS201], as well
281   as several NIST Special Publications (SPs) to provide additional specifications and supporting
282   information. Together, these documents provide a foundation for standardizing the processes
283   related to the adoption and use of government-wide personal identification credentials as a
284   means to verify the identities of credential holders. The implementation of PIV specifications
285   involves the collection, protection, and dissemination of personal information, which itself
286   requires privacy protection.
287   In light of the requirements for both improved security and the protection of personal privacy,
288   [HSPD-12] established four control objectives, one of which includes the call for forms of
289   identification that are “issued by providers whose reliability has been established by an official
290   accreditation process.” In response, Appendix A.1 of [FIPS201] specifies that NIST “…develop
291   a new accreditation methodology that is objective, efficient, and will result in consistent and
292   repeatable accreditation decisions…” This led to the development of SP 800-79, Guidelines for
293   the Accreditation of Personal Identity Verification Card Issuers. 1
294   This update to SP 800-79 reflects the third revision of [FIPS201], which was published in 2022.
295   It provides appropriate and useful guidelines for assessing the reliability of PIV Card issuers and
296   derived PIV credential issuers, which is of utmost importance when an organization (e.g., a
297   federal agency) is required to trust identity credentials that were created and issued by another
298   organization (i.e., another federal agency). This trust only exists if the relying organization has
299   the necessary level of assurance that the credential is established via a formal and reliable
300   authorization process.
301   This SP provides an assessment and authorization methodology for verifying that issuers are
302   adhering to the standards and implementation directives developed under [HSPD-12]. The salient
303   features of the methodology are:
304        •     Controls derived from specific requirements in [FIPS201] and relevant documents for a
305              PIV Card issuer (PCI) and a derived PIV credential issuer (DPCI)
306        •     Procedures for verifying and monitoring adherence to the requirements through an
307              assessment of the implementation of the controls (i.e., control assessment)
308        •     Guidance for evaluating the result of an assessment in order to arrive at the authorization
309              decision
310   Authorizing an issuer based on the assessment and authorization methodology in this document
311   establishes the reliability of the issuer. Authorization is the basis for establishing trust in an
312   issuer and requires that the assessment be thorough and comprehensive. Careful planning,
313   preparation, and the commitment of time, energy, and resources are required. These guidelines
314   are designed to assist the organization in creating the needed roles, assigning responsibilities,

        SP 800-37-2, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy
      [SP800-37], has deprecated the use of the term “accreditation” in favor of the term “authorization.” This is reflected in the title of the present
      revision.
