                                 Reports on Computer Systems Technology

The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical leadership for the Nation’s measurement
and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations,
and technical analyses to advance the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s
responsibilities include the development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and
guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
Federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and
outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities with industry, government, and
academic organizations.

Homeland Security Presidential Directive HSPD-12, Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal
Employees and Contractors [HSPD-12], called for Homeland Security Presidential Directive HSPD-12, Policy
for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors [HSPD-12], called for new
standards to be adopted governing interoperable use of identity credentials to allow physical and logical access
to Federal government locations and systems. The Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard for Federal
Employees and Contractors, Federal Information Processing Standard Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of
Federal Employees and Contractors (FIPS 201), was developed to define procedures and specifications for
issuance and use of an interoperable identity credential. This document, Special Publication 800-76 (SP 800-76),
is a companion document to FIPS 201. It describes technical acquisition and formatting specifications for the
PIV system, including the PIV Card itself. It also establishes minimum accuracy specifications for deployed
biometric authentication processes. The approach is to enumerate procedures and formats for collection and
preparation of fingerprint, iris and facial data, and to restrict values and practices included generically in
published biometric standards. The primary design objective behind these particular specifications is to enable
high performance and universal interoperability. The introduction of iris and face specifications into the current
edition adds alternative modalities for biometric authentication and extends coverage to persons for whom
fingerprinting is problematic. The addition of on-card comparison offers an alternative to PIN-mediated card
activation as well as an additional authentication method.
