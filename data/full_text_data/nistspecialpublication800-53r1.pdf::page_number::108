MP-6      MEDIA SANITIZATION AND DISPOSAL

          Control: The organization sanitizes information system media, both digital and non-digital, prior to
          disposal or release for reuse.
          Supplemental Guidance: Sanitization is the process used to remove information from information
          system media such that there is reasonable assurance, in proportion to the confidentiality of the
          information, that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques,
          including clearing, purging, and destroying media information, prevent the disclosure of
          organizational information to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or disposed.
          The organization uses its discretion on sanitization techniques and procedures for media
          containing information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly releasable, or deemed to
          have no adverse impact on the organization or individuals if released for reuse or disposed. NIST
          Special Publication 800-88 provides guidance on media sanitization. The National Security
          Agency also provides media sanitization guidance and maintains a listing of approved sanitization
          products at http://www.nsa.gov/ia/government/mdg.cfm.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization tracks, documents, and verifies media sanitization and disposal actions.
          (2)   The organization periodically tests sanitization equipment and procedures to verify correct
                performance.
