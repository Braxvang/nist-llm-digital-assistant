Special Publication 800-73-4          Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification – Part 1: PIV
                                   Card Application Namespace, Data Model and Representation

Card Application card commands can change the status of the Global PIN, and may change its
reference data while the PIV Card Application is the currently selected application.

Note: The rest of the document uses “PIN” to mean either the PIV Card Application PIN or the
Global PIN.

5.1.1     OCC Data

This document does not specify how the biometric reference data and comparison parameters are
stored internally on the card. Moreover, the export of the biometric reference data shall not be
allowed. Configuration data related to the biometric reference data may be read from the tag 0x7F61
BIT Group Template data object (see Section 3.3.6). Configuration data is defined in Table 7 of
[SP800-76].

5.1.2     PIV Secure Messaging Key

If the PIV Card supports secure messaging, the PIV Secure Messaging key shall be generated on the
PIV Card and the PIV Card shall not permit exportation of the PIV Secure Messaging key. The
cryptographic operations that use the PIV Secure Messaging key shall be available through the
contact and contactless interfaces of the PIV Card. The PKI cryptographic function (see Table 4b) is
under an “Always” access rule, and thus private key operations (i.e., use of the key to establish
session keys for secure messaging) can be performed without access control restrictions.

The PIV Card shall store a corresponding secure messaging CVC to support validation of the public
key by the relying party. The format for the secure messaging CVC shall be as specified in Part 2,
Section 4.1.5. The public key required to verify the digital signature of the secure messaging CVC
shall be provided in a certificate in the Secure Messaging Certificate Signer data object, as specified
in Section 3.3.7.

5.1.3     Pairing Code

If the PIV Card supports the virtual contact interface, then it shall implement support for the pairing
code. If implemented, the pairing code shall consist of eight decimal digits and it shall be generated at
random by the PIV Card Issuer. The results of each random pairing code generation shall be loaded
onto at most one PIV Card and cannot be changed by the cardholder. The pairing code value for a
PIV Card shall be stored in the Pairing Code Reference Data Container (see Section 3.3.8) on the card
and may be printed on the back of the card in an agency-specific text area (Zones 9B or 10B). PIV
Card Issuers may choose to provide the pairing code value to the cardholder in another manner, such
as printing it on a slip of paper, rather than printing it on the back of the card. 17

Unlike the PIV Card Application PIN or the Global PIN, there are no restrictions on the caching of
the pairing code by client applications. It is recommended that a client application that needs to
communicate with a PIV Card over its virtual contact interface obtain the card’s pairing code during a
registration step, either by asking the cardholder to enter the value or by reading it from the card over
the contact interface from the Pairing Code Reference Data Container, and then cache the pairing

17 While printing the value of the pairing code on the back of the card provides maximum convenience for use by the

cardholder and avoids any risk that the cardholder will forget the pairing code, it may create a risk that an attacker could
obtain the value of the pairing code by surreptitiously reading it from the back of the card. Departments and agencies will
need to make a risk-based decision in determining the method by which they provide cardholders with the values of their
pairing codes.
