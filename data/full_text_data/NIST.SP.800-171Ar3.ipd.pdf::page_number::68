2154   3.10.7. Physical Access Control
2155             REQUIREMENT: 03.10.07

2156             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
2157             Determine if:
2158             A.03.10.07.ODP[01]: the circumstances requiring visitor escorts and control of visitor
2159             activity are defined.
2160             A.03.10.07.a.01: physical access is controlled at the location where the system resides by
2161             verifying individual physical access authorizations before granting access.
2162             A.03.10.07.a.02: physical access is controlled at the location where the system resides by
2163             controlling ingress and egress with physical access control systems/devices or guards.
2164             A.03.10.07.b: physical access audit logs for entry or exit points are maintained.
2165             A.03.10.07.c[01]: visitors are escorted.
2166             A.03.10.07.c[02]: visitor activity is controlled under the following circumstances:
2167             <A.03.10.07.ODP[01]: circumstances>.
