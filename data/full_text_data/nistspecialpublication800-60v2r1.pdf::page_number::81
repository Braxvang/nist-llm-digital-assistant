Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
income information is moderate.
C.2.8.11 Representative Payee Information Information Type

Representative payee information includes the information required to determine the need for
representative payees and the data that is gathered to make the determination of who should
serve as the representative payee for all beneficiaries of federal benefits who are unable to
manage their own funds. This also includes accountability information required to provide
reasonable assurance that the funds are being used appropriately for the well being of entitled
individuals. The recommended security categorization for the representative payee information
type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is based on the effects of unauthorized disclosure of
representative payee information on the ability of the Federal government to determine that
entitlement funds are being used appropriately for the well being of entitled individuals - and to
protect individuals against identity theft and the Federal government against fraud.
Unauthorized disclosure of data for representative payee operations is likely to violate the
Privacy Act of 1974 and other regulations applicable to the dissemination of personal
information.

Unauthorized disclosure of centrally managed representative payee information can have a
serious adverse effect on agency missions and on large numbers of individuals. Therefore, in the
case of large representative payee information databases, the provisional confidentiality impact
level can be expected to be at least moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for representative payee information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific use of the payee information and not on the
time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In the case of very large
databases containing representative payee information relating to the general public, there is a
significant probability that erroneous actions will be taken affecting the benefits payments to
large numbers of individuals. This can result in at least short-term financial hardship for our
most vulnerable citizens. Loss of integrity can result in serious disruption of the agency
operations. In such cases, the integrity impact level would be at least moderate.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In the case of fraudulent diversion of
payments intended for particularly dependent individuals, there can be life-threatening
consequences. In such cases, a high integrity impact rating may be justified.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
representative payee information is moderate.
