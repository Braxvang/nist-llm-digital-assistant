                                                                                               Figure 4-2 illustrates five different examples. Other sequences of authentication mechanisms are

                                                                                               mechanisms that could be used in federal agency facility environments. Each example below is
                                                                                               labeled with a number and is described as follows:

                                                                                                   1. The PKI-CAK, SYM-CAK and BIO authentication mechanisms provide one-factor
                                                                                                      authentication and can be used to cross from Unrestricted to Controlled areas.

                                                                                                   2. The BIO-A, PKI-AUTH and OCC-AUTH authentication mechanisms provide two-factor
                                                                                                      authentication and can be used to cross into Limited areas. The example shows these
                                                                                                      authentication mechanisms to cross from Controlled to Limited areas.

                                                                                                   3. Authentication in context can be leveraged if the “Controlled, Limited, Exclusion” areas
                                                                                                      are nested. This example shows that if the BIO(-A) authentication mechanism is used to
                                                                                                      access the Limited area, then the PKI-AUTH authentication mechanism may be used to
                                                                                                      control access to the Exclusion area without requiring the cardholder to repeat the
                                                                                                      BIO(-A) authentication mechanism. Conversely, if the PKI-AUTH authentication
                                                                                                      mechanism was used to access the Limited area, then BIO-A authentication may be used
                                                                                                      to control access to the Exclusion area.
