the host processor or any other system component to bypass the authenticated update mechanism for
updating the RTU, except for the secure local update mechanism.

A modern platform includes design features that give system components direct access to the RTU or
system BIOS for performance and management improvements, such as shadowing the BIOS in RAM or
for system management mode operations. A system component may have read access to system flash
memory, but it shall not be able to directly modify the RTU unless that component serves as an extension
to the RTU or as an RTU itself.
