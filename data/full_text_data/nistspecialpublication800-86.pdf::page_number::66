GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



is placed in promiscuous mode, it accepts all incoming packets that it sees, regardless of their intended
destinations. Packet sniffers generally work by placing the NIC in promiscuous mode; the user then
configures the sniffer to capture all packets or only those with particular characteristics (e.g., certain TCP
ports, certain source or destination IP addresses). Packet sniffers are commonly used to capture a
particular type of traffic for troubleshooting or investigative purposes. For example, if IDS alerts indicate
unusual network activity between two hosts, a packet sniffer could record all of the packets traveling
between the hosts, potentially providing additional information for analysts.

Most packet sniffers are also protocol analyzers, which means that they can reassemble streams from
individual packets and decode communications that use any of hundreds or thousands of different
protocols.94 Protocol analyzers usually can process not only live network traffic but also packets that
have been recorded previously in capture files by packet sniffers. Protocol analyzers are extremely
valuable in displaying raw packet data in an understandable format. Protocol analyzers are discussed in
more depth in Section 6.4 and Section 7.

6.2.3     Intrusion Detection Systems

Network IDSs perform packet sniffing and analyze network traffic to identify suspicious activity and
record relevant information.95 Host IDSs monitor characteristics of a particular system and events
occurring within the system, which can include network traffic.96 Unlike network IDS sensors, which can
monitor all network traffic on a particular network segment, host IDS software is intended to monitor
network traffic only for the host on which it is installed.97 For each suspicious event, IDS software
typically records the same basic event characteristics that firewalls and routers record (e.g., date and time,
source and destination IP addresses, protocol, basic protocol characteristics), as well as application-
specific information (e.g., username, filename, command, status code). IDS software also records
information that indicates the possible intent of the activity. Examples include the type of attack (e.g.,
buffer overflow), the targeted vulnerability, the apparent success or failure of the attack, and pointers to
more information about the attack.98

Some IDSs can be configured to capture packets related to suspicious activity. This can range from
recording only the packet that triggered the IDS to label the activity suspicious, to recording the rest of
the session. Some IDSs even have the ability to store all sessions for a short period of time so that if
something suspicious is detected, the previous activity in the same session can be preserved. The packets

     Examples of open source packet sniffer and protocol analyzer software for wired networks include Ethereal
     (http://www.ethereal.com/), TCPDump (http://www.tcpdump.org/), and WinDump (http://www.winpcap.org/windump/).
     Open source software is also available for wireless networks, including Ethereal and Kismet
     (http://www.kismetwireless.net/). Additional packet sniffer and protocol analyzer software products are listed on various
     Web sites, including the Talisker Security Wizardry Portal (http://www.networkintrusion.co.uk/protanalyzers.htm),
     Softpedia (http://www.softpedia.com/get/Network-Tools/Protocol-Analyzers-Sniffers/), Packet Storm
     (http://packetstormsecurity.org/defense/sniff/), and other Web sites listed in Appendix F.

     Some network IDSs allow administrators to identify misuse as well as attacks. For example, an administrator (with proper
     approval) could configure the IDS with character strings of interest, such as an acronym or phrase associated with a sensitive
     project. The IDS could then search network traffic for file transfers, e-mails, and other forms of communication that used
     one of those character strings.

     Many IDS vendors provide help files that contain detailed information about each type of activity. IDS vendors also
     typically provide pointers to external sources of information, such as CERTÂ®/CC advisories, Common Vulnerabilities and
     Exposures (CVE) numbers, and software vendor vulnerability announcements.
