                                                  CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



Personnel with outage assessment responsibilities should understand and be able to perform these
procedures in the event the plan is inaccessible during the situation. Once impact to the system has been
determined, the appropriate teams should be notified of updated information and the planned response to
the situation. Based upon the results of the outage assessment, ISCP notifications may be revisited and
expanded using the procedures described in Section 4.2.2.

4.3       Recovery Phase

Formal recovery operations begin after the ISCP has been activated, outage assessments have been
completed (if possible), personnel have been notified, and appropriate teams have been mobilized.
Recovery Phase activities focus on implementing recovery strategies to restore system capabilities, repair
damage, and resume operational capabilities at the original or new alternate location. At the completion
of the Recovery Phase, the information system will be functional and capable of performing the functions
identified in the plan. Depending on the recovery strategies defined in the plan, these functions could
include temporary manual processing, recovery and operation at an alternate system, or relocation and
recovery at an alternate site. It is feasible that only system resources identified as high priority in the BIA
will be recovered at this stage.

4.3.1     Sequence of Recovery Activities

When recovering a complex system, such as a wide area network (WAN) or virtual local area network
(VLAN) involving multiple independent components, recovery procedures should reflect system
priorities identified in the BIA. The sequence of activities should reflect the system’s MTD to avoid
significant impacts to related systems. Procedures should be written in a stepwise, sequential format so
system components may be restored in a logical manner. For example, if a LAN is being recovered after
a disruption, then the most critical servers should be recovered before other, less critical devices, such as
printers. Similarly, to recover an application server, procedures first should address operating system
restoration and verification before the application and its data are recovered. The procedures should also
include escalation steps and instructions to coordinate with other teams where relevant when certain
situations occur, such as:

         An action is not completed within the expected time frame;
         A key step has been completed;
         Item(s) must be procured; and
         Other system-specific concerns exist.

If conditions require the system to be recovered at an alternate site, certain materials will need to be
transferred or procured. These items may include shipment of data backup media from offsite storage,
hardware, copies of the recovery plan, and software programs. Procedures should designate the
appropriate team or team members to coordinate shipment of equipment, data, and vital records.
References to applicable appendices, such as equipment lists or vendor contact information, should be
made in the plan where necessary. Procedures should clearly describe requirements to package, transport,
and purchase materials required to recover the system.

4.3.2     Recovery Procedures

To facilitate Recovery Phase operations, the ISCP should provide detailed procedures to restore the
information system or components to a known state. Given the extensive variety of system types,
configurations, and applications, this planning guide does not provide specific recovery procedures.
Recovery considerations are detailed for each of the platform types in Chapter 5.
