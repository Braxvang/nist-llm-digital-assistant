SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


FR:3.4 The CKMS design shall specify the COTS products used in the CKMS.

FR:3.5 The CKMS design shall specify which security functions are performed by COTS
products.

FR:3.6 The CKMS design shall specify how COTS products are configured and augmented
to meet the CKMS goal.

3.3    Conformance to Standards

An FCKMS that conforms to widely accepted security standards often increases confidence
in its ability to provide the desired protection, since it benefits from the wisdom that went
into developing the standards. If the standards have validation programs that measure
compliance and those validations are obtained, there is increased confidence that the FCKMS
has implemented that standard correctly. The use of standards also fosters interoperability
when different FCKMSs need to interoperate.

FR:3.7 The CKMS design shall specify the Federal, national, and international standards
that are utilized by the CKMS.

FR:3.8 For each standard utilized by the CKMS, the CKMS design shall specify which
CKMS devices implement the standard.

FR:3.9 For each standard utilized by the CKMS, the CKMS design shall specify how
conformance to the standard was validated (e.g., by a third-party testing program).

                SC-13       A Federal CKMS shall specify the Federal Information
PR:3.1
                            Processing Standards (FIPS) and NIST Special Publications
                            (SPs) to which the FCKMS or FCKMS devices have been
                            validated.

                            A Federal CKMS could conform to selected specifications of
PF:3.1
                            Industrial, National, and International standards for security
                            and interoperability of the FCKMS.

3.4    Ease-of-use

Ease-of-use is very subjective. Something easy for one person to do may not be easy for
another. An FCKMS should be easy to use by both untrained and experienced users. For
example, the FCKMS could assist untrained users by performing the required actions
automatically, but provide an interface for experienced users to select and use acceptable
alternative actions. Negative user experiences could affect the acceptability and use of a
security service or product. A Federal CKMS should be designed to support a range of user
expertise and experience.

Ease-of-use testing is discussed in Section 9.8.
