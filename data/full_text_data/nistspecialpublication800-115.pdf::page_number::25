different ones. Once a wired rogue device is identified, 12 it can be located by using existing network
maps and information already collected on the device’s network activity to identify the switch to which it
is connected. It may be necessary to generate additional network activity with the rogue device—such as
pings—to find the correct switch. The next step is to identify the switch port on the switch associated
with the rogue device, and to physically trace the cable connecting that switch port to the rogue device.

A number of tools exist for use in network discovery, and it should be noted that many active discovery
tools can be used for passive network sniffing and port scanning as well. Most offer a graphical user
interface (GUI), and some also offer a command-line interface. Command-line interfaces may take
longer to learn than GUIs because of the number of commands and switches that specify what tests the
tool should perform and which an assessor must learn to use the tool effectively. Also, developers have
written a number of modules for open source tools that allow assessors to easily parse tool output. For
example, combining a tool’s Extensible Markup Language (XML) output capabilities, a little scripting,
and a database creates a more powerful tool that can monitor the network for unauthorized services and
machines. Learning what the many commands do and how to combine them is best achieved with the
help of an experienced security engineer. Most experienced IT professionals, including system
administrators and other network engineers, should be able to interpret results, but working with the
discovery tools themselves is more efficiently handled by an engineer.

Some of the advantages of active discovery, as compared to passive discovery, are that an assessment can
be conducted from a different network and usually requires little time to gather information. In passive
discovery, ensuring that all hosts are captured requires traffic to hit all points, which can be time-
consuming—especially in larger enterprise networks.

A disadvantage to active discovery is that it tends to generate network noise, which sometimes results in
network latency. Since active discovery sends out queries to receive responses, this additional network
activity could slow down traffic or cause packets to be dropped in poorly configured networks if
performed at high volume. Active discovery can also trigger IDS alerts, since unlike passive discovery it
reveals its origination point. The ability to successfully discover all network systems can be affected by
environments with protected network segments and perimeter security devices and techniques. For
example, an environment using network address translation (NAT)—which allows organizations to have
internal, non-publicly routed IP addresses that are translated to a different set of public IP addresses for
external traffic—may not be accurately discovered from points external to the network or from protected
segments. Personal and host-based firewalls on target devices may also block discovery traffic.
Misinformation may be received as a result of trying to instigate activity from devices. Active discovery
presents information from which conclusions must be drawn about settings on the target network.

For both passive and active discovery, the information received is seldom completely accurate. To
illustrate, only hosts that are on and connected during active discovery will be identified—if systems or a
segment of the network are offline during the assessment, there is potential for a large gap in discovering
devices. Although passive discovery will only find devices that transmit or receive communications
during the discovery period, products such as network management software can provide continuous
discovery capabilities and automatically generate alerts when a new device is present on the network.
Continuous discovery can scan IP address ranges for new addresses or monitor new IP address requests.
Also, many discovery tools can be scheduled to run regularly, such as once every set amount of days at a
particular time. This provides more accurate results than running these tools sporadically.
