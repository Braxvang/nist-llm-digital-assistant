G.3.          Polynomial and Normal Bases for Binary Fields

G.3.1. Normal Bases
The elements of GF(2m), where m is odd, are expressed in terms of the type T normal 2 basis B for
GF(2m) for some T. Each element has a unique representation as a bit string:

                                                                 (a0 a1 … am–1).
The arithmetic operations are performed as follows:
Addition: Addition of two elements is implemented by bit-wise addition modulo 2. Thus, for
example,
                                                 (1100111) + (1010010) = (0110101).
Squaring: If
                                                           α = (a0 a1 … am–2 am–1),
then
                                                           α2 = (am–1 a0 a1 … am–2).
Multiplication: Multiplication depends on the following function F(u,v) on inputs:
                                  u = (u0 u1 … um–1)                              and        v = (v0 v1 … vm–1),
which is constructed as follows.
        1. Set p = Tm + 1.
        2. Let u be an integer having order T modulo p.
        3. Compute the sequence F (1), F (2), … , F (p–1) as follows:
               a. Set w = 1.
               b. For j from 0 to T–1, do:
                    i. Set n = w.
                   ii. For i = 0 to m–1, do:
                             1. Set F(n) = i.
                             2. Set n = 2n mod p.
                  iii. Set w = uw mod p.
        4. Output the formulae F(u, v), where

    It is assumed in this section that m is odd and T is even since this is the only case considered in this standard.
