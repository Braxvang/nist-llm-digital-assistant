difficult for novices to develop secure programs. For example, the register_globals option, used to
convert all input parameters into PHP variables, may allow user input to override values in the PHP
script, if not handled appropriately [Clo01].

4.3   Risk Summary

This section presented the technology-based risks associated with active content and mobile code. Any
technology that allows untrusted code to execute on a system may introduce risks. In particular, all
software contains defects, some of which may be exploitable vulnerabilitiesâ€”potentially allowing an
attacker to run arbitrary code on the machine. As such, there are two main factors to consider when
determining the risk associated with active content: the capabilities of the programming language and the
security controls provided by the execution environment. Nevertheless, in many situations, it may be
necessary to deploy an active content technology regardless of the risk determination, such as when a
critical system requires JavaScript or PDF support, taking appropriate caution.

As both the consumer and producer sides of the Web model increasingly support and require active
content, it becomes ever more important for organizations to be aware of and address the risks they may
be facing. The next section, Section 5, covers some of the safeguards that can be put in place to mitigate
many of these risks.
