A.5 Determination of an interoperable group
The testing laboratory shall compute the detection error tradeoff characteristic (DET) for all pair wise combinations of
the template generators and template matchers. The testing laboratory shall generate a rectangular interoperability
matrix (see [PERFSWAP]). The matrix has rows corresponding to the generators and columns corresponding to the
matchers. Each element of the interoperability matrix shall be the false reject rate at a fixed false accept rate. This
value corresponds to one operating point on the DET. As described in Annex A.3, the DET automatically includes the
effect of failure to enroll and acquire.
An interoperable group of template generators and matchers shall be established as the largest subgroup of products
submitted in an initial certification round for which all elements of the interoperability sub-matrix (i.e., FRR values)
are less than or equal to 0.01 at a fixed 0.01 FAR operating point. The condition that all pair wise product
combinations should be below this threshold is instituted because the PIV application is intolerant of non-
interoperable pairs.

A.6 The MINEX Program
NIST's Minutia Exchange program supports interoperable standardized-minutia based biometric authentication. An
overview appears in Figure 6.
