                            GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



personnel when investigating incidents. All access to the log occurs only from the organization‘s own
systems.

Taking into account these factors, the organization determines that a breach of the log‘s confidentiality
would likely cause little or no harm, and it chooses to assign the PII confidentiality impact level of low.

3.3.3   Example 3: Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Reporting Application

A database contains web form submissions by individuals claiming possible fraud, waste, or abuse of
organizational resources and authority. Some of the submissions include serious allegations, such as
accusing individuals of accepting bribes or not enforcing safety regulations. The submission of contact
information is not prohibited, and individuals often enter their personal information in the form‘s
narrative text field. The web site is hosted by a server that logs IP address and referring web site
information.

Identifiability: By default, the database does not request PII, but a significant percentage of users choose
to provide PII. The web log contains IP addresses, which could be identifiable. However, the log
information is not linked or readily linkable with the database or other sources to identify specific
individuals.

Quantity of PII: A recent estimate indicated that the database has approximately 50 records with PII out
of nearly 1000 total records.

Data field sensitivity: The database‘s narrative text field contains user-supplied text and frequently
includes information such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone numbers.

Context of use: Because of the nature of the submissions (i.e., reporting claims of fraud, waste, or
abuse), the disclosure of individuals‘ identities would likely cause some of the individuals making the
claims to fear retribution by management and peers. Additionally, it could negatively impact individuals
about whom accusations are made. The ensuing harm could include blackmail, severe emotional distress,
loss of employment, and physical harm. A breach would also undermine employee and public trust in the
organization.

Access to and location of PII: The database is only accessed by a few people who investigate fraud,
waste, and abuse claims. All access to the database occurs only from the organization‘s internal systems.

Taking into account these factors, the organization determines that a breach of the database‘s
confidentiality would likely cause catastrophic harm to some of the individuals and chooses to assign the
PII confidentiality impact level of high.
