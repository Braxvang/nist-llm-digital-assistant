                                                                          GUIDELINES ON ACTIVE CONTENT AND MOBILE CODE



1.      Introduction

1.1     Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency
Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2     Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of active content and mobile code technologies in
use today and offer insights for making informed IT security decisions on their application and treatment.
The discussion gives details about the threats, technology risks, and safeguards for end user systems, such
as desktops and laptops. Although various end user applications, such as email clients, can involve active
content, Web browsers remain the primary vehicle for delivery and are underscored in the discussion.
The tenets presented for Web browsers apply equally well to other end user applications and can be
inferred directly.

This document may be used by organizations interested in enhancing security for existing and future use
of active content to reduce related security incidents. This document presents generic principles that
apply to all systems.

This guideline does not cover the following aspects relating to securing active content:

 General security considerations related to Web servers and browsers 1
 Secure Web application development.
1.3     Audience

The intended audience for this document includes the following:

 Users of desktops, laptops, and other end user systems
