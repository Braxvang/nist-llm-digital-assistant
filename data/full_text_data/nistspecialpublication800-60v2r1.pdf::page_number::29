provided under the sub-heading “Special Factors Affecting [Security Objective] Impact
Determination.”

Appendices C.2 and C.3 identify information elements and contexts that may result in variances
from the basic impact level assignment. For example, some systems process information the
compromise of which affect national security, critical infrastructures, or key national assets.
Impacts associated with such systems are either outside the scope of this document (i.e., national
security information) or may need to be adjusted upward based on the more severe consequences
of compromises.

Many of the information types are also lifecycle-dependent. That is, information that requires
protection at one stage in system development or operational use of the information is publicly
accessible at a later stage or following some event. For example, information that has
confidentiality attributes during the period that an agency is using it to make a decision may be
public knowledge once the decision has been made (e.g., financial/budgetary information used
during development of requests for proposals in procurement actions).

    The confidentiality impact assigned to the Program Monitoring Information Type may necessitate the highest
    confidentiality impact of the information types processed by the system.
