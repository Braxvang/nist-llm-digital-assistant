data that are encrypted with a weak key, organizations must utilize administrative controls
to ensure that keys are both unpredictable and suitably protected.
Because encryption may be reversed and both approaches may be the subject of a success-
ful brute force attack, the use of encryption or hashing to protect direct identifers is not
recommended [66, 154].

4.3.3.   De-Identifying Numeric Quasi-Identifers
Once a determination is made regarding quasi-identifers, they should be transformed. A
variety of techniques are available to transform quasi-identifers:
    • Top and bottom coding. Outlier values that are above or below certain values are
      coded appropriately. For example, the Safe Harbor method under the HIPAA Privacy
      Rule calls for ages over 89 to be “aggregated into a single category of age 90 or
      older” [162, § 164.514 (b)(2)].
    • Micro aggregation. Individual microdata are combined into small groups that pre-
      serve data analysis capabilities while providing for some disclosure protection.
    • Generalize categories with small counts. When preparing contingency tables, sev-
      eral categories with small values may be combined. For example, rather than re-
      porting that there are two people with blue eyes, one person with green eyes, and one
      person with hazel eyes, it may be reported that there are four people with blue, green,
      or hazel eyes.
    • Data suppression. Cells in contingency tables with counts lower than a predefned
      threshold can be suppressed to prevent the identifcation of attribute combinations
      with small numbers [171].
    • Blanking and imputing. Specifc values that are highly identifying can be removed
      and replaced with imputed values.
    • Attribute or record swapping. Attributes or data values are swapped within a set of
      similar records. For example, data that represent families in two similar towns within
      a county might be swapped. “Swapping has the additional quality of removing any
      100-percent assurance that a given record belongs to a given household” [160, p.
      31] while preserving the accuracy of regional statistics, such as sums and averages.
      In this case, the average number of children per family in the county would be un-
      affected by data swapping. However, swapping may damage or destroy important
      relationships within the data and introduce systematic biases, depending on how the
      swapping candidates are selected, so it must be performed carefully to avoid these
      issues.
    • Noise addition. Also called “noise infusion,” and “noise injection” (and occasion-
      ally “partially synthetic data”), this approach adds small random values to attributes.
