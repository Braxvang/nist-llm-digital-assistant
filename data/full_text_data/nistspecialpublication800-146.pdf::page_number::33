                                                            CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



As depicted in Figure 8, a hybrid cloud can be extremely complex. However many less complex and
highly useful hybrid cloud configurations are possible. For example, "cloud bursting" is an often-
discussed concept in which a consumer uses a private cloud for routine workloads, but optionally accesses
one or more external clouds during periods of high demand. Using one type of cloud to provide backup
resources to another [SNI09] is another hybrid possibility as well as using one cloud for disaster recovery
[SNI09] for a second. For new software developed specifically to run on cloud platforms (e.g., [Msf11-2,
Goo11, Sal11]), multi-cloud configurations are possible and even likely. For example, Web request
handling platform clouds (see Section 6) can be very efficient for making Web applications continuously
available at low cost while on-site or community infrastructure clouds may be more suitable for
performing necessary background work to support the applications. Different cloud deployment variants
may also be appropriate for particular organizational functions or roles; for example, an organization may
elect to process sensitive data such as payroll information in an outsourced private cloud but use a public
cloud for new software development and testing activities.
