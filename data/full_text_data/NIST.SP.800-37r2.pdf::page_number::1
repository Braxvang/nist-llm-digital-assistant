                   A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy




This publication contains comprehensive updates to the                              JOINT TASK FORCE
Risk Management Framework. The updates include an
alignment with the constructs in the NIST Cybersecurity
Framework; the integration of privacy risk management
processes; an alignment with system life cycle security
engineering processes; and the incorporation of supply
chain risk management processes. Organizations can
use the frameworks and processes in a complementary
manner within the RMF to effectively manage security
and privacy risks to organizational operations and
assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.    This publication is available free of charge from:
Revision 2 includes a set of organization-wide RMF tasks           https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-37r2
that are designed to prepare information system owners
to conduct system-level risk management activities. The
intent is to increase the effectiveness, efficiency, and
cost-effectiveness of the RMF by establishing a closer
connection to the organizationâ€™s missions and business
functions and improving the communications among
senior leaders, managers, and operational personnel.
