   2. Developing the awareness and training material; and
   3. Implementing the program.
   Even a small amount of information security awareness and training can go a
long way toward improving the security posture of, and vigilance within, an
organization.

4.3.1   Designing an Awareness and Training Program
    Awareness and training programs must be designed with the mission of the
agency in mind. The awareness and training program must support the business
needs of the organization and be relevant to the organization’s culture and
information technology architecture. The most successful programs are those that
users feel are relevant to the subject matter and issues presented.
   Designing an information security awareness and training program answers the
question “What is our plan for developing and implementing awareness and training
opportunities that are compliant with existing directives?” In the design step of the
program, the agency’s awareness and training needs are identified, an effective
agency-wide awareness and training plan is developed, organizational buy-in is
sought and secured, and priorities are established.

4.3.2   Developing an Awareness and Training Program
   Once the awareness and training program has been designed, supporting
material can be developed. Material should be developed with the following in mind:
   • “What behavior do we want to reinforce?” (awareness)
   • “What skill or skills do we want the audience to learn and apply?” (training and
     education).
    In both cases, the focus should be on specific material that the participants
should integrate into their jobs. Attendees will pay attention and incorporate what
they see or hear in a session if they feel that the material was developed specifically
for them. Any presentation that feels so impersonal and general that it could be
given to any audience, will be filed away as just another of the annual “we’re here
because we have to be here” sessions. An awareness and training program can be
effective, however, if the material is interesting, current, and relevant.
    The awareness audience must include all users in an organization. Users may
include employees, contractors, foreign or domestic guest researchers, other agency
personnel, visitors, guests, and other collaborators or associates requiring access.
The message to be spread through an awareness program, or campaign, should
make all individuals aware of their commonly shared information security
responsibilities.
   On the other hand, the message in a training class is directed at a specific
audience. The message in training material should include everything related to
security that attendees need to know in order to perform their jobs. Training
material is usually far more in-depth than material used in an awareness session or
campaign.

4.3.3   Implementing an Awareness and Training Program
   An information security awareness and training program should be implemented
only after a needs assessment has been conducted, a strategy has been developed,
