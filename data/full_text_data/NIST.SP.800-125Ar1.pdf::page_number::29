NIST SP 800-125A REV. 1                                                      SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
                                                                         SERVER-BASED HYPERVISOR PLATFORMS

management VM or directly in the hypervisor kernel through a kernel module. The virtual network is a software-
defined artifact that resides entirely within the virtualized host and has the VMs residing inside it as its nodes.
The components of this virtual network are (a) the virtual network interface cards (vNICs) that are defined
for each VM and provide connection for each VM to the virtual network; (b) the virtual switches that provide
selective connectivity among VMs and whose configuration determines the topology of the virtual network;
and (c) the physical network interface cards (pNICs) of the virtualized hosts that provide connectivity for
VMs to the enterprise network.

While considering the security impact of the virtual network, the following three main functions must be
considered:

 •   Providing selective connectivity or isolation between groups of VMs belonging to different logical
     groupings (e.g., different tenants in the case of an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud service;
     different application tiers such as Web Server or Database Server; or different Line of Business
     applications of an enterprise)
 •   Dedicating subnets for key functions such as (a) migration of VMs from one hypervisor host to
     another for security or performance reasons, (b) attaching network-based storage devices, and (c)
     fault Tolerant Logging
 •   Providing access to the management interface in the management VM (a node of the virtual
     network), which is used for performing key hypervisor baseline functions of VM lifecycle
     management (HY-BF4) and Management of hypervisor platform (HY-BF5)

Out of the three functionalities stated above, selective connectivity and isolation between groups of VMs is
required for providing security to the applications running on those VMs and therefore outside of the scope of
this document. The same criteria apply to dedicating subnets for network-based storage administration. We
have already discussed secure VM migration under VM lifecycle management in section 6. Hence, our focus
on virtual network configuration is limited to providing protection for the network interfaces used for
performing VM management and hypervisor administrative functions. A commonly adopted approach is to
allocate a dedicated physical network interface card (NIC) for handling management traffic, and, if that is not
feasible, a virtual network segment (vLAN ID) exclusively for it.

Security Recommendation HY-SR-20: Protection for hypervisor host and software administration
functions should be ensured by allocating a dedicated physical NIC or, if that is not feasible, placing the
management interface of the hypervisor in a dedicated virtual network segment and enforcing traffic
controls using a firewall (e.g., designating the subnets in the enterprise network from which incoming
traffic into the management interface is allowed).
