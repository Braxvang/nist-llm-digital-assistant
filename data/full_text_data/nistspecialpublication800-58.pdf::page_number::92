NIST SP 800-58                                              Voice Over IP Security
_____________________________________________________________________________

        unnecessary or unknown network entities is the first step to overcoming this
        problem. However, there is still the opportunity for an attacker to spoof his MAC
        and IP address, circumventing the firewall protection.

Default Password Vulnerability

        It is common for switches to have a default login/password set, e.g.,
        admin/admin, or root /root. Similarly, VOIP telephones often have default
        keypad sequences that can be used to unlock and modify network information

        This vulnerability would allow an attacker to control the topology of the network
        remotely, allowing for not only complete denial of service to the network, but
        also a port mirroring attack to the attackerâ€™s location, giving the ability to
        intercept any other conversations taking place over the same switch. Further, the
        switch may have a web server interface, providing an attacker with the ability to
        disrupt the network without advance knowledge of switch operations and
        commands. In most systems, telephones download their configuration data on
        startup using TFTP or similar protocols. The configuration specifies the IP
        addresses for Call Manager nodes, so an attacker could substitute another IP
        address pointing to a call manager that would allow eavesdropping or traffic
        analysis. Changing the default password is crucial. Moreover, the graphical
        user interface should be disabled to prevent the interception of plaintext
        administration sessions.

Exploitable software flaws

        Like other types of software, VOIP systems have been found to have vulnerabilities
        due to buffer overflows and improper packet header handling. These flaws typically
        occur because the software is not validating critical information properly. For
        example, a short integer may be used as a table index without checking whether the
        parameter passed to the function exceeds 32,767, resulting in invalid memory
        accesses or crashing of the system.

        Exploitable software flaws typically result in two types of vulnerabilities: denial of
        service or revelation of critical system parameters. Denial of service can often be
        implemented remotely, by passing packets with specially constructed headers that
        cause the software to fail. In some cases the system can be crashed, producing a
        memory dump in which an intruder can find IP addresses of critical system nodes,
        passwords, or other security-relevant information. In addition, buffer overflows that
        allow the introduction of malicious code have been found in VOIP software, as in
        other applications.

        These problems require action from the software vendor, and distribution of patches
        to administrators. Intruders monitor announcements of vulnerabilities, knowing that
        many organizations require days or weeks to update their software. Regular checking
        for software updates and patches is essential to reducing these vulnerabilities.
