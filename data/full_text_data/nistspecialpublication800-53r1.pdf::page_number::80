CA-4      SECURITY CERTIFICATION

          Control: The organization conducts an assessment of the security controls in the information
          system to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as
          intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for
          the system.
          Supplemental Guidance: A security certification is conducted by the organization in support of the
          OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III requirement for accrediting the information system. The
          security certification is a key factor in all security accreditation (i.e., authorization) decisions and
          is integrated into and spans the system development life cycle. The organization assesses all
          security controls in an information system during the initial security accreditation. Subsequent to
          the initial accreditation and in accordance with OMB policy, the organization assesses a subset of
          the controls annually during continuous monitoring (see CA-7). The organization can use the
          current yearâ€™s assessment results obtained during security certification to meet the annual FISMA
          assessment requirement (see CA-2). NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on
          security control assessments. NIST Special Publication 800-37 provides guidance on security
          certification and accreditation. Related security controls: CA-2, CA-6, SA-11.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs an independent certification agent or certification team to conduct an
                assessment of the security controls in the information system.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: An independent certification agent or certification team is
                any individual or group capable of conducting an impartial assessment of an organizational
                information system. Impartiality implies that the assessors are free from any perceived or
                actual conflicts of interest with respect to the developmental, operational, and/or management
                chain of command associated with the information system or to the determination of security
                control effectiveness. Independent security certification services can be obtained from other
                elements within the organization or can be contracted to a public or private sector entity
                outside of the organization. Contracted certification services are considered independent if
                the information system owner is not directly involved in the contracting process or cannot
                unduly influence the independence of the certification agent or certification team conducting
                the assessment of the security controls in the information system. The authorizing official
                decides on the required level of certifier independence based on the criticality and sensitivity
                of the information system and the ultimate risk to organizational operations and
                organizational assets, and to individuals. The authorizing official determines if the level of
                certifier independence is sufficient to provide confidence that the assessment results produced
                are sound and can be used to make a credible, risk-based decision. In special situations, for
                example when the organization that owns the information system is small or the
                organizational structure requires that the assessment of the security controls be accomplished
                by individuals that are in the developmental, operational, and/or management chain of the
                system owner or authorizing official, independence in the certification process can be
                achieved by ensuring the assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by an
                independent team of experts to validate the completeness, consistency, and veracity of the
                results. The authorizing official should consult with the Office of the Inspector General, the
                senior agency information security officer, and the chief information officer to fully discuss
                the implications of any decisions on certifier independence in the types of special
                circumstances described above.
