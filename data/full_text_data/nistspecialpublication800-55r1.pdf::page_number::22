documented and implemented, the ability to reliably collect the outcome of their implementation
improves. As an organization’s information security program evolves and performance data
becomes more readily available, measures will focus on program effectiveness/efficiency and the
operational results of security control implementation. Once information security is integrated
into an organization’s processes, the processes become repeatable, measurement data collection
becomes fully automated, and the mission or business impact of information security-related
actions and events can be determined by analyzing and correlating the measurement data.
Appendix A contains examples of implementation, effectiveness/efficiency, and impact
measures.

3.3.1   Implementation Measures

Implementation measures are used to demonstrate progress in implementing information security
programs, specific security controls, and associated policies and procedures. Examples of
implementation measures related to information security programs include the percentage of
information systems with approved system security plans and the percentage of information
systems with password policies configured as required. At first, the results of these measures
might be less than 100 percent. However, as the information security program and its associated
policies and procedures mature, results should reach and remain at 100 percent. At this point, the
organization should begin to focus its measurement efforts on effectiveness/efficiency and
impact measures.

Implementation measures can also examine system-level areas—for example, the percentage of
servers within a system with a standard configuration. At first, the results of this system-level
measure will likely be less than 100 percent. When the implementation measure results reach and
remain at 100 percent, it can be concluded that the information systems have fully implemented
the security controls addressed by this measure, and measurement activities can refocus on other
controls in need of improvement. After most implementation measures reach and remain at 100
percent, the organization should begin to focus its measurement efforts on
effectiveness/efficiency and impact measures. Organizations should never fully retire
implementation measures because they are effective at pointing out specific security controls that
are in need of improvement; however, as an organization matures, the emphasis and resources of
the measurement program should shift away from implementation and towards
effectiveness/efficiency and impact measures.

Implementation measures require data that can be easily obtained from information security
assessment reports, quarterly and annual FISMA reports, plans of action and milestones
(POA&M), and other commonly used means of documenting and tracking information security
program activities.

3.3.2   Effectiveness/Efficiency Measures

Effectiveness/efficiency measures are used to monitor if program-level processes and system-
level security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and meeting the desired
outcome. These measures concentrate on the evidence and results of assessments and may
require multiple data points quantifying the degree to which information security controls are
