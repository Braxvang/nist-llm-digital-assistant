              and their ability to account for all of the security requirements and constraints associated
              with the delivery, utilization, and sustainment of the service or capability being leased.
          IP-2.2 Place the system element in a secure state for future use, as needed.
          Note: This includes protection of the element while stored and in transit, as well as the
          packaging and labeling of the element.
          IP-2.3 Record objective evidence that system elements meet the system security
                 requirements.

IP-3      MANAGE RESULTS OF IMPLEMENTATION
          IP-3.1 Record the security aspects of implementation results and any anomalies encountered.
          IP-3.2 Maintain traceability of the security aspects of implemented system elements.
          Note: Bidirectional traceability of the security aspects of the implemented system elements to
          the system security requirements, the security views of the architecture, the security design,
          and the security interface requirements is maintained.
          IP-3.3 Provide the security-relevant artifacts that have been selected for baselines.

H.8.      Integration
The purpose of the Integration process is to synthesize a set of system elements into a realized
system that satisfies the system requirements.

H.8.1. Security Purpose
-      Synthesize a set of system elements into a realized trustworthy secure system that satisfies
       the system requirements.

H.8.2. Security Outcomes
-      Security-relevant integration constraints that influence requirements, architecture, design, or
       interfaces and interactions are identified.
-      Approaches and checkpoints for the correct secure activation of the identified interfaces and
       system functions to an initial or established secure state are developed.
-      Enabling systems or services for the security aspects of integration are available.
-      A trustworthy secure system composed of implemented system elements is integrated.
-      Security aspects of system external interfaces (system to external environment) and system
       internal interfaces (between implemented system elements) are checked.
-      Security aspects of integration results and anomalies are identified.
