NIST SP 800-58                                             Voice Over IP Security
    _________________________________________________________________________


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

      Voice over IP – the transmission of voice over packet-switched IP networks – is
      one of the most important emerging trends in telecommunications. As with many
      new technologies, VOIP introduces both security risks and opportunities. VOIP
      has a very different architecture than traditional circuit-based telephony, and these
      differences result in significant security issues. Lower cost and greater flexibility
      are among the promises of VOIP for the enterprise, but VOIP should not be
      installed without careful consideration of the security problems introduced.
      Administrators may mistakenly assume that since digitized voice travels in
      packets, they can simply plug VOIP components into their already-secured
      networks and remain secure. However, the process is not that simple. This
      publication explains the challenges of VOIP security for agency and commercial
      users of VOIP, and outlines steps needed to help secure an organization’s VOIP
      network. VOIP security considerations for the public switched telephone network
      (PSTN) are largely outside the scope of this document.

      VOIP systems take a wide variety of forms, including traditional telephone
      handsets, conferencing units, and mobile units. In addition to end-user
      equipment, VOIP systems include a variety of other components, including call
      processors/call managers, gateways, routers, firewalls, and protocols. Most of
      these components have counterparts used in data networks, but the performance
      demands of VOIP mean that ordinary network software and hardware must be
      supplemented with special VOIP components. Not only does VOIP require
      higher performance than most data systems, critical services, such as Emergency
      911 must be accommodated. One of the main sources of confusion for those new
      to VOIP is the (natural) assumption that because digitized voice travels in packets
      just like other data, existing network architectures and tools can be used without
      change. However, VOIP adds a number of complications to existing network
      technology, and these problems are magnified by security considerations.

      Quality of Service (QoS) is fundamental to the operation of a VOIP network that
      meets users’ quality expectations. However, the implementation of various
      security measures can cause a marked deterioration in QoS. These complications
      range from firewalls delaying or blocking call setups to encryption-produced
      latency and delay variation (jitter). Because of the time-critical nature of VOIP,
      and its low tolerance for disruption and packet loss, many security measures
      implemented in traditional data networks are simply not applicable to VOIP in
      their current form; firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other components
      must be specialized for VOIP. Current VOIP systems use either a proprietary
      protocol, or one of two standards, H.323 and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).
      Although SIP seems to be gaining in popularity, neither of these protocols has
      become dominant in the market yet, so it often makes sense to incorporate
      components that can support both. In addition to SIP and H.323 there are also two
      further standards, media gateway control protocol (MGCP) and Megaco/H.248,
