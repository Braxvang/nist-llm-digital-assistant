Information Technology Security Training Requirements


Team teaching, if that is an option, can leverage individual instructor's respective skills in this
regard. In any case, the involvement of adult students as resources can help overcome potential
problems associated with classes composed of workforce students with differing levels of
subject-matter knowledge. Otherwise, instructors who rely on giving a lecture of the material
risk finding themselves over the heads of beginners, while boring or talking down to students
who are at more advanced levels.

Finally, adult students, more so than their younger counterparts, learn best when they perceive
the relevance of the knowledge or skill to their current job or to their career advancement.
When the instructor is able to emphasize the applicability and practical purpose of the material to
be mastered, as distinguished from abstract or conceptual learning, the learning retention rates
and the subsequent transference of the new knowledge or skill to the students' jobs and
organizational settings will be enhanced.
