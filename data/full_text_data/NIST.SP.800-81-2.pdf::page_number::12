SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



        Internet access service to the enterprise’s users), resulting in a denial of service to the resources
        serviced by it

    •   Violation of the integrity of DNS information resident on its authoritative source or the
        information cache of an intermediary that has accumulated information from several historical
        queries may break the chained information retrieval process of DNS. This could result in either a
        denial of service for DNS name resolution function or misdirection of users to a harmful set of
        illegitimate resources.

    •   If the name resolution data hosted by the DNS system violates content requirements as defined in
        DNS standards, it could have adverse impacts such as increased workload on the DNS system, or
        serving obsolete data that could result in denial of service to Internet resources. In most software,
        program data independence (as in conventional Database Management Systems (DBMS))
        provides a degree of buffer against adverse impacts due to erroneous data. In the case of DNS, the
        data content determines the integrity of the entire system.
Based on these functional impacts, the deployment guidelines for secure DNS presented in this document
broadly consist of the following generic and DNS-specific recommendations:

    •   Implement appropriate system and network security controls for securing the DNS hosting
        environment, such as operating system and application patching, process isolation, and network
        fault tolerance.

    •   Protect DNS transactions such as update of DNS name resolution data and data replication that
        involve DNS nodes within an enterprise’s control. The transactions should be protected using
        hash-based message authentication codes based on shared secrets, as outlined in Internet
        Engineering Task Force’s (IETF) Transaction Signature (TSIG) specification.

    •   Protect the ubiquitous DNS query/response transaction that could involve any DNS node in the
        global Internet using digital signatures based on asymmetric cryptography, as outlined in IETF’s
        Domain Name System Security Extension (DNSSEC) specification.
Enforce content control of DNS name resolution data using a set of integrity constraints that are able to
provide the right balance between performance and integrity of the DNS system. This guide contains
recommendations for securing a DNS name server. Part of those recommendations is deployment of the
DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) for zone information. The basic steps to accomplish that part of
security are below:

    •   Install a DNSSEC capable name server implementation (See Section 7.2.1)

    •   Check zone file(s) for any possible integrity errors (See Section 10)

    •   Generate asymmetric key pair for each zone and include them in the zone file (See Section 9.2
        and 9.3)

    •   Sign the zone (See Section 9.6)

    •   Load the signed zone onto the server

    •   Configure name server to turn on DNSSEC processing (See Section 9.1)
