An application whitelist is a list of applications and application components that are authorized for use in
an organization. Application whitelisting technologies use whitelists to control which applications are
permitted to execute on a host. This helps to stop the execution of malware, unlicensed software, and
other unauthorized software. This publication is intended to assist organizations in understanding the
basics of application whitelisting. It also explains planning and implementation for whitelisting
technologies throughout the security deployment lifecycle.
