6      Identifiers for PIV Card Interfaces

SP 800-73-4 defines an application programming interface, the PIV Client Application
Programming Interface (Part 3), and a set of mandatory card commands, the PIV Card
Application Card Command Interface (Part 2). The command syntaxes for these interfaces
identify PIV keys using one-byte key references; their associated algorithms (or suites of
algorithms) are specified using one-byte algorithm identifiers. The same identifiers are used in
both interfaces.

Section 6.1 specifies the key reference values for each of the PIV key types. Section 6.2 defines
algorithm identifiers for each cryptographic algorithm supported by this specification. Section
6.3 identifies valid combinations of key reference values and algorithm identifiers.

6.1    Key Reference Values

A PIV Card key reference is a one-byte identifier that specifies a cryptographic key according to
its PIV Key Type. Table 6-1 defines the key reference values used on the PIV interfaces for PIV
Key Types.

6.2    PIV Card Algorithm Identifiers

A PIV Card algorithm identifier is a one-byte identifier that specifies a cryptographic algorithm
and key size, or a suite of algorithms and key sizes. For symmetric cryptographic operations, the
algorithm identifier also specifies a mode of operation (i.e., ECB). Table 6-2 lists the algorithm
identifiers for the cryptographic algorithms that may be recognized on the PIV interfaces. All
other algorithm identifier values are reserved for future use.
