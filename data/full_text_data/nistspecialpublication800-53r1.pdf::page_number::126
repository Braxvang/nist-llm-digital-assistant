SA-5      INFORMATION SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION

          Control: The organization obtains, protects as required, and makes available to authorized
          personnel, adequate documentation for the information system.
          Supplemental Guidance:   Documentation includes administrator and user guides with information
          on: (i) configuring, installing, and operating the information system; and (ii) effectively using the
          systemâ€™s security features. When adequate information system documentation is either
          unavailable or non existent (e.g., due to the age of the system or lack of support from the
          vendor/manufacturer), the organization documents attempts to obtain such documentation and
          provides compensating security controls, if needed.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization includes, in addition to administrator and user guides, documentation, if available
                from the vendor/manufacturer, describing the functional properties of the security controls
                employed within the information system with sufficient detail to permit analysis and testing of the
                controls.
          (2)   The organization includes, in addition to administrator and user guides, documentation, if available
                from the vendor/manufacturer, describing the design and implementation details of the security
                controls employed within the information system with sufficient detail to permit analysis and
                testing of the controls (including functional interfaces among control components).


           LOW SA-5                      MOD SA-5 (1)                HIGH SA-5 (1) (2)



SA-6      SOFTWARE USAGE RESTRICTIONS

          Control: The organization complies with software usage restrictions.

          Supplemental Guidance: Software and associated documentation are used in accordance with
          contract agreements and copyright laws. For software and associated documentation protected by
          quantity licenses, the organization employs tracking systems to control copying and distribution.
          The organization controls and documents the use of publicly accessible peer-to-peer file sharing
          technology to ensure that this capability is not used for the unauthorized distribution, display,
          performance, or reproduction of copyrighted work.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW SA-6                      MOD SA-6                    HIGH SA-6



SA-7      USER INSTALLED SOFTWARE

          Control: The organization enforces explicit rules governing the installation of software by users.

          Supplemental Guidance: If provided the necessary privileges, users have the ability to install
          software. The organization identifies what types of software installations are permitted (e.g.,
          updates and security patches to existing software) and what types of installations are prohibited
          (e.g., software that is free only for personal, not government use, and software whose pedigree
          with regard to being potentially malicious is unknown or suspect).
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW SA-7                      MOD SA-7                    HIGH SA-7
