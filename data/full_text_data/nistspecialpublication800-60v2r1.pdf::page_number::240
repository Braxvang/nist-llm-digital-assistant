infrastructure management information will result in a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In some cases, premature
unauthorized disclosure of management information can give an unfair competitive advantage to
a commercial interest (e.g., proposed changes for management of petroleum reserves). The
confidentiality impact of consequent loss of public confidence and/or serious economic
disruption might be moderate.

In other cases, public resources, facilities, and infrastructure management details can be of use to
terrorists or other criminals who seek to penetrate the security of government property or to harm
populations. Unauthorized disclosure of some public resources, facilities, and infrastructure
management details to criminals (e.g., facilities security dispositions, building alarm designs),
can result in danger to critical infrastructures, key national assets, or human life. In such cases,
the confidentiality impact can be high

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most public resources, facilities, and infrastructure management information is
low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of public resources, facilities, and
infrastructure management information depends primarily on the criticality of the information
with respect to management of public resources, facilities, and infrastructures. Typically, the
effects of modification or deletion of public resources, facilities, and infrastructure information
are limited with respect to agency missions or assets.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
public resources, facilities, and infrastructure management information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to public resources, facilities, and
infrastructure management information. The nature of most government public resources,
facilities, and infrastructure management processes is tolerant of reasonable delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
public resources, facilities, and infrastructure management information is low.
