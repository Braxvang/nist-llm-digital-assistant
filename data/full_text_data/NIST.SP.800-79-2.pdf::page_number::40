Special Publication 800-79-2                                 Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                              and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



5.0 ASSESSMENT & AUTHORIZATION LIFECYCLE
The authorization of a PIV Card Issuer (PCI) or a Derived PIV Credential Issuer (DPCI) consists
of four phases: (i) Initiation; (ii) Assessment; (iii) Authorization; and (iv) Monitoring. Each
phase consists of tasks and sub-tasks that are to be carried out by the responsible officials (e.g.,
the Designated Authorizing Official (DAO), Assessor, Organization Identity Management
Official (OIMO), and Issuing Facility Manager(s)). Figure 5 provides a view of the
authorization phases, including the tasks associated with each phase. A table of authorization
phases, tasks, sub-tasks, and the official responsible for each is provided in Appendix H.

5.1 Initiation Phase

The Initiation Phase consists of three tasks: (i) preparation; (ii) resource identification; and (iii)
operations plan analysis and acceptance. The primary purpose of this phase is to ensure that the
issuer is prepared for the assessment, including having all the resources and documentation in
place. The other purpose of this phase is to include the DAO early in the process in order to
assure success of the assessment and authorization.
        Task 1: Preparation
The objectives of this task are to prepare for authorization by reviewing the operations plan and
confirming that the plan is consistent with [FIPS201-2] and the template provided in Appendix
D.
