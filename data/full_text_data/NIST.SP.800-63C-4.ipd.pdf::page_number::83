       NIST SP 800-63C-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                                      Federation and Assertions


2199   to this vulnerability, although sufficiently long passwords tend to be cumbersome for
2200   users. However, when Kerberos password-based authentication is used in a FAST (or
2201   similar) tunnel, a successful attacker-in-the-middle attack is additionally required in order
2202   to perform the dictionary attack.

2203   12.3. OpenID Connect
2204   OpenID Connect [OIDC] is an internet-scale federated identity and authentication
2205   protocol built on top of the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework and the JSON Object
2206   Signing and Encryption (JOSE) cryptographic system.
2207   OpenID Connect builds on top of the OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol to enable the
2208   subscriber to authorize the RP to access the subscriber’s identity and authentication
2209   information. The RP in both OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 is known as the client.
2210   In a successful OpenID Connect transaction, the IdP issues an ID Token, which is a
2211   signed assertion in JSON Web Token (JWT) format. The client parses the ID Token to
2212   learn about the subscriber and primary authentication event at the IdP. This token contains
2213   at minimum the following information about the subscriber and authentication event:
2214       • iss - An HTTPS URL identifying the IdP that issued the assertion.
2215       • sub - An IdP-specific subject identifier representing the subscriber.
2216       • aud - An IdP-specific audience identifier, equal to the OAuth 2.0 client identifier of
2217         the client at the IdP.
2218       • exp - The timestamp at which the ID Token expires and after which SHALL NOT
2219         be accepted the client.
2220       • iat - The timestamp at which the ID Token was issued and before which
2221         SHALL NOT be accepted by the client.

2222   In addition to the ID Token, the IdP also issues the client an OAuth 2.0 access token
2223   which can be used to access the UserInfo Endpoint at the IdP. This endpoint returns
2224   a JSON object representing a set of attributes about the subscriber, including but not
2225   limited to their name, email address, physical address, phone number, and other profile
2226   information. While the information inside the ID Token is reflective of the authentication
2227   event, the information in the UserInfo Endpoint is generally more stable and could
2228   be more general purpose. Access to different attributes from the UserInfo Endpoint
2229   is governed by the use of a specially-defined set of OAuth scopes, openid, profile,
2230   email, phone, and address. An additional scope, offline access, is used to govern
2231   the issuance of refresh tokens, which allow the RP to access the UserInfo Endpoint
2232   when the subscriber is not present. Access to the UserInfo Endpoint is structured as an
2233   API and may be available when the subscriber is not present. Therefore, access to the
2234   UserInfo Endpoint is not sufficient for proving a subscriber’s presence and establishing
2235   an authenticated session at the RP.
