of risk response decisions assigned or delegated to organizational officials at that tier (defined by the organizational
governance structures); and (ii) the organizational risk management strategy and associated risk response strategies.
The means used by organizations to mitigate risk can involve a combination of risk response measures across the three
tiers. For example, risk mitigation can include common security controls at Tier 1, process re-engineering at Tier 2,
and/or new or enhanced management, operational, or technical safeguards or countermeasures (or some combination of
all three) at Tier 3. Another example of a potential risk requiring mitigation can be illustrated when adversaries gain
access to mobile devices (e.g., laptop computers or personal digital assistants) while users are traveling. Possible risk
mitigation measures include, for example, organizational policies prohibiting transport of mobile devices to certain
areas of the world or procedures for users to obtain a clean mobile device that is never allowed to connect to the
organizational networks.
Risk Sharing or Transfer
Risk sharing or risk transfer is the appropriate risk response when organizations desire and have the means to shift risk
liability and responsibility to other organizations. Risk transfer shifts the entire risk responsibility or liability from one
organization to another organization (e.g., using insurance to transfer risk from particular organizations to insurance
companies). Risk sharing shifts a portion of risk responsibility or liability to other organizations (usually organizations
that are more qualified to address the risk). It is important to note that risk transfer reduces neither the likelihood of
harmful events occurring nor the consequences in terms of harm to organizational operations and assets, individuals,
other organizations, or the Nation. Risk sharing may be a sharing of liability or a sharing of responsibility for other,
adequate risk responses such as mitigation. Therefore, the concept of risk transfer is less applicable in the public sector
(e.g., federal, state, local governments) than the private sector, as liability of organizations is generally established by
legislation or policy. As such, self-initiated transfers of risk by public sector organizations (as typified by purchasing
insurance) are generally not possible. Risk sharing often occurs when organizations determine that addressing risk
requires expertise or resources that are better provided by other organizations. For example, an identified risk might be
the physical penetration of perimeters and kinetic attacks by terrorist groups. The organization decides to partner with
another organization sharing the physical facility to take joint responsibility for addressing risk from kinetic attacks.

EVALUATION OF ALTERNATIVES

TASK 3-2: Evaluate alternative courses of action for responding to risk.
Supplemental Guidance: The evaluation of alternative courses of action can include: (i) the expected effectiveness in
achieving desired risk response (and how effectiveness is measured and monitored); and (ii) anticipated feasibility of
implementation, including, for example, mission/business impact, political, legal, social, financial, technical, and
economic considerations. Economic considerations include costs throughout the expected period of time during which
the course of action is followed (e.g., cost of procurement, integration into organizational processes at Tier 1 and/or
Tier 2, information systems at Tier 3, training, and maintenance). During the evaluation of alternative courses of action,
trade-offs can be made explicit between near-term gains in mission/business effectiveness or efficiency and long-term
risk of mission/business harm due to compromise of information or information systems that are providing this near-
term benefit. For example, organizations concerned about the potential for mobile devices (e.g., laptop computers)
being compromised while employees are on travel can evaluate several courses of action including: (i) providing users
traveling to high-risk areas with clean laptops; (ii) removing hard drives from laptops and operate from CDs or DVDs;
or (iii) having laptops go through a detailed assessment before being allowed to connect to organizational networks.
The first option is highly effective as returning laptops are never connected to organizational networks. While the
second option ensures that hard drives cannot be corrupted, it is not quite as effective in that it is still possible that
hardware devices (e.g., motherboards) could have been compromised. The effectiveness of the third option is limited
by the ability of organizations to detect potential insertion of malware into the hardware, firmware, or software. As
such, it is the least effective of the three options. From a cost perspective, the first option is potentially the most
expensive, depending upon the number of travelers (hence number of travel laptops) required. The second and third
options are considerably less expensive. From a mission and operational perspective, the third option is the best
alternative as users have access to standard laptop configurations including all applications and supporting data needed
to perform tasks supporting missions and business functions. Such applications and data would not be available if the
first or second option is selected. Ultimately, the evaluation of courses of action is made based on operational
requirements, including information security requirements, needed for near and long term mission/business success.
Budgetary constraints, consistency with investment management strategies, civil liberties, and privacy protection, are
some of the important elements organizations consider when selecting appropriate courses of action. In those instances
where organizations only identify a single course of action, then the evaluation is focused on whether the course of
action is adequate. If the course of action is deemed inadequate, then organizations need to refine the identified course
of action to address the inadequacies or develop another course of action (see Task 3-1).
In summary, a risk verses risk-response trade-off is conducted for each course of action to provide the information
necessary for: (i) selecting between the courses of action; and (ii) evaluating the courses of action in terms of response
effectiveness, costs, mission/business impact, and any other factors deemed relevant to organizations. Part of risk
