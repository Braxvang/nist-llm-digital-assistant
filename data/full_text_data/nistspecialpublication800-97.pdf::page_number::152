ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



security breach. Organizations should also examine each of the “should consider” recommendations to
determine their applicability to the target environment. In general, “should consider” recommendations
enhance security beyond what can be achieved through the “best practice” recommendations. A “should
consider” recommendation should be rejected only if it is infeasible or if the reduction in risk from its
implementation does not justify its cost.

WLANs face several types of high-level threats, including denial of service attacks, eavesdropping, man-
in-the-middle attacks, masquerading, message modification, message replay, and traffic analysis. WLAN
threats most commonly involve an attacker with access to the radio link between two STAs or between a
STA and an AP. Implementing the recommendations presented in this guide for a new or existing
WLAN should help to provide reasonable assurance that an organization is protected against most WLAN
security threats. In addition, organizations should use guidance on general security controls, such as the
recommendations presented in NIST SP 800-53 for minimum management, operational, and technical
security controls for information systems.
