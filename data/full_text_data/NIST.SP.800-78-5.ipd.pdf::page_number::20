      September 2023                                                                                   and Key Sizes for PIV

417       Identifiers for PIV Card Interfaces
418   NIST SP 800-73 defines an application programming interface, the PIV Client Application
419   Programming Interface (Part 3), and a set of mandatory card commands, the PIV Card
420   Application Card Command Interface (Part 2). The command syntaxes for these interfaces
421   identify PIV keys using one-byte key references, and their associated algorithms (or suites of
422   algorithms) are specified using one-byte algorithm identifiers. The same identifiers are used in
423   both interfaces.
424   Section 6.1 specifies the key reference values for each of the PIV key types. Section 6.2 defines
425   algorithm identifiers for each cryptographic algorithm supported by this specification. Section
426   6.3 identifies valid combinations of key reference values and algorithm identifiers.

427           Key Reference Values
428   A PIV Card key reference is a one-byte identifier that specifies a cryptographic key according to
429   its PIV Key Type. Table 8 defines the key reference values used on the PIV interfaces for PIV
430   Key Types.

432           PIV Card Algorithm Identifiers
433   A PIV Card algorithm identifier is a one-byte identifier that specifies a cryptographic algorithm
434   and key size or a suite of algorithms and key sizes. For symmetric cryptographic operations, the
435   algorithm identifier also specifies a mode of operation (i.e., ECB). Table 9 lists the algorithm
436   identifiers for the cryptographic algorithms that may be recognized on the PIV interfaces. All
437   other algorithm identifier values are reserved for future use.
