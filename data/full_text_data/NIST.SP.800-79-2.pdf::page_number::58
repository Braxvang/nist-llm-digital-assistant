Special Publication 800-79-2                                          Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                                       and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



APPENDIX D: OPERATIONS PLAN TEMPLATES

Appendices D.1 and D.2 are suggested outlines for a PIV Card Issuer (PCI) and a Derived PIV
Credential Issuer (DPCI) respectively. It is highly recommended that an organization follow
these templates to document its operations comprehensively and to the full extent as needed to
support a successful authorization. An issuer of both PIV Cards and Derived PIV Credentials
may develop a single operations plan that addresses all requirements without repeating common
elements of the plan.
