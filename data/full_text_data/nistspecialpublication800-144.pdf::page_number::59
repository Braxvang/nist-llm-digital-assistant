acceptable level can be carried out within the terms of the agreement. The terms of the
agreement should also include the following items [Gra03]:

      A detailed description of the service environment, including facility
       locations and applicable security requirements
      Policies, procedures, and standards, including vetting and management of
       staff
      Predefined service levels and associated costs
      The process for assessing the cloud provider’s compliance with the service
       level agreement, including independent audits and testing
      Specific remedies for harm caused or noncompliance by the cloud
       provider
      The period of performance and due dates for any deliverable
      The cloud provider’s points of interface with the organization
      The organization’s responsibilities for providing relevant information and
       resources to the cloud provider
      Procedures, protections, and restrictions for collocating or commingling
       organizational data and for handling sensitive data
      The cloud provider’s obligations upon contract termination, such as the
       return and expunging of organizational data.

The previous chapter pointed out additional areas where the organization is especially
dependent on the service provider and where the terms of the service agreement should
have extreme clarity to avoid potential problems. They include the following items:

      Ownership rights over data
      Locus of organizational data within the cloud environment
      Security and privacy performance visibility
      Service availability and contingency options
      Data backup and recovery
      Incident response coordination and information sharing
      Disaster recovery.

Privacy regulations may be interpreted differently by an organization’s legal and privacy
officers than by a cloud provider. The organization must take due care when reviewing
the controls provided or negotiated in the cloud provider’s service agreement to identify
and resolve inconsistencies between the organization’s and the cloud provider’s privacy
policies. Organizations must ensure the controls provided are adequate to protect the
types of information being planned for deployment to the cloud environment. OMB
guidance M-07-16, Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally
Identifiable Information, examines the requirements established in the Privacy Act and
provides additional guidance regarding an agency’s obligations to protect PII.

Before entering into the contract, it is advisable to have an experienced legal advisor
review the terms in detail. Non-negotiable service agreements are typically drafted in
favor of the cloud provider and may prove to be impracticable for an organization.
