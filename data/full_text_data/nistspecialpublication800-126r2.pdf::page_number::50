                 The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



The SCAP source data stream component that MUST be included for vulnerability scanning is the
XCCDF benchmark, which expresses the checklist of the flaws to be checked for. Each rule in the
XCCDF benchmark SHALL reference one of the following:
     An OVAL vulnerability definition. This definition SHALL be contained in an OVAL component,
      which holds definitions of vulnerability checks used by the checklist. An XCCDF benchmark’s rules
      MAY reference one or more OVAL vulnerability class definitions in an OVAL component.
     An OCIL questionnaire. This questionnaire SHALL be contained in an OCIL component, which
      holds questionnaires that collect information that OVAL is not being used to collect, such as giving a
      system administrator step-by-step directions for manually examining a system for a vulnerability that
      cannot be detected with OVAL, and then collecting information on the results of that manual
      examination. An XCCDF benchmark’s rules MAY reference one or more OCIL questionnaires in an
      OCIL component.
     An OVAL patch definition. This definition SHALL be contained in an OVAL component, which
      holds definitions for patch compliance checks. These checks may be needed if an organization
      includes patch verification in its vulnerability scanning activities. An XCCDF benchmark MAY
      reference an OVAL patch definition through a patches up-to-date rule in a manner consistent with
      Section 3.2.4.3.
Each XCCDF benchmark SHALL have at least one rule that references either an OVAL vulnerability
class definition in an OVAL component or an OCIL questionnaire in an OCIL component.
All OVAL components and OCIL components referenced by the XCCDF benchmark SHALL be
included in the SCAP source data stream.
If the XCCDF benchmark component references any CPE names, then the SCAP source data stream
MUST include a CPE component, which specifies the products or platforms of interest, and MUST
include one or more OVAL inventory class definitions in an OVAL component that contain the technical
procedures for determining whether or not a specific target asset has a product or platform of interest.
The @use-case attribute in the <ds:data-stream> element MUST be set to
“VULNERABILITY”.

5.3     Inventory Scanning
SCAP content can be used to collect information on the software installed on systems. One example of
how this could be used is to verify that a group of systems all have required security software programs
installed. This could help verify compliance with technical security control requirements. Another
example is to collect software inventory data on devices that are not directly connected to the enterprise
network, such as smart phones.
Inventory scanning can also be applied to collect information on the presence of software artifacts on
systems, such as malware or characteristics of malware that indicate its presence. SCAP content authored
for this purpose can be used to detect classes or categories of malware based on system state that may be
common across multiple malware instances. For example, it is a common practice to reuse malware code,
making modifications to address available detection methods, change propagation characteristics, etc. It is
also possible to author content that detects a specific instantiation of malware. For example, hashing of
files can be used to identify a malicious executable or library.
The SCAP source data stream component that MUST be included for inventory scanning is the XCCDF
benchmark, which references the inventory checks and captures the results. Each rule in the XCCDF
benchmark SHALL reference one of the following:
