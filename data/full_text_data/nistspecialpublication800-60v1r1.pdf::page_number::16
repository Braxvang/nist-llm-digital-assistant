•   Step 5: Authorize information system operation based upon a determination of the risk to
    organizational operations, organizational assets, or to individuals resulting from the
    operation of the information system and the decision that this risk is acceptable as
    specified in NIST SP 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of
    Federal Information Systems.
•   Step 6: Monitor and assess selected security controls in the information system on a
    continuous basis including documenting changes to the system, conducting security
    impact analyses of the associated changes, and reporting the security status of the system
    to appropriate organizational officials on a regular basis. (Reference NIST SP 800-37 and
    SP 800-53A).
