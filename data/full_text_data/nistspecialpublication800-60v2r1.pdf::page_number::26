APPENDIX C: MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT INFORMATION AND
    INFORMATION SYSTEMS IMPACT LEVELS
Much Federal government information and many systems are not employed directly to provide
services to citizens, but are primarily intended to provide administrative or business services that
support mission accomplishment. Volume I, Section 4.1.2, “Identification of Management and
Support Information,” suggests a set of information types for management and support
information as based on Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) Federal Enterprise
Architecture (FEA) Business Reference Model (BRM) described in the FEA Consolidated
Reference Model Document Version 2.3, dated October 2007.

Some of the management and support functions executed to support delivery of services or
manage government resources are also executed by some agencies in delivering services to
citizens. (See especially the “C.2.8 General Government” line of business.) Most of these
information types could be included in Appendix D as mission-based information types.
Because the BRM categorizes them as services delivery support functions, they are included in
Volume I Section 4.1.2 and here in Appendix C. In order to reduce repetition, they are not
repeated in Appendix D.

Appendix C.1, “Recommended Provisional Impact Levels for Management and Support
Information Types,” documents impact levels for information types identified in Section 4.1.2.
These are provisional levels, subject to review and modification by agency stakeholders.
Provisional impact level assignments are only the first step in impact assignment and are
reviewed in the subsequent risk assessment processes. They are not designed to be used by
auditors as a definitive checklist for information types and impact assignments.

Most information systems employed in both direct services and administrative/management
support activities perform one or more of the service delivery support functions described in
Appendix C.2, “Rationale and Factors for Services Delivery Support Information.” These
service support functions are the day-to-day activities necessary to the organizations that provide
services to the general population and administrative/management services to government
departments and agencies responsible for the provision of those services. As in the case of
administrative/business information and information systems, the security objectives and impacts
are determined by the direct service missions and constituencies ultimately being supported. It is
likely that all Federal government information systems store, process, and operate under the
control of information technology (IT) infrastructure maintenance information (e.g., password
files and file and network access settings). At least a basic set of security controls will apply to
this set of information and processes in order to combat potential corruption, misuse, or abuse of
system information and processes.

Information necessary to conduct administrative or business services that support mission
accomplishment includes the government resource management information types described in
Appendix C.3, “Rationale and Factors for Government Resource Management Information.” All
of the departments and agencies performing direct service functions are supported by
information systems that perform the activities described in Appendix C.3. Many departments
and agencies operate their own support systems. Others obtain at least some support services
from other organizations. Some agencies’ missions are primarily to support other government
departments and agencies in the conduct of direct service missions. As indicated above, security
