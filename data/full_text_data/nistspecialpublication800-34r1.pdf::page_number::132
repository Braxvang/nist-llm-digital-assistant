                                                CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



CP-2 CONTINGENCY PLAN

Control: The organization:

a. Develops a contingency plan for the information system that:
    • Identifies essential mission and business processes and associated contingency requirements;
    • Provides restoration priorities and metrics;
    • Addresses contingency roles, responsibilities, and assigned individuals with contact information;
    • Addresses maintaining essential missions and business processes despite an information system
        disruption, compromise, or failure;
    • Addresses eventual full information system restoration without deterioration of the security
        measures originally planned; and
    • Is reviewed and approved by designated officials within the organization;

b. Distributes copies of the contingency plan to [Assignment: organization-defined list of key contingency
personnel and organizational elements, identified by name and/or by role];

c. Coordinates contingency planning activities with incident handling activities;

d. Reviews the contingency plan for the information system [Assignment: organization-defined
frequency];

e. Revises the contingency plan to address changes to the organization, information system, or
environment of operation and problems encountered during contingency plan implementation, execution,
or testing ; and

f. Communicates contingency plan changes to [Assignment: organization-defined list of key contingency
personnel and organizational elements, identified by name and/or by role].

Supplemental Guidance: Contingency planning for information systems is part of an overall
organizational program for achieving continuity of operations for mission/business operations.
Contingency planning addresses both information system restoration and implementation of alternative
mission/business processes when systems are compromised. Information system recovery objectives are
consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, or regulations. In
addition to information system availability, contingency plans also address other security-related events
resulting in a reduction in mission/business effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the
confidentiality or integrity of the information system. Examples of actions to call out in contingency plans
include, for example, graceful degradation, information system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode,
alternate information flows, or operating in a mode that is reserved solely for when the system is under
attack.

Control Enhancements:

(1) The organization coordinates contingency plan development with organizational elements
responsible for related plans.

        Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Examples of related plans include Business Continuity
        Plan, Disaster Recovery Plan, Continuity of Operations Plan, Crisis Communications Plan,
        Critical Infrastructure Plan, Cyber Incident Response Plan, and Occupant Emergency Plan.
