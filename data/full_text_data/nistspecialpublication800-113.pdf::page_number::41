Users are added to the various groups to grant them access to resources via the SSL VPN. For example,
regular employees are added to the Employees group, while executives are added to both the Executives
and Employees groups. A user in the Employees group who logs in from an organization-managed host
is granted access to both the corporate applications and Web applications resources. This same user is
restricted to only Web applications if the host cannot be verified as organization-managed.

Note that the access policy is configured to restrict access to the executive file share only to users who
belong to the Executives group and are logging in from an organization-managed host. An executive is
only given the access privileges of a regular employee if he or she logs in from any other host. If desired,
users could also use a different authentication method to receive access to the executive file share.

This access control policy assumes that a user can satisfy multiple conditions simultaneously. For
example, a user who logs in from an organization-managed host also satisfies the any host condition and
is granted access to the corresponding resources. If the SSL VPN device cannot support this flexibility,
then the organization would have to specify the resources for each condition.

4.3.2    Design the Endpoint Security Policy

Once the organization designs its access control policy, it should consider constructing a policy to enforce
endpoint security. Such a policy could initially verify that a client host complies with an organization’s
security policy by requiring host integrity checks to be performed on the client host. It is recommended
to run the checks before the login process to look for malware such as keystroke loggers or viruses.

The checks can prohibit login altogether if the client host does not comply with the organization’s
minimum security policy. For example, the organization’s endpoint security policy may specify that
desktop search tools that index the contents of a user’s hard drive are prohibited during an SSL VPN
session because these tools can cache data from the session. If this is the case, then the host integrity
checking process may either turn off the search tools directly or prevent login until the tools are explicitly
turned off by the user.

Some SSL VPN vendors perform the host integrity checks by having the client host dynamically
download active content from the SSL VPN device and then execute the active content. In this case, the
client operating system and browser need to be configured to permit these agents to be downloaded and
executed; otherwise, the client could perceive the agents as malware and block them, preventing the SSL
VPN from performing the host integrity checks. This shows a basic conundrum of using this type of
integrity check: some organizations prohibit such active content to be run in browsers because it is
difficult to distinguish it from malware.
