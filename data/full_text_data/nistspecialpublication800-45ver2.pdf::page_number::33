                                                                         GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



4.        Planning and Managing Mail Servers

The most critical aspect of deploying a secure mail server is careful planning before installation,
configuration, and deployment. Careful planning will ensure that the mail server is as secure as possible
and in compliance with all relative organizational policies. Many mail server security and performance
problems can be traced back to a lack of planning or management controls. The importance of
management controls is difficult to overstate. In many organizations, the information technology support
structure is highly fragmented. This fragmentation leads to inconsistencies, and these inconsistencies can
lead to security vulnerabilities.

4.1       Installation and Deployment Planning

Security of the mail server should be considered from the initial planning stage at the beginning of the
systems development life cycle to maximize security and minimize costs. It is much more difficult and
expensive to address security once implementation and deployment have occurred. Organizations are
more likely to make decisions about configuring hosts appropriately and consistently when they begin by
developing and using a detailed, well-designed deployment plan. Developing such a plan enables
organizations to make informed tradeoff decisions between usability and performance, and risk. A
deployment plan allows organizations to maintain secure configurations and aids in identifying security
vulnerabilities, which often manifest themselves as deviations from the plan.

In the planning stages of a mail server, the following items should be considered [Alle00]:

 Identify the purpose(s) of the mail server.

      –    What information categories will be stored on, processed on, or transmitted through the mail
           server?

      –    What are the security requirements for this information?

      –    What other service(s) will be provided by the mail server (in general, dedicating the host to being
           only a mail server is the most secure option)?

      –    What are the security requirements for these additional services?

      –    What are the requirements for continuity of mail services, such as those specified in continuity of
           operations plans and disaster recovery plans?

      –    Where on the network will the mail server be located (see Section 7.1)?
 Identify the network services that will be provided on the mail server (in addition to the
  organization’s standard services provided by every server for backup, remote administration, etc.),
  such as those supplied through standard email protocols (e.g., SMTP, POP, IMAP) and proprietary
  email protocols.
 Identify any network service software, both client and server, to be installed on the mail server and
  any other support servers.
 Identify the users or categories of users of the mail server and any support hosts, including servers
  providing Web-based mail access.
 Determine the privileges that each category of user will have on the mail server and support hosts.
