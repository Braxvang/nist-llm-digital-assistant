C.3.3.7 Employee Relations Information Type

Employee Relations designs, develops, and implements programs that strive to maintain an
effective employer-employee relationship that balance the agency’s needs against its employees’
rights. This sub-function includes: addressing employee misconduct; addressing employee
performance problems; managing administrative grievances; providing employee
accommodation; administering employees assistance programs; participating in administrative
third party proceedings; and determining candidate and applicant suitability. The recommended
provisional security categorization for employee relations information is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of employee relations
information on the ability of responsible agencies to design, develop, and implement programs
that strive to maintain an effective employer-employee relationship that balance the agency’s
needs against its employees’ rights. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of the
employee relations information will result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where more sensitive information is
involved, it will probably be personal information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or other laws and executive orders
affecting the dissemination of information regarding individuals. (The provisional impact levels
for personnel information are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication.) In such
cases, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of Employee Relations information could be
serious. In such cases, the confidentiality impact level might be moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for disclosure of employee relations information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of employee relations information
depends mostly on the criticality of the information with respect to agency mission capability,
protection of agency assets, and safety of individuals. Although there can be serious short-term
effects for individuals, the effects of modifications or deletion of this information are generally
limited with respect to agency mission capabilities or assets.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In some cases, integrity compromises that
adversely affect a significant subset of the workforce can result in work stoppages that adversely
affect the agency’s mission. Where interruptions to agency missions can have serious or life-
threatening consequences for individuals, the impacts of integrity compromises can be moderate
or even high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
employee relations information is low.
