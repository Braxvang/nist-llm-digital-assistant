CHAPTER 7                                                    Performance Measures


7.4.5    Apply Corrective Actions
    Phase 6 of the process, Apply Corrective Actions, involves implementing
corrective actions as determined through data analysis and as defined in an
applicable business case or a POA&M. After corrective actions are applied, the cycle
completes itself and restarts with subsequent data collection and analysis. Iterative
data collection, analysis, and reporting will track the progress of corrective actions
through the POA&M, among others, measure improvement, and identify areas for
further improvement to be included in tactical plans, Program Management Plans, or
other agency planning mechanisms. The iterative nature of the cycle ensures that
the progress is monitored, and the corrective actions are affecting system security
control implementation in an intended way. Frequent performance measurements
will ensure that if corrective actions are not implemented as planned, or if their
actual effect is not the desired effect, quick course corrections can be made
internally by the agency, thus avoiding the unveiling of problems during external
audits, security certification and accreditation efforts, or other similar activities.
