NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                            Guidelines for Media Sanitization



     Method                                                  Description


               renders many types of devices unusable (and in those cases, Degaussing is also a Destruction
               technique).


     Destroy   There are many different types, techniques, and procedures for media Destruction. While
               some techniques may render the Target Data infeasible to retrieve through the device
               interface and unable to be used for subsequent storage of data, the device is not considered
               Destroyed unless Target Data retrieval is infeasible using state of the art laboratory
               techniques.

                   •    Disintegrate, Pulverize, Melt, and Incinerate. These sanitization methods are
                        designed to completely Destroy the media. They are typically carried out at an
                        outsourced metal Destruction or licensed incineration facility with the specific
                        capabilities to perform these activities effectively, securely, and safely.
                   •    Shred. Paper shredders can be used to Destroy flexible media such as diskettes
                        once the media are physically removed from their outer containers. The shred size
                        of the refuse should be small enough that there is reasonable assurance in
                        proportion to the data confidentiality that the data cannot be reconstructed. To
                        make reconstructing the data even more difficult, the shredded material can be
                        mixed with non-sensitive material of the same type (e.g., shredded paper or
                        shredded flexible media).
               The application of Destructive techniques may be the only option when the media fails and other
               Clear or Purge techniques cannot be effectively applied to the media, or when the verification of
               Clear or Purge methods fails (for known or unknown reasons).
