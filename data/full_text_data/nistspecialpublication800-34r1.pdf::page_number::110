4.2     Recovery Procedures

The following procedures are provided for recovery of {system name} at the original or established
alternate location. Recovery procedures are outlined per team and should be executed in the sequence
presented to maintain an efficient recovery effort.

Provide general procedures for the recovery of the system from backup media. Specific keystroke-level
procedures may be provided in an appendix. If specific procedures are provided in an appendix, a
reference to that appendix should be included in this section. Teams or persons responsible for each
procedure should be identified.

4.3     Recovery Escalation Notices/Awareness

Provide appropriate procedures for escalation notices during recovery efforts. Notifications during
recovery include problem escalation to leadership and status awareness to system owners and users.
Teams or persons responsible for each escalation/awareness procedure should be identified.

5.      Reconstitution

Reconstitution is the process by which recovery activities are completed and normal system operations
are resumed. If the original facility is unrecoverable, the activities in this phase can also be applied to
preparing a new permanent location to support system processing requirements. A determination must be
made on whether the system has undergone significant change and will require reassessment and
reauthorization. The phase consists of two major activities: validating successful reconstitution and
deactivation of the plan.

5.1     Concurrent Processing

High-impact systems are not required to have concurrent processing as part of the validation effort. If
concurrent processing does occur for the system prior to making it operational, procedures should be
inserted here. Procedures should include length of time for concurrent processing, processing
information on both concurrent systems, and validating information on the new permanent system.

For high-impact systems without concurrent processing, this section may either be removed or the
following may be used:

In concurrent processing, a system operates at two separate locations concurrently until there is a level of
assurance that the recovered system is operating correctly. {System name} does not have concurrent
processing as part of validation. Once the system has been tested and validated, it will be placed into
normal operations.

5.2     Validation Data Testing

Validation data testing is the process of testing and validating recovered data to ensure that data files or
databases have been recovered completely. The following procedures will be used to determine that the
recovered data is complete and current to the last available backup:

Provide procedures for testing or validation of recovered data to ensure that data is correct and up to
date. This section may be combined with the Functionality Testing section if procedures test both the
functionality and data validity. Teams or persons responsible for each procedure should be identified.
