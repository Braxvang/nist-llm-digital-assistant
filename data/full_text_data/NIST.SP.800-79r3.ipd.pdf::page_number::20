557   An organization that outsources services must make sure that all privacy-related requirements are
558   being met both internally and by every external service provider used as part of the PIV
559   credential issuance function.
560   If an organization is considering using PIV or derived PIV services set up by another
561   organization’s issuer, the operations plan and associated documents — including the
562   authorization decision and evidence that the issuer is complying with [FIPS201] requirements —
563   SHALL be reviewed by the designated authorizing official (DAO) of the organization requesting
564   these services. Similarly, if an issuer is selectively using the services of an external service
565   provider for one or more of its processes, the provider’s capability to meet [FIPS201]
566   requirements for those processes SHALL be reviewed as well. In both cases, the information
567   gathered as part of this review activity SHALL be included in the issuer’s assessment leading to
568   authorization. Outsourced functions SHALL be assessed prior to the authorization of an issuer.

569                Assessment and Authorization
570   [HSPD-12] requires identification credentials to be “issued only by providers whose reliability
571   has been established by an official accreditation process.” This document contains guidelines for
572   satisfying the requirements for an official authorization and provides a methodology that can be
573   utilized to formally authorize an issuer. This methodology consists of two major sets of
574   activities: assessment and authorization. While assessment and authorization are closely related,
575   they are two distinct activities.
576   Assessment occurs before authorization and is the process of gathering evidence regarding an
577   issuer’s satisfaction of the requirements of [FIPS201], including all functions performed (i)
578   locally, (ii) at a supervised remote identity proofing (SRIP) station (if used), or (iii) at issuing
579   facilities. Assessment activities include interviews with the issuer, the issuing facility’s
580   personnel, and the SRIP live operators; a review of documentation; an observation of processes;
581   and an execution of tests to determine the overall reliability of the issuer. The result of the
582   assessment is a report that serves as the basis for an authorization decision. The report is also the
583   basis for developing corrective actions for removing or mitigating discovered deficiencies.
584   Authorization is the decision to permit the operation of the issuer once it has been established
585   that the requirements of [FIPS201] have been met and the risks regarding security and privacy
586   are acceptable. The individual making the authorization decision SHALL be knowledgeable of
