NIST SP 800-85A-4                                              PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                        INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

zz, where zz is set to either 0x10 or 0x20; and 2) the Global PIN can be used for PIV data object
access and command execution.

AS05.13A-R4: PIV Card Applications for which OCC satisfies the PIV ACRs for PIV data
object access and command execution shall implement the Discovery Object with the first byte
of the PIN Usage Policy set to 0x50, 0x58, 0x5C, 0x70, 0x78, or 0x7C.

Required Vendor Information

VE05.13A-R4.01: If OCC (in addition to the PIV Card Application PIN, and possibly the Global
PIN) is used for data access and command execution while the PIV Card Application is the currently
selected application, the vendor shall state in its documentation that the card supports the assertion
made in AS05.13A-R4.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.13A-R4.01: The tester shall validate that when OCC satisfies the PIV ACRs for PIV data
object access and command execution then: 1) the Discovery Object is implemented with the first
byte of the PIN Usage Policy set to 0x50, 0x58, 0x5C, 0x70, 0x78, or 0x7C; and 2) OCC can be
used for PIV data object access and command execution.

AS05.13B-R4: PIV Card Applications that implement the VCI shall implement the Discovery
Object with the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy set to 0x4C, 0x5C, 0x6C, or 0x7C, and may
optionally also implement the Discovery Object with the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy set
to 0x48, 0x58, 0x68, or 0x78.

Required Vendor Information

VE05.13B-R4.01: If the PIV Card Application implements the VCI, the vendor shall state in its
documentation that the card supports the assertion made in AS05.13B-R4.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.13B-R4.01: The tester shall validate that PIV Card Applications that implement the VCI
implement the Discovery Object with the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy set to 0x4C, 0x5C,
0x6C, or 0x7C (see Table 1 of SP 800-73-4 Part 1).

AS05.14: Key reference '80' specific to the PIV Card Application (i.e., local key references)
and, optionally, the Global PIN with key reference '00', the OCC data (key references '96' and
'97'), and pairing code (key reference '98') are the only key references that may be verified by
the PIV Card Application’s VERIFY command. The PIV Card Application may allow other
key references to be verified by the PIV Card Application’s VERIFY command, if they are
used for card management operations.
