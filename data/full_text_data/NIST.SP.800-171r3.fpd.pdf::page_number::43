1012           identify and authenticate devices on local and wide area networks. PKI and certificate revocation
1013           checking for the certificates exchanged can also be included as part of device authentication.

1017   3.5.3. Multi-Factor Authentication
1018           REQUIREMENT: 03.05.03
1019           Implement multi-factor authentication for access to system accounts.

1020           DISCUSSION
1021           Multi-factor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to achieve
1022           authentication. The authentication factors are defined as follows: something you know (e.g., a
1023           personal identification number [PIN]), something you have (e.g., a physical authenticator, such as
1024           a cryptographic private key), or something you are (e.g., a biometric). Multi-factor authentication
1025           solutions that feature physical authenticators include hardware authenticators that provide time-
1026           based or challenge-response outputs and smart cards. In addition to authenticating users at the
1027           system level, organizations may also employ authentication mechanisms at the application level
1028           to provide increased information security.

1032   3.5.4. Replay-Resistant Authentication
1033           REQUIREMENT: 03.05.04
1034           Implement replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for access to system accounts.

1035           DISCUSSION
1036           Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to successfully authenticate by
1037           recording or replaying previous authentication messages. Replay-resistant techniques include
1038           protocols that use nonces or challenges, such as time synchronous or challenge-response one-time
1039           authenticators.

1044           REQUIREMENT: 03.05.05

1046              role, service, or device identifier.
