Special Publication 800-78-4                             Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for PIV



Applications may be designed to use any or all of the cryptographic keys and objects stored on
the PIV Card. Where maximum interoperability is required, applications should support all of the
identified algorithms, key sizes, and parameters specified in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.

FIPS 201-2 requires CAs and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responders to generate
and distribute digitally signed certificate revocation lists (CRL) and OCSP status messages,
respectively. These certificate status mechanisms support validation of the PIV Card, the PIV
cardholder, the cardholder’s digital signature key, and the cardholder’s key management key.

The signed certificate status mechanisms specified in FIPS 201-2 are:

    +   X.509 CRLs that specify the status of a group of X.509 certificates; and
    +   OCSP status response messages that specify the status of a particular X.509 certificate.
The cryptographic algorithms, key sizes, and parameters that may be used to sign these
mechanisms are specified in Section 4. Section 4 also describes rules for encoding the signatures
to ensure interoperability.

FIPS 201-2 permits optional card management operations. These operations may only be
performed after the PIV Card authenticates the card management system. Card management
systems are authenticated through the use of PIV Card Application Administration Keys. The
cryptographic algorithms and key sizes that may be used for these keys are specified in Section
5.
