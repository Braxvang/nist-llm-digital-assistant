SP 800-89                                                                November 2006



Unless the “commitment” condition discussed below is met, the assurance message shall
also include:
   4. The public key corresponding to the private key for which assurance of
      possession is sought.
      The public key may be omitted if the (claimed) signatory’s “commitment” to the
      key pair has been unambiguously demonstrated before the exact form of the
      assurance message could have been known by the signatory.
      Such commitment must precede the time provided in the trusted timestamp token
      (i.e., the timestamp_time) mentioned above, or – in the absence of a TST – must
      precede the time provided in a timestamp component included in a verifier-
      supplied nonce. If neither the public key of the claimed signatory nor a time
      trusted by the relying parties will be included in the assurance message, then the
      relying parties must obtain trustworthy evidence that the (claimed) signatory
      committed to the key pair in question before the verifier-supplied nonce was made
      available for use in the computation of the assurance signature.
      Commitment to a key pair can be demonstrated, for example, by the presence of a
      trusted timestamp on a certificate (signed by a CA whose signature is trusted by
      the verifier and other relying parties) that contains the public key of the key pair
      and identifies the claimed signatory as the owner. Relying parties must be aware
      of the security strength provided by the CA’s signature. The security strength
      provided by the CA’s digital signature shall meet or exceed the security
      requirements of the requesting entity and relying party (see SP 800-57);
      Commitment could also be demonstrated by the existence of a signature that was
      previously generated by the same claimed signatory that can be successfully
      verified using the same public key; such a signature shall be known to have been
      generated at a time when the claimed signatory was the owner, and at a time
      before the exact form of the current assurance message (in particular, the values
      of included timestamps and/or nonces) could have been known by the signatory.
       A (claimed) signatory’s commitment to a key pair could also be demonstrated by
       making the value of the public key available to the verifier before the verifier
       supplies a nonce to the signatory (as described in item 3 above).
Additional information may be included in the signed data of the assurance message,
such as:
   •   An explicit indication that the message may be used to provide assurance of
       private key possession,
   •   A nonce supplied by the signatory that contains a random component with
       entropy equal to or greater than the security strength associated with the private
       key, or
   •   Any other data to be provided to the intended verifier by the signatory.
Note that any message containing the required information may be used as an assurance
message; the message may be intended only to provide assurance of possession or may be
