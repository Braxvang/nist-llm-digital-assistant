                                                 Federal Information Systems and Organizations




 Allocation                   The process an organization employs to determine whether
 [NISTIR 7298]                security controls are defined as system-specific, hybrid, or
                              common.
                              The process an organization employs to assign security controls
                              to specific information system components responsible for
                              providing a particular security capability (e.g., router, server,
                              remote sensor).

 Application                  A software program hosted by an information system.
 [NISTIR 7298]

 Assessment                   See Security Control Assessment.

 Assessment Findings          Assessment results produced by the application of an assessment
 [NISTIR 7298]                procedure to a security control or control enhancement to achieve
                              an assessment objective; the execution of a determination
                              statement within an assessment procedure by an assessor that
                              results in either a satisfied or other than satisfied condition.

 Assessment Method            One of three types of actions (examine, interview, test) taken by
 [NISTIR 7298]                assessors in obtaining evidence during an assessment.

 Assessment Object            The item (specifications, mechanisms, activities, individuals)
 [NISTIR 7298]                upon which an assessment method is applied during an
                              assessment.

 Assessment Objective         A set of determination statements that expresses the desired
 [NISTIR 7298]                outcome for the assessment of a security control or control
                              enhancement.

 Assessment Procedure         A set of assessment objectives and an associated set of assessment
 [NISTIR 7298]                methods and assessment objects.

 Assessor                     See Security Control Assessor.

 Assurance                    The grounds for confidence that the set of intended security
 [NISTIR 7298]                controls in an information system are effective in their
                              application.

 Assurance Case               A structured set of arguments and a body of evidence showing
 [NISTIR 7298]                that an information system satisfies specific claims with respect
                              to a given quality attribute.

 Authentication               Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a
 [FIPS 200]                   prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an information
                              system.
