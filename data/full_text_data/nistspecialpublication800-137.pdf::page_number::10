for compliance. NIST SP 800-37 describes monitoring security controls at the system level (RMF
Step 6) and also includes an organization-wide perspective, integration with the system
development life cycle (SDLC), and support for ongoing authorizations. The concepts presented
in NIST SP 800-39 and NIST SP 800-37 are expanded upon in order to provide guidelines
sufficient for developing an ISCM strategy and implementing an ISCM program.

The tiered approach herein mirrors that described in NIST SP 800-37 and NIST SP 800-39 where
Tier 1 is organization, Tier 2 is mission/business processes, and Tier 3 is information systems. In
NIST SP 800-39, these tiers are used to address risk management from varying organizational
perspectives. In this document, the tiers are used to address perspectives for ISCM for each tier.
Organization-wide, tier-specific ISCM policies, procedures, and responsibilities are included for
the organization, mission/business processes, and information systems tiers. Automation is
leveraged where possible, and manual (e.g., procedural) monitoring methodologies are
implemented where automation is not practical or possible.

The ISCM program will evolve over time as the program matures in general, additional tools and
resources become available, measurement and automation capabilities mature, and changes are
implemented to ensure continuous improvement in the organizational security posture and in the
organization’s security program. The monitoring strategy is regularly reviewed for relevance and
accuracy in reflecting organizational risk tolerances, correctness of measurements, applicability
of metrics, and effectiveness in supporting risk management decisions.

1.3    PURP OS E
The purpose of this guideline is to assist organizations in the development of an ISCM strategy
and the implementation of an ISCM program that provides awareness of threats and
vulnerabilities, visibility into organizational assets, and the effectiveness of deployed security
controls. The ISCM strategy and program support ongoing assurance that planned and
implemented security controls are aligned with organizational risk tolerance, as well as the ability
to provide the information needed to respond to risk in a timely manner.
