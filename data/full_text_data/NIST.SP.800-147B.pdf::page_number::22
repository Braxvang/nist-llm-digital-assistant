                                                                       BIOS PROTECTION GUIDELINES FOR SERVERS
        3-B.ii    If implemented, BIOS flash protections shall be enforced by hardware mechanisms that
                  are disengaged only by an authorized mechanism (e.g., system reset).
  3-C     If BIOS flash protections are not implemented, then BIOS integrity shall be verified prior to
          each execution, using the Verification Component of the RTU to authenticate the BIOS image.
        3-C.i     If verification fails, then the system shall initiate a recovery procedure.
        3-C.ii    Automatic recovery mechanisms which initiate recovery to a protected, authentic BIOS
                  should be supported.
  3-D     Each RTU shall be protected from modifications outside the authenticated update mechanisms.
        3-D.i     Protection mechanisms that ensure the integrity of the RTU shall be engaged prior to
                  execution of code outside of the RTU.
        3-D.ii    RTU integrity protections shall be enforced by hardware mechanisms that are
                  disengaged only by an authorized mechanism, for example system reset.

4. Non-Bypassability
  4-A     The design of the system and accompanying system components and firmware shall ensure that
          there are no mechanisms to install and execute unauthenticated BIOS code, except through
          physical intervention and the secure local update mechanism.
  4-B     The authenticated BIOS update mechanism shall be the exclusive mechanism for modifying
          the RTU absent physical intervention through the secure local update mechanism.
  4-C     The design of the system and accompanying system components and firmware shall ensure that
          there are no mechanisms that allow the host processor or any other system component to
          bypass the authenticated update mechanism for updating the RTU, except for the secure local
          update mechanism.
  4-D     While a system component may have read access to system flash memory, it shall not be able
          to directly modify the RTU unless that component serves as an RTU itself.


5. Service Processors
  5-A     Service Processors employed as a Root of Trust to protect BIOS, shall meet the following
          requirements:
        5-A.i     Updates to the SP code, cryptographic keys, and static data stored on the SP flash
                  memory shall be by way of an authenticating update mechanism.
        5-A.ii    The SP environment shall be controlled such that only authenticated code can be
                  executed on the SP.
        5-A.iii   Authorization should be required for user interaction with the SP.
  5-B     Service Processors that are not employed as a Root of Trust to protect BIOS shall meet the
          following requirements:
        5-B.i     SPs shall not have direct write access to the BIOS flash memory which the BIOS code
                  is verified or executed.
        5-B.ii    SPs shall be restricted such that it is not capable of interfering with BIOS update
                  processes, nor the memory from which the BIOS or RTU code is executed.
