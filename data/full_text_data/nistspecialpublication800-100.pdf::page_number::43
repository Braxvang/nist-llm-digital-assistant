CHAPTER 4                                                   Awareness and Training


    • Infrastructure to support broad distribution (e.g., Web, e-mail, learning
      management systems) and posting of security awareness and training
      materials is funded and implemented;
    • Executive/senior-level officials deliver messages to staff regarding security
      (e.g., staff meetings, broadcasts to all users by agency head), champion the
      program, and demonstrate support for training by committing financial
      resources to the program;
    • Metrics indicate improved security performance by the workforce (e.g., to
      explain a decline in security incidents or violations, indicate that the gap
      between existing awareness and training coverage and identified needs is
      shrinking, the percentage of users being exposed to awareness material is
      increasing, the percentage of users with significant security responsibilities
      being appropriately trained is increasing);
    • Executives and managers do not use their status in the organization to avoid
      security controls that are consistently adhered to by the rank and file;
    • Level of attendance at security forums/briefings/training is consistently high.
    • Recognition of security contributions (e.g., awards, contests) is a standard
      practice within an agency; and
    • Individuals playing key roles in managing/coordinating the security program
      demonstrate commitment to the program and motivation to promote the
      program.
