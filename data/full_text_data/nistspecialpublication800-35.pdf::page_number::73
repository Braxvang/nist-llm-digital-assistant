D.3.3.2                 Select Risk Assessment Methodology for a System

[NOTE: The organization may specify a specific risk assessment methodology or tool is to be used. If
the organization does not designate a methodology or tool, then this task should be performed.]

The <Contractor or organization name> shall select the technique for estimating the risk of operating a
system. The risk assessment methodology selected should be consistent with the methodology of NIST
SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems.

The Contractor shall deliver a Methodology Selection Report to the COTR, explaining the rationale for
selecting the methodology.

D.3.3.3                 Perform Risk Assessment

The Contractor shall collect the data required to support the risk assessment methodology and perform the
risk assessment. The requirements for the risk assessment task are:

  System characterization
  Threat identification
  Vulnerability identification
  Control analysis
  Likelihood determination
  Impact analysis
  Risk determination
  Control recommendations
  Results documentation.

D.3.3.4                 Develop a Risk Mitigation Plan

The Contractor shall develop a plan 15 to mitigate the risks identified in the risk assessment. The plan shall
include the following:

  A recommended priority of actions
  Evaluation of recommended control options
  Cost-benefit analysis
  Safeguard implementation plan
  Determination of residual risk.
The Contractor shall deliver the Risk Mitigation Report to the COTR.

15
     Certain key steps of the risk mitigation process have been excluded from this section as they should be in the exclusive domain
       of the organization. They include the selection of the final controls, assignment of responsibility for implementing controls,
       and the actual implementation of the selected controls.
