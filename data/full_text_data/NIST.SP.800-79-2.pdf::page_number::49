Special Publication 800-79-2                               Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                            and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



                 Guidance: If the results of the impact analysis indicate that changes to the issuer
                 could affect the reliability of its operations, the changes and impact on the issuer
                 must be reported to the DAO, corrective actions must be initiated, and the CAP
                 must be updated. In instances where major changes have occurred, the issuer
                 must be re-authorized.
        Task 9: Annual Lifecycle Walkthrough
The annual lifecycle walkthrough is a monitoring activity to be performed initially by the issuer
when its PIV Card and/or Derived PIV Credential issuing services begin, and annually thereafter.
The OIMO (or designated appointee) is responsible for observing and reviewing the entire
lifecycle of the PIV Card and/or the Derived PIV Credential. This walkthrough should provide
an accurate snapshot of the issuer’s operations and reliability at a point in time. By walking
through the lifecycle, from sponsorship to issuance, including maintenance, the operations of an
issuer can be examined as an integrated entity. During the walkthrough, the OIMO (or
designated appointee) shall observe all processes involving the PIV Card or Derived PIV
Credential, comparing them against the requirements defined in the issuer controls. This activity
shall be performed every year after each authorization until re- authorization begins. All
identified deficiencies in reliable operations shall be sent to the DAO for review and analysis.
Any potential impact to the reliability of the issuer’s operations and risk to the organization shall
be documented and presented to the OIMO and the DAO.

                 Subtask 9.1: Observe all the processes involved in getting a PIV Card or a
                 Derived PIV Credential, including those from sponsorship to maintenance.
                 Observe each process and compare its controls against the applicable list of
                 required issuer controls. If an issuer has several facilities, this process should be
                 repeated using randomly selected issuing facilities.
                 Responsibility: OIMO (or designated appointee)
                 Guidance: As part of the walkthrough, the OIMO (or designated appointee)
                 observes the processes followed for new employees and contractors (if different)
                 as well any maintenance processes, such as termination, reissuance, or renewals.
                 The OIMO (or designated appointee) observes each process and compares it
                 against the documented steps for the issuer and the associated issuer controls. An
                 annual walkthrough is required until re-authorization is initiated.
                 Subtask 9.2: The results of the lifecycle walkthrough are summarized in a report
                 to the DAO. Deficiencies must be highlighted, along with corrective actions that
                 must be implemented to correct any deficiencies.
                 Responsibility: OIMO, DAO
                 Guidance: The OIMO (or designated appointee) shall document the results of
                 the walkthrough. The results shall be recorded in the assessment report template
                 included in Appendix E. All deficiencies should be highlighted, and a plan for
                 correcting each deficiency shall be documented. The DAO shall decide if any
                 deficiency is significant enough to require a change of the issuer’s authorization-
                 to-operate status.
