6.7.3       Specifications for iris image matchers
A recognition algorithm is certified on the basis of its speed of computation, and on the error rates observed when it
matches single-eye records. Specifically, a recognition algorithm shall be certified if the following hold.
―     The median time taken to execute comparisons of genuine template pairs is below 0.05 seconds.
―     It matches both compressed Table 9 and Table 11 [IRISSTD] records from all certified record generators with
      FNMR less than or equal to 0.01 at a FMR no larger than 0.0001.

6.7.4       Test methods
The performance specifications of sections 6.7.2 and 6.7.3 shall be tested in an offline test using sequestered image
data. That test shall include visual inspection of the images produced for, and embedded in, the Table 9 records
[IRISSTD, Image Type 7].
INFORMATIVE NOTE         NIST's IREX VIII activity is a program that implements this test.

6.8     Performance specifications for PIV operations
Iris authentication implementations shall be configured according to the specifications of Section 10.
