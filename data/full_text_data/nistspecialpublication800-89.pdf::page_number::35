               •   (If provided by the TTP) use the description of the method(s) used to
                   obtain the times t1 and t2 to determine whether or not to adjust the
                   TTP-provided assurance level(s) (see Sections 6.2, 6.3.1.3 and
                   6.3.2.1).

7 Assurance of Identity
A digital signature verifier may require various levels of assurance of the claimed
signatory’s identity. The verifier may require assurance of the actual identity of the
signatory (e.g., the signatory is the John Smith who works in division 301 of the XYZ
agency), or that the signatory is authorized by agency XYZ to purchase 15 computers, or
that the signatory is device X on network Y; a verifier may allow cases where the
signatory is anonymous.
Requirements for the assurance associated with a signatory’s identity shall be addressed
in an organization’s security policy. A verifier’s requirements for signatory identity shall
be consistent with the requirements for establishing a signatory’s identity.
