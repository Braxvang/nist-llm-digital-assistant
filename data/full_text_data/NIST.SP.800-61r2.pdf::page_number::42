  Category                                                      Definition
  None          No effect to the organization’s ability to provide all services to all users
  Low           Minimal effect; the organization can still provide all critical services to all users but has lost
                efficiency
  Medium        Organization has lost the ability to provide a critical service to a subset of system users
  High          Organization is no longer able to provide some critical services to any users


Table 3-3 provides examples of possible information impact categories that describe the extent of
information compromise that occurred during the incident. In this table, with the exception of the ‘None’
value, the categories are not mutually exclusive and the organization could choose more than one.
                                       Table 3-3. Information Impact Categories

   Category                                                       Definition
  None             No information was exfiltrated, changed, deleted, or otherwise compromised
  Privacy          Sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) of taxpayers, employees, beneficiaries, etc.
  Breach           was accessed or exfiltrated
  Proprietary      Unclassified proprietary information, such as protected critical infrastructure information (PCII),
  Breach           was accessed or exfiltrated
  Integrity        Sensitive or proprietary information was changed or deleted
  Loss


Table 3-4 shows examples of recoverability effort categories that reflect the level of and type of resources
required to recover from the incident.
                                      Table 3-4. Recoverability Effort Categories

        Category                                                    Definition
  Regular               Time to recovery is predictable with existing resources
  Supplemented          Time to recovery is predictable with additional resources
  Extended              Time to recovery is unpredictable; additional resources and outside help are needed
  Not Recoverable       Recovery from the incident is not possible (e.g., sensitive data exfiltrated and posted
                        publicly); launch investigation


Organizations should also establish an escalation process for those instances when the team does not
respond to an incident within the designated time. This can happen for many reasons: for example, cell
phones may fail or people may have personal emergencies. The escalation process should state how long
a person should wait for a response and what to do if no response occurs. Generally, the first step is to
duplicate the initial contact. After waiting for a brief time—perhaps 15 minutes—the caller should
escalate the incident to a higher level, such as the incident response team manager. If that person does not
respond within a certain time, then the incident should be escalated again to a higher level of
management. This process should be repeated until someone responds.
3.2.7     Incident Notification

When an incident is analyzed and prioritized, the incident response team needs to notify the appropriate
individuals so that all who need to be involved will play their roles. Incident response policies should
