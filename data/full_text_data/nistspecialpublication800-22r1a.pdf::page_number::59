A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



          For example in this section, when x = 1,
                 (1− 3(0.5)) 2 (1− 3(0.25)) 2 (0 − 3(0.125)) 2 (1− 3(0.0625)) 2 (0 − 3(0.0312)) 2 (0 − 3(0.0312)) 2
          χ2 =                +              +                +                +                 +
                    3(0.5)        3(0.25)         3(0.125)        3(0.0625)         3(0.0312)         3(0.0312)
          = 4.333033

(8)       For each state of x, compute P-value = igamc(5/2, χ 2 ( obs ) 2 ) . Eight P-values will be
          produced.

                                                            5 4.333033 
          For the example when x = 1, P-value = igamc        ,          = 0.502529.
                                                           2      2    

2.14.5 Decision Rule (at the 1% Level)
If the computed P-value is < 0.01, then conclude that the sequence is non-random. Otherwise, conclude
that the sequence is random.


2.14.6 Conclusion and Interpretation of Results
Since the P-value obtained in step 8 of Section 2.14.4 is ≥ 0.01 (P-value = 0.502529), the conclusion is
that the sequence is random.

Note that if χ2(obs) were too large, then the sequence would have displayed a deviation from the
theoretical distribution for a given state across all cycles.

2.14.7 Input Size Recommendation
It is recommended that each sequence to be tested consist of a minimum of 1,000,000 bits (i.e., n ≥ 106).

2.14.8 Example
(input)     ε = "the binary expansion of e up to 1,000,000 bits"

(input)            n = 1000000 = 106

(processing)       J = 1490

(conclusion)       For seven of the states of x, the P-value is ≥ 0.01, and the conclusion would be that the
                   sequence was random. However, for one state of x (x = -1), the P-value is < 0.01, so the
                   conclusion would be that the sequence is non-random. When contradictions arise, further
                   sequences should be examined to determine whether or not this behavior is typical of the
                   generator.
