      NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1

526   3.2.1. X.509 Certificate for Digital Signature
527   The X.509 Certificate for Digital Signature and its associated private key, as defined in FIPS
528   201, support the use of digital signatures for the purpose of document signing. The digital
529   signature private key and its corresponding certificate are only available over the contact
530   interface or VCI. The read access control rule for the X.509 Certificate for Digital Signing is
531   “Always,” meaning that the certificate CAN be read without access control restrictions. The PKI
532   cryptographic function (see Table 5) is protected with a “PIN Always” or “OCC Always” access
533   rule. In other words, the PIN or OCC data must be submitted and verified every time
534   immediately before a digital signature key operation. This ensures cardholder participation every
535   time the private key is used for digital signature generation. 2

536   3.2.2. X.509 Certificate for Key Management
537   The X.509 Certificate for Key Management and its associated private key, as defined in FIPS
538   201, support the use of encryption for the purpose of confidentiality. The key management
539   private key and its corresponding certificate are only available over the contact interface or VCI.
540   This key pair MAY be escrowed by the issuer for key recovery purposes. The read access control
541   rule for the X.509 certificate is “Always,” meaning that the certificate CAN be read without
542   access control restrictions. The PKI cryptographic function (see Table 5) is protected with a
543   “PIN” or “OCC” access rule. In other words, once the PIN or OCC data is submitted and
544   verified, subsequent key management key operations CAN be performed without requiring the
545   PIN or OCC data again. This enables multiple private key operations without additional
546   cardholder consent.

547              Optional Data Elements
548   When implemented, the 27 optional data elements of FIPS 201 SHALL conform to the
549   specifications provided in this document.

550   3.3.1. Printed Information
551   All FIPS 201 mandatory information printed on the card is duplicated on the chip in that data
552   object. The printed information data object SHALL NOT be modified post-issuance. The
553   Security Object enforces integrity of this information according to the issuer. This provides
554   specific protection that the card information must match the printed information, mitigating
555   alteration risks on the printed media.

556   3.3.2. Discovery Object
557   If implemented, the Discovery Object is the 0x7E interindustry ISO/IEC 7816-6 template that
558   nests interindustry data objects. For the Discovery Object, the 0x7E template nests two

      signatures.
