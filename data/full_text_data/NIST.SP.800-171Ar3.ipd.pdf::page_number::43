1248   3.4.5. Access Restrictions for Change
1249           REQUIREMENT: 03.04.05

1250           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
1251           Determine if:
1252           A.03.04.05[01]: physical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are defined
1253           and documented.
1254           A.03.04.05[02]: physical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are
1255           approved.
1256           A.03.04.05[03]: physical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are enforced.
1257           A.03.04.05[04]: logical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are defined
1258           and documented.
1259           A.03.04.05[05]: logical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are approved.
1260           A.03.04.05[06]: logical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are enforced.

1261           ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
1262           Examine
1263           [SELECT FROM: configuration management policy and procedures; procedures for access
1264           restrictions for system changes; configuration management plan; system design documentation;
1265           system architecture; system configuration settings; logical access approvals; physical access
1266           approvals; access credentials; change control records; system audit records; system security
1267           plan; other relevant documents or records]
1268           Interview
1269           [SELECT FROM: personnel with logical access control responsibilities; personnel with physical
1270           access control responsibilities; personnel with information security responsibilities; system
1271           administrators]
