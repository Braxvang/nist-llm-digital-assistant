       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                     Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                            and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1324                    Subtask 2.3: Determine the resources and the time needed for the assessment of
1325                    the issuer, and prepare a plan to execute the assessment.
1326                    Responsibility: EIMO, Assessor, DAO
1327                    Guidance: The level of effort required for an assessment depends on numerous
1328                    factors, such as (i) the size of the issuer, (ii) the location and number of its
1329                    facilities, (iii) the level of outsourcing utilized by the issuer, and (iv) the number
1330                    of cards and/or derived PIV credentials being issued. By examining factors that
1331                    could influence the complexity of the assessment, the organization can make an
1332                    informed judgment about the size of the assessment team, the resources needed to
1333                    support the assessment, and the time frame for completing it.
1334           Task 3: Operations Plan Analysis and Acceptance
1335           The objectives of the operations plan analysis and acceptance task are to (i) determine
1336           whether the requirements of [FIPS201] have been implemented, (ii) evaluate the
1337           operations plan and revise as needed, and (iii) obtain acceptance of the plan by the DAO
1338           prior to assessing the issuer controls.
1339                    Subtask 3.1: Review the list of required issuer controls documented in the
1340                    organization’s issuer operations plan, and confirm that they have been
1341                    implemented properly.
1342                    Responsibility: DAO, EIMO
1343                    Guidance: Since the issuer controls serve as the basis for the assessment, review
1344                    the operations plan and supporting documentation to identify the controls that
1345                    need to be implemented before investing time in assessment activities, such as
1346                    interviews or testing. The operations plan documents each issuer control (whether
1347                    it is specific to the organization or facility), the owner of the issuer control, and
1348                    how the control is implemented.
1349                    Subtask 3.2: Analyze the operations plan to determine whether there are
1350                    deficiencies in satisfying all of the policies, procedures, and other requirements in
1351                    [FIPS201] that could result in a DATO being issued. After discussing the
1352                    discovered deficiencies in the documentation and operations plan with the EIMO,
1353                    the organization may still want to continue with the assessment if it has
1354                    determined that it can address all deficiencies within the time period of the current
1355                    assessment. In this situation, the DAO either authorizes continuation of the
1356                    assessment or terminates the assessment effort, depending on the evaluation of the
1357                    issuer’s ability to address the deficiencies.
1358                    Responsibility: DAO, EIMO
1359                    Guidance: The operations plan adequately addresses the policies, procedures, and
1360                    processes of the issuer so that after an initial review, deficiencies that could lead
1361                    to an eventual DATO can be identified and remediated as soon as possible.
1362                    Subtask 3.3: Verify that the operations plan is acceptable.
1363                    Responsibility: DAO
