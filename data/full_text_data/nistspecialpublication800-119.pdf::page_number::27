  3.1.1     Shorthand for Writing IPv6 Addresses

Due to their length, IPv6 addresses do not lend themselves to human memorization. Administrators of
IPv4 networks typically can recall multiple IPv4 network and host addresses; remembering multiple IPv6
network and host addresses is more challenging. The notation for IPv6 addresses may be compressed and
simplified under specific circumstances.

One to three zeroes that appear as the leading digits in any colon-delimited hexadecimal grouping may be
dropped. This simplifies the address and makes it easier to read and to write. For example:

                          2001:0db8:0aba:02e5:0000:0ee9:0000:0444/48 becomes
                          2001:db8:aba:2e5:0:ee9:0:444/48

It is important to note that trailing zeroes may not be dropped, because they have intrinsic place value in
the address format.

Further efficiency is gained by combining all-zero portions of the address. Any colon-delimited portion
of an address containing all zeros may be compressed so that nothing appears between the leading and
trailing colons. For example:

                          2001:0db8:0055:0000:cd23:0000:0000:0205/48 becomes
                          2001:db8:55:0:cd23::205/48

In this example, the sixth and seventh 16-bit groupings contain all zeroes; they were compressed by
eliminating the zeroes completely, as well as the colon that divided the two groupings. Nevertheless,
compressing an address by removing one or more consecutive colons between groups of zeroes may only
be done once per address. The fourth 16 bit-grouping in the example also contains all zeroes, but in the
condensed form of the address, it is represented with a single zero. A choice had to be made as to which
group of zeroes was to be compressed. The example address could be written:

          2001:db8:55::cd23:0:0:205/48, but this is not as efficient as 2001:db8:55:0:cd23::205/48.

It is important to note that both of the addresses in the preceding paragraph are properly formatted, but the
latter address is shorter. Compression is just a convention for writing addresses, it does not affect how an
address is used, and it makes no difference whether compression falls within the network prefix, host
identifier, or across both portions of the address.
