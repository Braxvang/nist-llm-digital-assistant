  Table 20. Sensor, final element, and asset management vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions

             Vulnerability                                             Description
  Unauthorized physical access to     Physical access to sensors and final elements allows for direct
  sensors or final elements           manipulation of the physical process. Many devices are configured on a
                                      fieldbus such that physical access to the sensor network allows for
                                      manipulation of controlling parameters. Physical access to the whole of
                                      the loop should be managed to prevent incidents.
  Unauthorized wireless access to     Wireless access to sensors and final elements allows for direct
  sensors or final elements           manipulation of the physical process. Many smart devices allow for
                                      wireless configuration (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, WirelessHART). Wireless
                                      access should be securely configured or disabled using hardware write-
                                      protect where possible to prevent unauthorized modification of the sensors
                                      and final elements that are connected to both the physical process and the
                                      OT environment.
  Inappropriate segmentation of the   Most architectures are designed for PLCs, RTUs, DCS, and SCADA
  asset management system             controllers to manipulate the process and for asset management systems to
                                      monitor the assets connected to the controllers. Many asset management
                                      systems also have the technical ability to modify the configuration of
                                      sensors and final elements, although modification may not be their
                                      primary function. The asset management system should be controlled
                                      appropriately based on its ability (or lack of ability) to manipulate the
                                      process.


C.3.    Threat Events and Incidents
A threat event is an event or situation that could potentially cause an undesirable consequence or
impact to operations resulting from some threat source. NIST SP 800-30, Rev. 1 [SP800-30r1]
Appendix E identifies a broad set of threat events that could potentially impact information
systems. The properties of OT may also present unique threat events, such as how the threat
events can manipulate OT processes to cause physical damage. Table 21 provides an overview
of potential OT threat events and leverages MITRE’s ATT&CK® for Industrial Control Systems
[ATTACK-ICS].

            Threat Event                                               Description
  Denial of control                   Temporarily prevents operators and engineers from interfacing with
                                      process controls. An affected process may still be operating during the
                                      period of control loss but not necessarily in a desired state.
  Manipulation of control             Unauthorized changes made to programmed instructions in PLCs, RTUs,
                                      DCS, or SCADA controllers, alarm thresholds changed, or unauthorized
                                      commands issued to control equipment. These changes could potentially
                                      result in damage to equipment (if tolerances are exceeded), premature
                                      shutdown of processes (e.g., prematurely shutting down transmission
                                      lines), an environmental incident, or even disabled control equipment.
  Spoofed reporting message           False information sent to an OT system operator, either for evasion or to
                                      impair process control. The adversary could make the defenders and
                                      operators think that other errors are occurring in order to distract them
                                      from the actual source of the problem (i.e., alarm floods).
  Theft of operational information    Adversaries may steal operational information for personal gain or to
                                      inform future operations.
