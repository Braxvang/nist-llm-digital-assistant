1082   Agencies SHOULD use tags 0x02, 0x07 and 0x08 to successfully match the printed information
1083   for verification on Zone 8F (Employee Affiliation) and Zone 10F (Agency, Department, or
1084   Organization) on the face of the card with the printed information stored electronically on the
1085   card.

          This is the recommended length. The certificate that signed the Facial Image data element (tag 0xBC) can be stored in the CHUID or in the
       Facial Image data element itself. For the latter, the “Max. Bytes” value quoted is a recommendation, and the signer certificate in
       CBEFF_SIGNATURE_BLOCK can exceed the “Max. Bytes.” Note that the use of separate content signing keys for biometric data and CHUID
       has been deprecated in FIPS 201-3. In future revisions, the CHUID and biometric elements will be signed with the same key. The content signing
       certificate will not be found in this data element but instead will be contained in the CHUID data element. Hence, the size will be as indicated in
       the table.

          This is the recommended length. The certificate size can exceed the indicated length value.
