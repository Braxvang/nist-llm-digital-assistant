   •      Would unauthorized disclosure/dissemination of elements of the information type violate
          laws, executive orders, or agency regulations?
4.2.2.2      Integrity Factors
Using the FIPS 199 potential impact criteria summarized in Table 7, each information type
should be evaluated for integrity with respect to the impact level associated with unauthorized
modification or destruction of (i) each known variant of the information belonging to the type
and (ii) each use of the information by the system under review. Answers to the following
questions will help in the evaluation process:
   •      How can a malicious adversary use the unauthorized modification or destruction of
          information to do limited/serious/severe harm to agency operations, agency assets, or
          individuals?
   •      Would unauthorized modification/destruction of elements of the information type violate
          laws, executive orders, or agency regulations?
Unauthorized modification or destruction of information can take many forms. The changes can
be subtle and hard to detect, or they can occur on a massive scale. One can construct an
extraordinarily wide range of scenarios for modification of information and its likely
consequences. Just a few examples include forging or modifying information to:
   •      Reduce public confidence in an agency;
   •      Fraudulently achieve financial gain;
   •      Create confusion or controversy by promulgating a fraudulent or incorrect procedure;
   •      Initiate confusion or controversy through false attribution of a fraudulent or false policy;
   •      Influence personnel decisions;
   •      Interfere with or manipulate law enforcement or legal processes;
   •      Influence legislation; or
   •      Achieve unauthorized access to government information or facilities.
In most cases, the most serious impacts of integrity compromise occur when some action is taken
that is based on the modified information or the modified information is disseminated to other
organizations or the public.
Undetected loss of integrity can be catastrophic for many information types. The consequences
of integrity compromise can be either direct (e.g., modification of a financial entry, medical alert,
or criminal record) or indirect (e.g., facilitation of unauthorized access to sensitive or private
information or deny access to information or information system services). Malicious use of
write access to information and information systems can do enormous harm to an agency’s
mission and can be employed to use an agency system as a proxy for attacks on other systems.
In many cases, the consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of information to
agency mission functions and public confidence in the agency can be expected to be limited. In
other cases, integrity compromises can result in the endangerment of human life or other severe
consequences. The impact can be particularly severe in the case of time-critical information.
