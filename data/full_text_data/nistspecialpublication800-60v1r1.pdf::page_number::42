•   Contingency and Disaster Recovery Planning: Contingency and disaster recovery
    planning personnel should review information systems that have multiple data types of
    varying impact levels and consider grouping applications with similar information system
    impact levels with sufficiently protected infrastructures. This ensures efficient application
    of the correct contingency and disaster protection security controls and avoids the over
    protection of lower impact information systems.
•   Information Sharing and System Interconnection Agreements: Agency personnel should
    utilize aggregated and individual security categorization information when assessing
    interagency connections. For example, knowing that information processed on a high
    impact information system is flowing to another agency’s moderate impact information
    system should cause both agencies to evaluate the security categorization information, the
    implemented or resulting security controls, and the risk associated with interconnecting
    systems. The results of this evaluation may substantiate the need for additional security
    controls in the form of a Service Level Agreement, information systems upgrades,
    additional mitigating security controls, or alternative means of sharing the required
    information.
