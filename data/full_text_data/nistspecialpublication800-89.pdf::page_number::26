SP 800-89                                                                    November 2006



   a. If t2 – t1 ≤ d units, and the source of t1 is at least as trustworthy as the source of t2,
      then time t1 shall be used as the assurance_time.
   b. If t2 – t1 ≤ d units, and the source of t1 is less trustworthy than t2, then time t2 shall
      be used as the assurance_time.
   c. If t2 – t1 > d units, then assurance of possession has not been provided, and there
      is no value assigned to assurance_time.
If the assurance signature cannot be verified, then assurance of private key possession has
not been provided, and there is no value assigned to assurance_time.
6.3.1.3 Assigning the Initial Assurance Level for an Assurance Signature
Following the successful verification of an assurance signature and the assignment of the
assurance_time (see Section 6.3.1.2), the initial level of assurance (LOW, MEDIUM or
HIGH) should be assigned as follows:
   a. If the time used to determine the assurance_time was obtained from a timestamp
      token provided by a TTA trusted by the relying parties, then the initial assurance
      level is HIGH.
   b. If the time used to determine the assurance_time was not obtained from a TTA,
      but was obtained by the verifier from a source whose accuracy is trusted by the
      relying parties, then the initial assurance level is MEDIUM.
   c. If the time used to determine the assurance_time was obtained by the verifier
      from a source of unknown accuracy, then the initial assurance level is LOW.

6.3.2 Obtaining Assurance of Possession via the Regeneration of Keys
Regeneration may be performed by the key pair owner or by a TTP who is provided with
the key pair currently held by the owner. When assurance of possession is first explicitly
provided/obtained by regeneration, one or both keys of the key pair shall be regenerated
using different routines and/or a different processor than that used during the original key
generation process. On subsequent occasions requiring provision of assurance of
possession, the regeneration may be performed using the same routines, and/or the same
processor that was used previously. Assurance of private key possession shall only be
successfully obtained by the relying parties if the regenerated key(s) are the same as the
key(s) currently held by the owner.
The regeneration method is different for each digital signature algorithm in FIPS 186-3.
For example, for DSA and ECDSA, the public key can be regenerated from the private
key. For RSA, the private exponent and the modulus may be regenerated from the public
exponent and the prime factors of the modulus (if known).

Section 6.2 and Figure 2 may also be used to describe the use of regeneration as a method
for obtaining assurance of private key possession, where:
