NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                  Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

       Note 1: This includes the approach to enable the continuous secure operation and use of the
       system and its security services, as well as the provision of support to operations elements to
       address anomalies identified during the operation and use of the system. It also includes:
       - The capacity, availability, schedule considerations, and security of products or services as
           they are introduced, routinely operated, and disposed (including contingency operations)
       - The human resources strategy and security qualification requirements for personnel,
           including all associated security-relevant training and personnel compliance requirements
       - The security aspects of release and re-acceptance criteria and schedules of the system to
           permit modifications that sustain the security aspects of existing or enhanced products or
           services
       - The approach to implement operational modes in the System Operational Concept,
           including normal and contingency operations
       - The secure approaches for contingency, degraded, alternative, training, and other modes of
           operation, as well as the transition within and between modes while considering resilience
           in the face of adversity
       - Measures for operation that will provide security insights into performance levels
       - The approach to achieving situational awareness to determine security-relevant
           consequences
       Note 2: This includes planning for securely starting the system, halting the system, shutting the
       system down, operating the system in a training mode, the secure implementation of work-
       around procedures to restore operations, performing back-out and restore operations,
       operating in any degraded mode, or alternative modes for special conditions. If needed, the
       operator performs the necessary steps to enter into contingency operations and possibly power
       down the system. Contingency operations are performed in accordance with the pre-established
       procedures for such an event.
       Note 3: There may be a need to plan for certain modes of operation for which security functions
       and services are reduced or eliminated to achieve more critical system functions and services or
       to carry out certain maintenance or periodic testing. Predetermined procedures for entering
       and exiting such modes would be followed.
       OP-1.2 Identify the constraints and objectives that result from the security aspects of operation
              to be incorporated into the system requirements, architecture, and design.
       OP-1.3 Identify the security aspects for enabling systems and services needed to support
              operation.
       OP-1.4 Identify and plan for enabling systems or services needed to support the security
              aspects of operation.
       OP-1.5 Obtain or acquire access to the security aspects of enabling systems or services to be
              used in operation.
       OP-1.6 Identify or define security training and qualification requirements to sustain the
              workforce needed for secure system operation.
       Note: Security qualification and training includes role and function-oriented competency,
       proficiency, certification, and other criteria to securely operate and use the system in all of its
       defined modes or states.
