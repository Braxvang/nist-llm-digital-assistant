Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish Health Care Administration information. Health
Care Administration information is generally tolerant of delay. Typically, disruption of Health
Care Administration information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
Health Care Administration information is low.

D.14.4 Health Care Delivery Services Information Type

Health Care Delivery Services provides and supports the delivery of health care to its
beneficiaries. This includes assessing health status; planning health services; ensuring quality of
services and continuity of care; and managing clinical information and documentation. The
recommended provisional security categorization for health care delivery services information is
as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, High), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of health care delivery
services on the ability of responsible agencies to provide and support the delivery of health care
to its beneficiaries will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or
individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Some information associated with
health care involves confidential patient information subject to the Privacy Act and to HIPAA.
The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity
and Authentication information type. Other information (e.g., information proprietary to
hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, insurers, and care givers) must be protected under rules
governing proprietary information and procurement management. In some cases, unauthorized
disclosure of this information such as privacy-protected medical records can have serious
consequences for agency operations. In such cases, the confidentiality impact level may be
moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for disclosure of health care delivery services information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Many activities associated with health care delivery services are not time critical and the adverse
effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of health care information on agency mission
functions and/or public confidence in the agency will be limited. However, the consequences of
