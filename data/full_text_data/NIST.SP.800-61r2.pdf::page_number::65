                                                                   COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE



Scenario 7: Disappearing Host
On a Thursday afternoon, a network intrusion detection sensor records vulnerability scanning activity
directed at internal hosts that is being generated by an internal IP address. Because the intrusion detection
analyst is unaware of any authorized, scheduled vulnerability scanning activity, she reports the activity to
the incident response team. When the team begins the analysis, it discovers that the activity has stopped
and that there is no longer a host using the IP address.
The following are additional questions for this scenario:
    1. What data sources might contain information regarding the identity of the vulnerability scanning
       host?
    2. How would the team identify who had been performing the vulnerability scans?
    3. How would the handling of this incident differ if the vulnerability scanning were directed at the
       organization’s most critical hosts?
    4. How would the handling of this incident differ if the vulnerability scanning were directed at
       external hosts?
    5. How would the handling of this incident differ if the internal IP address was associated with the
       organization’s wireless guest network?
    6. How would the handling of this incident differ if the physical security staff discovered that
       someone had broken into the facility half an hour before the vulnerability scanning occurred?

Scenario 8: Telecommuting Compromise
On a Saturday night, network intrusion detection software records an inbound connection originating
from a watchlist IP address. The intrusion detection analyst determines that the connection is being made
to the organization’s VPN server and contacts the incident response team. The team reviews the intrusion
detection, firewall, and VPN server logs and identifies the user ID that was authenticated for the session
and the name of the user associated with the user ID.
The following are additional questions for this scenario:
    1. What should the team’s next step be (e.g., calling the user at home, disabling the user ID,
       disconnecting the VPN session)? Why should this step be performed first? What step should be
       performed second?
    2. How would the handling of this incident differ if the external IP address belonged to an open
       proxy?
    3. How would the handling of this incident differ if the ID had been used to initiate VPN
       connections from several external IP addresses without the knowledge of the user?
    4. Suppose that the identified user’s computer had become compromised by a game containing a
       Trojan horse that was downloaded by a family member. How would this affect the team’s
       analysis of the incident? How would this affect evidence gathering and handling? What should
       the team do in terms of eradicating the incident from the user’s computer?
    5. Suppose that the user installed antivirus software and determined that the Trojan horse had
       included a keystroke logger. How would this affect the handling of the incident? How would this
       affect the handling of the incident if the user were a system administrator? How would this affect
       the handling of the incident if the user were a high-ranking executive in the organization?
