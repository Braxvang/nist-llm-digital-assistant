                                          ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



In conjunction with the ratification of the IEEE 802.11i amendment, the Wi-Fi Alliance introduced
WPA2, its term for interoperable equipment that is capable of supporting IEEE 802.11i requirements. 7
The Wi-Fi Alliance began testing IEEE 802.11i products for WPA2 certification shortly after the IEEE
802.11i amendment was finalized. Section 7 provides more information on WPA and WPA2.

2.1.3    Other Wireless Standards

In addition to the IEEE 802.11 and WPA standards, other wireless standards are also in use. These
standards are unrelated to IEEE 802.11, but are presented in this section to provide context and illustrate
how IEEE 802.11 and other standards meet different needs. The following list describes the major
wireless architecture categories and provides examples of selected key current and emerging wireless
standards.

      Wireless personal area networks (WPAN): small-scale wireless networks that require little or
       no infrastructure. A WPAN is typically used by a few devices in a single room instead of
       connecting the devices with cables. For example, WPANs can provide print services or enable a
       wireless keyboard or mouse to communicate with a computer. Examples of WPAN standards
       include the following:
         -    IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth). This WPAN standard is designed for wireless networking
              between small portable devices. The original Bluetooth operated at 2.4 GHz and has a
              maximum data rate of approximately 720 kilobits per second (Kbps); Bluetooth 2.0 can reach
              3 Mbps. 8
         -    IEEE 802.15.3 (High-Rate Ultrawideband; WiMedia, Wireless USB). This is a low-cost,
              low power consumption WPAN standard that uses a wide range of GHz frequencies to avoid
              interference with other wireless transmissions. It can achieve data rates of up to 480 Mbps
              over short ranges and can support the full range of WPAN applications. One expected use of
              this technology is the ability to detect shapes through physical barriers such as walls and
              boxes, which could be useful for applications ranging from law enforcement to search and
              rescue operations.
         -    IEEE 802.15.4 (Low-Rate Ultrawideband; ZigBee). This is a simple protocol for
              lightweight WPANs. 9 It is most commonly used for monitoring and control products, such as
              climate control systems and building lighting.
      Wireless local area networks (WLAN). IEEE 802.11 is the dominant WLAN standard, but
       others have also been defined. For example, the European Telecommunications Standards
       Institute (ETSI) has published the High Performance Radio Local Area Network
       (HIPERLAN) WLAN standard that transmits data in the 5 GHz band and operates at data rates
       of approximately 23.5 Mbps. 10 However, HIPERLAN appears to have been supplanted by IEEE
       802.11 in the commercial arena.
      Wireless metropolitan area networks (WMAN): networks that can provide connectivity to
       users located in multiple facilities that are generally within a few miles of each other. Many
       WMAN implementations provide wireless broadband access to customers in metropolitan areas.
       For example, IEEE 802.16e (better known as WiMAX) is a WMAN standard that transmits in the

     WPA2 does not test interoperability of ad hoc operation (IBSS) or pre-authentication for IEEE 802.11i.
