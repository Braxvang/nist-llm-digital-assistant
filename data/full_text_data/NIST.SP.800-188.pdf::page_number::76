 Data adjective        Description
 Datasets without formal guarantees:
 Partially synthetic   Data produced by selectively replacing rows, columns, or cells in
                       an existing data set with values produced by a statistical model [96]
                       or by the addition of unrelated statistical noise. This approach is
                       sometimes called blank-and-impute ( Sec. 4.4.1).


 Datasets with formal guarantees if the original dataset is not used to create the data:
 Test                  Data that resemble the original dataset in terms of structure and
                       the range of values but for which there is no attempt to ensure that
                       inferences drawn on the test data will be like those drawn on the
                       original data. Test data may also include extreme values that are not
                       in the original data but are present for testing software ( Sec. 4.4.2).
 Realistic             Better for clarity: Data that have a characteristic that is like the orig-
                       inal data but (1) are not developed by modifying the original data
                       and (2) contain no information that is privacy-sensitive ( Sec. 4.4.3).

 Datasets with formal guarantees when formal techniques are used:
 Fully synthetic       Data produced by applying the techniques of partial synthesis to ev-
                       ery row, column, and cell such that there is no one-to-one mapping
                       between the records of the original and synthetic datasets.

   1. Sampling an existing dataset and either adding noise to specifc cells that are likely
      to have a high risk of disclosure or replacing those cells with imputed values. This is
      known as a “partially synthetic” dataset (see Table 3).
   2. Using the existing dataset to create a model and then using that model to create a
      synthetic dataset. This is known as a “fully synthetic” dataset (see Table 3).
In both cases, formal privacy techniques can be used to quantify the privacy protection
offered by the synthetic dataset.

4.4.1.   Partially Synthetic Data
A partially synthetic dataset is one in which an existing dataset is sampled, and either noise
is added to specifc cells that are likely to have a high risk of disclosure, or else the contents
of those cells are replaced with imputed values that are typically based on probabilistic
