                              Federal S/MIME V3 Client Profile


        2) Loading certificates from commonly used (e.g., *.cer and *.crt (binary encoded
           certificates)) file extension types.
      Note: Lookup of certificates (and chains of certificates) from a LDAP repository is
      required as stated in Clause 2.2.2.

4.6 Importing/Exporting PKCS #12 Credentials
S/MIME agents SHOULD have the capability to import PKCS #12 objects as defined in
[PKCS#12].

4.7 Notes on Testing and Scope
   • Some testing requires “human scoring” because a user interface is involved. For example,
     as stated in Clause 2.3.2:
       “S/MIME implementations MUST ensure that either the SubjectAltName.rfc822Name
       or PKCS#9 emailAddress in the signer's certificate matches the actual e-mail address
       used in the received message's “From” or “Sender” field (See [RFC3280] and
       [RFC2632].) If the addresses do not match, the S/MIME implementation MUST
       display information to the user to allow the user to accept or reject the message.

        There is no efficient method to automate verification that the S/MIME implementation
        actually displays the mismatch information. Thus, human scoring is required to
        evaluate the implementation’s conformance to this requirement.

  •   Security of operating system and e-mail mechanisms are beyond the scope of this profile.
      For example, system operators must ensure that the operating system itself is secured, and
      that the e-mail system is secure. This profile addresses only the security aspects of IETF-
      developed S/MIME extensions.
