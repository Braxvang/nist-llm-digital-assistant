GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



        –   Users and Groups. The OS keeps a record of its user accounts and groups. Account
            information may include group membership, account name and description, account
            permissions, account status (e.g., active, disabled), and the path to the account’s home
            directory.

        –   Password Files. The OS may store password hashes in data files. Various password-
            cracking utilities may be used to convert a password hash to its clear text equivalent for
            certain OSs.

        –   Scheduled Jobs. The OS maintains a list of scheduled tasks that are to be performed
            automatically at a certain time (e.g., perform a virus scan every week). Information that can
            be gleaned from this include the task name, the program used to perform the task, command
            line switches and arguments, and the days and times when the task is to be performed.
    ! Logs. OS log files contain information about various OS events, and may also hold application-
      specific event information. Depending on the OS, logs may be stored in text files, proprietary-
      format binary files, or databases. Some OSs write log entries to two or more separate files. The
      types of information typically found in OS logs are as follows:

        –   System Events. System events are operational actions performed by OS components, such
            as shutting down the system or starting a service. Typically, failed events and the most
            significant successful events are logged, but many OSs permit system administrators to
            specify which types of events will be logged. The details logged for each event also vary
            widely. Each event is usually timestamped; other supporting information could include event
            codes, status codes, and username.

        –   Audit Records. Audit records contain security event information such as successful and
            failed authentication attempts and security policy changes. OSs typically permit system
            administrators to specify which types of events should be audited. Administrators also can
            configure some OSs to log successful, failed, or all attempts to perform certain actions.

        –   Application Events. Application events are significant operational actions performed by
            applications, such as application startup and shutdown, application failures, and major
            application configuration changes. Section 7 contains more information on application event
            logging.

        –   Command History. Some OSs have separate log files (typically for each user) that contain a
            history of the OS commands performed by each user.

        –   Recently Accessed Files. An OS might log the most recent file accesses or other usage,
            creating a list of the most recently accessed files.
    ! Application Files. Applications can be composed of many types of files, including executables,
      scripts, documentation, configuration files, log files, history files, graphics, sounds, and icons.
      Section 7 provides an in-depth discussion of application files.
    ! Data Files. Data files store information for applications. Examples of common data files are text
      files, word processing documents, spreadsheets, databases, audio files, and graphics files. In
      addition, when data is printed, most OSs create one or more temporary print files that contain the
      print-ready version of the data. Sections 4 and 7 discuss application data files in more depth.
    ! Swap Files. Most OSs use swap files in conjunction with RAM to provide temporary storage for
      data often used by applications. Swap files essentially extend the amount of memory available to
