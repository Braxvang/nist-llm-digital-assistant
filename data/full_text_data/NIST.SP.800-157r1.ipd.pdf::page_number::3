49   This publication has been developed by NIST in accordance with its statutory
50   responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA)
51   of 2014, 44 U.S.C. ยง 3551 et seq., Public Law (P.L.) 113-283. NIST is responsible
52   for developing information security standards and guidelines, including minimum
53   requirements for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall
54   not apply to national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal
55   officials exercising policy authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with
56   the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130.
57   Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines
58   made mandatory and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under
59   statutory authority. Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding
60   the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other
61   federal official. This publication may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a
62   voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the United States. Attribution would,
