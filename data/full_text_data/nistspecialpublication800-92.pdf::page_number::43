                                                                              GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



          –    How long each type of log data must or should be preserved (at both the system level and the
               infrastructure level)46

          –    How unneeded log data must or should be disposed of (at both the system level and the
               infrastructure level)

          –    How much log storage space must or should be available (at both the system level and the
               infrastructure level)

          –    How log preservation requests, such as a legal requirement to prevent the alteration and
               destruction of particular log records, must be handled (e.g., how the impacted logs must be
               marked, stored, and protected)
      Log analysis

          –    How often each type of log data must or should be analyzed (at both the system level and the
               infrastructure level)

          –    Who must or should be able to access the log data (at both the system level and the
               infrastructure level), and how such accesses should be logged

          –    What must or should be done when suspicious activity or an anomaly is identified47

          –    How the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the results of log analysis (e.g., alerts,
               reports) must or should be protected while in storage (at both the system level and the
               infrastructure level) and in transit

          –    How inadvertent disclosures of sensitive information recorded in logs, such as passwords or
               the contents of e-mails, should be handled.
An organization’s policies should also address who within an organization can establish and manage log
management infrastructures.

Organizations should also ensure that other policies, guidelines, and procedures that have some
relationship to logging incorporate and support these log management requirements and
recommendations, and also comply with functional and operational requirements. An example is
ensuring that software procurement and custom application development activities take log management
requirements into consideration.

Table 4-1 provides examples of the types of logging configuration settings to be specified in policies.
Organizations should not adopt these values as-is, but instead use them as a starting point for determining
44
     An example of protecting availability is making multiple copies of log data and storing them in separate locations so that the
     data will still be available even if one copy is damaged or destroyed.

     For more information on preserving logs in a forensically sound manner, see NIST SP 800-86, Guide to Integrating
     Forensic Techniques into Incident Response, which is available at http://csrc nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/.

     This can have a significant effect on digital forensics in several ways. First, data regarding a particular event could be
     needed weeks or months after the event occurred. Second, forensic analysis, such as queries of logs, might be significantly
     slowed by certain storage media (e.g.., loading archived logs from tape instead of directly querying online log files). Third,
     forensic analysis could also be slowed if data is not stored where the analyst is, such as a local analyst not having access to
     the remote centralized log storage. Organizations should keep digital forensics needs in mind when setting log storage
     requirements and designing a log management infrastructure.

     This item should already be addressed by an organization’s incident response-related policies. It is outside the scope of this
     publication to provide guidance on how anomalies and suspicious activity should be handled. For more information on
     incident handling, see NIST SP 800-61, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, which is available at
     http://csrc nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/.
