                                                                           GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



the single most important aspect of effective server security. Organizations should also consider the fact
that, in general, technical solutions are not a substitute for skilled and experienced personnel.

When considering the human resource implications of developing and deploying a server, organizations
should consider the following:

 Required Personnel—What types of personnel are required? Examples of possible positions are
  system administrators, server administrators, network administrators, and ISSOs.

 Required Skills—What are the required skills to adequately plan, develop, and maintain the server in
  a secure manner? Examples include OS administration, network administration, and programming.

 Available Personnel—What are the available human resources within the organization? In addition,
  what are their current skill sets and are they sufficient for supporting the server? Often, an
  organization discovers that its existing human resources are not sufficient and needs to consider the
  following options:

    –   Train Current Staff—If personnel are available but they do not have the requisite skills, the
        organization may choose to train the existing staff in the skills required. Although this is an
        excellent option, the organization should ensure that employees meet all prerequisites for training.

    –   Acquire Additional Staff—If not enough staff members are available or they do not have the
        requisite skills, it may be necessary to hire additional personnel or use external resources.

Once the organization has staffed the project and the server is active, it will be necessary to ensure the
number and skills of the personnel are still adequate. The threat and vulnerability levels of IT systems,
including servers, are constantly changing, as is the technology. This means that what is adequate today
may not be tomorrow, so staffing needs should be reassessed periodically and additional training and
other skills-building activities conducted as needed.
