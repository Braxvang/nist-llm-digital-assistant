                                                            SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



Executive Summary

The Internet is the world’s largest computing network, with hundreds of million of users. From the
perspective of a user, each node or resource on this network is identified by a unique name—the domain
name—such as www.nist.gov. However, from the perspective of network equipment that routes
communications across the Internet, the unique identifier for a resource is an Internet Protocol (IP)
address, such as 172.30.128.27. To access Internet resources by user-friendly domain names rather than
IP addresses, users need a system that translates domain names to IP addresses and back. This translation
is the primary task of an engine called the Domain Name System (DNS).

The DNS infrastructure is made up of computing and communication entities that are geographically
distributed throughout the world. There are more than 250 top-level domains, such as .gov and .com, and
several million second-level domains, such as nist.gov and ietf.org. Accordingly, there are many name
servers in the DNS infrastructure, which each contain information about a small portion of the domain
name space. The DNS infrastructure functions through collaboration among the various entities involved.
The domain name data provided by DNS is intended to be available to any computer located anywhere in
the Internet.

This document provides deployment guidelines for securing DNS within an enterprise. Because DNS data
is meant to be public, preserving the confidentiality of DNS data pertaining to publicly accessible IT
resources is not a concern. The primary security goals for DNS are data integrity and source
authentication, which are needed to ensure the authenticity of domain name information and maintain the
integrity of domain name information in transit. This document provides extensive guidance on
maintaining data integrity and performing source authentication. Availability of DNS services and data is
also very important; DNS components are often subjected to denial-of-service attacks intended to disrupt
access to the resources whose domain names are handled by the attacked DNS components. This
document presents guidelines for configuring DNS deployments to prevent many denial-of-service
attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in various DNS components.

DNS is susceptible to the same types of vulnerabilities (platform, software, and network-level) as any
other distributed computing system. However, because it is an infrastructure system for the global
Internet, it has the following special characteristics not found in many distributed computing systems:

    •   No well-defined system boundaries—participating entities are not subject to geographic or
        topologic confinement rules

    •   No need for data confidentiality—the data should be accessible to any entity regardless of the
        entity’s location or affiliation.
Because of these characteristics, conventional network-level attacks such as masquerading and message
tampering, as well as violations of the integrity of the hosted and disseminated data, have a completely
different set of functional impacts, as follows:

    •   A masquerader that spoofs the identity of a DNS node can deny access to services for the set of
        Internet resources for which the node provides information (i.e., domains served by the node).
        This denial is not only for a limited set of clients but for the entire universe of all clients needing
        access to those resources

    •   Bogus DNS information provided by a masquerader or intruder can poison the information cache
        of the DNS node providing that subset of DNS information (i.e., the name server providing
