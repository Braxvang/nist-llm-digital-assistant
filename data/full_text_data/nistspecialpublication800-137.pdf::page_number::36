Event-Driven Assessments.

Events may occur that trigger the immediate need to assess security controls or verify security
status outside of requirements expressed in the ISCM strategy. This may require an assessment
that is unplanned, but of the type defined in the ISCM strategy or a customized assessment
tailored to address an emerging need (e.g., a change in planned assessment or monitoring
frequency). For example, if a Web application is added to a system, an existing ISCM process
that includes configuration management and control, SIA, developmental vulnerability scans,
etc., may be sufficient to assess controls implemented for the new Web application.

When defining criteria for event-driven assessments, organizations consider events such as
incidents, new threat information, significant changes to systems and operating environments,
new or additional mission responsibilities, and results of a security impact analysis (SIA) or
assessment of risk.
Depending on the significance of the event, an event-driven assessment may trigger one or more
system reauthorizations.

Primary Roles: Information System Owner/Common Control Provider, Authorizing Official,
Information System Security Officer

Supporting Roles: Risk Executive (Function), Senior Information Security Officer, Security
Control Assessor

Expected Input: Organizational risk assessment, organizational risk tolerance, current threat
information, current vulnerability information, organizational priorities and expectations

Expected Output: Documented criteria and thresholds for event-driven
assessments/authorizations (e.g., significant change procedures, policy and procedures on event-
driven authorizations)

3.2.3 DEVELOP ISCM ARCHITECTURE
Organizations determine how the information will be collected and delivered within and between
the tiers as well as external to the organization. The core requirements of an architecture
implemented to support ISCM are data collection, data storage, data analysis capabilities, and
retrieval and presentation (reporting) capabilities. Methodologies are standardized to facilitate
efficiencies, intra- and inter-tier information exchange, correlation, and other analysis.

Organizations use automated tools, technologies, and methodologies where appropriate to allow
for increased efficiencies and insight including those gained through collection, analysis and
dissemination of large volumes of data from diverse sources. The architecture and associated
policies and procedures are designed to minimize data calls and maximize data reuse. 39 Data
feeds come from a heterogeneous mix of sources (e.g., authorization packages, training records,
system logs) and accommodate different stakeholder views. Interoperable data specifications
(e.g., SCAP, XML) enable data to be collected once and reused many times. Accountability for
different facets of the security posture may reside with different roles or functions within an
organization and hence require use of raw data in different metrics and contexts and at different
