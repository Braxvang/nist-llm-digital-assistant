KW, KWP, and TKW were designed to protect the confidentiality and the authenticity/integrity
of cryptographic keys. Each provides an option for protecting keys in a manner that is distinct
from the methods that protect general data. Segregating keys from general data can provide an
extra layer of protection.

Nevertheless, there is no requirement to protect cryptographic keys with a distinct cryptographic
method. Previously approved authenticated-encryption modes—as well as combinations of an
approved encryption mode with an approved authentication method—are approved for the
protection of cryptographic keys, in addition to general data.

Similarly, KW, KWP, and TKW are each approved for the protection of general data, as well as
cryptographic keys.

KW, KWP, and TKW are each robust in the sense that each bit of output can be expected to
depend in a nontrivial fashion on each bit of input, even when the length of the input data is
greater than one block. This property is achieved at the cost of a considerably lower throughput
rate, compared to other authenticated-encryption modes, but the tradeoff may be appropriate for
some key management applications. For example, a robust method may be desired when the
length of the keys to be protected is greater than the block size of the underlying block cipher, or
when the value of the protected data is very high.

3.2   Related Specifications
Earlier specifications of key-wrap algorithms 1 that are related to KW, KWP, and TKW are
discussed in this subsection.

In 2001, NIST posted a document entitled “AES Key Wrap Specification” on NIST’s Computer
Security Resource Center web site as an unofficial suggestion for the protection of cryptographic
keys. That algorithm is essentially equivalent to KW as specified in this Recommendation.

In 2002, two industry groups published specifications of key-wrap algorithms that were based on
the specification that NIST posted. First, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) developed
an essentially equivalent specification in Request For Comments (RFC) 3394 [11]. Second, the
Telecommunications Industry Association published a protocol for Digital Radio Over-the-Air-
Rekeying [1] containing a “Key Wrap Algorithm” that supported TDEA, in addition to the AES
block cipher. Those algorithms are essentially equivalent to KW and TKW as specified in this
Recommendation.

In 2008, Accredited Standards Committee X9, Inc., published a key-wrap standard for the
financial services industry [2]. The variant of KW in that standard features a more general
framework for formatting the input data, including a padding scheme, as well as an analogue
with TDEA as the underlying block cipher.

  The term “algorithm” here indicates a high-level cryptographic technique that may encompass more than one
computational procedure; for example, an "encryption algorithm" like TDEA or the AES algorithm has
transformations for both encryption and decryption. This publication also contains ten numbered algorithms in the
original sense of the word, i.e., as a list of instructions for executing a single computational procedure.
