57   Abstract
58   This publication provides guidance for federal agencies and organizations to develop and
59   manage a lifecycle approach to building a cybersecurity and privacy learning program (hereafter
60   referred to as CPLP). The approach is intended to address the needs of large and small
61   organizations as well as those building an entirely new program. The information leverages
62   broadly accepted standards, regulations, legislation, and best practices. The recommendations are
63   customizable and may be implemented as part of an organization-wide process that manages
64   awareness, training, and education programs for a diverse set of employee audiences. The
65   guidance also includes suggested metrics and evaluation methods in order that the program be
66   regularly improved and updated as needs will evolve.

70   The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
71   Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
72   leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
73   methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
74   the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
75   development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
76   the cost-effective cybersecurity and privacy of other than national security-related information in
77   federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
78   guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
79   with industry, government, and academic organizations.
