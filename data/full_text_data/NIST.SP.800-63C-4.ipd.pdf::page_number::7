      NIST SP 800-63C-4 ipd                                            Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                                    Federation and Assertions


170      • Is the updated text and introduction of “bound authenticators” sufficiently clear
171        to allow for practical implementations of federation assurance level (FAL) 3
172        transactions? What complications or challenges are anticipated based on the
173        updated guidance?
174   General
175      • Is there an element of this guidance that you think is missing or could be expanded?
176      • Is any language in the guidance confusing or hard to understand? Should we add
177        definitions or additional context to any language?
178      • Does the guidance sufficiently address privacy?
179      • Does the guidance sufficiently address equity?
180             – What equity assessment methods, impact evaluation models, or metrics
181               could we reference to better support organizations in preventing or detecting
182               disparate impacts that could arise as a result of identity verification
183               technologies or processes?
184      • What specific implementation guidance, reference architectures, metrics, or other
185        supporting resources may enable more rapid adoption and implementation of this
186        and future iterations of the Digital Identity Guidelines?
187      • What applied research and measurement efforts would provide the greatest impact
188        on the identity market and advancement of these guidelines?
