103   Reports on Computer Systems Technology

104   The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
105   Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
106   leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops
107   tests, test methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical
108   analyses to advance the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s
109   responsibilities include the development of management, administrative, technical, and
110   physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of other
111   than national security-related information in federal information systems. The Special
112   Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in
113   information system security, and its collaborative activities with industry, government,
114   and academic organizations.

115   Abstract

116   These guidelines provide technical requirements for federal agencies implementing digital
117   identity services and are not intended to constrain the development or use of standards
118   outside of this purpose. This guideline focuses on the enrollment and verification of an
119   identity for use in digital authentication. Central to this is a process known as identity
120   proofing in which an applicant provides evidence to a credential service provider (CSP)
121   reliably identifying themselves, thereby allowing the CSP to assert that identification at a
122   useful identity assurance level. This document defines technical requirements for each of
123   three identity assurance levels. This publication will supersede NIST Special Publication
124   (SP) 800-63A.

128   Note to Reviewers

129   The rapid proliferation of online services over the past few years has heightened the need
130   for reliable, equitable, secure, and privacy-protective digital identity solutions.
131   Revision 4 of NIST Special Publication 800-63, Digital Identity Guidelines, intends to
132   respond to the changing digital landscape that has emerged since the last major revision
133   of this suite was published in 2017 — including the real-world implications of online
134   risks. The guidelines present the process and technical requirements for meeting digital
135   identity management assurance levels for identity proofing, authentication, and federation,
136   including requirements for security and privacy as well as considerations for fostering
137   equity and the usability of digital identity solutions and technology.
