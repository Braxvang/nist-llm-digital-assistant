GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



 Open Design—System security should not depend on the secrecy of the implementation or its
  components. “Security through obscurity” is not reliable.
 Separation of Privilege—Functions, to the degree possible, should be separate and provide as much
  granularity as possible. The concept can apply to both systems and operators/users. In the case of
  systems, such functions such as read, edit, write, and execute should be separate. In the case of
  system operators and users, roles should be as separate as possible. For example, if resources allow,
  the role of system administrator should be separate from that of the security administrator.
 Least Privilege—This principle dictates that each task, process, or user is granted the minimum
  rights required to perform its job. By applying this principle consistently, should a task, process, or
  user be compromised, the scope of damage is constrained to the limited resources available to the
  compromised entity.
 Psychological Acceptability—Users should understand the necessity of security. This can be
  provided through training and education. In addition, the security mechanisms in place should
  present users with sensible options that give them the usability they require on a daily basis. If users
  find the security mechanisms too cumbersome, they may devise ways to work around or compromise
  them. The objective is not to weaken security so it is understandable and acceptable, but to train,
  educate, and design security mechanisms and policies that are usable and effective.
 Least Common Mechanism—When providing a feature to the system, it is best to have a process or
  service gain some function without granting the same function to other parts of the system. The
  ability for the mail server process to access a backend database, for instance, should not also enable
  other applications on the system to access the backend database.
 Defense in Depth—Organizations should understand that a single security mechanism would
  generally prove insufficient. Security mechanisms (defenses) need to be layered so that compromise
  of a single security mechanism is insufficient to compromise a host or network. There is no “silver
  bullet” for information system security.
 Work Factor—Organizations should understand what it would take to break the system or network’s
  security features. The amount of work necessary for an attacker to break the system or network
  should exceed the value that the attacker would gain from a successful compromise.
 Compromise Recording—Records and logs should be maintained so that if a compromise does
  occur, evidence of the attack is available to the organization. This information can assist in securing
  the network and host after the compromise and assist in identifying the methods and exploits used by
  the attacker. This information can be used to better secure the host or network in the future. In
  addition, this can assist organizations in identifying and prosecuting attackers.
