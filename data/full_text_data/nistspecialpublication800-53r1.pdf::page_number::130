SC-3      SECURITY FUNCTION ISOLATION

          Control:   The information system isolates security functions from nonsecurity functions.
          Supplemental Guidance: The information system isolates security functions from nonsecurity
          functions by means of partitions, domains, etc., including control of access to and integrity of, the
          hardware, software, and firmware that perform those security functions. The information system
          maintains a separate execution domain (e.g., address space) for each executing process.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system employs underlying hardware separation mechanisms to facilitate security
                function isolation.
          (2)   The information system isolates critical security functions (i.e., functions enforcing access and
                information flow control) from both nonsecurity functions and from other security functions.
          (3)   The information system minimizes the number of nonsecurity functions included within the
                isolation boundary containing security functions.
          (4)   The information system security functions are implemented as largely independent modules that
                avoid unnecessary interactions between modules.
          (5)   The information system security functions are implemented as a layered structure minimizing
                interactions between layers of the design and avoiding any dependence by lower layers on the
                functionality or correctness of higher layers.

SC-4      INFORMATION REMNANCE

          Control:The information system prevents unauthorized and unintended information transfer via
          shared system resources.
          Supplemental Guidance: Control of information system remnance, sometimes referred to as object
          reuse, or data remnance, prevents information, including encrypted representations of information,
          produced by the actions of a prior user/role (or the actions of a process acting on behalf of a prior
          user/role) from being available to any current user/role (or current process) that obtains access to a
          shared system resource (e.g., registers, main memory, secondary storage) after that resource has
          been released back to the information system.
          Control Enhancements: None.
