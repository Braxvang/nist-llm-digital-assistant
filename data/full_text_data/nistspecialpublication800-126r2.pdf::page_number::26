              The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



used, and provide additional information about the document. The following requirements and
conventions apply to the <xccdf:Benchmark>, <xccdf:Profile>, <xccdf:Value>,
<xccdf:Group>, and <xccdf:Rule> elements:
   1. One or more instances of the <xccdf:title> element SHALL be provided. Each instance
      MUST contain a text value that briefly indicates the purpose of the containing element.
   2. One or more instances of the <xccdf:description> element SHALL be provided. Each
      instance MUST contain a text value that describes the purpose of the containing element.
XInclude elements SHALL NOT be included in XCCDF content [XINCLUDE].
All remaining OPTIONAL elements in the XCCDF schema MAY be included at the author’s discretion
unless otherwise noted in this document.

3.2.2   The <xccdf:Benchmark> Element
The following requirements and recommendations apply to the <xccdf:Benchmark> element:
   1. The <xccdf:version> element and the @id attribute SHALL be used together to uniquely
      identify all revisions of a benchmark.
      a. Multiple revisions of a single benchmark SHOULD have the same @id attribute value and
          different <xccdf:version> element values, so that someone who reviews the revisions
          can readily identify them as multiple versions of a single benchmark.
      b. Multiple revisions of a single benchmark SHOULD have <xccdf:version> element
          values that indicate the revision sequence, so that the history of changes from the original
          benchmark can be determined.
      c. The @time attribute of the <xccdf:version> element SHOULD be used for a
          timestamp of when the benchmark was defined.
   2. The @update attribute of the <xccdf:version> element SHOULD be used for a URI that
      specifies where updates to the benchmark can be obtained.
   3. The <xccdf:Benchmark> element SHALL have an @xml:lang attribute.
   4. The @style attribute SHOULD have the value “SCAP_1.2”.
   5. The <xccdf:status> element SHALL indicate the current status of the benchmark
      document. The associated text value SHALL be “draft” for documents released in public draft
      state and “accepted” for documents that have been officially released by an organization. The
      @date attribute SHALL be populated with the date of the status change. Additional
      <xccdf:status> elements MAY be included to indicate historic status transitions.
   6. The <xccdf:metadata> element SHALL be provided and SHALL, at minimum, contain the
      Dublin Core [DCES] terms from Table 14. If provided, additional Dublin Core terms SHALL
      follow the required terms within the element sequence.
