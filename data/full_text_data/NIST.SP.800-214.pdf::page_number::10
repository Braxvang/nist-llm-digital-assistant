Cybersecurity Metrics provide decision support, and they help to measure and
improve performance and accountability for cybersecurity activities. A mature metrics program
is content-rich, supports a broader range of stakeholders, and provides greater value to the
organization. More precise measurement data helps to focus on an actionable approach
to improving cybersecurity. To support this effort, NIST has embarked on various initiatives,
some of which are highlighted here. Initiatives include research in new technology areas,
risk management tools and guidance, and ways for organizations to mature the use of
cybersecurity metrics.
Measurements for Information Security
Every organization wants to gain maximum value and effect for its finite cybersecurity-related
investments. This includes managing risk to the enterprise and optimizing the potential
reward of cybersecurity policies, programs, and actions. Organizations frequently make
decisions by comparing scenarios of various projected costs with potential associated
benefits and risk reduction. Senior executives need accurate and quantitative methods to
portray and assess these factors, their effectiveness and efficiency, and their effect on risk
exposure. Providing reliable answers to these questions requires organizations to employ a
systematic approach to cybersecurity measurement that considers current knowledge limits.
NIST’s cybersecurity measurements program enables organizations to manage
cybersecurity risks. NIST is undertaking a focused program on cybersecurity measurements
to support the development and alignment of technical measures to determine the effect of
cybersecurity risks and responses on an organization’s objectives. The initiative involves
collaboration with the research, business, and government sectors.
