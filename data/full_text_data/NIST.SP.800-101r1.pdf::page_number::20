2.4   Cellular Network Characteristics

      Within the U.S., different types of digital cellular networks follow distinct incompatible sets of
      standards. The following sections discuss digital cellular networks, Mobile IP and satellite
      phones.

      The two most dominant types of digital cellular networks are known as Code Division
      Multiple Access (CDMA) and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) networks.
      Other common cellular networks include Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) and
      Integrated Digital Enhanced Network (iDEN). iDEN networks use a proprietary protocol
      designed by Motorola, while the others follow standardized open protocols. A digital version
      of the original analog standard for cellular telephone phone service, called Digital Advanced
      Mobile Phone Service (D-AMPS), also exists.

      CDMA refers to a technology designed by Qualcomm in the U.S., which employs spread
      spectrum communications for the radio link.4 Rather than sharing a channel as many other
      network air interfaces do, CDMA spreads the digitized data over the entire bandwidth
      available, distinguishing multiple calls through a unique sequence code assigned. Successive
      versions of the IS-95 standard define CDMA conventions in the U.S., which is the reason why
      the term CDMA is often used to refer to IS-95 compliant cellular networks. IS-95 CDMA
      systems are sometimes referred to as cdmaOne. The next evolutionary step for CDMA to 3G
      services was CDMA2000. CDMA2000 is backward compatible with its previous 2G iteration
      IS-95 (cdmaOne). The successor to CDMA2000 is Qualcomm’s Long Term Evolution (LTE).
      LTE adds faster data transfer capabilities for mobile devices and is commonly referred to as
      4G LTE. Verizon and Sprint are common CDMA network carriers in the U.S.

      GSM is a cellular system used worldwide that was designed in Europe, primarily by Ericsson
      and Nokia. AT&T and T-Mobile are common GSM network carriers in the U.S. GSM uses a
      TDMA air interface. TDMA refers to a digital link technology whereby multiple phones share
      a single carrier, radio frequency channel by taking turns – using the channel exclusively for an
      allocated time slice, then releasing it and waiting briefly while other phones use it. A packet
      switching enhancement to GSM called General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) was
      standardized to improve the transmission of data. The next generation of GSM, commonly
      referred to as the third generation or 3G, is known as Universal Mobile Telecommunications
      System (UMTS) and involves enhancing GSM networks with a Wideband CDMA (W-
      CDMA) air interface. 4G LTE is also available to GSM mobile devices providing higher data
      transmission rates to its customers.5
