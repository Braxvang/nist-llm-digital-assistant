       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                           Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

1378   An example of an RBG2 construction is provided in Appendix B.4.
1379   An RBG2 construction may be implemented to use one or more validated physical and/or non-
1380   physical entropy sources for instantiation and reseeding. Two variants of the RBG2 construction
1381   may be implemented.
1382           1. An RBG2(P) construction uses the output of one or more validated physical entropy
1383              sources and (optionally) one or more validated non-physical entropy sources as discussed
1384              in Method 1 of Section 2.3 (i.e., only the entropy produced by validated physical entropy
1385              sources is counted toward the entropy required for instantiating or reseeding the RBG).
1386              Any amount of entropy may be obtained from a non-physical entropy source as long as
1387              sufficient entropy has been obtained from the physical entropy sources to fulfill an entropy
1388              request.
1389           2. An RBG2(NP) construction uses the output of any validated non-physical or physical
1390              entropy sources as discussed in Method 2 of Section 2.3 (i.e., the entropy produced by both
1391              validated physical and non-physical entropy sources is counted toward the entropy required
1392              for instantiating or reseeding the RBG).
1393   These variants affect the implementation of a Get_ES_Bitstring function (as specified in Section
1394   2.8.2.2 and discussed in Section 3.1), either accessing the entropy source directly or via the
1395   Get_conditioned_full_entropy_input function during instantiation and reseeding (see Sections
1396   5.2.1 and 5.2.3). That is, when instantiating and reseeding an RBG2(P) construction (including a
1397   DRBG within an RBG3 construction as discussed in Section 6), Method 1 in Section 2.3 is used
1398   to combine the entropy from the entropy sources, and Method 2 is used when instantiating and
1399   reseeding an RBG2(NP) construction.

1400                 Conceptual Interfaces
1401   The RBG2 construction interfaces to the DRBG include function calls for instantiating the DRBG
1402   (see Section 5.2.1), generating pseudorandom bits on request (see Section 5.2.2), and (optionally)
1403   reseeding the DRBG at the end of the DRBGâ€™s seedlife and providing prediction resistance upon
1404   request (see Section 5.2.3).
1405   Once instantiated, an RBG2 construction with a reseed capability may be reseeded on demand or
1406   whenever sufficient entropy is available.

1407   5.2.1. RBG2 Instantiation
1408   An RBG2 construction may be instantiated at any valid 20 security strength possible for the DRBG
1409   and its components using the following call:
1410               (status, RBG2_state_handle) = Instantiate_function (s, prediction_resistance_flag,
1411                                           personalization_string),




       20
            A security strength of either 128, 192, or 256 bits.
