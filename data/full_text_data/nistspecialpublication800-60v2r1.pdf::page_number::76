Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some
centrally managed records can pose a threat to human life or a loss of major assets. In such cases,
the confidentiality impact is high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for central records and statistics management information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In addition, the
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of central records and statistics
management information may depend on the urgency with which the information is needed or
the immediacy with which the information is used. In most cases, it is unlikely that the
information will be time-critical or acted upon immediately.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
central records and statistics management information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the central records and statistics
management information. Central records and statistics management processes are generally
tolerant of reasonable delays. Generally, disruption of access to central records and statistics
management information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
central records and statistics management information is low.
C.2.8.8 Income Information Information Type

Income information includes all the wages, self-employment earnings, savings data and other
financial resources information that is needed to help determine the amount of Retirement,
Survivor, or Disability benefits that individuals may be entitled to receive or not receive from the
Supplementary Security Income or RSDI Title II Programs. In most cases, the impact levels are
based on the effects of unauthorized disclosure, modification, or loss of availability of income
information on the ability of the Federal government to identify citizen entitlements and
obligations and to protect individuals against identity theft and the Federal government against
fraud. The recommended security categorization for the income information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is based on the effects of unauthorized disclosure of income
information on the ability of the Federal government to identify citizen entitlements and
obligations and to protect individuals against identity theft and the Federal government against
fraud. Unauthorized disclosure of raw data and other source information for benefits
