       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


2119   assets, individuals, other organizations, and includes: (i) establishing the context for risk-
2120   related activities; (ii) assessing risk; (iii) responding to risk once determined; and (iv)
2121   monitoring risk over time.

2122   Salt
2123   A non-secret value used in a cryptographic process, usually to ensure that the results of
2124   computations for one instance cannot be reused by an attacker.

2125   Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
2126   See Transport Layer Security (TLS).

2127   Session
2128   A persistent interaction between a subscriber and an endpoint, either an RP or a CSP. A
2129   session begins with an authentication event and ends with a session termination event.
2130   A session is bound by use of a session secret that the subscriberâ€™s software (a browser,
2131   application, or OS) can present to the RP to prove association of the session with the
2132   authentication event.

2133   Session Hijack Attack
2134   An attack in which the attacker is able to insert themselves between a claimant and a
2135   verifier subsequent to a successful authentication exchange between the latter two parties.
2136   The attacker is able to pose as a subscriber to the verifier or vice versa to control session
2137   data exchange. Sessions between the claimant and the RP can be similarly compromised.

2138   Shared Secret
2139   A secret used in authentication that is known to the subscriber and the verifier.

2140   Side-Channel Attack
2141   An attack enabled by leakage of information from a physical cryptosystem.
2142   Characteristics that could be exploited in a side-channel attack include timing, power
2143   consumption, and electromagnetic and acoustic emissions.

2144   Single-Factor
2145   A characteristic of an authentication system or an authenticator that requires only one
2146   authentication factor (something you know, something you have, or something you are)
2147   for successful authentication.

2148   Social Engineering
2149   The act of deceiving an individual into revealing sensitive information, obtaining
2150   unauthorized access, or committing fraud by associating with the individual to gain
2151   confidence and trust.
