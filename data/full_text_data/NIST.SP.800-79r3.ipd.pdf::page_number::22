      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                                 Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                                                        and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

625   facilities can continue with implementation and be included in the authorization boundary at a
626   later date.
627   In the case of outsourcing PIV or derived PIV services that are not under direct management
628   control of the organization nor physically located within its facilities, the organization SHALL
629   include the functions provided by any external service providers within the authorization
630   boundary to ensure that they are included within the scope of issuer authorization. This assures
631   that no matter how and where the functions are performed, the organization maintains complete
632   accountability for the reliability of its PIV program. From an issuer point of view, this translates
633   to applying the necessary due diligence process with respect to the assessment of controls to
634   ensure that outsourced functions are conducted in an acceptable and compliant manner.
635   Care should be used in defining the authorization boundary for the issuer. A boundary that is
636   unnecessarily expansive (i.e., includes many dissimilar processes and business functions) makes
637   the assessment and authorization processes extremely complex. Establishing a boundary and its
638   subsequent authorization are organization-level activities that SHOULD include the participation
639   of all key personnel. An organization SHOULD strive to define the authorization boundary of its
640   issuers such that it strikes a balance between the costs and benefits of assessment and
641   authorization.
642   While the above considerations SHOULD be useful to an organization in determining the
643   boundary for purposes of authorization, they SHOULD NOT limit their flexibility in establishing
644   a practical boundary that promotes an effective [HSPD-12]-compliant implementation. The
645   scope of an authorization is an issuer whose boundaries are formed by included issuing facilities,
646   not individual issuing facilities.

647                Issuer Roles and Responsibilities
648   PIV Card and derived PIV credential issuance roles and their processes should be selected based
649   on the organizationâ€™s structure, its mission, and operating environment. The organization
650   SHALL make sure that a separation of roles has been established and that the processes follow
651   the requirements of [FIPS201].
652   This subsection identifies the roles and responsibilities of key personnel involved in the setup,
653   day-to-day operations, assessment, and authorization of an issuer. 5 Recognizing that
654   organizations have widely varying missions and structures, there may be some differences in
655   naming conventions for authorization-related roles and in how the associated responsibilities are
656   allocated among personnel (e.g., one individual MAY perform multiple roles in certain
657   circumstances).

658   2.7.1. Senior Authorizing Official (SAO)
659   The senior authorizing official (SAO) of an organization is responsible for all operations. The
660   SAO has budgetary control, provides oversight, develops policy, and has authority over all
661   functions and services related to the issuance of PIV Cards and derived PIV credentials for the
662   organization.


      5
          Organizations may define other significant roles (e.g., PIV system liaisons, operations managers) to support the authorization process.
