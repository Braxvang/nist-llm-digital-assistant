NIST SP 800-85A-4                                         PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                   INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

C.1.2.2        Contactless Interface
 Purpose              Validates the conformance of the GET DATA command through the
                      contactless interface. This test is applicable to the mandatory data
                      objects required by Table 2 of SP 800-73-4 Part 1, and the optional
                      data objects when supported by the card.
 Reference(s)         1. Table 2 of SP 800-73-4 Part 2
                      2. AS05.01, AS05.02, AS05.12, AS05.12A
 Precondition(s)      1. The IUT is placed within the reading range of the contactless
                          reader.
                      2. There exists a valid PC/SC connection between the test system
                          and the contactless reader.
                      3. No other contactless card is within the proximity of the reader.
 Test Scenario        1. Repeat the steps 1-17 and 24 of test C.1.2.1
 Expected Result(s) 1. The command returns the application property template with the
                          status word '90 00' at the end.
                      2. In steps 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14A, 14B, and 17 the command
                          returns the status word '69 82' (security status is not satisfied),
                          due to the contactless interface.
                      3. In steps 3, 8, 13, 15, and 16 the command returns the requested
                          data object along with the status word '90 00' at the end.
                      4. In step 24, the command returns '6A 82' (data object not found).
 Postcondition(s)     N/A

C.1.2.3        Secure Messaging Interface
 Purpose              Validates the conformance of the GET DATA command using secure
                      messaging. This test is applicable to the mandatory data objects
                      required by Table 2 of SP 800-73-4 Part 2, and the optional data
                      objects when supported by the card.
 Reference(s)         1. Table 2 of SP 800-73-4 Part 2
                      2. AS05.01, AS05.02, AS05.12, AS05.12A
 Precondition(s)      1. The IUT is placed within the reading range of the contactless
                         reader.
                      2. There exists a valid PC/SC connection between the test system
                         and the contactless reader.
                      3. No other contactless card is within the proximity of the reader.
                      4. Secure messaging keys have been established and secure
                         messaging is used in the test scenario.
 Test Scenario        1. Repeat step 1 from Test C.1.2.1 without secure messaging.
                      2. Repeat the steps 2-17 and 24 from the Test C.1.2.1 using
                         the '0C' CLA byte
 Expected Result(s)   1. The command returns the application property template with the
                         status word '90 00' at the end.
