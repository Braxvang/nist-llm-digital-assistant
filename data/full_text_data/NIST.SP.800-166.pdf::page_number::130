NIST SP 800-166                                                  DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND

9.3.3.8 cRLDistributionPoints Extension

 Test Assertion          TA-09.03.03.08
 Purpose                 Verifies that the cRLDistributionPoints extension in the key
                         management certificate contains at least one URIs, either LDAP or
                         HTTP.
 DTR(s)                  • DTR-07.03.03.08
 Issuer Documentation    None.

 Precondition(s)         •   A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                             appropriate token reader.
                         •   Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                             an instance of the reader.
                         •   A key management certificate is present within the Derived PIV
                             Application.
 Test Scenario           1. Send the SELECT command with
                               • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                         2. Send the GET DATA command with
                               • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                  ('5FC10B') of the X.509 Certificate for Key
                                  Management data object
                         3. Extract the cRLDistributionPoints extension from
                            the certificate.
 Expected Result(s)      1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                            template with the status word '90 00'.
                         2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                            along with the status word '90 00'.
                         3. From Step 3, a URI with either the “LDAP” or “HTTP” scheme
                            that can be used to access CRL information is present.

9.3.3.9 RSA Exponent

 Test Assertion           TA-09.09.03.09
 Purpose                  Verifies that for RSA keys, the exponent of the asymmetric key for
                          key management is equal to 65 537.

                          • A key management certificate is present within the Derived
                             PIV Application.
 Test Scenario            1. Send the SELECT command with
                                • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                          2. Send the GET DATA command with
