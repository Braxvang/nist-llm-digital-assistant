GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



     perform varies considerably among products. Some products provide no IPv6 support or can simply
     alert administrators that IPv6 activity is present. Other products can do basic processing of IPv6 and
     tunneled IPv6 traffic, such as recording source and destination IP addresses, and extracting payloads
     (e.g., HTTP, SMTP) for in-depth analysis. Some products can do full analysis of the IPv6 protocol,
     such as confirming the validity of IPv6 options, to identify anomalous use of the protocol.
     Organizations with a current or future need to monitor IPv6 activity should carefully evaluate the
     IPv6 analysis capabilities of network-based IDPS products. 23
 Unexpected application services (e.g., tunneled protocols, backdoors, hosts running unauthorized
  application services). These are usually detected through stateful protocol analysis methods, which
  can determine if the activity in a connection is consistent with the expected application protocol, or
  through anomaly detection methods, which can identify changes in network flows and open ports on
  hosts.
 Policy violations (e.g., use of inappropriate Web sites, use of forbidden application protocols). Some
  types of security policy violations can be detected by IDPSs that allow administrators to specify the
  characteristics of activity that should not be permitted, such as TCP or UDP port numbers, IP
  addresses, Web site names, and other pieces of data that can be identified by examining network
  traffic.
Some IDPSs can also monitor the initial negotiation conducted when establishing encrypted
communications to identify client or server software that has known vulnerabilities or is misconfigured.
This can include application layer protocols such as secure shell (SSH) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),
and network layer virtual private networking protocols such as IP Security (IPsec).

Network-based IDPS sensors can often determine if an attack is likely to succeed. For example, as
described in Section 4.3.3.3, sensors might know which Web server software versions are running on
each of the organization’s Web servers. If an attacker launches an attack against a Web server that is not
vulnerable to the attack, then the sensor might produce a low-priority alert; if the server is thought to be
vulnerable, then the sensor might produce a high-priority alert. IDPS sensors are typically configured to
stop attacks whether or not they are likely to succeed, but an IDPS might still log the activity with
different priority levels depending on what its outcome probably would have been if not blocked.

4.3.3.2 Detection Accuracy

Historically, network-based IDPSs have been associated with high rates of false positives and false
negatives. Most of the early technologies relied primarily on signature-based detection, which by itself is
accurate only for detecting relatively simple well-known threats. Newer technologies use a combination
of detection methods to increase accuracy and the breadth of detection, and generally the rates of false
positives and false negatives have declined. Another common problem with network-based IDPSs’
accuracy is that they typically require considerable tuning and customization to take into account the
characteristics of the monitored environment.

False positives and false negatives for network-based IDPS sensors can only be reduced somewhat
because of the complexity of the activities being monitored. A single sensor is often monitoring traffic
involving hundreds or thousands of internal and external hosts. The number and variety of OSs and
applications in use over the monitored network can be immense; also, OSs and applications are constantly
being changed. This makes it impossible for a sensor to understand everything it sees.
