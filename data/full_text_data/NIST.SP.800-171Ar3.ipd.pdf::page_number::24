549   3.1.5. Least Privilege
550           REQUIREMENT: 03.01.05

551           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
552           Determine if:
553           A.03.01.05.ODP[01]: security functions for authorized access are defined.
554           A.03.01.05.ODP[02]: security-relevant information for authorized access is defined.
555           A.03.01.05.a: system access for users (or processes acting on behalf of users) is authorized only
556           when necessary to accomplish assigned organizational tasks.
557           A.03.01.05.b[01]: access to <A.03.01.05.ODP[01] security functions> is authorized.
558           A.03.01.05.b[02]: access to <A.03.01.05.ODP[01] security-relevant information> is
559           authorized.
560           A.03.01.05.c: the privileges assigned to roles or classes of users are periodically reviewed to
561           validate the need for such privileges.
562           A.03.01.05.d: privileges are reassigned or removed, as necessary.

563           ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
564           Examine
565           [SELECT FROM: access control policy and procedures; procedures for least privilege; list of
566           assigned access authorizations (i.e., privileges); system configuration settings; system audit
567           records; list of security functions (deployed in hardware, software, and firmware); security-
568           relevant information for which access must be explicitly authorized; list of system-generated roles
569           or classes of users and assigned privileges; validation reviews of privileges assigned to roles or
570           classes or users; records of privilege removals or reassignments for roles or classes of users;
571           system design documentation; system security plan; other relevant documents or records]
