Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the management improvement
information. The management improvement planning processes are usually tolerant of delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
management improvement information is low.
C.2.3.8 Budget and Performance Integration Information Type

Budget and Performance Integration involves activities that align Federal resources allocated
through budget formulation, execution, and management actions with examinations of program
objectives, performance, and demonstrated results such as Program Performance Assessments,
Government Performance Results Act (GPRA) plans and reports, performance-based agency
budget submissions, and Financial Management Cost Accounting and Performance Measurement
data. Subject to exception conditions described below, the recommended security categorization
for the budget and performance integration information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure budget and performance
integration information on the abilities of responsible agencies to align Federal resources
allocated through budget formulation, execution, and management actions. The consequences of
unauthorized disclosure of the majority of budget and performance integration information will
result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The effects of loss of confidentiality
of budget and performance integration information can violate privacy regulations, reveal
information proprietary to private institutions, and reveal procurement-sensitive information. In
aggregate, budget and performance integration information can reveal capabilities and methods
that some agencies (e.g., law enforcement, homeland security, national defense, intelligence)
consider extremely sensitive. In these cases, the potential harm that can result from unauthorized
disclosure ranges from moderate to high to national security-related. In the last case, the
information is outside the scope of this document. Public release of sensitive budget and
performance integration information can result in unnecessary damage to public confidence in
the agency. This is particularly likely where the release includes unedited internal commentary
and discussion.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for resource budget and performance integration information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction of
information affecting external communications that contain budget and performance integration
