NIST SP 800-167                                                                           GUIDE TO APPLICATION W HITELISTING


Appendix A—Security and Compliance Mapping

This appendix provides a mapping to selected standards and guidelines that support using application
whitelisting technologies.

NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information
Systems and Organizations15

    Control CM-7 (Least Functionality), control enhancement 5 (Authorized Software/Whitelisting):
     “The organization:
              (a) Identifies [Assignment: organization-defined software programs authorized to execute on
                  the information system];
              (b) Employs a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of authorized
                  software programs on the information system; and

              (c) Reviews and updates the list of authorized software programs [Assignment: organization-
                  defined frequency].”

Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, Version 1.016

    Subcategory PR.IP-1:17 “A baseline configuration of information technology/industrial control
     systems is created and maintained.” This refers to determining which applications are authorized to be
     run on each system.
    Subcategory PR.PT-3:18 “Access to systems and assets is controlled, incorporating the principle of
     least functionality.” This refers to the enforcement of the whitelist established through subcategory
     PR.IP-1.
Critical Controls for Effective Cyber Defense, Version 5.119

    Critical Control 2: Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Software: “Actively manage (inventory,
     track, and correct) all software on the network so that only authorized software is installed and can
     execute, and that unauthorized and unmanaged software is found and prevented from
     installation or execution.”

     PR.IP stands for Protect: Information Protection Processes and Procedures. This is defined as follows: “Security policies
     (that address purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, and coordination among organizational
     entities), processes, and procedures are maintained and used to manage protection of information systems and assets.”
18   PR.PT stands for Protect: Protective Technology (PT). This is defined as follows: “Technical security solutions are managed
     to ensure the security and resilience of systems and assets, consistent with related policies, procedures, and agreements.”
