NIST SP 800-156                                                  REPRESENTATION OF PIV CHAIN-OF-TRUST
                                                                               FOR IMPORT AND EXPORT


PIV Card or a private key generated under the id-fpki-common-piv-contentSigning

3.4     Complex Type EnrollmentRecordType

The following schema fragment defines the EnrollmentRecordType complex type:
<xs:complexType name="EnrollmentRecordType">
  <xs:sequence>
    <xs:element name="PersonalInformation" type="PersonalInformationType" minOccurs="1"
       maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="AdjudicationInformation" type="AdjudicationInformationType" minOccurs="1"
       maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="EnrollmentPackage" type="EnrollmentPackageType" minOccurs="1"
       maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="PIVCardTopography" type="PIVCardTopographyType" minOccurs="0"
       maxOccurs="1"/>
  </xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>


The EnrollmentRecordType complex type contains four elements carrying data
required for the issuance of a PIV Card to the cardholder. The elements contained in the
EnrollmentRecordType complex type are:

      <PersonalInformation>:
            This element is an instance of the PersonalInformationType complex type
            and contains personally identifying information on the subject of the chain-of-
            trust enrollment record. The <PersonalInformation> element is a required
            element that appears once in the EnrollmentRecordType complex type.

      <AdjudicationInformation>:
            This element is an instance of the AdjudicationInformationType complex
            type and contains information on the status of the background investigation
            into the subject of the chain-of-trust enrollment record. The
            <AdjudicationInformation> element is a required element that appears once in
            the EnrollmentRecordType complex type.

      <EnrollmentPackage>:
             This element is an instance of the EnrollmentPackageType complex type
             and contains biographic and biometric information on the subject of the chain-
             of-trust enrollment record. The <EnrollmentPackage> element is a required
             element that appears once in the EnrollmentPackageType complex type.

      <PIVCardTopography>:
           This element is an instance of the PIVCardTopographyType complex type
           and contains information used for the physical printing of PIV Cards. The
           <PIVCardTopography> element is an optional element. If used, it would
           appear once in the EnrollmentRecordType complex type.

The EnrollmentRecordType for an agency to agency record exchange use case would
typically include the following types:


                                                8
