Distributed Energy Resource (DER) Security
In FY 2021, NIST’s NCCoE Energy Sector team completed the project started in FY 2020 on
protecting Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices at the grid edge (the components that extend
the traditional power grid infrastructure and that include physical assets [e.g., smart meters],
applications, and data analytics tools). The team investigates data integrity concerns that arise
from the use of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as photovoltaics. The team developed
an associated draft practice guide, Securing the Industrial Internet of Things: Cybersecurity for
Distributed Energy Resources (SP 1800-32). The practice guide addresses a key challenge for all
energy operators and owners: protecting the integrity of the data needed to execute command and
control to maintain the resilience of the grid.
NIST participated in and provided contributions to the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers) 1547.3 working group in their effort to develop a Guide for Cybersecurity of Distributed
Energy Resources (DER) Interconnected with Electric Power Systems. The document provides
cybersecurity guidelines for DER stakeholders, including utilities, aggregators, and DER vendors,
owners, and operators. NIST also organized a Smart Electric Power Alliance (SEPA) half-day
workshop in March 2021 to understand the usage of the cybersecurity controls for the logical
interface categories defined in Guidelines for Smart Grid Cybersecurity (NISTIR 7628) by DER
stakeholders. The workshop results and conclusions will be used to inform future SEPA and NIST
efforts.
Systems Security Engineering
The NIST Systems Security Engineering Project initiated major updates to its publications.
Developing Cyber-Resilient Systems: A Systems Security Engineering Approach (SP 800-160,
Volume 2, Revision 1) helps organizations anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to
adverse conditions, stresses, or compromises on systems, including hostile and increasingly
destructive attacks from nation-states, criminal gangs, and disgruntled individuals. This update
offers significant new content and support tools for organizations to defend against attacks. The
document provides suggestions on how to limit the damage that adversaries can inflict by impeding
their lateral movement, increasing their work factor, and reducing their time on target. The update
also adds an appendix analyzing the potential effects of cyber resiliency on adversary tactics,
techniques, and procedures used to attack OT systems.
NIST also continued its update to Systems Security Engineering: Considerations for a
Multidisciplinary Approach in the Engineering of Trustworthy Secure Systems (SP 800-160,
Volume 1, Revision 1). Content was added to help organizations develop systems that are “secure
by design” with an emphasis on the use of design principles for trustworthy, secure systems. The
guideline is also being updated to ensure consistency with international systems and software
engineering standards.
