                                              TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



systems that are shared by organizations, such as a system using virtual machine technology to provide
services to multiple organizations. By signing the assessment plan, all parties acknowledge and approve
of the assessment.

Besides determining which systems are authorized for assessment, the assessment plan should also detail
the type and level of the testing permitted. For example, if the organization desires a vulnerability
assessment, the assessment plan should provide information on activities authorized to be performed on
the target network—such as port and service identification, vulnerability scanning, security configuration
review, and password cracking—with enough detail included to describe the type of testing, approach,
and tools. For example, if password cracking will be used, the method through which the passwords will
be obtained (e.g., sniffed off the network or copied from the OS password file) should be included in the
assessment plan. The plan should also explicitly state any activities that are prohibited—for example, file
creation and modification—in a way that leaves no room for interpretation. If questions regarding scope
and level of authorization arise during the course of an assessment, the assessors and the organization’s
identified point of contact should meet to discuss them.

The plan should also address the logistical details of the engagement—including the hours of operation
for assessors; the clearance or background check level required; a call plan with current contact
information, network and security operations centers, and the organization’s main point of contact for the
assessment; the physical location where assessment activities will originate; and the equipment and tools
that will be used to conduct the assessment. Any requirements to inform parent organizations, law
enforcement, and a computer incident response team (CIRT) should be identified in the assessment plan.
In addition, the person responsible for informing the organizations of the pending security assessment
should be identified. In the case of covert or other unannounced testing, the assessment plan should also
define how test activity detected and reported by the organization’s security staff, CIRT, and others
should be handled—including as the escalation processes to be followed. The primary purpose for this is
to ensure that assessment activity does not trigger reporting of security breaches to external parties, such
as external incident response teams.

IP addresses of the machines from which assessment activities will be conducted should be identified in
the assessment plan to enable administrators to differentiate assessment activities such as penetration
testing attacks from actual malicious attacks. If appropriate for the goals of the assessment, security
administrators can configure intrusion detection systems and other security monitoring devices to ignore
activity generated by these IP addresses during testing.

Data handling requirements should be addressed in the assessment plan, including:

     Storage of organizational data during the assessment on the assessors’ systems, including
      physical security of the systems, passwords, and data encryption
     Data storage upon conclusion of the assessment, to meet long-term storage requirements or
      vulnerability tracking
     Transmission of data during or after the assessment across internal or external networks (e.g., the
      Internet)
     Removal of data from systems upon conclusion of the assessment—in particular, for third-party
      assessments that include references to specific requirements set forth by the governing
      organization’s policies or procedures.
Finally, the assessment plan should provide specific guidance on incident handling in the event that
assessors cause or uncover an incident during the course of the assessment. This section of the plan
