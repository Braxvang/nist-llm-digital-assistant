_____________________________________________________________________________

      SRTP does not define key management by itself. It rather uses a set of negotiated
      parameters from which session keys for encryption, authentication and integrity
      protection are derived. The key management is not fixed. Within the IETF, the
      MSEC working group discusses key management solutions to be used beyond
      other protocols with SRTP. The preferred solution here is Multimedia Internet
      Keying (MIKEY) [RFC 3830] which is also part of the group key management
      architecture (GKMArch).

      MIKEY describes a key management scheme that addresses real-time multimedia
      scenarios (e.g. SIP calls and RTSP sessions, streaming, unicast, groups,
      multicast). The focus lies on the setup of a security association for secure
      multimedia sessions including key management and update, security policy data,
      etc., such that requirements in a heterogeneous environment are fulfilled. MIKEY
      also supports the negotiation of single and multiple crypto sessions. This is
      especially useful for the case where the key management is applied to SRTP,
      since here RTP and RTCP may to be secured independently. Deployment
      scenarios for MIKEY comprise peer-to-peer, simple one-to-many, and small-size
      interactive group scenarios.
      MIKEY supports the negotiation of cryptographic keys and security parameters
      (SP) for one or more security protocols. This results in the concept of crypto
      session bundles, which describe a collection of crypto sessions that may have a
      common Traffic Encryption Key (TEK), Generation Key (TGK), and session
      security parameters.
      MIKEY defines three options for the user authentication and negotiation of the
      master keys all as 2 way-handshakes. They are:
        − Symmetric key distribution (pre-shared keys, MAC for integrity protection)
        − Asymmetric key distribution
        −   Diffie Hellman key agreement protected by digital signatures
      A fourth version exists, which is not part of MIKEY itself. It is specified as an
      extension to MIKEY and describes the Diffie-Hellman key agreement protected
      by symmetric pre-shared keys.
      The default and mandatory key transport encryption is AES in counter mode.
      MIKEY uses a 160-bit authentication tag, generated by HMAC with SHA-1 as
      the mandatory algorithm as described in RFC 2104. Also mandatory, when
      asymmetric mechanisms are used, is the support of X.509v3 certificates for public
      key encryption and digital signatures.

      Annex G discusses the use of MIKEY to integrate key management suitable for
      SRTP in three profiles:
       − Profile 1 using symmetric techniques to protect the key management data in
          gatekeeper routed scenarios;
       − Profile 2 using asymmetric techniques to protect the key management data
          in scenarios with a single gatekeeper instance;
