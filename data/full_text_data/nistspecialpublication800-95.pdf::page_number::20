In the loan example, both the credit and rate services are intermediaries. As shown in Figure 2-5, the
credit service receives a request from the loan service and then forwards the request on to the credit
bureau services for each of the major credit bureaus. This allows the user’s credit information to be
checked by multiple sources while allowing the loan service to use a single service. As part of its
calculations, the rate service may wish to make a request to a Web service that provides the current
Treasury bonds rate.

2.1.5   Coordination: Orchestration and Choreography

When multiple requesters, providers, and intermediaries are participating in a Web service transaction, it
may be necessary to coordinate them. There are two different types of mechanisms for coordinating Web
services: Web services orchestration and Web services choreography. Web services orchestration is
performed within an organization’s SOA and concerns the use of existing Web services to create another
Web service. Web services choreography is performed among multiple organizations’ SOAs and
describes relationships between Web services so that Web services understand how to interact with one
