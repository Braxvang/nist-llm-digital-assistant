Special Publication 800-79-2                                           Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                                        and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



Unless there is a need to differentiate between PCIs and DPCIs, this document uses the common
term issuer to refer to both types of issuers. Similarly, Derived PIV Credential and the PIV
Card’s credentials are collectively referred to as credentials, unless a distinction is made. An
issuer is considered to be owned and managed by an organization which may be a federal
department, agency, or a private entity authorized by a federal department or agency. Ensuring
the reliability of an issuer is of critical importance in light of the security and privacy
implications of credentials used for meeting the objective of secure and reliable forms of
identification to millions of employees and contractors. [HSPD-12] and its standards and
guidelines were developed to address a range of security concerns, including those posed by
terrorists in a post-9/11 world. Providing a comprehensive set of standards for controlling access
to the physical and logical resources through the use of standard credentials, provides the
assurance that certain pre-defined levels of security can be achieved. However, it requires
organizations to implement and use the standards in a consistent and reliable manner. An
organization must have confidence in the credentials it issues to its own employees and
contractors. Possibly more importantly, since [HSPD-12] requires a common inter-agency-
interoperable standard, all organizations need to have confidence in the identity credentials
issued by other organizations. This confidence can only be established if the issuer’s functions in
those other organizations are assessed and authorized. Thus, authorization of the issuer plays a
key role in meeting the objectives of [HSPD-12].

NIST has considerable experience in the development of assessment and authorization
methodologies, most significantly with the widely accepted approach to authorization in SP 800-
37-1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems [SP
800-37-1], and its family of related documents. While [SP 800-37-1] is focused on the
authorization of the security of information systems, rather than the authorization of the
reliability of an issuer, it does offer a practical foundation for the authorization programs
envisioned by [HSPD-12]. This document utilizes the various aspects of [SP 800-37-1] and
applies them to authorizing the reliability of an issuer. Authorization of an issuer requires prior
assessment of the security of all information systems used by that issuer in accordance with [SP
800-37-1]. PIV Cards and Derived PIV Credentials are typically issued through the use of
information systems and hence an assessment of their security (through the methodology in [SP
800-37-1]) is critical in determining the ability to comply with [FIPS 201-2] requirements.

One difference between the authorization of the security of information systems and the
authorization of the reliability of an issuer is that an organization has considerable flexibility in
how they prepare for an [SP 800-37-1] authorization (particularly in implementing security
controls), but have little room for variation for an SP 800-79-2 authorization. Much of the
flexibility in [SP 800-37-1] comes from the necessity of acceptable variations in security
controls, since individual information systems within varied environments may have
significantly different security requirements. Conversely, the desire for standardization in
[HSPD-12] has led to the development of a stable set of requirements. There may be some
flexibility in how a requirement is met, but a majority of requirements must be satisfied in a
uniform manner in order to deem an issuer as reliable. Allowing too much latitude in how a
requirement is met undermines its reliability.
