        screen-tap, button press, or soft reset occurs. Devices that do not support a semi-
        active state need only a single inactivity timer to transition directly from the active to
        quiescent state.

Simply stated – a PDA device with sufficient battery power is never really turned off, since
processes are active even when no visible cues are present.

For simplicity, a device is said to be “off” or “powered off” if it is in the quiescent state, and
“on” or “powered on” if it is in any of the remaining states. Similarly, a device is said to be
“cleared” and devoid of data when in the nascent state. Note, however, deviations can occur
should devices utilize flash memory for purposes other than exclusively housing the operating
system. For example, applications exist for the Palm OS that allow data to be stored on flash
memory in space unused by the operating system. Similarly, some recent Pocket PC PDAs are
beginning to include a feature to backup important PIM data on flash memory, where it can be
retained and restored if a hard reset is performed on the device. Finally, Linux handheld
distributions, such as the Familiar Distribution from handhelds.org, often use flash memory in
lieu of RAM for user data to avoid loss when a hard reset occurs. In these situations, the
nascent state must be interpreted accordingly.
