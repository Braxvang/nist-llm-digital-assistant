                                                                             GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



 Provision of a host-based firewall capability to restrict both incoming and outgoing traffic

 Support for strong authentication protocols and encryption algorithms

In addition, organizations should consider the availability of trained, experienced staff to administer the
server. Many organizations have learned the difficult lesson that a capable and experienced administrator
for one type of operating environment is not automatically as effective for another.
Many servers host sensitive information, and many others, such as public-facing Web servers, should be
treated as sensitive because of the damage to the organization’s reputation that could occur if the servers’
integrity is compromised. In such cases, it is critical that the servers are located in secure physical
environments. When planning the location of a server, the following issues should be considered:

 Are the appropriate physical security protection mechanisms in place for the server and its
  networking components (e.g., routers, switches)? Examples include—

      –    Locks

      –    Card reader access

      –    Security guards

      –    Physical intrusion detection systems (e.g., motion sensors, cameras).

 Are there appropriate environmental controls so that the necessary humidity and temperature are
  maintained? If high availability is required, are there redundant environmental controls?

 Is there a backup power source? For how long will it provide power?

 Is there appropriate fire containment equipment? Does it minimize damage to equipment that would
  otherwise not be impacted by the fire?

 If high availability is required, are there redundant network connections? (For Internet-facing servers,
  this generally means Internet connections from at least two different Internet service providers [ISP].)
  Is there another data center that can be used to host servers in the event of a catastrophe at the original
  data center?

 If the location is subject to known natural disasters, is it hardened against those disasters and/or is
  there a contingency site outside the potential disaster area?

3.2       Security Management Staff

Because server security is tightly intertwined with the organization’s general information system security
posture, a number of IT and system security staff may be involved in server planning, implementation,
and administration. This section provides a list of generic roles and identifies their responsibilities as they
relate to server security. These roles are for the purpose of discussion and may vary by organization.
