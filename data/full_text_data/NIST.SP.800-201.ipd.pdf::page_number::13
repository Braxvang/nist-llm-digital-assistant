      NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                  Cloud Computing Forensic
      February 2023                                                                  Reference Architecture

341   platforms, as well as criminal and terrorist organizations and opposing nation-states. For
342   legitimate consumers, cloud computing provides capabilities such as:
343       •   More rapid business continuity and disaster recovery
344       •   More effective incident response
345       •   Improved information access, management, and archiving
346       •   Easier and more immediate collaboration between widely separated individuals and groups
347   This research has adapted solutions that originated in the on-premises data center to the
348   significant differences presented by the cloud.
349   As important as they are for addressing significant events related to business operations (as
350   described above), forensic methods have at least equal importance when contributing to matters
351   of compliance, legality, and criminal exploitation. Careful treatment has been given to these
352   questions during this research to ensure that the findings do not merely consider technical aspects
353   but also address the broader aspects of their material application. Unquestionably, close
354   examination of these adverse events is required to understand their incipience and progression
355   and – in particular – to ensure that remediation, event reconstruction, and attribution are
356   effectively and credibly realized.
357   Thus, it has been the specific focus and goal of this effort to research these issues, examine and
358   clarify the forensic challenges, and ultimately formulate and validate the capabilities required to
359   apply accepted forensic techniques and technologies to this unique computing environment. The
360   result is the Cloud Computing Forensic Reference Architecture.
361   In as much as a security reference architecture is required to incorporate standards and
362   requirements that will inform system actualization and operation with respect to security,
363   applying the forensic reference architecture will likewise inform that system actualization and
364   operation with the capability to more effectively examine, understand, reconstruct, and remediate
365   the variety of system events and disruptions being experienced.
366   The goal of the CC FRA is to provide support for a cloud system’s forensic readiness. It is meant
367   to help the user understand the cloud forensic challenges that might exist for an organization’s
368   cloud system. It identifies which forensic challenges require mitigation strategies and how a
369   forensic investigator would apply that to a particular forensic investigation. The CC FRA
370   presented here will likely evolve over time with more use and research.

371           The Approach
372   The CC FRA builds on several foundational layers. We begin with the understanding that this
373   reference architecture addresses forensics in the context of a cloud computing environment.
374   Building upon the fundamental relationship between security, incident response, and forensics,
375   the CC FRA is designed as an overlay to NIST SP 500-299/SP 800-200, NIST Cloud Computing
376   Security Reference Architecture (Draft) [15]. This document discusses the Security Reference
377   Architecture (SRA) and leverages the CSA’s Enterprise Architecture (EA). Section 3 provides
378   descriptions of the CSA’s EA and its use in the SRA, while Section 4 elaborates on the overlay
379   approach employed for the CC FRA.
