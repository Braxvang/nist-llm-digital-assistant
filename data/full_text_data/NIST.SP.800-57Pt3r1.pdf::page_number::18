demonstrating that a user’s public key certificate can be trusted, even though it was
issued by a CA that is not in the relying party’s trust list. All certification paths begin
with a trust anchor, include zero or more intermediate certificates, and end with the
certificate that contains the user’s public key.

The entire path must be examined to ensure that the certificates have not been revoked,
were issued under appropriate policies, and that each public key is suitable for the use to
which it has been put. This process is known as path validation.

As noted above, the certificate itself will usually include a pointer to an authoritative
source for certificate status information. Certificate status information may be provided
using one of two standard mechanisms:

       An Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responder [RFC 6960]. An OCSP
        responder is a trusted system, and provides signed status information for a given
        CA, on a per certificate basis, in response to a request from a relying party.
        Relying parties can authenticate the response by verifying the OCSP responder’s
        digital signature. As the OCSP responder is providing authoritative status
        information, there shall be a formal relationship between the CA and OCSP
        responder (e.g., a contract).
       An alternative method is to use a certificate revocation list, or CRL. An X.509
        CRL contains a list of certificates issued by a CA that have been revoked,
        indicates when they were revoked, and may include the reason for revocation
        [RFC 5280]. If the serial number of an unexpired certificate does not appear on
        the CRL, then it is still valid. CRLs are digitally signed, like a certificate, so they
        can be distributed through untrusted systems. Most commonly, CRLs are
        distributed via LDAP7 directories or web servers. The distribution of CRLs by
        web servers has become more common recently.

In many cases, PKIs will also provide key recovery services (using Recovery Servers) to
support business continuity. Key recovery services store private keys that support key
establishment to ensure that the plaintext of encrypted data may be recovered in the
future. These services can provide the private key to the user in the event of loss or
failure of their cryptographic module, or to the user’s management when policy or legal
requirements exist. When supported, this service removes a key management burden
from PKI-enabled applications. A PKI should include a key recovery services system.

This section provides guidance for general-purpose PKIs when users from different
organizations need to support a variety of applications. For large, general-purpose PKIs,
interoperability is an important consideration. Less commonly, PKIs may be deployed to
support a small, closed community of users or for a single application, where wider
interoperability is less important. The requirements within this section are focused on

 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a software protocol for enabling anyone to locate
organizations, individuals, and other resources, such as files and devices in a network, whether on the
Internet or on a corporate intranet. See [RFC 4511] Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): The
Protocol and [RFC 4512] Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Directory Information Models.
