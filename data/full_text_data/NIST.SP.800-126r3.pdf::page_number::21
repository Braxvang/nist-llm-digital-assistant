                                                                                               The design of the SCAP source data stream is important for the following reasons:
                                                                                                   1. Individual components may be developed outside of an SCAP data stream where the linking to
                                                                                                      other components is not necessarily known at the time the component is created.
                                                                                                   2. The SCAP source data stream creates links between different components that were not
                                                                                                      necessarily designed to reference each other. For example, XCCDF was not designed to reference
                                                                                                      a particular checking system; it can reference OVAL, OCIL, and other checking systems.
                                                                                                   3. The logical link mapping in the data stream places a layer of capability within the data stream to
                                                                                                      control the dereferencing of URIs within components, creating a complete solution related to
                                                                                                      bundling components.
                                                                                                   4. The SCAP source data stream format is intended to be easily adaptable for use in future
                                                                                                      communication models such as web services, transport protocols, tasking mechanisms, etc.

                                                                                                       o   The “Type” column indicates the REQUIRED data type for the value of the property. There
