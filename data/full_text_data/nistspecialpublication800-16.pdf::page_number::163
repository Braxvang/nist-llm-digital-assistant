 Functional Specialty: Implement & Operate

 Definition   —        The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an FT system
                       from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                       model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                       Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                       ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                       needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                       The termination phase comprises the series of steps taken to retire a system
                       when it is no longer needed and to securely and properly archive or dispose
                       of its assets.

 Beliavioral Outcome       —   Individuals responsible for IT system operation are able to develop
                               and implement the system termination plan, including security
                               requirements for archiving/disposing of resources.

 Knowledge Levels        —

 Sample Learning Objectives —

 At the conclusion of this module, individuals will be able to:

 1.    Beginning   — Comply with termination procedures and           report any potenticd IT security
       incidents or actual breaches to proper authorities.


 2.    Intermediate   — Ensure   that hardware, software, data, and facility resources are archived,
       sanitized, or disposed of in a manner consistent with the system termination plan.


 3.    Advanced    — Develop    the system termination plan to ensure that IT security breaches are
       avoided during shutdown and long-term protection of archived resources is achieved.
