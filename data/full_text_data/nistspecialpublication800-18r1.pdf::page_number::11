The roles and responsibilities in this section are specific to information system security
planning. Recognizing that agencies have widely varying missions and organizational
structures, there may be differences in naming conventions for security planning-related
roles and how the associated responsibilities are allocated among agency personnel (e.g.,
multiple individuals filling a single role or one individual filling multiple roles4).

1.7.1 Chief Information Officer
The Chief Information Officer (CIO)5 is the agency official responsible for developing
and maintaining an agency-wide information security program and has the following
responsibilities for system security planning:

     â€¢   Designates a senior agency information security officer (SAISO) who shall carry
         out the CIO's responsibilities for system security planning,

4
  Caution should be exercised when one individual fills multiple roles in the security planning process to
ensure that the individual retains an appropriate level of independence and remains free from conflicts of
interest.
5
  When an agency has not designated a formal CIO position, FISMA requires the associated responsibilities
to be handled by a comparable agency official.
