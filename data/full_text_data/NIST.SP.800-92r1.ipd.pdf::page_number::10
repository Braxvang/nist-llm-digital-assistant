      October 2023                                                                            Planning Guide



180      Introduction
181   A log is a record of the events that occur within an organization’s computing assets, including
182   physical and virtual platforms, networks, services, and cloud environments. Logs are composed
183   of log entries, and each entry contains information related to a specific event, which is an
184   observable occurrence in a computing asset. Logs serve many functions within most
185   organizations, such as optimizing system and network performance, recording the actions of
186   users, and providing useful data for investigating malicious activity. Many logs contain records
187   that are relevant for cybersecurity, such as operating system logs that capture system events and
188   audit records, application logs that capture application operational and security events, and
189   cybersecurity software logs that record routine events, adverse events, and possible malicious
190   activity.
191   Log management is the process for generating, transmitting, storing, accessing, and disposing of
192   log data. It facilitates an organization’s log usage and analysis. Log management can benefit an
193   organization in many ways. For example, it helps ensure that records are stored in sufficient
194   detail for an appropriate period of time. The continuous monitoring and analysis of logs are
195   beneficial for identifying security incidents, policy violations, fraudulent activity, and
196   operational problems shortly after they have occurred, and for providing useful information for
197   resolving such problems. Logs can also be useful for performing auditing and forensic analysis,
198   supporting the organization’s internal investigations, establishing baselines, verifying that assets
199   operate as intended, and identifying operational trends and long-term problems.
200   Logging and log management practices are part of many cybersecurity and privacy-related laws,
201   regulations, standards, guidance, and recommendations for every sector.

202          Purpose and Scope
203   The purpose of this document is to help all organizations improve their log management so that
204   they have the log data they need. The document’s scope is cybersecurity log management
205   planning. All other aspects of logging and log management, including implementing log
206   management technology and making use of log data, are out of scope. The log plan is informed
207   by the activities that will leverage the logs to inform security and operational decisions.
208   This document replaces the original NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-92 [SP800-92], which
209   was released in 2006. That material was developed at a time when many organizations were just
210   starting to think about log management. With the wealth of information now available on log
211   management, this revision of NIST SP 800-92 focuses on high-level guidance for organization-
212   wide improvement, not the details of implementation nor the capabilities of particular
213   technologies.
214   The main content of this publication is a playbook for cybersecurity log management planning.
215   The playbook provides actionable steps that organizations can take to plan improvements to their
216   log management practices in support of recommended practices and regulatory requirements.
217   The playbook contains four high-level plays, each of which is a practice that involves two or
218   more tasks (or other lower-level plays). The playbook and the plays are not comprehensive, but
219   the listed plays are noteworthy and generally beneficial to organizations. Section 2 provides
220   additional information on how to make use of the playbook and plays.
