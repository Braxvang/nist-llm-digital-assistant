                                                                  GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


All address ranges not listed in Table 3-2 are reserved or unassigned. IANA currently assigns only out of

     3.1.3    IPv6 Address Types

IPv6 uses the notion of address types for different situations. These different address types are defined
below:

          Unicast Addresses. Addresses that identify one interface on a single node; a packet with a
           unicast destination address is delivered to that interface.

          Multicast Addresses. RFC 4291 defines a multicast address as, ―An identifier for a set of
           interfaces (typically belonging to different nodes). A packet sent to a multicast address is
           delivered to all interfaces identified by that address.‖ Although multicast addresses are
           common in both IPv4 and IPv6, in IPv6 multicasting has new applications. The single most
           important aspect of multicast addressing under IPv6 is that it enables fundamental IPv6
           functionality, including neighbor discovery (ND) and router discovery. Multicast addresses
           begin with FF00::/8. They are intended for efficient one-to-many and many-to-many
           communication. The IPv6 standards prohibit sending packets from a multicast address;
           multicast addresses are valid only as destinations. Multicast Addressing is discussed in
           Section 4.2.

          Anycast Addresses. Addresses that can identify several interfaces on one or more nodes; a
           packet with an anycast destination address is delivered to one of the interfaces bearing the
           address, usually the closest one as determined by routing protocols. Anycast addressing was
           introduced as an add-on for IPv4, but it was designed as a basic component of IPv6.

               The format of anycast addresses is indistinguishable from unicast addresses.

                                            n bits                             128  n bits
                                       subnet prefix                        00000000000000


      The subnet prefix in an anycast address is the prefix that identifies a specific link. Anycast addresses
      are intended for efficiently providing services that any one of a number of nodes can perform (e.g., a
      Home Agent for a Mobile IP node). Anycast addresses may not be used as source addresses and, as
      of the writing of this guide, may only be assigned to routers. It should be noted that there are no
      defined mechanisms for security or registration for anycast, nor is there a way to verify that a
      response to a packet sent to an anycast address was sent by an interface authorized to do so. This
      leaves open the possibility of impersonating anycast servers.
          Broadcast Addresses. Broadcast addressing is a common attribute of IPv4, but is not defined
           or implemented in IPv6. Multicast addressing in IPv6 meets the requirements that broadcast
           addressing formerly fulfilled.

3.1.4        IPv6 Address Scope

The shortage of IPv4 addresses led to the designation of non-routable addresses in RFC 1918 and the
