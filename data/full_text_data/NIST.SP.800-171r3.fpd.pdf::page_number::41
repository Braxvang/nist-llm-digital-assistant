937             software license information — and for networked components — the machine names and
938             network addresses for all implemented protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). Inventory specifications
939             include component type, physical location, date of receipt, manufacturer, cost, model, serial
940             number, and supplier information.

944   3.4.11. Information Location
945             REQUIREMENT: 03.04.11
946             a. Identify and document the location of CUI and the system components on which the
947                information is processed and stored.
948             b. Identify and document the users who have access to the system and system components
949                where CUI is processed and stored.
950             c.   Document changes to the location (i.e., system or system components) where CUI is
951                  processed and stored.

952             DISCUSSION
953             Information location addresses the need to understand the specific system components where
954             CUI is being processed and stored and the users who have access to CUI so that appropriate
955             protection mechanisms can be provided, including information flow controls, access controls,
956             and information management.

960   3.4.12. System and Component Configuration for High-Risk Areas
961             REQUIREMENT: 03.04.12
962             a. Issue systems or system components with the following configurations to individuals
963                traveling to high-risk locations: [Assignment: organization-defined system configurations].
964             b. Apply the following security requirements to the system or system components when the
965                individuals return from travel: [Assignment: organization-defined security requirements].

966             DISCUSSION
967             When it is known that a system or a specific system component will be in a high-risk area,
968             additional security requirements may be needed to counter the increased threat. Organizations
969             can implement protective measures on systems or system components used by individuals
970             departing on and returning from travel. Actions include determining the locations that are of
971             concern, defining the required configurations for the components, ensuring that the components
972             are configured as intended before travel is initiated, and taking additional actions after travel is
973             completed. For example, systems going into high-risk areas can be configured with sanitized
974             hard drives, limited applications, and more stringent configuration settings. Actions applied to
