     802.11i. The majority of types of events that can be detected by wireless IDPSs fall into this
     detection category.
 Unusual usage patterns. Some sensors can use anomaly-based detection methods to detect unusual
  WLAN usage patterns. For example, if many more STAs than usual are using a particular AP, or
  there is a much higher than usual amount of network traffic between a STA and AP, one of the
  devices might have been compromised, or unauthorized parties might be using the WLAN. Many
  sensors can identify failed attempts to join the WLAN, such as alerting on several failed attempts in a
  short period of time, which could indicate an attempt to gain unauthorized access to the WLAN.
  Some sensors can also alert if any WLAN activity is detected during off-hours periods.
 The use of wireless network scanners (e.g., war driving tools). Such scanners are used to identify
  unsecured or weakly secured WLANs. Wireless IDPS sensors can detect only the use of active
  scanners—scanners that generate wireless network traffic. They cannot detect the use of passive
  sensors that simply monitor and analyze observed traffic. 38
 Denial of service (DoS) attacks and conditions (e.g., network interference). DoS attacks include
  logical attacks such as flooding, which involves sending large numbers of messages to an AP at a
  high rate, and physical attacks such as jamming, which involves emitting electromagnetic energy on
  the WLAN’s frequencies to make the frequencies unusable by the WLAN. DoS attacks can often be
  detected through stateful protocol analysis and anomaly detection methods, which can determine if
  the observed activity is consistent with the expected activity. Many denial of service attacks are
  detected by counting events during periods of time and alerting when threshold values are exceeded.
  For example, a large number of events involving the termination of wireless network sessions can
  indicate a DoS attack.
 Impersonation and man-in-the-middle attacks. Some wireless IDPS sensors can detect when a
  device is attempting to spoof the identity of another device. This is done by identifying differences in
  the characteristics of the activity, such as certain values in frames.
Most wireless IDPS sensors can identify the physical location of a detected threat by using
triangulation—estimating the threat’s approximate distance from multiple sensors by the strength of the
threat’s signal received by each sensor, then calculating the physical location at which the threat would be
the estimated distance from each sensor. This allows an organization to send physical security staff to the
location to address the threat. Wireless IDPS products that can use building floor plans can also
determine if the threat is inside or outside a building, or if it is in a public area or secured area. This
information is helpful not only in finding and stopping the threat, but also in prioritizing the response to
the threat. Wireless IDPS sensors can set the priority of alerts based in part on the location of each threat.
Handheld IDPS sensors can also be used to pinpoint a threat’s location, particularly if fixed sensors do
not offer triangulation capabilities or if the threat is moving.

5.3.3.2 Detection Accuracy

Compared to other forms of IDPS, wireless IDPS is generally more accurate; this is largely due to its
limited scope (analyzing wireless networking protocols). False positives are most likely to be caused by
anomaly-based detection methods, especially if threshold values are not properly maintained. Although
many alerts might occur based on benign activity, such as another organization’s WLAN being within
range of the organization’s WLANs, these alerts are not truly false positives because they are accurately
detecting an unknown WLAN within the organization’s facilities.


38
     In many cases, the most effective way to identify the use of passive scanners is through physical security controls, such as
     seeing individuals with computers and antennas in proximity to the organization’s facilities.
