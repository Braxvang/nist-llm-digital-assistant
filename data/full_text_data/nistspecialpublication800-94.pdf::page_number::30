GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



 Performing regular vulnerability assessments
 Receiving notifications from vendors of security problems with IDPS components (including OSs and
  non-IDPS applications) and responding appropriately to those notifications
 Receiving notifications from the IDPS vendor of updates, and performing testing and deployment of
  the updates. Updates are described in Section 3.3.2.3.
3.3.2.3 Acquiring and Applying Updates

There are two types of IDPS updates: software updates and signature updates. Software updates fix bugs
in the IDPS software or add new functionality, while signature updates add new detection capabilities or
refine existing detection capabilities (e.g., reducing false positives). For many IDPSs, signature updates
cause program code to be altered or replaced, so they are really a specialized form of software update.
For other IDPSs, signatures are not written in code, so a signature update is a change to the configuration
data for the IDPS.

Software updates can include any or all IDPS components, including sensors, agents, management
servers, and consoles. Software updates for sensors and management servers, particularly appliance-
based devices, are often applied by replacing an existing IDPS CD with a new one and rebooting the
device. Many IDPSs run the software directly from the CD, so that no software installation is required.
Other components, such as agents, require an administrator to install software or apply patches, either
manually on each host or automatically through IDPS management software. Some vendors make
software and signature updates available for download from their Web sites or other servers; often, the
administrator interfaces for IDPSs have features for downloading and installing such updates.

Administrators should verify the integrity of updates before applying them, because updates could have
been inadvertently or intentionally altered or replaced. The recommended verification method depends
on the update’s format, as follows:

 Files downloaded from a Web site or FTP site. Administrators should compare file checksums
  provided by the vendor with checksums that they compute for the downloaded files.
 Update downloaded automatically through the IDPS user interface. If an update is downloaded
  as a single file or a set of files, either checksums provided by the vendor should be compared to
  checksums generated by the administrator, or the IDPS user interface itself should perform some sort
  of integrity check. In some cases, updates might be downloaded and installed as one action,
  precluding checksum verification; the IDPS user interface should check each update’s integrity as
  part of this.
 Removable media (e.g., CD, DVD). Vendors may not provide a specific method for customers to
  verify the legitimacy of removable media apparently sent by the vendors. If media verification is a
  concern, administrators should contact their vendors to determine how the media can be verified, such
  as comparing vendor-provided checksums to checksums computed for files on the media, or verifying
  digital signatures on the media’s contents to ensure they are valid. Administrators should also
  consider scanning the media for malware, with the caveat that false positives might be triggered by
  IDPS signatures for malware on the media.
IDPSs are typically designed so that applying software and signature updates has no effect on existing
tuning and customization settings. The primary exception is code customization, which often has to be
repeated when code updates from the vendor are installed. For any IDPS, administrators should back up
configuration settings periodically and before applying software or signature updates to ensure that
existing settings are not inadvertently lost.
