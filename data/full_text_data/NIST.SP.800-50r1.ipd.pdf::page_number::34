894   Determining who in the organization will participate in role-based training is a multi-step
895   process that begins with defining the significant cybersecurity and privacy work roles in the
896   organization and identifying the staff who are aligned with the designated work role. Often, the
897   determination begins with senior leadership with direction from the office of the CIO, CISO, or
898   CPO and in partnership with the Human Resources department. The Learning Program Manager
899   should participate closely in this effort to identify those on their team who have significant
900   cybersecurity and privacy responsibilities and need additional training.
901   The work roles should also be included in position descriptions, hierarchy charts, and
902   responsibilities to show how the work required to achieve a particular objective has been
903   identified. Individuals may assume additional work roles based on their particular skills,
904   organization policies regarding cross-training, and organizational staffing levels. NIST SP 800-
905   181r1 [3] identifies work roles for cybersecurity and is a detailed lexicon for understanding the
906   related knowledge and skills typical for such roles.

907          Determining Scope and Complexity
908   When building any CPLP, the ultimate goal is to reduce risks to the organization, not simply
909   achieve compliance. The material should be appropriate in scope and complexity for the
910   participant, so it is necessary for the Learning Program Managers to consider the different types
911   of workforce participants who will participate in the program. The program material should also
912   contain the right level of complexity and technical knowledge for the audience’s learning
913   objectives and fulfill their training and awareness needs. This requires coordination with Human
914   Resources and the Chief Learning Officers (CLO), or equivalent, in the organization to recognize
915   the roles and responsibilities of individuals in the organization.
916   Individuals who receive the training will appreciate the effort made to ensure that they
917   understand the material in a manner appropriate to their learning needs and the nature of the
918   work that they do. The complexity of the material must be determined before development
919   begins and commensurate with the role of the person who will undergo the learning effort.
920   Material should be developed based on two important criteria: 1) the target attendee’s role, and
921   2) the cybersecurity and privacy responsibilities required for that role.

922          The CPLP Elements
923   A typical CPLP includes a variety of learning program elements that are delivered to diverse
924   audiences through a variety of platforms and methods. The Learning Program Manager will
925   work to identify the necessary and most effective types of program elements for each audience
926   type, per learning goal, and adjust their selections to match their available budget and schedule
927   considerations.
928   The typical CPLP elements are:
929      •   Awareness Activities
930      •   Practical Exercises
931      •   Training
