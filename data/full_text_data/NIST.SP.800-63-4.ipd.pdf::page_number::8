      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                             Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022


210      • Are emerging authentication models and techniques – such as FIDO passkey,
211        Verifiable Credentials, and mobile driver’s licenses – sufficiently addressed and
212        accommodated, as appropriate, by the guidelines? What are the potential associated
213        security, privacy, and usability benefits and risks?
214      • Are the controls for phishing resistance as defined in the guidelines for AAL2 and
215        AAL3 authentication clear and sufficient?
216      • How are session management thresholds and reauthentication requirements
217        implemented by agencies and organizations? Should NIST provide thresholds or
218        leave session lengths to agencies based on applications, users, and mission needs?
219      • What impacts would the proposed biometric performance requirements for this
220        volume have on real-world implementations of biometric technologies?
221   Federation and Assertions
222      • What additional privacy considerations (e.g., revocation of consent, limitations of
223        use) may be required to account for the use of identity and provisioning APIs that
224        had not previously been discussed in the guidelines?
225      • Is the updated text and introduction of “bound authenticators” sufficiently clear
226        to allow for practical implementations of federation assurance level (FAL) 3
227        transactions? What complications or challenges are anticipated based on the
228        updated guidance?
229   General
230      • Is there an element of this guidance that you think is missing or could be expanded?
231      • Is any language in the guidance confusing or hard to understand? Should we add
232        definitions or additional context to any language?
233      • Does the guidance sufficiently address privacy?
234      • Does the guidance sufficiently address equity?
235             – What equity assessment methods, impact evaluation models, or metrics
236               could we reference to better support organizations in preventing or detecting
237               disparate impacts that could arise as a result of identity verification
238               technologies or processes?
239      • What specific implementation guidance, reference architectures, metrics, or other
240        supporting resources may enable more rapid adoption and implementation of this
241        and future iterations of the Digital Identity Guidelines?
242      • What applied research and measurement efforts would provide the greatest impact
243        on the identity market and advancement of these guidelines?
