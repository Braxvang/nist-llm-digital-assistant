Special Publication 800-85B                                 PIV Data Model Testing Specification


Test Scenario           1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                        2. Set OID := <<Card Holder Fingerprints
                           (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.96.16)>>
                        3. Call pivGetData w/
                            • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                        4. Extract the value field for tag 0xBC, extract the first
                           88 bytes (CBEFF Header) and read the BDB Format Type
                           field (based on its position) in CBEFF Header.
Expected Result(s) The BDB Format Type field has a value of 0x0201.

9.1.2.5   Biometric Creation Date
Purpose                 Validates that the creation date in the PIV Patron Format is encoded in 8
                        bytes using a binary representation of “YYYYMMDDhhmmssZ”.

                       4. AS05.03.08
Precondition(s)         1. A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                        2. A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and
                            the contact reader.
                        3. The test application is currently connected to the card application
                             which is accessible through card handle.
                        4. A valid Card Holder Fingerprints object is present on the PIV card.
                        5. Security conditions to read the object are met.
Test Scenario           1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                        2. Set OID := <<Card Holder Fingerprints
                           (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.96.16)>>
                        3. Call pivGetData w/
                            • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                        4. Extract the value field for tag 0xBC, extract the first
                           88 bytes (CBEFF Header) and read the Biometric Creation
                           Date field (based on its position) in CBEFF Header.
Expected Result(s) The Biometric Creation Date is in the YYYYMMDDhhmmssZ format.

9.1.2.6   Validity Period Dates
Purpose                 Validates that the Validity Period in the PIV Patron Format contains two
                        dates encoded in the same format as expected in 9.1.2.5 above.
