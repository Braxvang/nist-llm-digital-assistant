While these validation programs do not guarantee security, they can significantly increase
confidence in the security and integrity of the CKMS.

FR:11.3 The CKMS design shall specify all validation programs under which any of the
CKMS devices have been validated.

FR:11.4 The CKMS design shall specify all validation certificate numbers for its
validated devices.

11.1.2 Architectural Review of System Design
Under this activity, a team of experts is assembled to evaluate the CKMS architecture.
The architecture review team should have access to the CKMS design information, the
third-party validation information, and the results of all available CKMS testing. The
recommendations provided by the architecture review team should be reviewed by the
designer, and the recommendations that are selected to be integrated into the CKMS
should result in documented and implemented design changes. The architecture review
team should also make recommendations for penetration-testing scenarios that are
reviewed by the CKMS management. Penetration tests that are selected to be performed
should be done in a timely manner in accordance with CKMS management direction.

The architecture review team should have expertise in cryptography, cryptographic
protocols, secure system design, network security, computer security, human
usability/accessibility, functional safety, distributed system design, and applicable
information system law and regulations.

FR:11.5 The CKMS design shall specify whether an architectural review is required as
part of the full security assessment.

FR:11.6 If an architectural review is required, then the CKMS design shall specify the
skill set required by the architectural review team.

11.1.3 Functional and Security Testing
Functional and security testing is typically performed as part of the full security
assessment, the periodic security review, and the incremental security assessment. A
variety of functional and security tests may be performed by the vendor, the information
owner, or a trusted third-party (see Section 9).

FR:11.7 The CKMS design shall specify all required functional and security testing of
the CKMS.

FR:11.8 The CKMS design shall report the results of all functional and security tests
performed to date.
