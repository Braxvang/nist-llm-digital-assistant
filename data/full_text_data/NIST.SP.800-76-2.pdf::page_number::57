A.3.2   Template matcher
A template matcher shall be certified as a software library. For PIV, a matcher is a software function that compares
enrollment templates with authentication templates to produce a similarity score. The similarity score shall be an
integer or real value quantity. The enrollment templates represent the PIV Card templates. The authentication
templates represent those extracted from fingerprints collected in an authentication attempt. A supplier's
implementation, submitted for certification, shall satisfy the API specification published by the test organizer.
The API specification will support at a minimum the comparison of one authentication template (from an individual's
primary or secondary fingers) with one enrollment template (from the same finger of either the same person or
another individual). Both templates shall conform to the Table 6 profile of [MINUSTD].
The test shall require that all invocations of the matching function shall yield a similarity score regardless of the input
templates. Larger scores shall be construed as indicating higher likelihood that the input data originated from the
same person. A failure or refusal to compare the inputs shall in all cases result in the reporting of a score. This
document recommends implementers report a low score in this case.
The input [MINUSTD] enrollment templates shall be prepared by the test agent using software from a supplier. The
input [MINUSTD] authentication templates shall be the output of the template generation software provided by the
supplier of the matcher under test. This means that a matcher cannot be certified as a standalone item.

A.4 Test procedure
The testing laboratory shall publish a test specification document. This document shall establish deadlines for
submission of products for certification.
The supplier of a template generator shall submit a request for certification to the testing laboratory. The testing
laboratory shall provide a set of image samples to these suppliers. The supplier shall submit templates from this data
to the testing laboratory. The supplier shall submit the template generator to the testing laboratory. The testing
laboratory shall execute it and check that it produces identical templates to those submitted by the supplier. The
testing laboratory shall apply a conformance assessor to the templates. The testing laboratory shall report to the
supplier whether identical templates were produced and whether the templates are conformant to the specifications
in Table 18. This validation process may be iterative.
The supplier of a template matcher shall submit a request for certification to the testing laboratory. The testing
laboratory shall provide a set of samples to these suppliers. This set shall support debugging and shall consist of
images representative of those collected in PIV registration. The supplier shall submit similarity scores from this data
to the testing laboratory. The supplier shall submit the template matcher to the testing laboratory. The testing
laboratory shall execute it and check that it produces identical scores to those submitted by the supplier. The testing
laboratory shall report to the supplier the result of the check. This validation process may be iterative.
The testing laboratory shall apply all template generators to the first biometric sample from each member of the test
corpus. The testing laboratory shall invoke all template matchers to compare the resulting enrollment templates with
second authentication templates from each member of the corpus. The authentication template shall be generated
by the matcher supplier's generator (i.e., not by another supplier's generator). This shall be done for all pair wise
combinations of template generators and template matchers. The result is a set of genuine similarity scores for each
combination.
The testing laboratory shall invoke all template matchers to compare enrollment templates with second
authentication templates from members of a disjoint population. The authentication template shall, in all cases, be
generated by the matcher supplier's generator. This shall be done for all pair wise combinations of template
generators and template matchers. The result is a set of impostor similarity scores for each combination. The order
in which genuine and impostor similarity scores are generated shall be randomized (i.e., it is not implied by the order
of the last two paragraphs).
The testing laboratory shall sum the similarity score obtained from matching of the image of a primary finger with
that obtained from matching of the image of a secondary finger. This sum-rule fusion represents two-finger
authentication.
