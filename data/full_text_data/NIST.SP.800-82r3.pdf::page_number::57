NIST SP 800-82r3                                         Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

The OT cybersecurity strategy:
   •   Refines and supplements guidance from the organization-wide risk management strategy
       to address OT-specific constraints and requirements
   •   Identifies the OT cybersecurity team and personnel
   •   Addresses the OT cybersecurity operation model (e.g., insource, outsource, and/or use
       managed security services)
   •   Outlines the appropriate cybersecurity architecture for the various OT sites within the OT
       program
   •   Defines OT-specific cybersecurity training and awareness
The OT cybersecurity strategy should help refine the organizational risk tolerance for the OT
operation, which in turn drives the priorities for the OT cybersecurity operation. The program
should also address both IT and OT concerns and requirements. For example, IT may consider
data loss or system availability as a higher priority, but OT may value system safety, production
efficiency, and environmental damage as higher priorities.
Further guidance for developing an OT cybersecurity strategy can be found in Section 5, Section
6, Appendix C, and Appendix D. Additional information and specific examples for establishing
an OT cybersecurity strategy are also provided in NIST IR 8183A, Cybersecurity Framework
Manufacturing Profile Low Impact Level Example Implementations Guide [IR8183A].

3.3.4. Define OT-Specific Policies and Procedures
Policies and procedures are essential to the success of any cybersecurity program. Where
possible, OT-specific security policies and procedures should be derived from existing IT
cybersecurity and plant operational policies and procedures for consistency throughout the
organization.
As discussed earlier, organizational management is responsible for developing and
communicating the risk tolerance level of the organization (i.e., the level of risk that the
organization is willing to accept), which allows the OT cybersecurity manager to determine the
risk management strategy. The development of cybersecurity policies should be based on a risk
assessment that will set the security priorities and goals for the organization. Procedures that
support the policies need to be developed so that the policies are implemented fully and properly
for OT. Cybersecurity procedures should be documented, tested, and updated periodically in
response to policy, technology, and threat changes.
Further guidance for developing OT-specific policies and procedures can be found in Section 6.
Additional information with examples for establishing OT-specific policies and procedures are
also provided in NIST IR 8183A, Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile Low Impact
Level Example Implementations Guide [IR8183A].
