SP 800-130                                                            August 2013



FR:9.10 The CKMS design shall specify:
   a) The devices (including their source code, documentation, build scripts, executable
      code, firmware, hardware, documentation, and test code) to be kept under
      configuration control.
   b) The protection requirements (e.g., formal authorizations and proper record
      keeping) to ensure that only authorized changes are made to the components and
      devices under configuration control.

9.8.2 Secure Delivery
When products to be used in a CKMS are delivered, assurance of secure delivery (i.e. that
the products received are the exact products that were ordered) is necessary.

FR:9.11 The CKMS design shall specify secure delivery requirements for the products
used in the CKMS, including:
   a) Protection requirements to ensure that the product has not been tampered with
        during the delivery process or that tampering is detected,
   b) Protection requirements to ensure that the product has not been replaced during
        the delivery process or that replacement is detected,
   c) Protection requirements to ensure that an unrequested delivery is detected, and
   d) Protection requirements to ensure that the product delivery is not suppressed or
        delayed and that suppression or delay is detected.

9.8.3 Development and Maintenance Environmental Security
The CKMS development and maintenance environments must be properly protected from
physical, personnel, and IT hacking threats. Tools such as compilers, software linkers,
and text editors should not be automatically trusted.

FR:9.12 The CKMS design shall specify the security requirements for the development
and maintenance environments of the CKMS, including:
   a) Physical security requirements,
   b) Personnel security requirements, such as clearances and background checks for
      developers, testers, and maintainers,
   c) Procedural security, such as multi-person control and separation of duties,
   d) Computer security controls to protect the development and maintenance
      environment and to provide access control to permit authorized user access,
   e) Network security controls to protect the development and maintenance
      environment from hacking attempts,
   f) Cryptographic security control to protect the integrity of software and its control
      data under development, and
   g) The means used to ensure that the tools (e.g., editors, compiler, software linkers,
      loaders, etc.) are trustworthy and are not sources of malware.
