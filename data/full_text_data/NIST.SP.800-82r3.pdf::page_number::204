September 2023

D.1.3.1.       IEC Technical Committee 57
The scope of TC 57 is to prepare international standards for power systems control equipment
and systems, including energy management systems (EMSs), SCADA, distribution automation,
teleprotection, and associated information exchange for real-time and non-real-time information
used in the planning, operation, and maintenance of power systems.

       grid

D.1.3.2.       IEC Technical Committee 65
The scope of TC 65 is to prepare international standards for the systems and elements used for
industrial process measurement, control, and automation to coordinate standardization activities
that affect the integration of components and functions into such systems, including safety and
security aspects. This work of standardization is to be carried out in the international fields for
equipment and systems.
