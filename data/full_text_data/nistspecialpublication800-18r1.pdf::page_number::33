mechanisms primarily implemented and executed by people (as opposed to systems).
These controls are put in place to improve the security of a particular system (or group of
systems). They often require technical or specialized expertise and often rely upon
management activities as well as technical controls. Technical controls focus on security
controls that the computer system executes. The controls can provide automated
protection for unauthorized access or misuse, facilitate detection of security violations,
and support security requirements for applications and data.


3.15 Completion and Approval Dates
The completion date of the system security plan should be provided. The completion date
should be updated whenever the plan is periodically reviewed and updated. When the
system is updated, a version number should be added. The system security plan should
also contain the date the authorizing official or the designated approving authority
approved the plan. Approval documentation, i.e., accreditation letter, approval
memorandum, should be on file or attached as part of the plan.


3.16 Ongoing System Security Plan Maintenance
Once the information system security plan is developed, it is important to periodically
assess the plan, review any change in system status, functionality, design, etc., and ensure
that the plan continues to reflect the correct information about the system. This
documentation and its correctness are critical for system certification activity. All plans
should be reviewed and updated, if appropriate, at least annually. Some items to include
in the review are:

   •   Change in information system owner;
   •   Change in information security representative;
   •   Change in system architecture;
   •   Change in system status;
   •   Additions/deletions of system interconnections;
   •   Change in system scope;
   •   Change in authorizing official; and
   •   Change in certification and accreditation status.
