                                                            CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



      In the outsourced private cloud scenario, however, these limits may be adjusted, although not
      eliminated, by provisioning high-performance and/or high-reliability networking between the
      provider and consumer. This provisioning, however, would require a special contract and incur
      significant costs.
 Potentially strong security from external threats (outsourced-private). As with the on-site
  private cloud scenario, a variety of techniques exist to harden a security perimeter. The main
  difference with the outsourced private cloud is that the techniques need to be applied both to a
  consumer's perimeter and to a provider's perimeter, and that the communications link needs to be
  protected.
 Modest-to-significant up-front costs to migrate into the cloud (outsourced-private). Unlike the
  case of an on-site private cloud, where physical computing resources need to be provisioned or
  scavenged by a consumer before the cloud can start operating, in the outsourced private cloud
  scenario, the resources are provisioned by the provider, and the main startup costs for the consumer
  relate to: (1) negotiating the terms of the service level agreement (e.g., agreeing on suitable protection
  mechanisms), (2) possibly upgrading the consumer's network to connect to the outsourced private
  cloud, (3) switching from traditional applications to cloud-hosted applications, (4) porting existing
  non-cloud operations to the cloud, and (5) training. Although these costs may be significant, they do
  not include server-side equipment and its supporting infrastructure.
 Extensive resources available (outsourced-private). Unlike the case of an on-site private cloud, in
  which the resources must be provisioned by a consumer up front, in the case of the outsourced private
  cloud, a consumer can rent resources in any quantity offered by the provider. Provisioning and
  operating computing equipment at scale is a core competency of providers. Hence it is likely that a
  provider can provision relatively large private clouds as needed. As with the on-site private cloud, an
  outsourced private cloud has a fixed capacity at any given time, and providing elasticity for clients is
  achievable only if the cloud is large enough and there is sufficient diversity of workloads. As with an
  on-site private cloud, an outsourced private cloud will exhibit maximum capacity limits similar to
  those of traditional data centers.
4.4     The On-site Community Cloud Scenario

Figure 5 depicts an on-site community cloud. The community depicted in the figure is made up of a set
of participant organizations. Each participant organization may provide cloud services, consume cloud
services, or both. It is necessary for at least one community member to provide cloud services for a
community cloud to be functional. The figure depicts members that provide cloud services (and possibly
consume them also) on the left and those that consume-only on the right. Assuming that each
organization implements a security perimeter, the participant organizations are connected via links
between the boundary controllers that allow access through their security perimeters. Optionally,
organizations may implement extra security perimeters to isolate the local cloud resources from other
local resources. Many network configurations are possible; the figure shows the extra security perimeter
as being inside an organization's "non-cloud" security perimeter although it could be located outside as
well. The boundary controllers in any configuration should grant appropriate access to the cloud
resources both to local clients and to clients of other participant organizations. Importantly, providing
access to local cloud resources should not grant access to non-cloud resources unless granting such access
is a specific policy goal.
