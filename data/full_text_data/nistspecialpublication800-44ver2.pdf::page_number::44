                                                                    GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



 Apply appropriate security template or hardening script to server.

 Reconfigure HTTP service banner (and others as required) not to report Web server and OS type and
  version (this may not be possible with all Web servers).

Organizations should consider installing the Web server with non-standard directory names, directory
locations, and filenames. Many Web server attack tools and worms targeting Web servers only look for
files and directories in their default locations. While this will not stop determined attackers, it will force
them to work harder to compromise the server, and it also increases the likelihood of attack detection
because of the failed attempts to access the default filenames and directories and the additional time
needed to perform an attack.

5.2     Configuring Access Controls

Most Web server host OSs provide the capability to specify access privileges individually for files,
devices, and other computational resources on that host. Any information that the Web server can access
using these controls can potentially be distributed to all users accessing the public Web site. The Web
server software is likely to include mechanisms to provide additional file, device, and resource access
controls specific to its operation. It is important to set identical permissions for both the OS and Web
server application; otherwise, too much or too little access may be granted to users. Web server
administrators should consider how best to configure access controls to protect information stored on
public Web servers from two perspectives:

 Limit the access of the Web server application to a subset of computational resources.

 Limit the access of users through additional access controls enforced by the Web server, where more
  detailed levels of access control are required.

The proper setting of access controls can help prevent the disclosure of sensitive or restricted information
that is not intended for public dissemination. In addition, access controls can be used to limit resource use
in the event of a DoS attack against the Web server. Similarly, access controls can enforce separation of
duty by ensuring Web server logs cannot be modified by Web server administrators and potentially
ensure that the Web server process is only allowed to append to the log files.

Typical files to which access should be controlled are as follows:

 Application software and configuration files

 Files related directly to security mechanisms:

       Password hash files and other files used in authentication

       Files containing authorization information used in controlling access

       Cryptographic key material used in confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation services

 Server log and system audit files

 System software and configuration files

 Web content files.
