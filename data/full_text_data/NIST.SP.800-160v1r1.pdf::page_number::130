Process relationships are further illustrated by the use cases in [94]. Several prominent use cases
include:
•    Establish a formal agreement
     -     Agreements between organizations, between projects, and for work efforts within a
           project
     -     Commonly a formal contract between an acquirer and the supplier, including a prime
           contractor and its subcontractors
•    Satisfy an agreement
     -     Processes to satisfy the agreement, including information that a supplying organization
           provides to the acquiring organization to ensure compliance with the agreement
•    Engineer a system of interest 96
     -     Relationships among the technical processes (Appendix H) 97

The following sources provide additional information on system life cycle processes and their
relationships: [4] [13] [15] [17] [18] [19] [27] [94] [95] [96]. Processes for software-intensive
systems are discussed in [86].




96
   The application of technical processes for engineering a system of interest will occur recursively to realize subsystems and system elements.
See Annex A of [96] for additional details.
97
   This use case often supports satisfying an agreement.
