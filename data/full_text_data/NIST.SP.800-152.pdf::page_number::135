This glossary defines terms that are used in this Profile, some of which may also be
defined in the Framework.

Access control system      A set of procedures and/or processes, normally automated,
                           which allows access to a controlled area or to information to
                           be controlled, in accordance with pre-established policies and
                           rules.
Active state               A lifecycle state for a key in which the key may be used to
                           cryptographically protect information (e.g., encrypt plaintext
                           or generate a digital signature), to cryptographically process
                           previously protected information (e.g., decrypt ciphertext or
                           verify a digital signature) or both.
Approved security          A security function (e.g., cryptographic algorithm,
function                   cryptographic key management technique, or authentication
                           technique) that is either
                               a) Specified in an Approved standard,

                                  in an appendix of the Approved standard or in a
                                  document referenced by the Approved standard, or
                               c) Specified in the list of Approved security functions.
