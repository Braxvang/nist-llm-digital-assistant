8. Security Planning
    Todayâ€™s rapidly changing technical environment requires that federal agencies
adopt a minimum set of security controls to protect their information and information
systems. The purpose of the system security plan is to provide an overview of the
security requirements of the system and describe the controls in place or planned for
meeting those requirements. The system security plan also delineates responsibilities
and expected behavior of all individuals who access the system. It should reflect
input from various managers with responsibilities concerning the system, including
information owners, the system owner, and the senior agency information security
officer (SAISO). Agencies, at their discretion, can include additional information in
the basic plan and add sections to the basic format prescribed herein, as long as the
major sections described in this document are adequately covered and readily
identifiable.
    Program managers, system owners, and security personnel in the organization
must understand the system security planning process. In addition, users of the
information system and those responsible for defining system requirements should
also be familiar with the system security planning process, as the system security
plan is an important deliverable in the system development life cycle (SDLC)
process. 49 Those responsible for implementing and managing information systems
must participate in addressing security controls to be applied to their systems.
    Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 200, Minimum Security
Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems, specifies the
minimum security requirements for federal information and information systems in
seventeen security-related areas. Federal agencies must meet the minimum security
requirements defined in FIPS 200 by using the security controls in National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Recommended
Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, and NIST SP 800-18 Rev.1, Guide
for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems, which provides a
Systems Security Plan Template in Appendix A of the document. The guidance below
provides basic information on how to prepare a system security plan in accordance
with applicable federal requirements, and it is easily adaptable to a variety of
organizational structures.

8.1 Major Applications, General Support Systems, and Minor Applications
    All information systems must be covered by a system security plan and labeled
as a major application (MA) 50 or general support system (GSS). 51 Specific system

   Cycle, and Chapter 3, System Development Life Cycle, of this guide for additional guidance on the

   Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix III, defines major application as an
   application that requires special attention to security due to the risk and magnitude of harm resulting
   from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of the information in the application.
51
   OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, defines general support system as an interconnected set of
   information resources under the same direct management control that shares common functionality. It
   normally includes hardware, software, information, data, applications, communications, and people.
