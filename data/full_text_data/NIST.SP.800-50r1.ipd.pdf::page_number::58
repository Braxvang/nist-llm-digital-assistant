1754   the time to confirm that the required reporting and metrics can be satisfied in later program
1755   phases. Steps to consider before initiating the implementation phase include:
1756      1. Communicate the CPLP implementation
1757      2. Plan to measure success by establishing measurement, metric, and reporting requirements
1758      3. Build a CPLP schedule
1759      4. Plan to evaluate program success by reviewing post-implementation
1760         feedback, measurements, and metrics

1761          Communicating the CPLP Implementation
1762   Communication is a large part of developing an organization’s shared culture of supporting the
1763   Learning Program efforts. The Learning Program Manager should develop a Communications
1764   Plan for each phase of the program element implementation and include the organization’s
1765   communication team. The Learning Program Manager should determine the appropriate timing
1766   to inform managers, supervisors, and possibly the personnel involved about upcoming and
1767   required Learning Program elements, as well as the frequency with which to send out reminders
1768   and other forms of communication that encourage cooperation from the organization.
1769   Communication is a large part of developing an organization’s shared culture of supporting the
1770   Learning Program efforts.
1771   Each individual CPLP element (e.g., presentation, course, or tabletop exercise) requires a
1772   separate and more detailed form of communication to inform the learners and their managers of
1773   the following:
1774      •   Purpose of the training or learning activity
1775      •   Participating employee groups (if not all users)
1776      •   Consequences of not completing the training (by deadline or at all)
1777      •   Course title
1778      •   Delivery method (e.g., in person, virtual delivery, self-directed online learning, etc.)
1779      •   Required or recommended accommodations
1780      •   Tracking method (and completion tracking)
1781      •   Availability date
1782      •   Due date
1783      •   Verification of users with significant cybersecurity responsibilities
1784      •   How to request accommodations
1785   The Communications Plan should include a clear explanation of why the training is being
1786   mandated or encouraged. Applicable federal legislation, regulations, and internal (agency or
1787   organizational) policies should be referenced.
1788   Each category of user must be specified for the training assigned. For example, if the
1789   organization’s policy states that all IT users must complete a particular training to gain or
