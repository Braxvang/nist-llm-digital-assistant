GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



     ! Second Extended Filesystem (ext2fs). 20 ext2fs is supported natively by Linux. It supports
       standard UNIX file types and filesystem checks to ensure filesystem consistency. The maximum
       ext2fs volume size is 4 TB.
     ! Third Extended Filesystem (ext3fs). ext3fs is supported natively by Linux. It is based on the
       ext2fs filesystem and provides journaling capabilities that allow consistency checks of the
       filesystem to be performed quickly on large amounts of data. The maximum ext3fs volume size
       is 4 TB.
     ! ReiserFS.21 ReiserFS is supported by Linux and is the default filesystem for several common
       versions of Linux. It offers journaling capabilities and is significantly faster than the ext2fs and
       ext3fs filesystems. The maximum volume size is 16 TB.
     ! Hierarchical File System (HFS).22 HFS is supported natively by Mac OS. HFS is mainly used
       in older versions of Mac OS but is still supported in newer versions. The maximum HFS volume
       size under Mac OS 6 and 7 is 2 GB. The maximum HFS volume size in Mac OS 7.5 is 4 GB.
       Mac OS 7.5.2 and newer Mac OSs increase the maximum HFS volume size to 2 TB.
     ! HFS Plus.23 HFS Plus is supported natively by Mac OS 8.1 and later and is a journaling
       filesystem under Mac OS X. It is the successor to HFS and provides numerous enhancements,
       such as long filename support and Unicode filename support for international filenames. The
       maximum HFS Plus volume size is 2 TB.
     ! UNIX File System (UFS).24 UFS is supported natively by several types of UNIX OSs, including
       Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Mac OS X. However, most OSs have added proprietary
       features, so the details of UFS differ among implementations.
     ! Compact Disk File System (CDFS). As the name indicates, the CDFS filesystem is used for
       CDs.
     ! International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9660 and Joliet. The ISO 9660
       filesystem is commonly used on CD-ROMs. Another popular CD-ROM filesystem, Joliet, is a
       variant of ISO 9660. ISO 9660 supports filename lengths of up to 32 characters, whereas Joliet
       supports up to 64 characters. Joliet also supports Unicode characters within filenames.
     ! Universal Disk Format (UDF). UDF is the filesystem used for DVDs and is also used for some
       CDs.
4.1.3    Other Data on Media

As described in Section 4.1.2, filesystems are designed to store files on media. However, filesystems may
also hold data from deleted files or earlier versions of existing files. This data can provide important
information. (Section 4.2 discusses techniques for collecting this type of data.) The following items
describe how this data can still exist on various media:

     ! Deleted Files. When a file is deleted, it is typically not erased from the media; instead, the
       information in the directoryâ€™s data structure that points to the location of the file is marked as
       deleted. This means that the file is still stored on the media but is no longer enumerated by the
