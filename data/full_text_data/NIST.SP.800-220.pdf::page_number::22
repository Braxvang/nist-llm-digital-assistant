Programs: Developing an ISCM Program Assessment (NIST SP 800-137A). The ISCMAx software
tool – a free, publicly available working implementation of ISCMA – can be tailored to fit the needs
of any organization. The NISTIR 8212 includes instructions for using ISCMAx and for tailoring it if
desired.
The NIST RMF website was redesigned and expanded to include additional introductory materials,
new resources to support implementers, and improvements to usability and user experience. New
website features include the SP 800-53 Security and Privacy Controls and Baselines Search
(Release Search) and the SP 800-53 Downloads pages. The Release Search provides a browser-
based version of the SP 800-53 controls and SP 800-53B control baselines to allow users to
quickly access, search, and use the controls and baselines. The SP 800-53 Downloads page
offers the controls, baselines, and SP 800-53A assessment procedures for downloading in multiple
data formats, including Extensible Markup Language (XML), portable document format (PDF),
comma-separated value (CSV), spreadsheet, and Open Security Control Assessment Language
(OSCAL).
To promote and increase stakeholder engagement for the development of SP 800-53, NIST
released an online tool to allow real-time input about controls and control baselines. This tool,
the NIST SP 800-53 Controls Public Comment Site, is a model for how standards and guidelines
can keep pace with changes in technology and society, encourage all stakeholders to participate
in the NIST publication development and review process, and modernize how certain types of
publications are issued in a more user-friendly manner.
Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
Controlled unclassified information (CUI) is routinely shared with nonfederal organizations—state
and local governments, universities, research organizations, and the private sector—and must
be protected by the nonfederal organization. In FY 2021, NIST developed new guidelines to
protect CUI in critical programs and systems from advanced persistent threats (APTs). Enhanced
Security Requirements for Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information: A Supplement to NIST
Special Publication 800-171 (SP 800-172) offers additional recommendations for handling CUI in
situations where that information runs a higher than usual risk of exposure. The enhanced security
requirements protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of CUI from APTs by promoting
penetration-resistant architectures, damage-limiting operations, and designs to help achieve cyber
resiliency and survivability. NIST also issued Assessing Enhanced Security Requirements for CUI
(draft SP 800-172A) to assist organizations with planning and conducting efficient, effective, and
cost-effective assessments of the enhanced security requirements in SP 800-172.
Integration of Cybersecurity Risk Management into ERM
Information and technology are among the most valuable resources to each enterprise, so it is
important that cybersecurity risk management be well integrated with other elements of enterprise
risk management (ERM). Building on the foundation of Integrating Cybersecurity and Enterprise
Risk Management (NISTIR 8286), which was released in 2020, NIST has created a series of
publications to provide ways to better align enterprise risk considerations with cybersecurity risk
activities at all organizational levels. The three reports are described below:
•   NISTIR 8286A details the context, scenario identification, and analysis of the likelihood and
    impact of cybersecurity risk. It also includes methods to convey risk information, such as
    cybersecurity risk registers (CSRRs) and risk detail records.
