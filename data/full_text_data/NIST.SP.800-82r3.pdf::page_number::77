4.3.3. Select
The purpose of the Select step is to select the initial controls to protect the system commensurate
with risk. The control baselines are the starting point for the control selection process and are
chosen based on the security category and associated impact level of the systems identified in the
Categorize step. NIST SP 800-53B [SP800-53B] identifies the recommended control baselines
for federal systems and information. To address the need for developing community-wide and
specialized sets of controls for systems and organizations, the concept of overlays is introduced.
An overlay is a fully specified set of controls, control enhancements, and supplemental guidance
derived from the application of tailoring guidance to security control baselines described in NIST
SP 800-53B, Appendix C.
In general, overlays are intended to reduce the need for ad hoc tailoring of baselines by
organizations through the selection of a set of controls and control enhancements that more
closely correspond to common circumstances, situations, and/or conditions. Appendix F of this
publication includes an OT-specific overlay of applicable NIST SP 800-53 controls that provides
tailored baselines for low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact OT. These tailored
baselines are starting specifications and recommendations that can be applied to specific OT by
responsible personnel.
