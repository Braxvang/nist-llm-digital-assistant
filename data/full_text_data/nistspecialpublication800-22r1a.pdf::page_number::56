A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



2.14.2 Function Call
RandomExcursions(n), where:

        n        The length of the bit string.

Additional input used by the function, but supplied by the testing code:

        ε        The sequence of bits as generated by the RNG or PRNG being tested; this exists as a
                 global structure at the time of the function call; ε = ε1, ε2, … , εn.

2.14.3 Test Statistic and Reference Distribution
χ2(obs):      For a given state x, a measure of how well the observed number of state visits within a
              cycle match the expected number of state visits within a cycle, under an assumption of
              randomness.

The reference distribution for the test statistic is the χ2 distribution.

2.14.4 Test Description
(1)    Form a normalized (-1, +1) sequence X: The zeros and ones of the input sequence (ε) are changed
       to values of –1 and +1 via Xi = 2εi – 1.

        For example, if ε = 0110110101, then n = 10 and X = -1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1.

(2)     Compute the partial sums Si of successively larger subsequences, each starting with X1. Form the
        set S = {Si}.

                 S1 = X1
                 S2 = X1 + X2
                 S3 = X1 + X2 + X3
                 .
                 .
                 S k = X 1 + X 2 + X 3 + … + Xk
                 .
                 .
                 Sn = X1 + X2 + X3 + … + Xk + …+ Xn

        For the example in this section,
                 S1 = -1                 S6 = 2
                 S2 = 0                  S7 = 1
                 S3 = 1                  S8 = 2
                 S4 = 0                  S9 = 1
                 S5 = 1                  S10 = 2

        The set S = {-1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2}.

(3)     Form a new sequence S' by attaching zeros before and after the set S. That is, S' = 0, s1, s2, … , sn,
        0.
