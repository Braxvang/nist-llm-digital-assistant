                                                                 GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



that include only the OS and Web server application. These distributions are generally based on hardened
and/or modified general-purpose OSs (e.g., Linux, Unix, Windows) that are specifically designed to
support a secure Web server. The Web server application is also often based on a hardened and/or
modified generally available Web server application (e.g., Apache, Internet Information Service [IIS]).
These packages often include a greater number of security options and are designed to be easier to
configure through the use of precompiled scripts and graphical user interfaces (GUI). Although each of
these packages is different, they usually rely on one or more of the following to provide a higher level of
protection and security:

 Secure initial default configuration

 Hardened OS or TOS

 Hardened Web server software

 Extensive auditing capabilities

 Application wrappers

 Network wrappers and/or host-based firewall capabilities

 Host-based IDSs

 Simplified security administration (e.g., menus, GUIs).

These types of systems should be considered by organizations that face a significant threat level and/or
have high-value Web sites (e.g., major Federal government organizations, banks, health insurance
companies). These packages are available from some major hardware and software manufacturers in
addition to various specialized manufacturers.

Some issues to consider when contemplating the purchase of a hardened Web appliance:

 What is the underlying OS and how has it fared in security testing?

 How has the Web server application itself fared in security testing?

 How difficult is it to administer?

 Are the hardened Web server application and OS compatible with the organization’s existing Web
  applications and scripts?

 How quickly does the manufacturer respond to and provide patches for potential vulnerabilities?

3.6.4   Virtualized Platforms

Virtual machine technology is being used more and more frequently for Web servers. Through
virtualization, a single physical host computer can run multiple virtual machines, each with a distinct
guest OS and associated applications. A guest OS need not be aware of other OSs—even that of the
supporting host—running on the same physical platform. Virtual machine technology is improving
constantly. New versions of mainstream OSs are being designed with virtualization in mind and new x86
64-bit processors provide hardware-level support for virtualization.
