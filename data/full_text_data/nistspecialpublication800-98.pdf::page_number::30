GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



2.3.2.4 Antenna Design and Placement

Readers use a wide variety of antenna types. Each type has a different coverage pattern. To reduce the
likelihood of eavesdropping and minimize interference with other radios, the coverage should only
encompass a range sufficient to communicate with the intended tags. Antennas may be integrated into the
device or may be detachable. Readers that support detachable antennas are better suited for applications
that require specific coverage areas because an antenna can be selected or customized to meet those
requirements.

Antennas can be mounted for a particular application. Figures 2-3 and 2-4 in Section 2.3.2.3 show
examples of item tracking and automatic toll payment applications. Antennas can also be mounted on
forklifts to identify items when they are moved from one location to another. In industrial applications,
antennas are often placed in tunnels around a production line’s conveyor belt.

2.3.3   Tag-Reader Communication

Tag-reader communication is achieved by using a common communications protocol between the tag and
the reader. Tag-reader communication protocols are often specified in RFID standards. Prominent
international standards include the ISO/IEC 18000 series for item management and the ISO/IEC 14443
and ISO/IEC 15693 standards for contactless smart cards. The most recent EPCglobal Class-1
Generation-2 standard is essentially equivalent to the ISO/IEC 18000-6C standard. A more detailed
explanation of RFID standards can be found in Appendix A on RFID Standards and Security
Mechanisms.

Tag-reader communication characteristics that affect performance and security include:

 How tag-reader communication is initiated,
 How a reader identifies particular tags, and
 How far away a tag or reader’s signal can be reliably detected or interpreted.
These are discussed in detail in Sections 2.3.3.1 through 2.3.3.3.

2.3.3.1 Communication Initiation

Tags and readers can initiate RF transactions in two general ways:

 Reader Talks First (RTF). In an RTF transaction, the reader broadcasts a signal that is received by
  tags in the reader’s vicinity. Those tags may then be commanded to respond to the reader and to
  continue transactions with the reader.
 Tag Talks First (TTF). In a TTF transaction, a tag communicates its presence to a reader when the
  tag is within the reader’s RF field. If the tag is passive, then it transmits as soon as it gets power from
  the reader’s signal to do so. If the tag is active, then it transmits periodically as long as its power
  supply lasts. This type of transaction might be used when it is necessary to identify objects that pass
  by a reader, such as objects on a conveyer belt.
Readers and tags in an RFID system typically operate using only RTF or only TTF transactions, not both
types. Active tag TTF operation may be easier for an adversary to detect or intercept, because active tags
send beaconing signals even when they are not in the presence of a reader. The adversary could eavesdrop
on this communication without risking detection because in TTF transactions the adversary never has to
send a signal to ascertain the tag’s presence.
