These measures combine information about the results of security controls implementation with
a variety of information about resources. They can provide the most direct insight into the value
of information security to the organization and are the ones that are sought out by executives.
For example, the percentage of the agency’s information system budget devoted to information
security relies on information regarding the implementation, effectiveness, and outcome of the
following NIST SP 800-53 security controls: Allocation of Resources (SA-2) and Acquisitions
(SA-4). Another, more generalized budget-related impact measure would be the number of
information security investments reported to OMB in an Exhibit 300. Rather than examining the
impact of a security control or controls, this measure evaluates the relationship between the
portfolio of information security investments and the budget process.

Impact measures require tracking a variety of resource information across the organization in a
manner that can be directly tied to information security activities and events.

3.4     Measurement Considerations

Organizations embarking on information security performance measurement should be aware of
several considerations that can help make their program a success. These include specific
organizational structure and processes as well as an understanding of required budget, personnel,
and time resources.

3.4.1   Organizational Considerations

Appropriate stakeholders must be included in the development of information security measures
and program implementation. Organizational elements that do not have information security as
their primary responsibility but interact with information security on a regular basis (e.g.,
training, resource management, legal department) may need to be included in this process. (See
Section 5.1 for more information on stakeholders.) If an organizational element exists that is
responsible for performance measurement in general, the development and implementation of an
information security measurement program should be coordinated with that organization. If a
process exists for approving organization-wide data calls and actions, development and
implementation of the information security measurement program should comply with the
existing process.

3.4.2   Manageability

Any information security measurement program must be manageable for the implementing
organization. Results of many information security activities can be quantified and used for
performance measurement; however, since resources are limited and the majority of resources
should be applied to correcting performance gaps, organizations should prioritize measurement
requirements to ensure that a limited number of measures are gathered. Each stakeholder should
be responsible for as few measures as possible—usually two to three measures per stakeholder.
This helps ensure that the measures that are collected are meaningful, yield impact and outcome
findings, and provide stakeholders with the time necessary to use the results to address
performance gaps. As the program matures and target levels of measurement are reached,
