                                                                   IMPERATIVE 2 – Enhancing Risk Management



community. That alignment of the Cybersecurity Framework and the RMF is still a work
in progress with NIST committed to producing improved guidance in 2019.
     •    Systems Security Engineering: Considerations for a Multidisciplinary Approach
          in the Engineering of Trustworthy Secure Systems. The FY18 update of this
          publication addresses the engineering-driven perspective and actions necessary to
          develop more defensible and survivable systems, including the machine, physical,
          and human components that compose the systems as well as the capabilities and
          services delivered by those systems. It builds upon well-established international
          standards for systems and software and fuses systems security engineering
          methods, practices, and techniques. The objective is to address security
          issues from the perspective of stakeholder protection needs, concerns, and
          requirements using established engineering processes to ensure that those needs
          are addressed with appropriate fidelity and rigor early on and in a sustainable
          manner throughout the life cycle of the system. NIST also published a draft of the
          first in a series of specialty publications developed to support the flagship NIST
          Systems Security Engineering guideline. Volume 2 addresses cyber resiliency
          considerations for two important yet distinct communities of interest represented
          by organizations: those conducting new development of IT component products,
          systems, and services; and those with legacy systems (installed base) currently
          carrying out day-to-day missions and business functions.
     •    Privacy Framework: An Enterprise Risk Management Tool. There is growing
          concern regarding privacy issues across the country and throughout the
          world. Government organizations are putting into place multiplying privacy
          requirements that cross borders in their implementation. That is why in FY18,
          NIST laid the groundwork for developing a risk management-driven approach
          that could be used by any organization that chooses to do so. The Privacy
          Framework project, announced in September 2018 and expected to result in a
          final Framework by late 2019, is being carried out based on the same type and
          degree of extensive private-public sector collaboration that led to the widely
          regarded Cybersecurity Framework.
Other risk management-focused NIST cybersecurity accomplishments in FY18 included
an update of NIST’s recommendations for protecting the confidentiality of controlled,
unclassified information (CUI) in non-federal systems and organizations. Safeguarding
that CUI is of paramount importance and can directly affect the ability of federal
agencies to successfully conduct their assigned missions and business operations.
NIST SP 800-171 Revision 110 recommends security requirements to those agencies. The
FY18 update included editorial changes to select CUI security requirements, additional
references and definitions, and an expanded discussion about each CUI requirement.
