                              Federal S/MIME V3 Client Profile


       stronger Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [FIPS197] algorithm allowing up to 256-
       bit keys has recently been approved and implementations are expected to be widely
       available soon. In the interim, the triple DES algorithm, which uses multiple passes of
       the DES algorithm (significantly stronger than DES) is specified for use within S/MIME
       V3. Thus for S/MIME V3, the following symmetric encryption algorithms are identified:

              3DES: The Triple DES algorithm [FIPS46-3] for encryption and decryption
                    MUST be supported by sending and receiving agents as specified in
                    Clause 2.1.1.1 of this profile. When generating messages, at least two
                    independent keys MUST be supported. The Cipher Block Chaining Mode
                    (CBC) MUST be supported. This algorithm is also known as DES EDE3
                    CBC.

              AES: The Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode of the Advanced Encryption
                   Standard [FIPS197] with 128-bit keys SHOULD be supported by sending
                   and receiving agents when it becomes widely available. (See Clause
                   2.1.1.2.)

A.3 Digital Signature Algorithms
     Digital signature algorithms are asymmetric (using public-private key pairs) algorithms
     that are used for digitally signing data. Use of signature algorithms in S/MIME V3
     provides authentication, message integrity, and non-repudiation of origin. For S/MIME
     V3, the following digital signature algorithms are identified:

              RSA: The RSA Public Key digital signature algorithm identified in [RFC2313]
                   MUST be supported in combination with the SHA-1 hash algorithm as
                   specified in Clause 2.1.1.1 of this profile.

              DSA: The DSA algorithm defined in [FIPS186-2] MUST be supported in
                   combination with the SHA-1 hash algorithm as specified in Clause 2.1.1.1
                   of this profile.

              rDSA: Implementations MAY support digital signatures using reversible public
                    key cryptography (rDSA) as defined in [ANSIX9.31]

              ECDSA: Implementations MAY support elliptic curve digital signatures as
                   defined in [ANSIX9.62]

       Note: Currently no standard methods (e.g., appropriate algorithm identifying OIDs) are
             defined for using rDSA or ECDSA with S/MIME.

A.4 Key Management Algorithms
     Key management algorithms are used for either key transport or for key agreement in a
     secure manner.

       The following key management algorithms are identified:
