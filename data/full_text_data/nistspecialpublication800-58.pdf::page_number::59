 7.2   Network Address Translation

       Network Address Translation (NAT) is a powerful tool that can be used to hide
       internal network addresses and enable several endpoints within a LAN to share
       the same (external) IP address. For the purposes of this document, NAT actually
       refers to Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT). In NAT as it is literally
       defined, outgoing IP headers are changed from private LAN addresses to the
       router’s global IP. In NAPT, the TCP/UDP headers themselves are converted.
       This allows several computers to simultaneously share the router’s global IP
       address. Also, machines that do not need to access the Internet can still be
       assigned local addresses on the intranet without producing conflicts or needlessly
       taking up an IP address. With the shortages of IP addresses in many regions, this
       is an extremely useful functionality.

       NATs also indirectly contribute to security for a LAN, making internal IP
       addresses less accessible from the public Internet. Thus, all attacks against the
       network must be focused at the NAT router itself. Like firewalls, this provides
       security because only one point of access must be protected, and the router will
       generally be far more secure than a PC directly connected to the Internet (less
       likelihood of open ports, malicious programs, etc.). The abstraction of the LAN
       from the Internet through a NAT also simplifies network management. For
       instance, if one decided to change their ISP, only the external router configuration
       would need to be changed. The internal network and addressing scheme could be
       left untouched [24].

       Different types of NAT policies result in different complexity (the following
       terminology is adopted from the STUN RFC [32] describing a NAT traversal
       methodology, which originates from the MIDCOM working group of the IETF):

       Full Cone NAT
              A full cone NAT is one where all requests from the same internal IP
              address and port are mapped to the same external IP address and port.
              Furthermore, any external host can send a packet to the internal host, by
              sending a packet to the mapped external address.

       Restricted Cone NAT
              Restricted Cone: A restricted cone NAT is one where all requests from the
              same internal IP address and port are mapped to the same external IP
              address and port. Unlike a full cone NAT, an external host (with IP
              address X) can send a packet to the internal host only if the internal host
              had previously sent a packet to IP address X.
