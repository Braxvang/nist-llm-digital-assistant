       NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                               Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
       November 2023

2791   overlay
2792   A specification of security or privacy controls, control enhancements, supplemental guidance, and other supporting
2793   information employed during the tailoring process, that is intended to complement (and further refine) security
2794   control baselines. The overlay specification may be more stringent or less stringent than the original security control
2795   baseline specification and can be applied to multiple information systems. [13]

2796   personnel security
2797   The discipline of assessing the conduct, integrity, judgment, loyalty, reliability, and stability of individuals for duties
2798   and responsibilities requiring trustworthiness. [8]

2799   portable storage device
2800   A system component that can be inserted into and removed from a system and that is used to store information or
2801   data (e.g., text, video, audio, and/or image data). Such components are typically implemented on magnetic, optical,
2802   or solid-state devices (e.g., floppy disks, compact/digital video disks, flash/thumb drives, external hard disk drives,
2803   flash memory cards/drives that contain nonvolatile memory).

2804   potential impact
2805   The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have: (i) a limited adverse effect (FIPS
2806   Publication 199 low); (ii) a serious adverse effect (FIPS Publication 199 moderate); or (iii) a severe or catastrophic
2807   adverse effect (FIPS Publication 199 high) on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. [6]

2808   privileged account
2809   A system account with the authorizations of a privileged user.

2810   privileged user
2811   A user who is authorized (and therefore, trusted) to perform security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not
2812   authorized to perform.

2813   records
2814   The recordings (automated and/or manual) of evidence of activities performed or results achieved (e.g., forms,
2815   reports, test results) that serve as a basis for verifying that the organization and the system are performing as
2816   intended. Also used to refer to units of related data fields (i.e., groups of data fields that can be accessed by a
2817   program and that contain a complete set of information on particular items).

2818   remote access
2819   Access to an organizational system by a user (or a process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through an
2820   external network (e.g., the internet). Remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

2821   remote maintenance
2822   Maintenance activities conducted by individuals communicating through an external network (e.g., the internet).

2823   replay resistant
2824   Protection against the capture of transmitted authentication or access control information and its subsequent
2825   retransmission with the intent of producing an unauthorized effect or gaining unauthorized access.

2826   risk
2827   A measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and typically is a
2828   function of: (i) the adverse impact, or magnitude of harm, that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and
2829   (ii) the likelihood of occurrence. [13]

2830   risk assessment
2831   The process of identifying risks to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, reputation),
2832   organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, resulting from the operation of a system. [55]
