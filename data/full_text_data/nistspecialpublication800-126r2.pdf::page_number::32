           The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



        The source attribute SHALL be defined using either “http://cce.mitre.org” (preferred
        method) or “CCE”.
    b. Definitions that are directly or indirectly extended SHALL be limited to inventory and
       compliance classes.
2. For inventory class definitions:
    a. If an OVAL inventory class definition maps to one or more CPE identifiers, the definition
       SHOULD include <oval-def:reference> elements that reference those identifiers
       using the following format:

        <oval-def:reference source="http://cpe.mitre.org"
        ref_id="CPE_identifier"/>

        The source attribute SHALL be defined using either “http://cpe.mitre.org” (preferred
        method) or “CPE”.
    b. Definitions that are directly or indirectly extended SHALL be limited to the inventory class.
3. For patch class definitions:
    a. If an OVAL patch class definition is associated with a source specific identifier (for example,
       Knowledge Base numbers for Microsoft patches), these identifiers SHOULD be included in
       <oval-def:reference> elements contained by the definition. For example:

        <oval-def:reference source="www.microsoft.com/Patch"
        ref_id="KB912919"/>
    b. If an OVAL patch class definition maps to one or more CVE identifiers, the definition MAY
       include <oval-def:reference> elements that reference those identifiers using the
       following format:

        <oval-def:reference source="http://cve.mitre.org"
        ref_id="CVE_identifier"/>

        This recommendation is weaker than its counterparts for the other class definition types
        because a CVE identifier is not an identifier for a patch; it is more of an association. For
        example, one patch could fix multiple vulnerabilities, so it would map to multiple CVE
        identifiers.

        The source attribute SHALL be defined using either “http://cve.mitre.org” (preferred
        method) or “CVE”.
    c. Definitions that are directly or indirectly extended SHALL be limited to inventory and patch
       classes.
4. For vulnerability class definitions:
    a. If an OVAL vulnerability class definition maps to one or more CVE identifiers, the definition
       SHOULD include <oval-def:reference> elements that reference those identifiers
       using the following format:

        <oval-def:reference source="http://cve.mitre.org"
        ref_id="CVE_identifier"/>
