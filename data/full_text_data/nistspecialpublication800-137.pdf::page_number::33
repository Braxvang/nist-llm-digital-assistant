Special Publication 800-137                                  Information Security Continuous Monitoring for
                                                             Federal Information Systems and Organizations




     Configuration Settings, and CM-8, Information System Component Inventory, may require
     more frequent assessment and monitoring, preferably using automated, SCAP-validated tools
     that provide alerts and status on demand. Conversely, controls such as PS-2, Position
     Categorization, or PS-3, Personnel Screening, (from the NIST SP 800-53 Personnel Security
     family of controls) are not volatile in most organizational settings. They tend to remain static
     over long periods and would therefore typically require less frequent assessment.

•    System categorizations/impact levels. In general, security controls implemented on systems
     that are categorized as high-impact are monitored more frequently than controls implemented
     on moderate-impact systems, which are in turn monitored more frequently than controls
     implemented on low-impact systems. 34

•    Security controls or specific assessment objects providing critical functions. Security
     controls or assessment objects that provide critical security functions (e.g., log management
     server, firewalls) are candidates for more frequent monitoring. Additionally, individual
     assessment objects that support critical security functions and/or are deemed critical to the
     system (in accordance with the Business Impact Analysis35) or to the organization may be
     candidates for more frequent monitoring.
•    Security controls with identified weaknesses. Existing risks documented in security
     assessment reports (SARs) are considered for more frequent monitoring to ensure that risks
     stay within tolerance. Similarly, controls documented in the POA&M as having weaknesses
     are monitored more frequently until remediation of the weakness is complete. Note that not
     all weaknesses require the same level of monitoring. For example, weaknesses deemed in the
     SAR to be of minor or low-impact risk to the system or organization are monitored less
     frequently than a weakness with a higher-impact risk to the system or organization.
•    Organizational risk tolerance. 36 Organizations with a low tolerance for risk (e.g.,
     organizations that process, store, or transmit large amounts of proprietary and/or personally
     identifiable information (PII), organizations with numerous high-impact systems,
     organizations facing specific persistent threats) monitor more frequently than organizations
     with a higher tolerance for risk (e.g., organizations with primarily low- and moderate-impact
     systems that process, store, or transmit very little PII and/or proprietary information).

•    Threat information. Organizations consider current credible threat information, including
     known exploits and attack patterns, 37 when establishing monitoring frequencies. For instance,
     if a specific attack is developed which exploits a vulnerability of an implemented technology,
     temporary or permanent increases to the monitoring frequencies for related controls or
     metrics may help provide protection from the threat.

•    Vulnerability information. 38 Organizations consider current vulnerability information with
     respect to information technology products when establishing monitoring frequencies. For
