                                                            CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



that perform computations, mitigation can occur by limiting the kinds of data that are processed in the
cloud or by contracting with providers for specialized isolation mechanisms such as the rental of entire
computer systems rather than VMs (mono-tenancy), Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), segmented
networks, or advanced access controls.

8.5.5   Browsers

Many cloud applications use the consumer's browser as a graphical interface. For example, a number of
technologies (e.g., [Gar05, Ado11, Goo11-2, Mic11, Dja11]) allow consumer browsers to provide a cloud
experience where the software "feels local" even though it runs in a cloud infrastructure. Although
providers sometimes distribute client-side tools for cloud administration, browsers are also used for
consumer account setup and resource administration, including the provisioning of financial information
necessary to open and use an account with a provider. Unfortunately, browsers are complex, rivaling the
complexity of early operating systems, and browsers have been shown to harbor security flaws and be
vulnerable in nearly every public security challenge (e.g., [Por10, Mar09]). Providers interoperate with a
diversity of consumer browsers and versions, and consumer-administered end systems and browsers may
not be properly managed for security or may not be current. If a consumer's browser is subverted, all of
the consumer's resources entrusted to a cloud provider are at risk.

Whenever browsers are the access points to a cloud, building confidence that browsers have not been
subverted is important. Various approaches can be taken to build confidence, including accessing clouds
from behind application gateway or network packet filtering firewalls, restricting the browser types that
are approved for accessing a cloud, limiting browser plug-ins for browsers providing cloud access,
ensuring that browsers are up-to-date, and locking down systems that access clouds via browsers. While
practical and helpful, most of these techniques, however, raise costs, lower functionality, or reduce
convenience.

8.5.6   Hardware Support for Trust

In some scenarios, hardware support can enable consumers to understand the trustworthiness of remote
systems. As an example, a Trusted Platform Module (TPM)'s purpose is to store a set of checksums that
are generated at system startup, and then attest when asked, that the system did in fact boot from known
components. When virtual machines migrate, this would appear to weaken the trust chain in the TPM.
Different groups have attempted to virtualize the TPM, or to construct an argument in which a re-
awakened VM can reestablish trust on different hardware, but this issue remains open.

8.5.7   Key Management

Proper protection of consumer cryptographic keys appears to require some cooperation from cloud
providers. The issue is that unlike dedicated hardware, zeroing a memory buffer may not delete a key if:
(1) the memory is backed by a hypervisor that makes it persistent, (2) the VM is having a snapshot taken
for recovery purposes, or (3) the VM is being serialized for migration to different hardware. It is an open
issue on how to use cryptography safely from inside a cloud.
