markets (stock exchanges, corporations, etc.) to protect investors from fraud, monopolies, and
illegal behavior. This also includes deposit protection, creation, regulation, and control of the
nationâ€™s currency and coinage supply and demand.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: While the consequences of
unauthorized disclosure of some financial sector oversight information would have only a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals, there are significant
exceptions. Unauthorized disclosure of much financial sector oversight information can result in
major financial consequences. This can result in assignment of a high impact level to such
information.

In some cases, premature disclosure of regulatory information can impact major financial
markets and damage national banking and finance infrastructures. For example, unauthorized
disclosure of a decision to increase the money supply or of an ongoing securities fraud
investigation can have a dramatic effect on financial markets. This can result in assignment of a
high impact level to such information.

Unauthorized disclosure to a single institution (e.g., a major banking institution or brokerage
house), could damage faith in regulatory institutions and result in even more market disruption
and have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on public confidence in the agency. This can
result in assignment of a high impact level to such information.

Even where the consequences are limited to giving an unfair market advantage to a single
financial or commercial institution, unauthorized disclosure can have a serious adverse effect on
public confidence in the agency and its staff. This can result in assignment of a high impact
level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for financial sector oversight information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. T he
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of financial sector oversight
information depends on whether the information is time-critical. Unauthorized modification or
destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail)
may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the
mission would usually be limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Where unauthorized modification or
destruction of financial sector oversight information facilitates or enables catastrophic
consequences, the integrity impact level may be high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most financial sector oversight information is low.
