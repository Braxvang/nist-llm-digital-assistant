                                                                   GUIDELINES ON FIREWALLS AND FIREWALL POLICY


A different type of firewall policy based on network activity is one that throttles or redirects traffic if the
rate of traffic matching the policy rule is too high. For example, a firewall might redirect the connections
made to a particular inside address to a slower route if the rate of connections is above a certain threshold.
Another policy might be to drop incoming ICMP packets if the rate is too high. Crafting such policies is
quite difficult because throttling and redirecting can cause desired traffic to be lost or have difficult-to-
diagnose transient failures.

4.5   Summary of Recommendations

The following items summarize the major recommendations from this section:

 An organizationâ€™s firewall policy should be based on a comprehensive risk analysis.
 Firewall policies should be based on blocking all inbound and outbound traffic, with exceptions made
  for desired traffic.
 Policies should take into account the source and destination of the traffic in addition to the content.
 Many types of IPv4 traffic, such as that with invalid or private addresses, should be blocked by
  default.
 Organizations should have policies for handling incoming and outgoing IPv6 traffic.
 An organization should determine which applications may send traffic into or out of its network and
  make firewall policies to block traffic for other applications.
