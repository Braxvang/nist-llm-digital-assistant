transparent the risk perceptions that organizations routinely use in making both investment and
operational decisions. The risk management strategy establishes a foundation for managing risk
and delineates the boundaries for risk-based decisions within organizations. 14

The second component of risk management addresses how organizations assess risk within the
context of the organizational risk frame. The purpose of the risk assessment component is to
identify: (i) threats to organizations (i.e., operations, assets, or individuals) or threats directed
through organizations against other organizations or the Nation; (ii) vulnerabilities internal and
external to organizations; 15 (iii) the harm (i.e., adverse impact) that may occur given the potential
for threats exploiting vulnerabilities; and (iv) the likelihood that harm will occur. The end result is
a determination of risk (i.e., typically a function of the degree of harm and likelihood of harm
occurring).

The third component of risk management addresses how organizations respond to risk once that
risk is determined based on the results of a risk assessment. The purpose of the risk response
component is to provide a consistent, organization-wide response to risk in accordance with the
organizational risk frame by: (i) developing alternative courses of action for responding to risk;
(ii) evaluating the alternative courses of action; (iii) determining appropriate courses of action
consistent with organizational risk tolerance; and (iv) implementing risk responses based on
selected courses of action.

The fourth component of risk management addresses how organizations monitor risk over time.
The purpose of the risk monitoring component is to: (i) determine the ongoing effectiveness of
risk responses (consistent with the organizational risk frame); (ii) identify risk-impacting changes
to organizational information systems and the environments in which the systems operate; 16 and
(iii) verify that planned risk responses are implemented and information security requirements
derived from and traceable to organizational missions/business functions, federal legislation,
directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines are satisfied.

2.2 RISK ASSESSMENT
This publication focuses on the risk assessment component of risk management—providing a
step-by-step process for organizations on: (i) how to prepare for risk assessments; (ii) how to
conduct risk assessments; (iii) how to communicate risk assessment results to key organizational
personnel; and (iv) how to maintain the risk assessments over time. Risk assessments are not
simply one-time activities that provide permanent and definitive information for decision makers
to guide and inform responses to information security risks. Rather, organizations employ risk
assessments on an ongoing basis throughout the system development life cycle and across all of
the tiers in the risk management hierarchy—with the frequency of the risk assessments and the
resources applied during the assessments, commensurate with the expressly defined purpose and
scope of the assessments.

14
  In the absence of an explicit or formal organizational risk management strategy, organizational resources (e.g., tools,
data repositories) and references (e.g., exemplary risk assessment reports) can be used to discern those aspects of the
organization’s approach to risk management that affect risk assessment.
15
  Organizational vulnerabilities are not confined to information systems but can include, for example, vulnerabilities in
governance structures, mission/business processes, enterprise architecture, information security architecture, facilities,
equipment, system development life cycle processes, supply chain activities, and external service providers.
16
  Environments of operation include, but are not limited to: the threat space; vulnerabilities; missions/business
functions; mission/business processes; enterprise and information security architectures; information technologies;
personnel; facilities; supply chain relationships; organizational governance/culture; procurement/acquisition processes;
organizational policies/procedures; organizational assumptions, constraints, risk tolerance, and priorities/trade-offs).
