       Network Security Automation Tools
Network security automation tools automate the life cycle processes involved in deployment,
observability/monitoring, threat intelligence gathering/reporting (e.g., generating alerts of
security violations for security personnel to take timely action), and – in some instances –
automatic remediation. These automated tools are an indispensable part of the current enterprise
network landscape, especially those that consist of highly distributed on-premises and cloud-
based IT resources.
The security capabilities of network tools fall under the category of policy enforcement point
(PEP) security capabilities that are extensively discussed in CISA’s TIC 3.0 Cloud Use Case
[51]. Guidance for the deployment of these capabilities is also covered in that document. The
intent of the material in this section is to highlight some higher-level metrics that this category of
tools should satisfy in order to perform their intended functions effectively; it is not meant to be
used as deployment guidance. Each higher- level metric is tagged with the abbreviation NSAT-
HLM-x, where NSAT stands for network security automation tool, HLM stands for high-level
metric, and x stands for the numerical sequence.
   •   NSAT-HLM-1: The tools should scale to meet the volume, velocity, and variety of
       today’s application development, deployment, and maintenance paradigms [13]. This
       requirement is critical in environments where DevSecOps is used to deploy not only
       applications but also infrastructures, the latter using infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools.
       These tools are an integral part of the smart automated workflows called CI/CD pipelines,
       which invoke them to deploy servers (computing), networking, and storage infrastructure.
       Hence, this class of network automation tools should have the capability to be seamlessly
       integrated into the corresponding CI/CD pipelines.
   •   NSAT-HLM-2: The tools should have the capability to minimize human intervention for
       security remediation, which is slow and prone to error. In other words, the more
       automated remediation features built into the tool, the better.
   •   NSAT-HLM-3 (enhanced threat intelligence and protection): The tools should have
       advanced threat intelligence, real-time threat prevention capabilities for known and zero-
       day vulnerabilities, and sandboxing features for isolating malicious traffic.
   •   NSAT-HLM-4 (leveraging knowledge of previous events): The tools should have
       features for matching current events to past ones and for leveraging the remediation
       measures performed for those instances in the current solution. This brings about
       reduction to the average outage time [14].
The network monitoring and observability tools and network provisioning tools are important
classes of network security automation tools. The requirements and feature set for these two
classes alone are discussed in the following subsections.
