3.        Client Application Programming Interface

Table 1 lists the entry points on the PIV client API. This section references object identifiers (OIDs),
which are defined and can be found in Part 1 (Table 3).

If both the PIV Middleware and the PIV Card support secure messaging, then all non-card-management
functionality 2 of the PIV Card may be accessed over either the contact or contactless interface of the card.
In order to perform non-card-management functionality that would otherwise be limited to the contact
interface, the client application must first establish a virtual contact interface by calling the
pivEstablishSecureMessaging function and then using the pivLogIntoCardApplication function to submit
the pairing code to the card. 3 If the client application does not have another means of determining whether
communication with the PIV Card is over a contact or contactless interface, it may determine this by
using the pivGetData function to attempt to read a mandatory data object, such as the X.509 Certificate
for PIV Authentication or the Security Object, that has an access rule for read of “Always,” but that is
only accessible over the contact and virtual contact interfaces (see Part 1, Table 2). If the return code from

2
 Only the pivPutData and pivGenerateKeyPair API functions perform card-management functionality.
3
 As noted in Part 1, Section 5.5, the pairing code does not need to be submitted if the Bit 3 of the first byte of the PIN Usage
Policy is set to one.
