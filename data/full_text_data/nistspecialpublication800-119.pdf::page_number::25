Note that the address contains eight distinct four-place hex values, separated by colons. Each of these
values represents 16 bits, for a total of 128 bits in the entire address.

IPv6 addresses are divided among the network prefix, the subnet identifier and the host identifier portions
of the address. The network prefix is the high-order bits of an IP address, used to identify a specific
network and, in some cases, a specific type of address (see Table 3-2). The subnet identifier (ID)
identifies a link within a site. The subnet ID is assigned by the local administrator of the site; a single site
can have multiple subnet IDs. This is used as a designator for the network upon which the host bearing
the address is resident. The host identifier (host ID) of the address is a unique identifier for the node
within the network upon which it resides. It is identified with a specific interface of the host. Figure 3-1
depicts the IPv6 address format with the network prefix, subnet identifier and host identifier.

RFC 4291 also describes the notation for prefixes. The network prefix is analogous, but not equivalent,
to the subnet mask in IPv4. IPv4 addresses are written in Classless Inter-domain Routing (CIDR)
notation, with a subnet mask that contains ―1‖s in the bit positions that identify the network ID (see
Section 3.1.6). There is no subnet mask in IPv6, although the slash notation used to identify the network
address bits is similar to IPv4’s subnet mask notation. The IPv6 notation appends the prefix length and is
written as a number of bits with a slash, which leads to the following format:

                                          IPv6 address/prefix length

The prefix length specifies how many of the address’s left-most bits comprise the network prefix. An
example address with a 32-bit network prefix is:

                               2001:0db8:9095:02e5:0216:cbff:feb2:7474/32

Quantities of IPv6 addresses are assigned by the international registry services and Internet service
providers (ISP) (see Section 3.2.2) based in part upon the size of the entity receiving the addresses.
Large, top-tier networks may receive address allocations with a network prefix of 32 bits as long as the
need is justified. In this case, the first two groupings of hex values, separated by colons, comprise the
network prefix for the assignee of the addresses. The remaining 96 bits are available to the local
