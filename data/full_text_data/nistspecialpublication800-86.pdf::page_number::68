GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



the data consistently. Although this is beneficial for analysis (as described in Section 6.4), the
normalization process occasionally introduces errors in the data or causes some data to be lost.
Fortunately, SEM products typically do not alter the original data sources, so analysts should retain copies
of the original logs and use them to verify the accuracy of the data if needed.

6.2.6     Network Forensic Analysis Tools

Network forensic analysis tools (NFAT)102 typically provide the same functionality as packet sniffers,
protocol analyzers, and SEM software in a single product. Whereas SEM software concentrates on
correlating events among existing data sources (which typically include multiple network traffic–related
sources), NFAT software focuses primarily on collecting, examining, and analyzing network traffic.
NFAT software also offers additional features that further facilitate network forensics, such as the
following:

      ! Reconstructing events by replaying network traffic within the tool, ranging from an individual
        session (e.g., instant messaging [IM] between two users) to all sessions during a particular time
        period. The speed of the replaying can typically be adjusted as needed.
      ! Visualizing the traffic flows and the relationships among hosts. Some tools can even tie IP
        addresses, domain names, or other data to physical locations and produce a geographic map of the
        activity.
      ! Building profiles of typical activity and identifying significant deviations.
      ! Searching application content for keywords (e.g., “confidential”, “proprietary”).
6.2.7     Other Sources

Most organizations have other sources of network traffic information that can be of use for forensics in
some capacity, including the following:

      ! Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Servers. The DHCP service assigns IP addresses to
        hosts on a network as needed. Some hosts might have static IP addresses, which means that they
        always receive the same IP address assignment; however, most hosts typically receive dynamic
        assignments. This means that the hosts are required to renew their IP address assignments
        regularly and that there is no guarantee that they will be assigned the same addresses. DHCP
        servers may contain assignment logs that include the MAC address, the IP address assigned to
        that MAC address, and the time the assignment occurred.
      ! Network Monitoring Software. Network monitoring software is designed to observe network
        traffic and gather statistics about it.103 For example, it may record high-level information about
        traffic flows for a particular network segment, such as the amount of bandwidth typically
        consumed by various protocols. Network monitoring software may also collect more detailed
        information about network activity, such as the payload size and the source and destination IP
        addresses and ports for each packet. Some managed switches and other network devices offer
        basic network monitoring capabilities, such as collecting statistics concerning bandwidth usage.

      Open source network monitoring software includes EtherApe (http://etherape.sourceforge.net/) and IPaudit
      (http://ipaudit.sourceforge.net/). Packet sniffers, protocol analyzers, and IDS software may also perform basic network
      monitoring functions. See the Web sites listed in Appendix F for additional product names.
