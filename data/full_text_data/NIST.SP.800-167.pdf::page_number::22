Appendix B—Applying Application Whitelisting to Mobile Platforms

This appendix discusses considerations involved in applying application whitelisting to mobile platforms
(e.g., smartphones, tablets). Typical standalone application whitelisting technologies are generally not
available for mobile devices as of this writing. Instead, application whitelisting is achieved through one of
two methods: mobile device management (MDM)/mobile application management (MAM) or an
enterprise app store.

MDM/MAM

MDM20 and MAM technologies are suites of security controls for protecting mobile devices from
compromises. MDM and MAM technologies often have application whitelisting capabilities built in.
Because MDM and MAM technologies are typically centrally managed, they offer a relatively easy way
to deploy whitelisting capabilities to mobile devices. However, the disadvantage of relying on application
whitelisting in this environment is that mobile applications are constantly changing and new applications
are released all the time; it may be prohibitively difficult to maintain application whitelisting solutions
with that much flux to be addressed.

Enterprise App Store

An alternative to a client-based application whitelisting technology is an enterprise app store21. Many
organizations, especially those with MDM deployed to their mobile devices, control the app stores from
which their users may download and install apps. This effectively provides a form of application
whitelisting, because only those applications that have been approved by the organization for inclusion in
the app store may be accessed by the organization’s users. There is some maintenance overhead
associated with relying on an app store for whitelisting, but it is centralized (approving an app once and
posting it to the app store) instead of distributed (configuring thousands of managed mobile devices to
recognize the latest apps and app updates).
