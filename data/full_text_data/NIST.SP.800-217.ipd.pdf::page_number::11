      NIST SP 800-217 ipd                          Guidelines for PIV Federation (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


231   1.   Introduction
232   This section is informative.
233   PIV Cards and derived PIV credentials allow for a very high level of trust in a PIV
234   identity account thanks to the requirements and processes used in the issuance of
235   the PIV identity account, the features of the associated PIV Card, and the binding of
236   derived PIV credentials to the PIV identity account. This document seeks to make the
237   benefits of the PIV identity account available to federated relying parties (RPs) through
238   the use of identity providers (IdPs) that verify PIV credentials and provide federated
239   assertions representing the PIV identity account. Federation technologies can facilitate
240   the connection of these PIV identity accounts across different security domains, allowing
241   a subscriber to leverage the trust and strength of their PIV identity account at agencies
242   other than the agency that issued the credentials.

243   1.1. Background
244   This document is a companion document to [FIPS201], providing specific details for
245   implementing PIV federation for PIV identity accounts. [FIPS201] defines standards for
246   the use of PIV credentials, including the establishment of the PIV identity account, the
247   issuance of the PIV Card, authentication using the PIV Card, management of derived
248   PIV credentials, and other aspects of the PIV identity account. FIPS 201 provides basic
249   requirements for the use of federation and defers to the guidelines provided in this
250   publication to define details of what a PIV-based federation system would entail.
251   [SP800-63C] and its companion document suite of [SP800-63] provide general guidelines
252   for the use of federation technologies and assertions within Federal Government use
253   cases. These guidelines are intended to be used across a wide variety of account types,
254   authenticators, and deployment patterns. The SP 800-63 suite is not specific to PIV
255   identity accounts.
256   This document, SP 800-217, specifically applies the guidelines of [SP800-63C] to the
257   PIV identity account defined in [FIPS201] to outline the details of PIV federation. This
258   document provides a set of processes and technical guidelines for deployers of PIV
259   federation with Federal Government use cases in both IdP and RP roles.
260   Note that this document is not intended to be sufficient for a full technical interoperability
261   profile. In addition to this document and its prerequisites ([FIPS201] and [SP800-63C]), a
262   PIV federation deployment will need a technical profile that is suitable for the federation
263   protocol being used. For example, while this document requires that the federated
264   identifier be included in the assertion, a technical profile would specify the field name
265   within the assertion to house both the subject identifier and issuer identifier, as well as any
266   data formatting needed for the value.
