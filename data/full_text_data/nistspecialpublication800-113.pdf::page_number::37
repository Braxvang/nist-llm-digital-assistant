authentication, so it is not possible to audit which sessions are FIPS-compliant. Worse yet, few (if any)
SSL VPN browsers can be configured to reject server certificates based on the size of the key used and
therefore most can be used in FIPS-noncompliant modes without any way to prevent such use.

To guarantee FIPS compliance, SSL VPNs that cannot enforce requiring particular key sizes need to be
configured with both of the following settings:

 The server certificate used for authenticating the SSL VPN device to clients must have an
  appropriate-length key.
 One of the following steps must be performed:

      –    The SSL VPN gateway must be configured to only validate client certificates that have a
           certificate policy that enforces the key size requirement.

      –    The SSL VPN gateway must be configured to only validate client certificates from a pre-
           approved list. (In this way, key size validation can be handled at the time the client certificate is
           registered.)

      –    The use of client certificates for authentication to the SSL VPN gateway must be disabled. In
           place of client certificates, a smartcard or token should be used. If that is not possible, a
           username and password may be used, but this solution is a last resort and its use is discouraged.
It is important to note that the minimum FIPS-compliant key length for DSA and RSA certificates will
change at the end of 2010 from 1024 bits to 2048 bits; see Implementation Guidance for FIPS PUB 140-2
and the Cryptographic Module Validation Program for more information.

4.3       Design the Solution

Once the requirements have been identified, and it has been determined that an SSL VPN is the best
solution, the next phase is to design a solution that meets the specified requirements. This phase is
broken into five major components that are described in more detail in the following subsections.

 Access Control. Design the access control policy. SSL VPN users may gain access to particular
  resources based on characteristics such as user identification, computer type and location, and the
  method of authentication.
 Endpoint Security. Design the endpoint security controls. SSL VPNs provide endpoint security
  controls that include host integrity checking and security protection mechanisms. Host integrity
  checks ensure that the client system is in compliance with an organization’s minimum security policy.
  Typical host integrity checks may look for operating system type and version, antivirus and personal
  firewall status and configurations, or a specific file, registry key, or process that is running.
 Authentication. Select the authentication methods. There are many ways to authenticate SSL VPN
  users, including LDAP, RADIUS, Active Directory, and digital certificates.
 Architecture. Designing the architecture of the SSL VPN implementation includes hardware
  selection, device placement, firewall and routing considerations, client software selection, high
  availability configuration, and portal design.
 Cryptography Policy and FIPS Compliance. The organization must choose a cryptography policy
  that fits its needs and is compliant with its requirements. In addition, Federal agencies must use only
