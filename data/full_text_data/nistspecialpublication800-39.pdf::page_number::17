As indicated in the four components of risk management described above, organizations also
consider external risk relationships, as appropriate. Organizations identify external entities with
which there is an actual or potential risk relationship (i.e., organizations which could impose risks
on, transfer risks to, or communicate risks to other organizations, as well as those to which
organizations could impose, transfer, or communicate risks). External risk relationships include,
for example, suppliers, customers or served populations, mission/business partners, and/or service
providers. For organizations dealing with advanced persistent threats (i.e., a long-term pattern of
targeted, sophisticated attacks) the risk posed by external partners (especially suppliers in the
supply chain) may become more pronounced. Organizations establish practices for sharing risk-
related information (e.g., threat and vulnerability information) with external entities, including
those with which the organizations have a risk relationship as well as those which could supply or
receive risk-related information (e.g., Information Sharing and Analysis Centers [ISAC],
Computer Emergency Response Teams [CERT]).

Figure 1 illustrates the risk management process and the information and communications flows
among components. The black arrows represent the primary flows within the risk management
process with risk framing informing all the sequential step-by-step set of activities moving from
risk assessment to risk response to risk monitoring. For example, one of the primary outputs from
the risk framing component is a description of the sources and methods that organizations use in
acquiring threat information (e.g., open source, classified intelligence community reports). The
output regarding threat information is a primary input to the risk assessment component and is
communicated accordingly to that component. Another example is illustrated in the primary
output from the risk assessment component—that is, a determination of risk. The output from the
risk assessment component is communicated to the risk response component and is received as a
primary input for that component. Another primary input to the risk response component is an
output from the risk framing component—the risk management strategy that defines how the
organization should respond to risk. Together, these inputs, along with any additional inputs, are
used by decision makers when selecting among potential courses of action for risk responses.
