SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



    •   When a new RR is added (e.g., a new mail server is added and hence a new MX RR is added the
        zone file)

    •   When an existing RR’s RDATA has changed (e.g., the IP address of a server has changed and
        hence the corresponding A RR has to be replaced)

    •   When the signature has expired for an RRSIG RR.
Because of the volume of data handled and the frequency of usage, the size of the ZSK-private key
becomes a factor in overall CPU cycles consumed by the digital signature generation operations. Hence,
the ZSK used is often relatively small.


Checklist item 30: The (often longer) KSK needs to be rolled over less frequently than the ZSK. The
recommended rollover frequency for the KSK is once every 1 to 2 years, whereas the ZSK should be
rolled over every 1 to 3 months for operational consistency but may be used longer if necessary for
stability or if the key is of the appropriate length. Both keys should have an Approved length according
to NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 [800-57P1], [800-57P3].


The impact of a key rollover on the rest of DNS depends on whether the secure zone is locally secure or
globally secure (part of a chain of trust).

For a more detailed discussion of the operational steps involved in a key rollover, see the IETF document
on DNSSEC operations [RFC4641]. Note that the two processes described for key rollovers (pre-
published and dual-signature) can be used in rolling over the ZSK or the KSK. The recommendations
below are based on common practice and minimizing the impact of larger responses on clients.

11.2.1 Key Rollover in a Locally Secure Zone

A zone that is only locally secure will have a ZSK, and possibly a KSK that is configured in client
resolvers, as a trusted key. Certain challenges arise when either key is rolled over, although having a KSK
even for a locally signed zone makes rolling over the ZSK easier. When a zone changes its ZSK(s) and
has a KSK that remains unchanged, the only problem that must be addressed is introducing the new key
when the old key may be in some distant resolver’s or name server’s cache.

The solution is to pre-publish the new public key before the rollover. The DNS administrator needs to
publish the new key as a DNSKEY RR in the zone file before it is used to generate signatures. The
process is as follows:

    •   Generate a new key pair.

    •   Add the public key of the new key pair to the zone file (DNSKEY record).

    •   Sign the zone using the private key of the currently active key pair and the KSK (if present).

    •   Wait for a period equal to the TTL of the DNSKEY RRSet or the MinTTL of the zone SOA
        record (whichever is greater).
    •   Delete the RRSIG RRs generated by the outgoing key, but retain the DNSKEY RR. Resign the zone
        using the new ZSK (and current KSK, if used).
