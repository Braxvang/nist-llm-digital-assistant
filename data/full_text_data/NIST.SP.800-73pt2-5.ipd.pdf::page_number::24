584   3.2.2. CHANGE REFERENCE DATA Card Command
585   The CHANGE REFERENCE DATA card command initiates the comparison of the
586   authentication data in the command data field with the current value of the reference data and
587   replaces the reference data with new reference data if the comparison is successful. This
588   command CAN be used by the PIV Card Application Administrator and the Cardholder.
589   Only reference data associated with key references '80', '81' specific to the PIV Card Application
590   (i.e., local key reference), and the Global PIN with key reference '00' MAY be changed by the
591   PIV Card Application CHANGE REFERENCE DATA command. The PIV Card Application
592   MAY allow the reference data associated with other key references (e.g., ‘96’ and ‘97’) to be
593   changed by the PIV Card Application CHANGE REFERENCE DATA if they are used for card
594   management operations and the requirements specified in Section 2.9.2 of FIPS 201-3 are
595   satisfied. If any key reference value is specified that is not supported by the card, the PIV Card
596   Application SHALL return the status word '6A 88'. Key reference '80' reference data SHALL be
597   changed by the PIV Card Application CHANGE REFERENCE DATA command. The ability to
598   change reference data associated with key references '81' and '00' using the PIV Card Application
599   CHANGE REFERENCE DATA command is optional.
600   If key reference '81' is specified and the command is not submitted over the contact interface,
601   then the card command SHALL fail. If key reference '00' or '80' is specified and the command is
602   not submitted over either the contact interface or the VCI, then the card command SHALL fail.
603   In each case, the security status and the retry counter of the key reference SHALL remain
604   unchanged.
605   If the current value of the retry counter associated with the key reference is zero, then the
606   reference data associated with the key reference SHALL NOT be changed, and the PIV Card
607   Application SHALL return the status word '69 83'. If the command is submitted over the
608   contactless interface (VCI) and the current value of the retry counter associated with the key
609   reference is at or below the issuer-specified intermediate retry value (see Section 3.2.1), then the
610   reference data associated with the key reference SHALL NOT be changed, and the PIV Card
611   Application SHALL return the status word '69 83'.
612   If the authentication data in the command data field does not match the current value of the
613   reference data or if either the authentication data or the new reference data in the command data
614   field of the command does not satisfy the criteria in Section 2.4.3, the PIV Card Application
615   SHALL NOT change the reference data associated with the key reference and SHALL return
616   either status word '6A 80' or '63 CX', with the following restrictions. If the authentication data in
617   the command data field satisfies the criteria in Section 2.4.3 and matches the current value of the
618   reference data, but the new reference data in the command data field of the command does not
619   satisfy the criteria in Section 2.4.3, the PIV Card Application SHALL return status word '6A 80'.
