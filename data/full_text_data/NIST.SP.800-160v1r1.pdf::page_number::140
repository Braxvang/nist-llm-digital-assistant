NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                 Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

       AR-1.9 Identify and plan for enabling systems or services needed to support the security
              aspects of system architecture definition.
       AR-1.10 Obtain or acquire access to the security aspects of enabling systems or services to be
               used in system architecture definition.

AR-2   CREATE THE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE CANDIDATE(S)
       AR-2.1 Establish the security aspects of architecture objectives and critical success criteria.
       AR-2.2 Synthesize potential trustworthy secure solution(s) in the solution space.
       AR-2.3 Characterize aspects of trustworthy secure solutions and the trade space.
       AR-2.4 Formulate trustworthy secure candidate architecture(s).
       AR-2.5 Capture trustworthy secure architecture concepts and properties.
       AR-2.6 Relate the candidate architecture(s) to other architectures and relevant affected entities
              to help ensure the consistency of trustworthy secure architecture concepts and
              properties.
       AR-2.7 Coordinate the secure use of the candidate architecture(s) by intended users.
       AR-2.8 Develop the security aspects of the models and views of the candidate architecture(s).
       Note: The following are some typical considerations:
       - The definition of the system security context and security boundaries in terms of interfaces
          and interactions with external entities
       - The identification of architectural entities and relationships between entities that address
          key stakeholder protection concerns and system security requirements
       - The allocation of security concepts, security properties, security characteristics, secure
          behaviors, security functions, or security constraints to architectural entities
       - The composition of views expressing how the architecture addresses stakeholder protection
          concerns and meets stakeholder and system security requirements
       - The harmonization of the architecture models and views
       AR-2.9 Coordinate secure use of the architecture by intended users.

AR-3   EVALUATE THE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE CANDIDATE(S)
       AR-3.1 Analyze trustworthy secure architecture concepts and properties, and assess the value
              of the architecture in meeting stakeholder security protection concerns.
       AR-3.2 Characterize the candidate architecture(s) based on trustworthy secure analysis results.
       AR-3.3 Formulate security-relevant evaluation findings and recommendations.
       AR-3.4 Capture and communicate security-relevant evaluation results.
       AR-3.5 Relate the architecture to the other architectures and relevant affected entities to help
              ensure consistency in the trustworthy secure system architecture.
