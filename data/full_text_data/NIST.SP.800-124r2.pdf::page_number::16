NIST SP 800-124r2                                                    Guidelines for Managing the Security

       device or can interpret non-human readable data formats (e.g., Quick Response [QR]
       codes).
   •   Sensors: Sensors within a mobile device capture data to perform an operation, such as
       authentication or measurement. Examples include a gyroscope, accelerometer,
       magnetometer, biometric reader, pedometer, infrared, barometer, photometer, and
       thermometer.
   •   Speaker and/or microphone: A mobile device usually has a speaker that provides an
       audio output ability and/or a microphone that provides audio input ability.
   •   Removable media: Removable media allows for additional data and memory storage on a
       mobile device, normally provided through a secure digital (SD) card. Removable media
       also serves as a way to transport data from one mobile device to another device.
   •   Data synchronization/backup services: Mobile devices have built-in features for
       synchronizing local data with a different storage location (e.g., desktop or laptop
       computer, organization servers, telecommunications provider servers, other third-party
       servers, etc.).
   •   Hardware-backed security module: A mobile device uses a hardware module or some
       portion of a hardware chip to perform cryptographic functions and store sensitive
       cryptographic keys and secrets.

       Mobile Device Components
Multiple organizations work in concert to provide the hardware, firmware, software, and other
technology that make up a mobile device. For smartphones and tablets with cellular capabilities,
a separation exists between the hardware and firmware used to access cellular networks and the
hardware and firmware used to operate the general-purpose mobile OS. Users and administrators
generally interact with the general-purpose mobile OS that utilizes the application processor.
The hardware and firmware used to access the cellular network, often referred to as the telephony
subsystem, typically runs a completely separate real-time operating system (RTOS). This
telephony subsystem utilizes a completely separate system on a chip (SoC) called the baseband
processor. This often means that a cellular-enabled smartphone is concurrently running multiple
OSs.
Other features of the telephony subsystem include the universal integrated circuit card (UICC),
international mobile equipment identifier (IMEI), and the international mobile subscriber identity
(IMSI), also known as a subscription permanent identifier (SUPI). The UICC, also known as the
subscriber identity module (SIM) card, stores cryptographic information and personal data and is
used to enable access to the cellular network. The IMEI is an identifier specific to a mobile
device and is used to uniquely identify a device to the cellular network. The IMSI is used to
uniquely identify a subscriber or user on the network. More information on these features can be
found in NIST SP 800-187, Guide to LTE Security [3].
A set of lower-level systems exists in the form of firmware to initialize the device and load the
mobile OS into memory, which includes the bootloader. This initialization firmware may also
verify other device initialization code, including device drivers. All of this activity occurs before
a user can interact with the device. If the initialization code is modified or tampered with, the
