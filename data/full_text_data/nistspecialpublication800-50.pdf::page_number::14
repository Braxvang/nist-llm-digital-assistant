      (ii) their responsibilities in complying with agency policies and procedures designed to reduce these
      risks(.)”
Within the agency IT security program policy, there should be a clear and distinct section devoted to
agency wide requirements for the awareness and training program. Topics documented within the
awareness and training program policy should include roles and responsibilities, development of program
strategy and a program plan, implementation of the program plan, and maintenance of the awareness and
training program.

1.5      Roles and Responsibilities

While it is important to understand the policies that require agencies to develop and implement awareness
and training, it is crucial that agencies understand who has responsibility for IT security awareness and
training. This section identifies and describes those within an organization that have responsibility for IT
security awareness and training.

Some organizations have a mature IT security program, while other organizations may be struggling to
achieve basic staffing, funding, and support. The form that an awareness and training program takes can
vary greatly from agency to agency. This is due, in part, to the maturity of that program.3 One way to
help ensure that a program matures is to develop and document IT security awareness and training
responsibilities for those key positions upon which the success of the program depends.4

1.5.1      Agency Head

Agency heads must ensure that high priority is given to effective security awareness and training for the
workforce. This includes implementation of a viable IT security program with a strong awareness and
training component. Agency heads should:

     Designate a CIO;
     Assign responsibility for IT security;
     Ensure that an agency wide IT security program is implemented, is well-supported by resources and
      budget, and is effective; and
     Ensure that the agency has enough sufficiently trained personnel to protect its IT resources.
1.5.2      Chief Information Officer

Chief Information Officers (CIOs) are tasked by the FISMA to administer training and oversee personnel
with significant responsibilities for information security. CIOs should work with the agency IT security
program manager to:

     Establish overall strategy for the IT security awareness and training program;
     Ensure that the agency head, senior managers, system and data owners, and others understand the
      concepts and strategy of the security awareness and training program, and are informed of the
      progress of the program’s implementation;

      Differences in organizational culture are indicated by the placement of the IT security program, funding support, and access
      to and support by management. See Section 3.1 for examples of different awareness and training program models that can
      be implemented in an agency.

      IT security awareness and training responsibilities can be documented in agency policy, position descriptions, and where
      applicable, in performance or individual development plans.
