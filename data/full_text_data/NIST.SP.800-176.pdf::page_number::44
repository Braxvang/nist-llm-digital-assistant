     Multiparty computation is a technique that allows
a group of people to compute a function of their inputs
without revealing the inputs themselves. Examples of this
are: i) holding an election; ii) conducting closed-bid auctions
in which only the winning bid is determined; iii) proving to a
third party that an entity’s encrypted attributes satisfy some
requirement, such as “over 21 and (US citizen or Canadian
citizen)”. The protocols that solve multiparty computation
problems often encrypt bits using arithmetic modulo 2.                         Figure 7: Combinational Boolean Circuit
