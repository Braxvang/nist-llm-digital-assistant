Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1                Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


Public access-related considerations—
•    Security controls associated with public access information systems should be carefully
     considered and applied with discretion since some security controls from the specified control
     baselines (e.g., identification and authentication, personnel security controls) may not be
     applicable to users accessing information systems through public interfaces. For example,
     while the baseline controls require identification and authentication of organizational
     personnel that maintain and support information systems providing the public access services,
     the same controls might not be required for access to those information systems through
     public interfaces to obtain publicly available information. On the other hand, identification
     and authentication would be required for users accessing information systems through public
     interfaces in some instances, for example, to access/change their personal information.

Technology-related considerations—
•    Security controls that refer to specific technologies (e.g., wireless, cryptography, public key
     infrastructure) are applicable only if those technologies are employed or are required to be
     employed within the information system.
•    Security controls are applicable only to the components of the information system that
     provide or support the security capability addressed by the control and are sources of
     potential risk being mitigated by the control. 39 For example, when information system
     components are single-user, not networked, or only locally networked, one or more of these
     characteristics may provide appropriate rationale for not applying selected controls to that
     component.
•    Security controls that can be either explicitly or implicitly supported by automated
     mechanisms, do not require the development of such mechanisms if the mechanisms do not
     already exist or are not readily available in commercial or government off-the-shelf products.
     In situations where automated mechanisms are not readily available, cost-effective, or
     technically feasible, compensating security controls, implemented through nonautomated
     mechanisms or procedures, should be used to satisfy specified security controls or control
     enhancements (see terms and conditions for applying compensating controls below).

Policy/regulatory-related considerations—
•    Security controls that address matters governed by applicable laws, Executive Orders,
     directives, policies, standards, or regulations (e.g., privacy impact assessments) are required
     only if the employment of those controls is consistent with the types of information and
     information systems covered by the applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
     standards, or regulations.

   For example, auditing controls would typically be applied to the components of an information system that provide
or should provide auditing capability (servers, etc.) and would not necessarily be applied to every user-level
workstation within the organization. Organizations should carefully assess the inventory of components that compose
their information systems to determine which security controls are applicable to the various components. As
technology advances, more powerful and diverse functionality can be found in such devices as personal digital
assistants and cellular telephones, which may require the application of security controls in accordance with an
organizational assessment of risk. While the tailoring guidance may support not applying a particular security control
to a specific component (e.g., the audit example above), any residual risks associated with the absence of that control
must still be addressed and mitigated as necessary to adequately protect the organization’s operations, assets, and
individuals.
