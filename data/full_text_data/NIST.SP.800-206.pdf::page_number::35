     IMPERATIVE 8 – Securing Emerging Technologies




            BOTNET REPORT
            A Report to the President on Enhancing the Resilience of the Internet and
            Communications Ecosystem Against Botnets and Other Automated, Distributed
            Threats,80 released on May 30, 2018, outlines government and the private sector
            actions that would reduce the threat of botnets and similar cyberattacks. It
            responds to the May 11, 2017, Executive Order on Strengthening the Cybersecurity
            of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure.81 That order directed the
            Secretaries of Commerce and Homeland Security to lead “an open and
            transparent process to identify and promote action by appropriate stakeholders”
            with the goal of “dramatically reducing threats perpetrated by automated and
            distributed attacks (e.g., botnets).” In the course of the year-long effort launched
            by the Executive Order, the Departments determined that the opportunities and
            challenges of working toward dramatically reducing threats from automated,
            distributed attacks can be summarized in six principal themes:
            1. Automated, distributed attacks are a global problem.
            2. Effective tools exist but are not widely used.
            3. Products should be secured during all stages of the lifecycle.
            4. Awareness and education are needed.
            5. Market incentives should be more effectively aligned.
            6. Automated, distributed attacks are an ecosystem-wide challenge
            Five complementary and mutually supportive goals were identified that, if
            realized, would dramatically reduce the threat of automated, distributed attacks
            and improve the resilience and redundancy of the ecosystem:
                Goal 1: Identify a clear pathway toward an adaptable, sustainable, and secure
                technology marketplace.
                Goal 2: Promote innovation in the infrastructure for dynamic adaptation to
                evolving threats.
                Goal 3: Promote innovation at the edge of the network to prevent, detect, and
                mitigate automated, distributed attacks.
                Goal 4: Promote and support coalitions between the security, infrastructure,
                and operational technology communities domestically and around the world.
                Goal 5: Increase awareness and education across the ecosystem.
