                               The use of mathematical techniques to provide security services
Cryptography                   such as confidentiality, data integrity, entity authentication, and
                               data origin authentication.
                               The time span during which a specific key is authorized for use
Cryptoperiod                   or in which the keys for a given system or application may
                               remain in effect.
                               The key lifecycle state in which a key is not to be used to apply
Deactivated State              cryptographic protection to data. Under certain circumstances, the
                               key may be used to process already-protected data.
                               The person or organization having the ability, responsibility, and
Designer                       authority for specifying the devices comprising a new system and
                               how the devices will be structured, coordinated, and operated.
Destroyed State                A key lifecycle state in which a key cannot be recovered or used.
Destroyed       Compromised A key lifecycle state in which a key cannot be recovered nor used
State                       and is marked as compromised.
                               A logical entity that contains a group of elements (e.g., people,
Security Domain
                               organizations, information systems) that have common goals and
(Domain)
                               requirements.
                               An individual (person), organization, device or process. An entity
Entity                         has an identifier to which it may be associated. (Sometimes called
                               a party.)
                               Two domain security policies are equivalent if they permit the
Equivalent Security            exchange of cryptographic keys from one security domain to
Domain Policies                another in a manner whereby the key is provided comparable
                               protection in each domain.
Extensibility                  A measure of the ease of increasing the capability of a system.
                               The process integrated with a computer operating system that
Firewall                       detects and prevents undesirable applications and remote users
                               from accessing or performing operations on a secure computer.
                               A language whose syntax (i.e., rules for creating correct
                               sentences with proper structure) is defined such that the rules are
Formal Language                unambiguous and all syntactically correct sentences of the
                               language can be recognized as being correct by an automaton
                               (e.g., a computer running a syntax-analysis application program).
                               A description of the policies, procedures, components, and
Framework
                               devices that are used to create a CKMS.
                               The modification of data (e.g., a cryptographic key) in which one
Garbled                        or more of its elements (e.g., bit, digit, character) has been
                               changed or destroyed.
