 Development of short-, medium-, and long-term implementation plans identifying tasks, resources,
  priority, and ownership
 Development of IT security metrics.
5.1.3   Risk Management

Risk management is comprehensively discussed in NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for
Information Technology Systems. NIST SP 800-30 notes that the primary goal of risk management is to
“balance the operational and economic costs of protective measures and achieve gains in mission
capability by protecting IT systems and data.”

Risk Management Services

Service providers offer various combinations of service packages for supporting risk management
activities. The service provider may develop risk management guidance for supporting an organization’s
risk management program. The service provider may manage the risk management program as a whole
but the organization should always retain the responsibility for the program. The service provider may
also perform a risk assessment and/or develop a risk mitigation plan. If the organization already has a
mature and operational risk management program, the service provider may audit the program for
effectiveness.

5.1.4   IT Security Architecture

Security architecture refers to the strategic planning and development of an IT infrastructure that supports
the mission and the security objectives. It is a process that is developed during the security design phase
after a security requirements analysis has been conducted to support it.

IT Security Architecture Services

If the organization asks a service provider to design a new security architecture, the service provider must
have access to the technology and security baseline of the organization’s current architecture. The service
provider can conduct baselining if it has not already been done by the organization. Baselining services
include identifying its business needs, functional requirements, security requirements, and risk
assessments, as well as the security controls in place. A service provider can identify security controls
and identify and assess technologies that will enforce the organization’s security policies. A service
provider can develop a methodology for selecting the security solutions that best serve the organization’s
needs and design a technical architecture. Finally, the service provider should document the security
architecture.

5.1.5   Certification and Accreditation

Accreditation is the formal declaration by an authorizing official that a system is approved to operate at
an acceptable level of risk and in a particular environment using a prescribed set of technical, managerial,
and operational safeguards to an acceptable level of risk. Accreditation is usually supported by a technical
security evaluation, a risk assessment, a contingency plan, and signed rules of behavior. Certification is
the technical security evaluation of an IT system made in support of the accreditation process, to establish
the extent to which a particular design and implementation meets a set of specified security requirements.

NIST SP 800-37 (draft), Federal Guidelines for the Security Certification and Accreditation of
Information Technology Systems establishes standard processes, activities and general tasks, and
management approaches designed to certify and accredit an information system.
