3. Forensic Tools

     Unlike the situation with personal computers, the number and variety of toolkits for PDAs and
     other handheld devices are considerably limited. Not only are there fewer specialized tools
     and toolkits, but also the range of devices over which they operate is typically narrowed to
     only the most popular families of PDA devices â€“ those based on the Pocket PC and Palm OS.
     Linux-based devices can be imaged with the dd utility, somewhat analogously to a Linux
     desktop, and analyzed with the use of a compatible tool (e.g., EnCase). Since Palm OS
     devices have been around the longest, more forensic tools are available for them than for other
     device families. Table 2 lists open-source and commercially available tools known to the
     authors and the facilities they provide: acquisition, examination, or reporting. The
     abbreviation NA means that the tool at the left of the row is not applicable to the device at top
     of the column. With one exception (i.e., versions of Palm OS prior to 4.0), these tools require
     that the examiner have unobstructed access to acquire contents (i.e., no authentication
     technique need be satisfied to gain access).

     Forensic tools acquire data from a device in one of two ways: physical acquisition or logical
     acquisition. Physical acquisition implies a bit-by-bit copy of an entire physical store (e.g., a
     disk drive or RAM chip), while logical acquisition implies a bit-by-bit copy of logical storage
     objects (e.g., directories and files) that reside on a logical store (e.g., a filesystem partition).
     The difference lies in the distinction between memory as seen by a process through the
     operating system facilities (i.e., a logical view), versus memory as seen in raw form by the
     processor and other related hardware components (i.e., a physical view).

     Physical acquisition has advantages over logical acquisition, since it allows deleted files and
     any data remnants present (e.g., unallocated RAM or unused filesystem space) to be examined,
     which otherwise would go unaccounted. Physical device images are generally more easily
     imported into another tool for examination and reporting. However, a logical structure has the
     advantage that it is a more natural organization to understand and use during examination.
     Thus, if possible, doing both types of acquisition on PDAs is preferable.
