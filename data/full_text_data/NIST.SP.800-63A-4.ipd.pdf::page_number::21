465   This section is informative.
466   Figure 1 outlines the basic flow for identity proofing and enrollment.




                                     Figure 1. Identity Prooﬁng Process

467   The following provides an example of how a CSP and an applicant might interact during a
468   remote identity proofing process at IAL2:
469      1. Resolution
470           a) The CSP collects attributes from the applicant, such as name, address, date of
471              birth, email, and phone number.
472           b) The CSP also collects one or more pieces of identity evidence, such as a
473              driver’s license or a passport.
474      2. Validation
475           a) The CSP validates the attributes obtained in steps 1a by checking them against
476              authoritative or credible sources.
477           b) The CSP validates the authenticity, accuracy, and currency of the presented
478              evidence.
479      3. Verification
480           a) The CSP asks the applicant to take a photo of themself, with liveness checks.
481           b) The CSP compares the pictures on the license and the passport to the photo of
482              the live applicant’s photo from the previous step and determines they match.
