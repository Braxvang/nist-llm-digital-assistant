NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                                              GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


these mechanisms is single-use tickets, which allows each session ticket to be used only once. It
may be difficult to implement this mechanism in an environment with distributed servers as a
session database must be shared between servers. ClientHello recording is a second mechanism
that defends against replay attacks by recording a unique value derived from the ClientHello and
rejecting duplicates. To limit the size of the list, the server can maintain a list only within a
specified time window. In general, 0-RTT data should not be accepted by the server. If the
server does allow 0-RTT data, then the server should use the single-use ticket mechanism in
accordance with RFC 8446 (see Section 8 of [57]).

3.7     Compression Methods

The use of compression may enable attackers to perform attacks using compression-based side
channels (e.g., [60], [11]). To defend against these attacks, the null compression method shall be
enabled, and all other compression methods shall be disabled.

3.8     Operational Considerations

The sections above specify TLS-specific functionality. This functionality is necessary but is not
sufficient to achieve security in an operational environment.

Federal agencies shall ensure that TLS servers include appropriate network security protections
as specified in other NIST guidelines, such as SP 800-53 [36].

The server shall operate on a secure operating system. 29 Where the server relies on a FIPS 140
Level 1 cryptographic module, the software and private key shall be protected using the
operating system identification, authentication, and access control mechanisms. In some highly
sensitive applications, server private keys may require protection using a FIPS 140 Level 2 or
higher hardware cryptographic module.

The server and associated platform shall be kept up-to-date in terms of security patches. This is
critical to various aspects of security.




29 A secure operating system contains and uses the following features: operating system protection from applications and

      processes, operating system mediated isolation among applications and processes, user identification and authentication,
      access control based on authenticated user identity, and event logging of security-relevant activities.
