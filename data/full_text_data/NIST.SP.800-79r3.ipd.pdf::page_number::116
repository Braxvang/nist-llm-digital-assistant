NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                        Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
December 2023                                                                               and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

    Identifier                           Issuer Control                              Applicability              Source

    MP(DC)-5      Upon derived PIV credential invalidation, the organization             DPCI        [SP800-157], Sec. 2.4 –
                  enforces a standard methodology for updating the PIV                               Invalidation
                  identity account to indicate the derived PIV credential
                  status.

                  Assessment
                  Determine that:
                     (i) The issuer has procedures to update the PIV
                          identity account to indicate derived PIV credential
                          invalidation (review).
    MP(DC)-7      The organization has completed a life cycle walkthrough at             DPCI        SP 800-79, Sec. 5.4 –
                  one year intervals since the last authorization date, and the                      Monitoring Phase
                  results are documented in a report to the DAO.

                  Assessment
                  Determine that:
                      (i) The organization has completed a life cycle
                          walkthrough to cover initial issuance, maintenance,
                          and termination processes (interview).
                     (ii) A life cycle walkthrough has been completed at one
                          year intervals since the last authorization date
                          (interview).
                    (iii) The results of the issuer life cycle walkthrough have
                          been documented and reviewed by the DAO
                          (review, interview).
    MP(DC)-11     When certificate rekeying or modification is performed               PKI-AAL2,     [SP800-157], Sec. 2.3.1 - PKI-
                  remotely for a derived PIV credential, communication                 PKI-AAL3      Based Derived PIV Credential
                  between the issuer and the cryptographic module in which                           Maintenance
                  the derived PIV authentication private key is stored occurs
                  only over mutually authenticated secure sessions between
                  tested and validated cryptographic modules.

                  Assessment
                  Determine that:
                    (i) Remote updates for certificate rekeying and the
                         modification of a derived PIV authentication
                         certificate meet all required security controls to be
                         implemented by the issuer and the issuer
                         information systems (review).
    MP(DC)-12     The intent of this control is covered by MP(DC)-22 and                   -         -
                  MP(DC)-23.
    MP(DC)-13     The intent of this control is covered by MP(DC)-22 and                   -         -
                  MP(DC)-23.
    MP(DC)-16     Reissuance of derived PIV credentials in cases of                      DPCI        [SP800-157], Sec. 2.3 –
                  expiration, loss, damage, or compromise is performed in                            Maintenance
                  accordance with the initial issuance process.

                  Assessment
                  Determine that:
                       (i) The issuer follows the initial issuance process while
                           reissuing a derived PIV credential in cases of
                           expiration, loss, damage, or compromise (review,
                           observe).
    MP(DC)-17     If the derived PIV authentication private key was created            PKI-AAL2,     [SP800-157], Sec. 2.4.1 –
                  and stored on a hardware cryptographic token that permits            PKI-AAL3      PKI-Based Derived PIV
                  export of the private key, then the derived PIV                                    Credential Invalidation
                  authentication certificate is revoked upon termination, even
                  if the token is collected and either zeroized or destroyed.
