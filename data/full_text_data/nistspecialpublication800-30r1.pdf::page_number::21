Strategic plans and policies also assert or imply the relative priorities of immediate or near-term
mission/business function accomplishment and long-term organizational viability (which can be
undermined by the loss of reputation or by sanctions resulting from the compromise of sensitive
information). Organizations can also consider the range of effects of threat events including the
relative size of the set of resources affected, when making final impact determinations. Risk
tolerance assumptions may state that threat events with an impact below a specific value do not
warrant further analysis.

Risk
Figure 3 illustrates an example of a risk model including the key risk factors discussed above and
the relationship among the factors. Each of the risk factors is used in the risk assessment process
in Chapter Three.

As noted above, risk is a function of the likelihood of a threat eventâ€™s occurrence and potential
adverse impact should the event occur. This definition accommodates many types of adverse
impacts at all tiers in the risk management hierarchy described in Special Publication 800-39
(e.g., damage to image or reputation of the organization or financial loss at Tier 1; inability to
successfully execute a specific mission/business process at Tier 2; or the resources expended in
responding to an information system incident at Tier 3). It also accommodates relationships
among impacts (e.g., loss of current or future mission/business effectiveness due to the loss of
data confidentiality; loss of confidence in critical information due to loss of data or system
integrity; or unavailability or degradation of information or information systems). This broad
definition also allows risk to be represented as a single value or as a vector (i.e., multiple values),
in which different types of impacts are assessed separately. For purposes of risk communication,
risk is generally grouped according to the types of adverse impacts (and possibly the time frames
in which those impacts are likely to be experienced).
