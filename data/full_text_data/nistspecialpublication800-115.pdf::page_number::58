                                                 TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



While individual vulnerabilities need to be identified and resolved, identifying the root cause of
vulnerabilities is key to improving the organization’s overall security posture because a root cause can
often be traced to program-level weaknesses. Some common root causes include:

       Insufficient patch management, such as failing to apply patches in a timely fashion or failing to
        apply patches to all vulnerable systems
       Insufficient threat management, including outdated antivirus signatures, ineffective spam
        filtering, and firewall rulesets that do not enforce the organization’s security policy
       Lack of security baselines, such as inconsistent security configuration settings on similar systems
       Poor integration of security into the system development life cycle, such as missing or unsatisfied
        security requirements and vulnerabilities in organization-developed application code
       Security architecture weaknesses, such as security technologies not being properly integrated into
        the infrastructure (e.g., poor placement, insufficient coverage, or outdated technologies), or poor
        placement of systems that increases their risk of compromise
       Inadequate incident response procedures, such as delayed responses to penetration testing
        activities
       Inadequate training, both for end users (e.g., failure to recognize social engineering and phishing
        attacks, deployment of rogue wireless access points) and for network and system administrators
        (e.g., deployment of weakly secured systems, poor security maintenance)
       Lack of security policies or policy enforcement (e.g., open ports, active services, unsecured
        protocols, rogue hosts, weak passwords).
A useful resource to reference throughout the analysis phase is the NIST National Vulnerability Database
(NVD) 30 . NVD is a database that contains information on Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
(CVE), a list of standardized names for known vulnerabilities. The NVD scores vulnerabilities with the
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and provides additional information regarding the
vulnerability and additional resources to reference for mitigation recommendations (e.g., vendor Web
sites).

Another goal of analysis is to identify throughout the assessment any critical vulnerabilities that the
organization needs to immediately address. For instance, if penetration testing exploits a vulnerability
that allows assessors to gain administrator rights on a critical system, assessors should immediately notify
the person identified in the assessment plan or ROE.

7.4     Data Handling

The method by which an organization’s data is handled throughout the assessment is critical to ensuring
protection of sensitive information—including system architecture, security configurations, and system
vulnerabilities. Organizations should ensure proper documentation of requirements for data handling in
the assessment plan or ROE, and adhere to their governing policies regarding the handling of system
vulnerabilities. This section offers suggested methods for collecting, storing, and transmitting assessment
data during an engagement, as well as for storing and destroying data once an assessment is complete.
