shutting it down, reconfiguring it to comply with the organization’s policies, or removing the device
completely. If the device is to be removed, security personnel should evaluate the activity of the rogue
device before it is confiscated. This can be done through monitoring transmissions and attempting to
access the device.

If discovered wireless devices cannot be located during the scan, security personnel should attempt to use
a WIDPS to support the location of discovered devices. This requires the WIDPS to locate a specific
MAC address that was discovered during the scan. Properly deployed WIDPSs should have the ability to
assist security personnel in locating these devices, and usually involves the use of multiple WIDPS
sensors to increase location identification granularity. Because the WIDPS will only be able to locate a
device within several feet, a wireless scanning tool may still be needed to pinpoint the location of the
device.

4.4.4    Bluetooth Scanning

For organizations that want to confirm compliance with their Bluetooth security requirements, passive
scanning for Bluetooth-enabled wireless devices should be conducted to evaluate potential presence and
activity. Because Bluetooth has a very short range (on average 9 meters [30 feet], with some devices
having ranges of as little as 1 meter [3 feet]), scanning for devices can be difficult and time-consuming.
Assessors should take range limitations into consideration when scoping this type of scanning.
Organizations may want to perform scanning only in areas of their facilities that are accessible by the
public—to see if attackers could gain access to devices via Bluetooth—or to perform scanning in a
sampling of physical locations rather than throughout the entire facility. Because many Bluetooth-
enabled devices (such as cell phones and personal digital assistants [PDA]) are mobile, conducting
passive scanning several times over a period of time may be necessary. Organizations should also scan
any Bluetooth infrastructure, such as access points, that they deploy. If rogue access points are
discovered, the organization should handle them in accordance with established policies and processes.

A number of tools are available for actively testing the security and operation of Bluetooth devices.
These tools attempt to connect to discovered devices and perform attacks to surreptitiously gain access
and connectivity to Bluetooth-enabled devices. Assessors should be extremely cautious of performing
active scanning because of the likelihood of inadvertently scanning personal Bluetooth devices, which are
found in many environments. As a general rule, assessors should use active scanning only when they are
certain that the devices being scanned belong to the organization. Active scanning can be used to
evaluate the security mode in which a Bluetooth device is operating, and the strength of Bluetooth
password identification numbers (PIN). Active scanning can also be used to verify that these devices are
set to the lowest possible operational power setting to minimize their range. As with IEEE 802.11a/b/g
rogue devices, rogue Bluetooth devices should be dealt with in accordance with policies and guidance.
