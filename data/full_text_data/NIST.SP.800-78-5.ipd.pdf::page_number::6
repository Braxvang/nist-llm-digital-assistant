      NIST SP 800-78-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                   Cryptographic Algorithms
      September 2023                                                                   and Key Sizes for PIV

108   Call for Patent Claims
109   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use
110   would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information
111   Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or requirements may be
112   directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another publication. This call also
113   includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending U.S. or foreign patent applications
114   relating to this ITL draft publication and of any relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.
115   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its behalf,
116   in written or electronic form, either:
117       a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not hold
118          and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
119       b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available to
120          applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the guidance
121          or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:
122              i.    under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
123                    discrimination; or
124             ii.    without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
125                    demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.
126   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make assurances
127   on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents subject to the
128   assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the assurance are binding on
129   the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of
130   future transfers with the goal of binding each successor-in-interest.
131   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
132   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.
133   Such statements should be addressed to: piv_comments@nist.gov
