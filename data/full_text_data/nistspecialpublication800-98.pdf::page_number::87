                                                                                           SECTION 5: RFID SECURITY CONTROLS



 The existence of a kill feature represents a significant business process threat to an RFID system. If
  an adversary who learns the kill password improperly disables tags that should remain in operation,
  the supported application will not function properly because it will not be able to perform transactions
  on the disabled tags. This risk is particularly salient for organizations that assign the same password
  to multiple tags because doing so could enable an adversary to disable large numbers of tags with a
  single compromised password.
 Once killed, a tag cannot be used for any further application involving the asset (e.g., recalls, receipt-
  less product returns).
 If an organization assigns a weak (e.g., short or easily guessed) password for the kill command,
  unauthorized parties can kill the tag at will. 64 Moreover, the longer a tag maintains the same
  password, the more likely it is that the password will be compromised.
 Data stored on the tag is still present in the tag’s memory after it is killed (although it can no longer
  be accessed wirelessly), and therefore still may be accessible to someone with physical access to the
  tag. 65
 Although the kill command was added to tags as a potential solution for privacy concerns, consumers
  cannot easily detect whether a tag has been deactivated. 66 Moreover, typical consumers cannot easily
  kill tags on their own because this action requires a reader and knowledge of the kill password.
5.3.3.4 Tamper Resistance

Control: Certain RFID tags have tamper resistant or tamper-evident features that help prevent an
adversary from altering the tags or removing them from the objects to which they are attached. One
simple type of tamper resistance is the use of a frangible, or easily broken, antenna; if a tag of this type is
removed, the electric connection with the antenna is severed, rendering the tag inoperable. Other, more
complex types of RFID systems monitor the integrity of objects associated with the tags to ensure that the
objects have not been compromised, altered, or subjected to extreme conditions.

Applicability: Applications in which tags are frequently outside of the direct control of the
implementing organization and therefore vulnerable to tampering. Tamper resistance and tamper-evident
features are currently only available on specialty RFID tags that are designed for tamper resistance to
support specific buyer requirements.

Benefits: This control helps to prevent adversaries from breaking the association between a tag and its
corresponding object. The more complex tamper-resistant / tamper-evident tags provide health and status
monitoring of the attached objects to ensure that they have not been opened, manipulated, damaged, or
subjected to extreme temperature, humidity, or shock.

Weaknesses: Sophisticated adversaries may be able to defeat the tamper resistance mechanisms. This is
dependent upon the implementation of the tamper resistance feature. For example, a sophisticated
adversary may be able to repair a frangible antenna. In addition, tamper-resistance / tamper-evidence
technologies do not prevent the theft or destruction of the tag or its associated items.

     An EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 tag cannot be killed if it has a null password (i.e., one whose bits are all zeros). Source:
     EPCglobal, "EPC™ Radio-Frequency Identity Protocols Class-1 Generation-2 UHF RFID Protocol for Communications at
     860 MHz – 960 MHz Version 1.0.9," January 2005, pg. 58.

     Obtaining data from the tag in this circumstance would require an attacker to have specialized equipment and expertise.

     This may open a door for future consumer products to test for the presence of passive RFID tags and probe their
     characteristics. It is hypothesized that cellular phones may be able to provide this service for EPC passive tags since cellular
     phones already operate in the 860 to 960 MHz band.
