       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                         Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

1316       17. If an RBG2(P) construction is used as the randomness source for the RBG1 construction,
1317           the RBG2(P) construction must be reseeded (i.e., prediction resistance must be obtained
1318           within the RBG2(P) construction) before generating bits for each RBG1 instantiation.
1319       18. A physically secure channel must be used to insert the randomness input from the
1320           randomness source into the DRBG of the RBG1 construction.
1321       19. An RBG1 construction must not be used for applications that require a higher security
1322           strength than has been instantiated.

1323   4.4.2. Sub-DRBG Requirements
1324   A sub-DRBG has the following testable requirements (i.e., testable by the validation labs).
1325       1. The randomness source for a sub-DRBG shall be an RBG1 construction; a sub-DRBG
1326          shall not serve as a randomness source for another sub-DRBG.
1327       2. A sub-DRBG shall employ the same DRBG components as its randomness source.
1328       3.    A sub-DRBG shall reside in the same security boundary as the RBG1 construction that
1329            initializes it.
1330       4. The RBG1 construction shall fulfill the appropriate requirements of Section 4.4.1.
1331       5. A sub-DRBG shall exist only for a limited time and purpose, as determined by the
1332          application or developer.
1333       6. The output from the RBG1 construction that is used for sub-DRBG instantiation shall not
1334          be output from the security boundary of the construction and shall not be used for any
1335          other purpose, including for seeding a different sub-DRBG.
1336       7. A sub-DRBG shall not permit itself to be instantiated more than once.
1337       8. A sub-DRBG shall not provide output for use by the RBG1 construction (e.g., as additional
1338          input) or another sub-DRBG in the security boundary.
1339       9. The security strength s requested for a target sub-DRBG instantiation shall not exceed the
1340          security strength that is supported by the RBG1 construction.
1341       10. For a Hash_DRBG, HMAC_DRBG or CTR_DRBG (with a derivation function), 3s/2 bits
1342           shall be obtained from the RBG1 construction for instantiation, where s is the requested
1343           security strength for the target sub-DRBG.
1344       11 For a CTR_DRBG (without a derivation function), s + 128 bits shall be obtained from the
1345          RBG1 construction for instantiation, where s is the requested security strength for the target
1346          sub-DRBG.
1347       12. A sub-DRBG shall not produce output until it is instantiated.
1348       13. A sub-DRBG shall not provide output for generating requests that specify a security
1349           strength greater than the instantiated security strength of the sub-DRBG.
1350       14. A sub-DRBG shall not include a reseed capability.
