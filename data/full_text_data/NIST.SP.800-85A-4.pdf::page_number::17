NIST SP 800-85A-4                                              PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                        INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES



3.2 PIV Card Application Tests

PIV Card Application tests cover the following:
   +     The PIV Card Application card command interface as per Part 2 of SP 800-73-4,
         including the security conditions for executing each command in the interface as well
         as the security conditions for accessing and storing each of the associated data
         objects.
   +     Presence of all mandatory data objects as well as accessibility and storage of all
         implemented data objects using the identifiers specified in Part 1 of SP 800-73-4.
The tests are performed through test scripts communicating directly with a PIV Card through
the API of the driver that comes with the card reader.

 3.2.1    PIV Card Application Card Command Interface Tests
These tests will validate that the card under test can successfully execute the commands in
the PIV card command interface. Successful execution constitutes the card responding with
appropriate data and response status codes to the commands sent by the test system. It also
involves setting state variables within the PIV Card. For example, the criteria for successful
execution of the SELECT command involve the following:
   +     The response status code returned is '90 00'.
   +     The application property template is returned with the correct format and content.
   +     The “PIV Card Application” is the value of “currently selected application” (state
         variable) on the card.
The card command interface test suite includes conformance tests for the following PIV Card
Application commands:
   +     Data access commands.
               SELECT
               GET DATA
   +     Card authentication commands.
               VERIFY
               CHANGE REFERENCE DATA
               RESET RETRY COUNTER
               GENERAL AUTHENTICATE
   +     Credential initialization and administration commands.
               PUT DATA
               GENERATE ASYMMETRIC KEY PAIR
The card edge commands will be validated against the following conditions:
   +     Card interface type (contact vs. contactless, including virtual contact interface).
