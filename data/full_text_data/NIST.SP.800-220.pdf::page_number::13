In FY 2021, there were also several activities surrounding the NICE Framework. In November
2020, NIST published a framework update – Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (SP 800-
181, Revision 1). Competencies were reintroduced in the revision, and subsequently, a draft NICE
Framework Competencies: Assessing Learners for Cybersecurity Work (NISTIR 8355) and a draft
list of competencies were released for public comment. In addition, three workshops were held
in FY 2021 to explore areas in which the NICE Framework could be expanded: Competencies:
Moving from Concept to Implementation (March 2021), Developing a Workforce to Secure
Operational Technologies (August 2021), and Developing a Workforce for Security Awareness
and Behavior Change (September 2021). Finally, NIST released eight NICE success stories.
These articles demonstrate how an organization has used the NICE Framework and emphasize
the drivers, process, and outcomes – including benefits and lessons learned – to help improve
an understanding of the NICE Framework. These success stories also promote ideas on how to
adopt the framework and associated products.
Federal Cybersecurity Workforce
NIST has brought together the federal cybersecurity community throughout the year through
two major programs: the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Summit/Webinars and the Federal
Information Security Educators (FISSEA). In addition to the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce
Summit, which covered topics such as national cybersecurity priorities and policy initiatives and the
strategic vision for the federal cybersecurity workforce, a webinar was held to share assessment
policies, strategies, and practices for cybersecurity hiring. Additionally, FISSEA’s Summer and
Fall forums brought together Federal Government information security professionals to explore
techniques for awareness and training. FISSEA also recognized two innovators of the year and
several winners in a contest for best awareness and training materials, including blogs, posters,
and more.
Advancing Cybersecurity Usability
The NIST Usable Cybersecurity team conducted research to better understand the factors that
influence youth cybersecurity and privacy knowledge and behaviors across both the home and
school contexts. At the 2021 USENIX Security Symposium, NIST published the results from a large-
scale survey of 1,505 3rd to 12th graders from schools across the United States. In preparation
for a future report, the team also analyzed data from a study of passwords used by parents.
NIST also conducted an interview study with parent/child pairs to understand youth perceptions of
online security and privacy and potential parental influences. Research results will inform efforts
to provide guidance and best practices to youths, their parents, and educators so that youths can
stay safe and secure online while enjoying the benefits of the Internet.
NIST also completed a study to understand the needs, challenges, practices, and competencies
of federal security awareness professionals and programs. The results of the study will inform the
creation of resources for federal programs, including examples of successful practices and the
lessons learned. Findings were presented to federal security forums and are directly contributing
to the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework and a revision of NIST Special Publications
related to security awareness and training programs. Multiple reports detailing the results will be
published in 2022.
