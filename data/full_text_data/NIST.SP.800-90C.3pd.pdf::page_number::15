      NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                        Recommendation for RBG Constructions
      September 2022

362           Audience
363   The intended audience for this Recommendation includes 1) developers who want to design and
364   implement RBGs that can be validated by NIST’s CMVP and CAVP, 2) testing labs that are
365   accredited to perform the validation tests and the evaluation of the RBG constructions, and 3) users
366   who install RBGs in systems.

367           Document Organization
368   This document is organized as follows:
369       •   Section 2 provides background and preliminary information for understanding the
370           remainder of the document.
371       •   Section 3 provides guidance on accessing and handling entropy sources, including the
372           external conditioning of entropy-source output.
373       •   Sections 4, 5, and 6 specify the RBG constructions.
374       •   Section 7 discusses health and implementation-validation testing.
375       •   References contains a list of papers and publications cited in this document.
376   The following informational appendices are also provided:
377       •   Appendix A provides discussions on entropy versus security strength.
378       •   Appendix B provides examples of each RBG construction.
379       •   Appendix C is an addendum to SP 800-90A that includes two additional derivation
380           functions that may be used with the CTR_DRBG. These functions will be moved into SP
381           800-90A as part of the next revision of that document.
382       •   Appendix D provides a list of abbreviations, symbols, functions, and notations used in this
383           document.
384       •   Appendix E provides a glossary with definitions for terms used in this document.
