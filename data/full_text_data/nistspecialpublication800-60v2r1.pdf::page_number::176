D.10.4 Postal Services Information Type

Postal Services provide for the timely and consistent exchange and delivery of mail and packages
between businesses, organizations, and residents of the United States or between businesses,
organizations, and residents of the United States and the rest of the world. It also includes the
nation-wide retail infrastructure required to make Postal Services easily accessible to customers.
(Note: The commercial function of mail is more closely aligned with the “Business and Industry
Development” mission in the “Economic Development mission area.” The international
commercial function of mail is more closely aligned with the “Global Trade” mission in the
“International Affairs” mission area). The recommended provisional categorization of thee postal
services information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of postal services
information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide for the timely and consistent
exchange and delivery of mail and packages between businesses, organizations, and residents of
the United States or between businesses, organizations, and residents of the United States and the
rest of the world. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most postal services
information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Exceptions that might have a
potential for more serious consequences include privacy information (e.g., information required
by the Privacy Act of 1974 or other statutes and executive orders to receive special handling to
protect the privacy of individuals). The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are
documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. Other exceptions
include unauthorized disclosure of information that might assist criminals to perpetrate fraud,
particularly with respect to income security disbursements. Because registered mail can be
employed to transmit classified information, information regarding some registered mail can
facilitate unauthorized access to national security information. This can result in assignment of a
moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most postal services information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of postal services information would
have, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.
Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications
(e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the
agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.
