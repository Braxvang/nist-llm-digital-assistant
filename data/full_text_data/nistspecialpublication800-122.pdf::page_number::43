                                GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



     The E-Government Act requires publication of PIAs, 88 which must analyze and describe the
     following information:
      What information is to be collected
      Why the information is being collected
      The intended use of the information
      With whom the information will be shared
      What opportunities individuals have to decline to provide information (i.e., where providing
       information is voluntary) or to consent to particular uses of the information (other than required
       or authorized uses), and how individuals can grant consent
      How the information will be secured
      Whether a system of records is being created under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a
      What choices the agency made regarding an information system or collection of information as a
       result of performing the PIA.
7. What is the Paperwork Reduction Act?

     The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) gives OMB and other Federal agencies responsibilities for the
     management of information resources. 89 The PRA is relevant to PII protection for two major reasons.
     First, it places privacy among the responsibilities of agency CIOs. However, the extent to which
     agency CIOs are responsible for privacy depends on a number of factors, including whether the
     agency is covered by any other statutory mandate for the designation of a chief privacy officer
     (CPO).90 Second, the PRA created a process for OMB review and approval of Federal agency
     information collections from the public. This process is relevant to PII protection because it provides
     a mechanism for agencies to limit the collection of PII, as mandated by the Fair Information Practice
     of Collection Limitation. It is also relevant to PII protection because its terms partly define the scope
     of E-Government Act PIAs. The purpose of the PRA information collection review process is to
     minimize the burdens of paperwork on the public, minimize the cost of information collections, and
     increase the quality of Federal information.91 The PRA requires Federal agencies to get clearance
     from OMB when an agency plans to collect information from ten or more persons using identical
     reporting, recordkeeping, or disclosure requirements. The term persons is defined broadly to include
     people, organizations, local government, etc., but it does not include Federal agencies or employees
     of Federal agencies when acting in their official capacities. Agencies must also provide notice of the
     collection in the Federal Register before submitting the information collection to OMB for clearance.


88
     An agency may exempt itself from this requirement if publication of the PIA would raise national security concerns or
     reveal classified or sensitive information.
89
     The PRA is codified at 44 U.S.C. § 3501, et seq. First enacted into law in 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511, Dec. 11, 1980), the PRA
     was significantly amended in 1995 (Pub. L. 104-13, May 22, 1995). The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 amended the PRA to
     make agency Chief Information Officers (CIO) responsible for carrying out agency responsibilities under the Act (sec.
     5125(a), Pub. L. 104-106, 110 Stat. 684, Feb. 10, 1996).
90
     For example, chief (or senior) privacy officers are required by the Transportation, Treasury, Independent Agencies, and
     General Government Appropriations Act of 2005, for the agencies covered by that Act (sec. 522, Div. H, Pub. L. 108-447,
     Dec. 8, 2004), for the Department of Homeland Security by sec. 222, Homeland Security Act, Pub. L. 107-296, Nov. 25,
     2002 (6 U.S.C. § 142), and for the Department of Justice by sec. 1174, Violence Against Women and Dept. of Justice
     Reauthorization Act of 2005, Pub. L. 109-162, Jan. 5, 2006 (28 U.S.C. § 509).
