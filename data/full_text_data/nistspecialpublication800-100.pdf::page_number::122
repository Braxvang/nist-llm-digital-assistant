Chapter 12
12. Security Services and Products
    Acquisition
    Information security services and products are essential elements of an
organization’s information security program. Many products and services to support
an agency’s information security program for information systems are widely
available in the marketplace today, and are frequently used by federal agencies.
Security products and services should be selected and used within the organization’s
overall program to manage the design, development, and maintenance of its
information security infrastructure, and to protect its mission-critical information. In
the acquisition of both, agencies should apply risk management principles to aide in
the identification and mitigation of risks associated with the acquisition.
    In the acquisition of information security products, agencies are encouraged to
conduct a cost-benefit analysis as part of the product-selection process – one that
also includes the costs associated with risk mitigation. This cost-benefit analysis
should include a life cycle cost (LCC) estimate for the status quo and one for each
identified alternative while highlighting the benefits associated with each alternative.
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-
36, Guide to Selecting Information Technology (IT) Security Products, first defines
broad security product categories and specifies product types, product
characteristics, and environment considerations within those categories. The guide
then provides a list of pertinent questions that agencies should ask when selecting
products.
     As with the acquisition of products, the acquisition of services bears considerable
risks that federal agencies must identify and mitigate. The importance of
systematically managing the process for acquisition of information security services
cannot be underestimated because of the potential impact associated with those
risks. In selecting this type of services, agencies should employ risk management
processes in the context of information security services life cycle, which provides an
organizational framework for information security decision makers. NIST SP 800-35,
Guide to Information Technology Security Services, provides assistance with the
selection, implementation, and management of information security services by
guiding the reader through the various phases of the information security services
life cycle. Information security decision makers must consider the costs involved, the
underlying security requirements, and the impact of their decisions on the
organizational mission, operations, strategic functions, personnel, and service-
provider arrangements.
    The process of selecting information security products and services involves
numerous people throughout an organization. Each person involved in the process,
whether on an individual or group level, should understand the importance of
security in the organization’s information infrastructure and the security impacts of
their decisions. Depending on its needs, an organization may include all of the
personnel listed below or a combination of particular positions relevant to
information security needs.
