1127   The RBG for instantiating the DRBG within the RBG1 construction must be either an RBG2(P)
1128   construction that has support for prediction resistance requests ( see Section 5) or an RBG3
1129   construction (see Section 6). A physically secure channel between the randomness source and the
1130   DRBG is used to securely transport the randomness input required for the instantiation of the
1131   DRBG. An optional recommended personalization string and optional additional input may be
1132   provided from within the DRBGâ€™s cryptographic module or from outside of that module (see
1133   Section 2.4.1).
1134   An external conditioning function is not needed for this design because the output of the RBG has
1135   already been cryptographically processed.
1136   The output from an RBG1 construction may be used within the cryptographic module (e.g., to seed
1137   a sub-DRBG as specified in Section 4.3) or by an application outside of the RBG1 security
1138   boundary.
1139   The security strength provided by the RBG1 construction is the minimum of the security strengths
1140   provided by the DRBG within the construction, the secure channel, and the RBG used to seed the
1141   DRBG.
1142   Examples of RBG1 and sub-DRBG constructions are provided in Appendices B.2 and B.3,
1143   respectively.

1144           Conceptual Interfaces
1145   Interfaces to the DRBG within an RBG1 construction include function calls for instantiating the
1146   DRBG and generating pseudorandom bits upon request (see Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2).
1147   Note that reseeding is not included in this construction.
