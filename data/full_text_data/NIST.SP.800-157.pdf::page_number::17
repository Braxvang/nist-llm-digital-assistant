Special Publication 800-157                                                            Guidelines for Derived PIV Credentials


The cryptographic tokens permitted for Derived PIV Credentials are described in the subsections below.

3.3.1    Removable (Non-Embedded) Hardware Cryptographic Tokens

This section provides requirements for implementations where the Derived PIV Authentication private
key resides in a hardware cryptographic module (or token) that can be removed from the mobile device.
In such cases, a Derived PIV Application, as defined in Appendix B, shall be installed on the hardware
cryptographic token. The use of this data model and its interface supports interoperability and ensures the
Derived PIV Credential interface is aligned with the interface of the PIV Card.

The permitted types of removable hardware cryptographic tokens are described in the following
subsections. Each token type is a standards-based hardware form-factor that supports compatibility and
portability across a variety of mobile computing devices. In each case, the form-factor supports a secure
element (SE), a tamper resistant cryptographic component that provides security and confidentiality.

The Application Protocol Data Units (APDUs) for the Derived PIV Application command interface (as
defined in Appendix B) are transported to the secure element within each form-factor over a transport
protocol appropriate for that form factor. Further details of the required transport protocols are provided
below.

As described in Appendix B, the Derived PIV Application may include digital signature and key
management private keys and their corresponding certificates in addition to the Derived PIV
Authentication private key and its corresponding certificate.

3.3.1.1 SD Card with Cryptographic Module

A Secure Digital (SD) Card is a non-volatile memory card format for use in portable devices such as
mobile phones and tablet computers. The SD format is available in three different physical sizes â€“
"original," "mini," and "micro." While any size is permissible for Derived PIV Credential issuance, the
microSD form factor is the most likely to be available for use within a mobile device.

A Derived PIV Application may reside on an SD Card implementation that includes an on-board secure
element or security system. An example of a security system is an implementation of the smartSD
standard, which describes a smart card element within an SD memory card.

The secure element used for the Derived PIV Application shall support an interface with the card
commands specified in Appendix B of this document. It should be noted that there is no widely adopted
interoperable standard transport mechanism for the APDUs, which may limit portability between devices.

3.3.1.2 Removable UICC with Cryptographic Module

The Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) configuration is based on the GlobalPlatform Card
Specification v2.2.1 [GP-SPEC]. The UICC configuration standardizes a minimum level of
interoperability for mobile products that support remote application management. UICC represents a new
generation Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card.

The UICC includes storage and processing, as well as input/output capabilities. Unlike the SIM card, the
UICC can also support a variety of other applications and services and multiple security domains.10 [GP-


10 A security domain is a protected area on a UICC. To this security domain are assigned applications, which can use

  cryptographic services it offers. By default only the security domain of the card issuer exists on a card. If another institution
