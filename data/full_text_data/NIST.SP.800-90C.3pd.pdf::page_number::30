      NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                             Recommendation for RBG Constructions
      September 2022

810   where bits_of_entropy is the amount of entropy requested, ES_output is a bitstring containing the
811   requested amount of entropy, and status indicates whether or not the request has been satisfied.
812   See Figure 7.

815   If the status indicates a success, a bitstring of at least bits_of_entropy long is returned as the
816   ES_output. ES_output must contain at least the requested amount of entropy indicated by the
817   bits_of_entropy input parameter. If the status does not indicate a success, an invalid ES_output
818   bitstring is returned (e.g., ES_output could be a null bitstring).

819   2.8.2.2.        The Get_ES_Bitstring Function
820   A single GetEntropy call may not be sufficient to obtain the entropy required for seeding and
821   reseeding a DRBG and for providing input for the exclusive-or operation in an RBG3(XOR)
822   construction (see Section 6.2). Therefore, SP 800-90C uses a Get_ES_Bitstring function (see
823   Figure 8) to obtain the required entropy from one or more GetEntropy calls. The
824   Get_ES_Bitstring function is invoked as follows:
825                    (status, entropy_bitstring) = Get_ES_Bitstring(bits_of_entropy),
826   where bits_of_entropy is the amount of entropy requested in the returned entropy_ bitstring, and
827   status indicates whether or not the request has been satisfied.

830   Note that if non-validated entropy sources are used (e.g., to provide entropy to be used as additional
831   input), they shall be accessed using a different function than is used to access validated entropy
832   sources (i.e., the Get_ES_Bitstring function).
833   If the returned status from the Get_ES_Bitstring function indicates a success, the requested
834   amount of entropy (i.e., indicated by bits_of_entropy) shall be returned in the entropy_bitstring,
835   whose length is equal to or greater than bits_of_entropy. If the status does not indicate a success,
836   an invalid entropy_bitstring shall be returned (e.g., entropy_bitstring is a null bitstring).
837   The Get_ES_Bitstring function will be used in this document to access validated entropy sources
838   to obtain one or more bitstrings with entropy using GetEntropy calls.
