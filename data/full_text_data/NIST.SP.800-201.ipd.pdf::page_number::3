57   Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be identified in this document in order to describe an
58   experimental procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply recommendation or
59   endorsement by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, nor is it intended to imply that the entities,
60   materials, or equipment are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

61   There may be references in this publication to other publications currently under development by NIST in
62   accordance with its assigned statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication, including concepts and
63   methodologies, may be used by federal agencies even before the completion of such companion publications. Thus,
64   until each publication is completed, current requirements, guidelines, and procedures, where they exist, remain
65   operative. For planning and transition purposes, federal agencies may wish to closely follow the development of
66   these new publications by NIST.

67   Organizations are encouraged to review all draft publications during public comment periods and provide feedback
68   to NIST. Many NIST cybersecurity publications, other than the ones noted above, are available at
