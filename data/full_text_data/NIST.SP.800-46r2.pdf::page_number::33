                                                                                                rely on such a system, they may not receive updates promptly if they are configured to get updates only
                                                                                                from the organization’s centralized patch management system. 29 For example, a user might connect a

                                                                                                The PC may be exposed to threats that could exploit its unpatched vulnerabilities, and patches would not

                                                                                                Another potential problem with keeping software updated is that remote access sessions may be brief,
                                                                                                particularly if the teleworker is on travel. This might preclude larger updates from being downloaded if
                                                                                                the software performing the updates does not permit updates to be downloaded in pieces.

                                                                                                Organizations should carefully consider these issues when planning how telework PCs will be kept
                                                                                                current with OS and application updates. Organizations should also encourage users to fully update their
                                                                                                telework PCs before taking them on travel or to other uncontrolled environments, which are generally
                                                                                                more likely to contain new threats than home networks.

                                                                                                 Have a separate user account with limited privileges for each person that will use the telework PC.
                                                                                                  Teleworkers should use their limited privilege accounts for regular work and use a separate
                                                                                                  administrative account only for tasks that require administrator-level access, such as some software
                                                                                                  updates. This reduces the likelihood of an attacker gaining administrator-level access to the PC.
                                                                                                 Enforce session locking, which prevents access to the PC after it has been idle for a period of time
                                                                                                  (such as 15 minutes) or permits the user to lock a session upon demand. After a session is locked,
                                                                                                  access to the PC can only be restored through authentication. Session locking is often part of screen-

                                                                                                  access to the current session. However, it does not thwart an attacker who steals a PC or has access to
                                                                                                  it for an extended period of time; session locking can be circumvented through various techniques.
