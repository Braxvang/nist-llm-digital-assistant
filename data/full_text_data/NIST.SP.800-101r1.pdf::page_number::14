lines of delineation are somewhat fuzzy and dynamic, the classification scheme nevertheless
serves as a general guide.

Both feature phones and smartphones support voice, text messaging, and a set of basic
Personal Information Management (PIM) type applications including phonebook and calendar
facilities. Smartphones add PC-like capability for running a wide variety of general and
special-purpose applications. Smartphones are typically larger than feature phones, support
higher video resolutions (e.g., ~300 PPI) and may have an integrated QWERTY keyboard or
touch sensitive screen. Smartphones generally support a wide array of applications, available
through an application storefront. Table 2 lists the differences in software capabilities found on
these device classes.
