     FOCUS AREA 5



     Increasing Awareness of Cybersecurity Resources
     A major element of NIST’s work in information security involves the publication of
     cybersecurity and privacy documents as well as engagement with public and private-
     sector communities. FY 2019 activities to increase and improve awareness included:
         •   The Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC), one of the most visited websites
             at NIST, provides a central resource for NIST cybersecurity and privacy publications,
             standards, and guidelines. The purpose of the CSRC is to encourage the broad
             sharing of information security tools and practices, provide a resource for
             information security standards and guidelines, and identify and link key security
             resources to support the industry. In FY 2019, the CSRC was updated to provide an
             enhanced search capability and a more consistent and modernized user interface.
         •   Cybersecurity for Small Businesses supports the small and medium-sized
             businesses (SMBs) that represent approximately 95% of all businesses and are
             often considered to be the backbone of the U.S. economy.4 Typically faced with
             limited budgets, SMBs need practical resources that enable them to understand
             and cost-effectively address their cybersecurity risks. NIST has been working on
             behalf of SMBs for many years, together with interagency and industry partners
             and collaborators. The NIST Small Business Cybersecurity Act codified the
             Institute’s focus on small businesses. Specifically, the statute directed NIST to
             “disseminate clear and concise resources to help small business concerns identify,
             assess, manage, and reduce their cybersecurity risks.” In FY 2018, the NIST Small
             Business Outreach Program began updating the Small Business Cybersecurity
             Corner website to make resources easier to find and use (https://www.nist.gov/
             itl/smallbusinesscyber). In FY 2019, those training materials and accompanying
             resources have been expanded, based on cybersecurity resources and feedback
             received from NIST’s federal partners and the public.
         •   The Federal Computer Security Program Managers (FCSM) Forum is an important
             component of improving cybersecurity awareness, training, and workforce
             development. FCSM is an informal NIST-sponsored group that promotes the sharing
             of system security information among U.S. federal, state, and higher education
             organizations. In FY 2019, FCSM conducted three half-day quarterly meetings and
             hosted a annual two-day off-site meeting to discuss current issues and items of
             interest with those responsible for protecting non-national security systems.

         The most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau, Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) Firm and Establishment
22       Data Tables, shows that 95.52 % of “firms” have between 1 and 49 employees and could be considered by many
         to be SMBs.
