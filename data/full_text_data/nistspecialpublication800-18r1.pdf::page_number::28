                    Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


3.6 Assignment of Security Responsibility
Within an agency, an individual must be assigned responsibility for each system. This
can be accomplished in many ways. In some agencies, the overall responsibility may be
delegated to the SAISO. Often, the SAISO is supported by a subnet of security officers
assigned to each major component. These security officers may be authorized to address
the security requirements for all systems within their domain of authority. Other models
may segment this responsibility in other ways based on agency structure and
responsibility. The same contact information, as listed under Section 3.3, should be
provided for these individuals. Most important is that this responsibility be formalized in
writing either in the employee's Position Description or by delegation Memorandum.


3.7 System Operational Status
Indicate one or more of the following for the system's operational status. If more than
one status is selected, list which part of the system is covered under each status.

   •   Operational — the system is in production.
   •   Under Development — the system is being designed, developed, or implemented.
   •   Undergoing a major modification — the system is undergoing a major conversion
       or transition.

If the system is under development or undergoing a major modification, provide
information about the methods used to assure that up-front security requirements are
included. Include specific controls in the appropriate sections of the plan depending on
where the system is in the security life cycle.


3.8 Information System Type
In this section of the plan, indicate whether the system is a major application or general
support system. If the system contains minor applications, describe them in the General
Description/Purpose section of the plan. If the agency has additional categories of
information system types, modify the template to include the other categories.


3.9 General Description/Purpose
Prepare a brief description (one to three paragraphs) of the function and purpose of the
system (e.g., economic indicator, network support for an agency, business census data
analysis, crop reporting support).

If the system is a general support system, list all applications supported by the general
support system. Specify if the application is or is not a major application and include
unique name/identifiers, where applicable. Describe each application's function and the
information processed. Include a list of user organizations, whether they are internal or
external to the system owner's agency.
