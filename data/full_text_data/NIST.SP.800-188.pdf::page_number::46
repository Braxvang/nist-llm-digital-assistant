No matter where de-identifcation is applied in the data life cycle, agencies should docu-
ment the answers to the following questions for each de-identifed dataset:
    • Are direct identifers collected with the dataset?
    • Even if direct identifers are not collected, is it still possible to identify the data
      subjects through the presence of quasi-identifers?
    • Where in the data life cycle is de-identifcation performed? Is it performed in only
      one place or in multiple places?
    • Is the original dataset retained after de-identifcation?
    • Is there a key or map retained so that specifc data elements can be re-identifed later?
    • How are decisions made regarding de-identifcation and re-identifcation?
    • Are there specifc datasets that can be used to re-identify the de-identifed data? If so,
      what controls are in place to prevent intentional or unintentional re-identifcation?
    • Is it a problem if some records in a dataset are re-identifed?
    • Is there a mechanism that will inform the de-identifying agency if there is an attempt
      to re-identify the de-identifed dataset? Is there a mechanism that will inform the
      agency if the attempt is successful?

3.4.   Data-Sharing Models
Agencies should decide on the data-sharing model that will be used to make the data avail-
able outside of the agency after the data have been de-identifed [66, p. 14]. Specifc
models combine security, privacy and disassociability techniques to reduce privacy risks
to individuals.
Here we use the term security to refer to techniques that limit who can view the data, and
privacy to refer to techniques that limit what information the data contains. Disassociability
is the degree to which the information in the data can be used while limiting the association
to individuals or devices beyond the operational requirements of the system. These con-
cepts can be considered independently. In practice, however, who has access to the data and
the degree to which the data are associated with individuals or devices makes a signifcant
difference to the expected risk of disclosure and, therefore, infuences the extent to which
privacy techniques must be used to limit the presence of sensitive personally identifable
information in the data.
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) symmetric encryption algorithm, which is one
of several traditional encryption algorithms, is an example of a security technique since it
allows only the party holding the encryption key to view the data. However, advanced cryp-
tographic techniques that combine secure multiparty cryptography with the application of
