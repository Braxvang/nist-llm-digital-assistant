                                                                  GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6




6.7     Other Transition Mechanisms

Dual stack operation, tunneling, and translation help to provide interoperability between IPv4 and IPv6
nodes while the transition to IPv6 is taking place. Other possible methods exist:

          Host-based translation is possible by modification of application layer software or network
           layer protocols. This approach is not common, perhaps because if the changes needed for
           translation could be made, a dual stack system could be implemented just as simply instead.
          VLANs or MPLS can carry IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. These approaches are viable ways to use
           Layer 2 technology instead of Layer 3 encapsulation, potentially reducing overhead. A
           downside is that Layer 2 technology cannot be routed effectively. All of the security concerns
           remain, so it is just as important in this case to ensure that security policy applies equally for
           IPv4 and IPv6.
          SSL/TLS encapsulation of IPv6 has been implemented and is available as a secure tunneling
           technology. The advantage of this approach is good security between tunnel endpoints. The
           disadvantage is that many of the properties of IP are lost by forcing it to run over TCP, and
           typical SSL/TLS mechanisms are oriented towards client-server systems rather than peer-to-
           peer networking.
6.8     The IPv6 Deployment Planning Process for Security

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) developed the Enterprise Architecture Assessment
Framework67 to help organizations transitioning to IPv6. The deployment of IPv6-enabled equipment is a
small part of the OMB framework. In the framework, most of the tasks deal with documenting the
environment, communicating the transition both internally and externally, and making the strategic
decisions. The framework outlines high-level tasks that should be accomplished during the transition
effort:

          Conduct a requirements analysis to identify the current scope of IPv6 within an organization,
           current challenges using IPv4, and target requirements.
          Develop a sequencing plan for IPv6 implementation, integrated with the organization’s
           Enterprise Architecture.
          Develop IPv6-related policies and enforcement mechanisms.
          Develop training material for stakeholders.
          Develop and implement a test plan for IPv6 compatibility/interoperability.
          Deploy IPv6 using a phased approach.
          Maintain and monitor networks.
          Update IPv6 requirements and target architecture on an ongoing basis.
The Architecture Assessment Framework can also be used to measure an organization’s progression from
an IPv4 operational environment to an IPv6 operational environment. Although the framework is not a

      OMB, Enterprise Architecture Assessment Framework (EAAF).
