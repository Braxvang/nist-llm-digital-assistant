Special Publication 800-73-4         Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification – Part 1: PIV
                                  Card Application Namespace, Data Model and Representation

The X.509 Certificate for Content Signing shall be a digital signature certificate issued under the id-
fpki-common-piv-contentSigning policy of [COMMON]. The X.509 Certificate for Content Signing
shall also include an extended key usage (extKeyUsage) extension asserting id-PIV-content-signing.
Additional descriptions for the PIV object identifiers are provided in Appendix B of FIPS 201-2. The
X.509 Certificate for Content Signing needed to verify the digital signature of a secure messaging
CVC or Intermediate CVC of a valid PIV Card 10 shall not be expired.

Note that the option to include an Intermediate CVC is included as a temporary measure to
accommodate the use of certification authorities that do not support the issuance of X.509 certificates
that contain elliptic curve subject public keys. It is expected that the Intermediate CVC data element
will be deprecated in a future version of SP 800-73.

3.3.8     Pairing Code Reference Data Container

The Pairing Code Reference Data Container, which shall be present if the PIV Card supports the
virtual contact interface, includes a copy of the PIV Card’s pairing code (see Section 5.1.3). The
Security Object enforces integrity of the Pairing Code Reference Data Container according to the
issuer.

3.4     Inclusion of Universally Unique IDentifiers (UUIDs)

This specification provides support for two UUIDs on a PIV Card. The Card UUID is a UUID that is
unique for each card, and it shall be present on all PIV Cards. The Cardholder UUID is a UUID that
is a persistent identifier for the cardholder, and it is optional to implement. The requirements for these
UUIDs are provided in the following subsections.

3.4.1     Card UUID

FIPS 201 requires PIV Cards to include a Card UUID. The Card UUID shall be included on PIV
Cards as follows:

      1. The value of the GUID data element of the CHUID data object shall be a 16-byte binary
         representation of a valid UUID [RFC4122]. The UUID shall be version 1, 4, or 5, as specified
         in [RFC4122, Section 4.1.3].

      2. The same 16-byte binary representation of the UUID value shall be present as the value of an
         entryUUID attribute, as defined in [RFC4530], in any CMS-signed data object that is
         required to contain a pivFASC-N attribute on a PIV Card, i.e., in the mandatory cardholder
         fingerprint template and facial image data objects as well as in the optional cardholder iris
         images data object when present.

      3. If the PIV Card supports secure messaging, then the same 16-byte binary representation of
         the UUID value shall be used as the Subject Identifier in the secure messaging CVC, as
         specified in Part 2, Section 4.1.5.

      4. The string representation of the same UUID value shall be present in the X.509 Certificate for
         PIV Authentication and the X.509 Certificate for Card Authentication, in the subjectAltName
         extension encoded as a URI, as specified by [RFC4122, Section 3].


10 A valid PIV Card is defined as a PIV Card that is neither expired nor revoked.
