2.        PIV Card Reader Requirements


2.1       PIV Contact Card Reader (Logical Access)

2.1.1       Application Programming Interface (API)
The reader shall be Personal Computer Smart Card (PC/SC) conformant when used with corresponding drivers
for the host Operating System Platform.
The reader, in conjunction with its corresponding driver, should handle the Application Protocol Data Unit
(APDU) exchange with T=0 for case 4 commands (e.g., GET DATA, GENERATE ASYMMETRIC KEY
PAIR) by reading all data from the card. In other words, the reader in conjunction with its corresponding driver
should process all APDUs from the card consisting of SW1 = ‘61’ and SW2 = Number of bytes in the buffer,
and should not transmit these APDUs through the PC/SC API to the software implementing the client-
application programming interface (middleware).

2.1.2       Application Protocol Data Unit (APDU) Support
At a minimum, the contact interface shall support all card commands for contact based access specified in
Section 7, End-point PIV Card Application Card Command Interface of SP 800-73-1, Interfaces for Personal
Identity Verification.

2.1.3       Buffer Size
The reader must contain a buffer large enough to receive the maximum size frame permitted by International
Organization for Standardization International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 7816-3:1997, Section
9.4.

2.1.4       Programming Voltage
PIV Readers shall not generate a Programming Voltage.

2.1.5       Support for Operating Class
PIV Readers shall support cards with Class A Vccs as defined in ISO/IEC 7816-3:1997 and ISO/IEC 7816-
3:1997/Amd 1:2002.

2.1.6       Retrieval Time
Retrieval time1 for 12.5 kilobytes (KB) of data through the contact interface of the reader shall not exceed 2.0
seconds.

2.1.7       Transmission Protocol
The PIV Reader shall support both the character-based T=0 protocol and block-based T=1 protocol as defined in
ISO/IEC 7816-3:1997.

    The time to retrieve a specified amount of data does not include activation/deactivation time.
