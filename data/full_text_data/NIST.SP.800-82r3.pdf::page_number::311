 SI-8 (2)   SPAM PROTECTION | AUTOMATIC UPDATES                               Remove      Remove

OT Discussion: OT organizations implement spam protection by removing spam transport
mechanisms, functions, and services (e.g., electronic mail, web browsing) from the OT.
Rationale for removing SI-8 (2) from MOD and HIGH baselines: Spam transport mechanisms
are disabled or removed from the OT, so automatic updates are not necessary.
