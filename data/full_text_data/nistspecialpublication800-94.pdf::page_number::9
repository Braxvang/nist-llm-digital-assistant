                                                              GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



Executive Summary

Intrusion detection is the process of monitoring the events occurring in a computer system or network and
analyzing them for signs of possible incidents, which are violations or imminent threats of violation of
computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices. Intrusion prevention is
the process of performing intrusion detection and attempting to stop detected possible incidents. Intrusion
detection and prevention systems (IDPS) 1 are primarily focused on identifying possible incidents, logging
information about them, attempting to stop them, and reporting them to security administrators. In
addition, organizations use IDPSs for other purposes, such as identifying problems with security policies,
documenting existing threats, and deterring individuals from violating security policies. IDPSs have
become a necessary addition to the security infrastructure of nearly every organization.

IDPSs typically record information related to observed events, notify security administrators of important
observed events, and produce reports. Many IDPSs can also respond to a detected threat by attempting to
prevent it from succeeding. They use several response techniques, which involve the IDPS stopping the
attack itself, changing the security environment (e.g., reconfiguring a firewall), or changing the attack’s
content.

This publication describes the characteristics of IDPS technologies and provides recommendations for
designing, implementing, configuring, securing, monitoring, and maintaining them. The types of IDPS
technologies are differentiated primarily by the types of events that they monitor and the ways in which
they are deployed. This publication discusses the following four types of IDPS technologies:

 Network-Based, which monitors network traffic for particular network segments or devices and
  analyzes the network and application protocol activity to identify suspicious activity
 Wireless, which monitors wireless network traffic and analyzes it to identify suspicious activity
  involving the wireless networking protocols themselves
 Network Behavior Analysis (NBA), which examines network traffic to identify threats that generate
  unusual traffic flows, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, certain forms of malware,
  and policy violations (e.g., a client system providing network services to other systems)
 Host-Based, which monitors the characteristics of a single host and the events occurring within that
  host for suspicious activity.
Implementing the following recommendations should facilitate more efficient and effective intrusion
detection and prevention system use for Federal departments and agencies.

Organizations should ensure that all IDPS components are secured appropriately.

Securing IDPS components is very important because IDPSs are often targeted by attackers who want to
prevent the IDPSs from detecting attacks or want to gain access to sensitive information in the IDPSs,
such as host configurations and known vulnerabilities. IDPSs are composed of several types of
components, including sensors or agents, management servers, database servers, user and administrator
consoles, and management networks. All components’ operating systems and applications should be kept
fully up-to-date, and all software-based IDPS components should be hardened against threats. Specific

    An intrusion detection system (IDS) is software that automates the intrusion detection process. An intrusion prevention system
    (IPS) is software that has all the capabilities of an intrusion detection system and can also attempt to stop possible incidents.
    IDS and IPS technologies offer many of the same capabilities, and administrators can usually disable prevention features in
    IPS products, causing them to function as IDSs. Accordingly, for brevity the term intrusion detection and prevention system
    (IDPS) is used throughout the rest of this guide to refer to both IDS and IPS technologies.
