7.3       Operational View

Proprietary cloud providers do not release detailed technical information about their system architectures
or algorithms; however, three Open Source systems (Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud [War09], NASA Nebula
[Nas10], Eucalyptus [Nur08, Nur08-2], all based on the Eucalyptus source code provide detailed technical
information about specific system architectures.13 This section presents a logical view of IaaS cloud
structure and operation. This logical view has been substantially informed by documentation from the
Eucalyptus and Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud projects; 14 however, the informal model presented here is more
abstract and general. This model is based on intuitive constraints of the provisioning of IaaS cloud
services: IaaS clouds must provide the resources described above with both performance and cost
efficiency while maintaining centralized control and the capability to scale up without disrupting service.
These constraints imply a natural three-level hierarchy in IaaS cloud systems, with the top level
responsible for central control, the middle level responsible for management of possibly large computer
clusters that may be geographically distant from one another, and the bottom level responsible for running
the host computer systems on which virtual machines are created.

Figure 17 illustrates this layered and abstract model. At the top layer is the Cloud Manager with
responsibility for user accounts and high-level allocation of resources within the overall cloud. At the
mid-layer are Cluster Managers with responsibility over large numbers of computers and their
interconnection, as well as local storage. At the bottom layer are the Computer Managers with
responsibility over VMs running on individual computers. A specific implementation may split up and
parallelize some components for performance reasons, may introduce more intermediary layers for
additional coordination, or may locate storage on networks different from the ones indicated in the model.

IaaS clouds are computing systems for dynamic resource renting; consumer queries and commands
generally flow into the system at the top and are forwarded down through the layers that either answer the
queries or execute the commands. Status reports flow in the reverse direction back to the consumer.

     Other open source projects, some not based on Eucalyptus, are in progress as well.
