790   5.2.2. Dynamic Registration
791   In the dynamic registration model of federation, it is possible for relationships between
792   members of the federation to be negotiated at the time of a transaction. This process
793   allows IdPs and RPs to be connected together without manually establishing a connection
794   between them using manual registration (See Sec. 5.2.1). IdPs that support dynamic
795   registration SHALL make their configuration information (such as dynamic registration
796   endpoints) available in such a way as to minimize system administrator involvement.




                                    Figure 5. Dynamic Registration

797   As shown in Figure 5, dynamic registration involves four steps:
798      1. Discover. The RP goes to a well-known location at the IdP to find the IdP’s
799         metadata.
800      2. Validate. The RP and IdP determine each other’s validity. This can be
801         accomplished through keying information, metadata, software statements, or other
802         means.
803      3. Register RP attributes. The RP sends its attributes to the IdP, and the IdP associates
804         those attributes with the RP.
805      4. Federation Protocol. The IdP and RP then communicate using a standard federation
806         protocol.
807   Protocols requiring the transfer of keying information SHALL use a secure method
808   during the registration process to establish such keying information needed to operate
809   the federated relationship, including any shared secrets or public keys. Any symmetric
810   keys used in this relationship SHALL be unique to a pair of federation participants.
