For example, CDRs will contain information such as: sender and receiver phone numbers,
time and duration of the call, call type (i.e., voice, SMS), etc. CDRs may be obtained from
U.S. service providers through their law enforcement point of contact, with the appropriate
legal documentation. Procedures may vary among states in the U.S., and new laws regarding
proper seizure are continually legislated. Procedures also vary for getting records from service
providers and network operators located in other countries. Close and continuing consultation
with legal counsel is advised. Various online law enforcement forums can also be helpful in
identifying points of contact and sharing tips on procedures for accurately obtaining the
required data.24

Besides call detail records, subscriber records maintained by a service provider can provide
data useful in an investigation. For example, for GSM systems, the database usually contains
the following information about each customer [Wil03]:

         Customer name and address

         Billing name and address (if other than customer)

         User name and address (if other than customer)

         Billing account details

         Telephone number (MSISDN)

         IMSI

         UICC serial number (ICCID)

         PIN/PUK for the UICC

         Services allowed

Other useful information, including phone numbers (i.e., work or home), contact information
(e.g., email address), and credit card numbers used, may also be retained in subscriber records.
Pay-as-you-go prepaid phones purchased anonymously over the counter may also have useful
information maintained with their accounts, which was supplied by the subscribers, such as the
credit card numbers used for purchases of additional time or an email address registered online
for receipt of notifications. Gaining access to the call records of prepaid phones should not be
ruled out.

CDRs and other records maintained by the service provider can be requested using subscriber
or equipment identifier information seized or acquired from a mobile device or UICC.
Subscriber information often used for this purpose includes the IMSI from the UICC and the
mobile device number (i.e., MSISDN). Equipment identifiers used are the ESN or IMEI of the
phone and the serial number (i.e., ICCID) of the UICC. The search criteria used could be, for
example, all calls received by a certain phone number (e.g., that of a victim) or all calls
handled by a base station responsible for a particular cell (i.e., to determine who was in a
