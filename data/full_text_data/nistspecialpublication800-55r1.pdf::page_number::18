3.     INFORMATION SECURITY MEASURES BACKGROUND

This section provides basic information on what information security measures are and why
information security performance should be measured. Additionally, this section defines types
of measures that can be used; discusses the key aspects of making an information security
measurement program successful; and identifies the uses of measures for management, reporting,
and decision making.

3.1    Definition

Information security measures are used to facilitate decision making and improve performance
and accountability through the collection, analysis, and reporting of relevant performance-related
data. The purpose of measuring performance is to monitor the status of measured activities and
facilitate improvement in those activities by applying corrective actions based on observed
measurements.

Information security measures can be obtained at different levels within an organization.
Detailed measures, collected at the information system level, can be aggregated and rolled up to
progressively higher levels, depending on the size and complexity of an organization. While a
case can be made for using different terms for more detailed and aggregated items, such as
“metrics” and “measures,” this document standardizes on “measures” to mean the results of data
collection, analysis, and reporting. This document refers to the process of data collection,
analysis, and reporting as “measurement.”

Information security measures are based on information security performance goals and
objectives. Information security performance goals state the desired results of an information or
security program implementation, such as, “All employees should receive adequate information
security awareness training.” Information security performance objectives enable
accomplishment of goals by identifying practices defined by information security policies and
procedures that direct consistent implementation of security controls across the organization.
Examples of information security performance objectives, corresponding to the example goal
cited above, are: All new employees receive new employee training. Employee training includes
a summary of the Rules of Behavior. Employee training includes a summary of, and a reference
to, the organization’s information security policies and procedures.

Information security measures monitor the accomplishment of goals and objectives by
quantifying the implementation, efficiency, and effectiveness of security controls; analyzing the
adequacy of information security program activities; and identifying possible improvement
actions. During measures development, goals and objectives from federal guidelines, legislation,
regulations, and enterprise-level guidance are identified and prioritized to ensure that the
measurable aspects of information security performance correspond to the operational priorities
of the organization.

Information security measures must yield quantifiable information for comparison purposes,
apply formulas for analysis, and track changes using the same points of reference. Percentages
