The approach to establishing mission-based information types at an agency level begins by
documenting the agency’s business and mission areas. The owner, or designee, of each
information system is responsible for identifying the information types stored in, processed by,
or generated by that information system. In the case of mission-based information, the
responsible individuals, in coordination with management, operational, and security
stakeholders, should compile a comprehensive set of lines of business and mission areas
conducted by the agency. In addition, the responsible individuals should identify the applicable
sub-functions necessary to conduct agency business and in turn accomplish the agency’s
mission. For example, one mission conducted by an agency might be law enforcement. Sub-
functions that are part of the agency’s law enforcement mission might include criminal
investigation and surveillance, criminal apprehension, criminal incarceration, citizen protection,
crime prevention, and property protection. Each of these sub-functions would represent an
information type.
Recommended mission-based lines of business and constituent sub-functions that may be
processed by information systems are identified in Table 4 with details provided in Volume II,
Appendix D, “Examples of Impact Determination for Mission-based Information and
Information Systems.”


                                               Implementation Tip
               At the agency level, all government agencies perform at least one of the
               mission areas and employ at least one of the services delivery
               mechanisms described in Table 4. However, some information systems
               may only provide a supporting role to the agency’s mission and not
               directly process any of the mission-based information types.


4.1.2    Identification of Management and Support Information

Much Federal government information and many supporting information systems are not
employed directly to provide direct mission-based services, but are primarily intended to support
delivery of services or to manage resources. The support delivery of services and management of
resources business areas are together composed of 13 lines of business (Tables 5 and 6). The
