Special Publication 800-73-4          Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification â€“ Part 1: PIV
                                   Card Application Namespace, Data Model and Representation


5.       Data Types and Their Representation

This section provides a description of the data types used in the PIV Client Application Programming
Interface (SP 800-73-4, Part 3) and PIV Card Command Interface (SP 800-73-4, Part 2). Unless
otherwise indicated, the representation shall be the same on both interfaces.

The data types are defined in Part 1, rather than in Parts 2 and 3 in order to achieve smart card
platform independence from Part 1. Thus, non-government smart card programs can readily adopt the
interface specifications in Parts 2 and 3 while customizing Part 1 to their own data model, data types,
and namespaces. 14

5.1      Key References

A key reference is a one-byte reference data identifier that specifies a cryptographic key or PIN
according to its PIV Key Type. Tables 4a and 4b and SP 800-78, Table 6-1, define the key reference
values that shall be used on the PIV interfaces. The key reference values are used, for example, in a
cryptographic protocol such as an authentication or a signing protocol. Key references are only
assigned to private and secret (symmetric) keys, PINs, PIN Unblocking Key (PUK), OCC, and the
pairing code. All other PIV Card Application key reference values are reserved for future use.

14 A customized Part 1 data model exists in the PIV-Interoperable card (PIV-I card) specification as defined in [PIV-I NFI]

and further clarified in [PIV-I FAQ]. The intent of [PIV-I NFI] is to enable issuers to issue cards that are technically
interoperable with Federal PIV Card readers and their applications, and that may be trusted for particular purposes at the
discretion of the relying Federal departments and agencies. PIV-I cards use the same namespace and data types as PIV
Cards, however, the data model is slightly different since some of the ASN.1 OIDs that appear in PIV certificates are
specific to PIV Cards and since non-Federal issuers do not have Agency Codes assigned to them, which means that they are
unable to create unique FASC-N identifiers for the cards they issue. As a result, [PIV-I FAQ] requires the first 14 digits of
the FASC-Ns for PIV-I cards (the Agency Code, System Code, and Credential Number) to be populated with all nines.
15 The sole use of the pairing code is the establishment of a VCI. Its use over the contact interface serves no purpose.
