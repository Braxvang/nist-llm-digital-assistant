Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1                  Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems

3.2 SECURITY CATEGORIZATION
FIPS 199, the mandatory federal security categorization standard, is predicated on a simple and
well-established concept—determining appropriate priorities for organizational information
systems and subsequently applying appropriate measures to adequately protect those systems.
The security controls applied to a particular information system should be commensurate with the
potential impact on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals should there
be a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. FIPS 199 requires organizations to
categorize their information systems as low-impact, moderate-impact, or high-impact for the
security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The potential impact values
assigned to the respective security objectives are the highest values (i.e., high water mark) from
among the security categories that have been determined for each type of information resident on
those information systems. 36 The generalized format for expressing the security category (SC) of
an information system is:
          SC information system = {(confidentiality, impact), (integrity, impact), (availability, impact)},
                    where the acceptable values for potential impact are low, moderate, or high.

Since the potential impact values for confidentiality, integrity, and availability may not always be
the same for a particular information system, the high water mark concept is used to determine
the impact level of the information system for the express purpose of selecting an initial set of
security controls from one of the three security control baselines. 37 Thus, a low-impact system is
defined as an information system in which all three of the security objectives are low. A
moderate-impact system is an information system in which at least one of the security objectives
is moderate and no security objective is greater than moderate. And finally, a high-impact system
is an information system in which at least one security objective is high.

                                                  Implementation Tip
  To determine the overall impact level of the information system:
  •    First, determine the different types of information that are processed, stored, or transmitted by the
       information system (e.g., financial sector oversight, inspections and auditing, official information
       dissemination, etc.). NIST Special Publication 800-60 provides guidance on a variety of information
       types commonly used by organizations.
  •    Second, using the impact levels in FIPS 199 and the recommendations of NIST Special Publication
       800-60, categorize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of each information type as low,
       moderate, or high impact.
  •    Third, determine the information system security categorization, that is, the highest impact level for
       each security objective (confidentiality, integrity, availability) from among the categorizations for the
       information types associated with the information system.
  •    Fourth, determine the overall impact level of the information system from the highest impact level
       among the three security objectives in the system security categorization.

   NIST Special Publication 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security
Categories, provides guidance on the assignment of security categories to information systems.
37
   The high water mark concept is employed because there are significant dependencies among the security objectives
of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In most cases, a compromise in one security objective ultimately affects
the other security objectives as well. Accordingly, the security controls in the control catalog are not categorized by
security objective—rather, they are grouped into baselines to provide a general protection capability for classes of
information systems based on impact level. The application of scoping guidance may allow selective security control
baseline tailoring (see Section 3.3).
