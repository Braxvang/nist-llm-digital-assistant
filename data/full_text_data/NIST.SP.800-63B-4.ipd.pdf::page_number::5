98    The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
99    Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
100   leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops
101   tests, test methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical
102   analyses to advance the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s
103   responsibilities include the development of management, administrative, technical, and
104   physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of other
105   than national security-related information in federal information systems. The Special
106   Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in
107   information system security, and its collaborative activities with industry, government,
108   and academic organizations.

109   Abstract

110   These guidelines provide technical requirements for federal agencies implementing
111   digital identity services and are not intended to constrain the development or use of
112   standards outside of this purpose. These guidelines focus on the authentication of
113   subjects interacting with government information systems over networks, establishing
114   that a given claimant is a subscriber who has been previously authenticated. The
115   result of the authentication process may be used locally by the system performing
116   the authentication or may be asserted elsewhere in a federated identity system. This
117   document defines technical requirements for each of the three authenticator assurance
118   levels. This publication will supersede NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-63B.

123   Note to Reviewers

124   The rapid proliferation of online services over the past few years has heightened the need
125   for reliable, equitable, secure, and privacy-protective digital identity solutions.
126   Revision 4 of NIST Special Publication 800-63 Digital Identity Guidelines intends to
127   respond to the changing digital landscape that has emerged since the last major revision
128   of this suite was published in 2017 — including the real-world implications of online
129   risks. The guidelines present the process and technical requirements for meeting digital
130   identity management assurance levels for identity proofing, authentication, and federation,
