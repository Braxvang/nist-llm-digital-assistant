2040   10.2.3. User Mental Models and Beliefs
2041   Users’ beliefs and perceptions predispose them to expect certain results and to behave in
2042   certain ways. Such beliefs, perceptions, and predispositions are referred to in the social
2043   sciences as mental models. For example, people have a mental model of dining out which
2044   guides their behavior and expectations at each establishment, such as fast food restaurants,
2045   cafeterias, and more formal restaurants. Thus, it is not necessary to be familiar with every
2046   establishment to understand how to interact appropriately at each one.
2047   Assisting users in establishing good and complete mental models of federation allows
2048   users to generalize beyond a single specific implementation. If federated identity systems
2049   are not designed from users’ perspectives, users may form incorrect or incomplete mental
2050   models that impact their willingness to adopt these systems. The following factors should
2051   be considered:
2052       • Clearly explain the working relationship and information flow among the
2053         transacting parties (e.g., RPs, IdPs, and brokers) to avoid user misconceptions.
2054         Use the actual names of the entities in the explanation rather than using the generic
2055         terms IdPs and RPs.
2056            – Provide prominent visual cues and information so that users understand why
2057              seemingly unrelated entities have a working relationship. For example, users
2058              may be concerned with mixing online personal activities with government
2059              services due to a lack of understanding of the information flow in federated
2060              identity systems.
2061            – Provide prominent visual cues and information to users about redirection
2062              when an RP needs to redirect control from their site to an IdP. For example,
2063              display RP branding within the IdP user interface to inform users when they
2064              are logging in with their IdP for access to the destination RP.
2065       • Provide users with clear and usable ways (e.g., visual assurance) to determine the
2066         authenticity of the transacting parties (e.g., RPs, IdPs, and brokers). This will also
2067         help to alleviate user concern over leaving one domain for another, especially if the
2068         root domain changes (e.g., .gov to .com). For example, display the URL of the IdP
2069         so that the user can verify that they are not being phished by a malicious site.
2070       • Provide users with clear information, including visual cues, regarding implicit
2071         logins and explicit logouts. Depending on the implementation, logging into an
2072         RP with a federated account may authenticate users to both the IdP and RP. Users
2073         may not realize that ending their session with the RP will not necessarily end their
2074         session with the IdP; users will need to explicitly “log out” of the IdP. Users require
2075         clear information to remind them if explicit logouts are required to end their IdP
2076         sessions.
