Special Publication 800-73-4                             Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification – Part 2:

with a credential that can be used to authenticate the entity. The security status indicator of an
authenticable entity shall be TRUE if the credentials associated with the security status indicator of the
authenticable entity have been authenticated and FALSE otherwise.

A successful execution of an authentication protocol shall set the security status indicator associated with
the credential used in the protocol to TRUE. An aborted or failed execution of an authentication protocol
shall set the security status indicator associated with the credential used in the protocol to FALSE.

As an example, the credentials associated with three security status indicators of the cardholder might be:
PIN, fingerprint, and pairing code. Demonstration of knowledge of the PIN is the authentication protocol
for the first security status indicator wherein the PIN is the credential. Comparison of the fingerprint
template on the card with a fingerprint acquired from the cardholder is the authentication protocol for the
second security status indicator wherein the fingerprint is the credential. Demonstration of knowledge of
the pairing code is the authentication protocol for the third security status indicator wherein the pairing
code is the credential. A security condition using these three security status indicators might be “pairing
code AND (PIN OR fingerprint).”

A security status indicator shall be said to be a global security status indicator if it is not changed when
the currently selected application changes from one application to another. In essence, when changing
from one application to another, the global security status indicators shall remain unchanged.

A security status indicator is said to be an application security status indicator if it is set to FALSE when
the currently selected application changes from one application to another. Every security status indicator
is either a global security status indicator or an application security status indicator. The security status
indicators associated with the PIV Card Application PIN, the PIN Unblocking Key (PUK), OCC, pairing
code, and the PIV Card Application Administration Key are application security status indicators for the
PIV Card Application, whereas the security status indicator associated with the Global PIN is a global
security status indicator.

The term global security status refers to the set of all global security status indicators. The term
application security status refers to the set of all application security status indicators for a specific
application.

  2.4.3    Authentication of an Individual

Knowledge of a PIN is the means by which an individual can be authenticated to the PIV Card
Application.

The pairing code shall be exactly 8 bytes in length and the PIV Card Application PIN shall be between 6
and 8 bytes in length. If the actual length of PIV Card Application PIN is less than 8 bytes it shall be
padded to 8 bytes with 'FF' when presented to the card command interface. The 'FF' padding bytes shall
be appended to the actual value of the PIN. The bytes comprising the PIV Card Application PIN and
pairing code shall be limited to values 0x30 – 0x39, the ASCII values for the decimal digits '0' – '9'. For
example,

    +     Actual PIV Card Application PIN: “123456” or '31 32 33 34 35 36'
    +     Padded PIV Card Application PIN presented to the card command interface: '31 32 33 34 35 36
          FF FF'
The PIV Card Application shall enforce the minimum length requirement of six bytes for the PIV Card
Application PIN (i.e., shall verify that at least the first six bytes of the value presented to the card
