89    Organization-defined parameters (ODPs) are included for some requirements. These ODPs
90    provide flexibility through the use of assignment and selection operations to allow federal
91    agencies and nonfederal organizations to specify values for the designated parameters in the
92    requirements. 14 Assignment and selection operations provide the capability to customize the
93    security requirements based on specific protection needs. The determination of organization-
94    defined parameter values can be guided and informed by laws, Executive Orders, directives,
95    regulations, policies, standards, guidance, or mission and business needs. Once specified, the
96    values for the organization-defined parameters become part of the requirement.

 97   A discussion section is included with each requirement. It is derived from the control discussion
 98   sections in NIST SP 800-53 and provides additional information to facilitate the implementation
 99   and assessment of the requirements. The discussion section is informative, not normative. It is
100   not intended to extend the scope of a requirement or to influence the solutions that organizations
101   may use to satisfy a requirement. The use of examples is notional, not exhaustive and not
102   reflective of potential options available to organizations. A references section provides the
103   source controls from NIST SP 800-53 and a list of NIST Special Publications with additional
104   information on the topic described in the security requirement. 15

105   The structure and content of a typical security requirement is provided in the example below:

106   3.13.11 Cryptographic Protection
107                  REQUIREMENT: 03.13.11
108                  Implement the following types of cryptography when used to protect the confidentiality of CUI:
109                  [Assignment: organization-defined types of cryptography].

110                  DISCUSSION
111                  Cryptography is implemented in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
112                  regulations, standards, and guidelines.

         NIST does not establish or assign values for ODPs. If ODP values for selected security requirements are not formally established or assigned
      by a federal agency or a consortium of federal agencies, nonfederal organizations assign those values to complete the requirements.

         Unless specified in federal policy, the guidance in supporting NIST publications in the references section is informative, not normative.
