NIST SP 800-58                                              Voice Over IP Security

      only one bit of delay as the cipher stream is applied. Block ciphers may require
      one block of delay, which will vary with the method used, but still require
      relatively little overhead.

      More significant delays are introduced by computing HMAC hash valures for
      authentication. HMAC is used with secret key hash functions, such as MD5 or
      SHA-1. HMAC-MD5 produces a 128-bit message authentication code (MAC),
      while HMAC-SHA-1 will produce a 160-bit MAC. Because the HMAC
      operation must wait for a full block of data to arrive before processing, these
      operations can produce significant latency delays. On arrival, the reverse
      operations must be applied, introducing further performance delays.

      In most applications, authentication and integrity are equally, or more, important
      than encryption, but with voice processing for human speakers, some
      authentication is normally built-in because parties recognize the person on the
      other end of the conversation. Even if the conversation is with a stranger, concern
      with source authentication applies primarily to call setup, rather than to the
      authentication of voice packets in the midst of a conversation. As a result of these
      considerations, some designers may consider HMAC less important for secure
      VOIP than call encryption, and may limit HMAC use if performance is a
      problem.
