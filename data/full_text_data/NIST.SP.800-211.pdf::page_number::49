  •   Computer Forensic Reference Data Sets (CFReDS) – The CFReDS is a repository of
      various documented sets of digital evidence. In FY 2019, CFReDS was updated to
      include five Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) and nine Chip-Off mobile device binary
      images, string search test data for use with Federated Testing 4.0 and later, and 19
      drone forensic images.
  •   Forensics Tool Catalog – The Forensics Tool Catalog is a web-based community-
      sourced catalog of forensic tools aided by a taxonomy of forensic tools. The
      Tool Catalog grew by two functionalities (Live Response and Incident Response
      Forensic Tracking and Reporting) and 63 new tool entries for a total of 315 tools in
      FY 2019.


National Software Reference Library (NSRL)
The NSRL is designed to collect software from various sources and incorporate the file
profiles computed from this software into a Reference Data Set (RDS) of information.
The RDS can be used by law enforcement, government, and industry to review computer
files by matching file profiles in the RDS. This will help alleviate much of the effort
involved in determining which files are important as evidence on computers or file
systems that have been seized as part of criminal investigations. The NSRL also provides
a research environment to promote the development of new forensics techniques and
other applications in computer science.
In FY 2019, the NSRL published four releases of software metadata and enlarged the
collection to contain a combined total of 544 million files from 30,000 microcomputer
applications; 169,000 mobile device applications; and 3,700 gaming platform
applications. The NSRL was also expanded to include applications that were distributed
through gaming platforms and the profiles obtained from installing and updating
common operating systems.
