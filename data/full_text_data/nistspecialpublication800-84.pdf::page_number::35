6.      Tests

Tests are evaluation tools that use quantifiable metrics or expected outcomes to validate the operability of
one or more IT systems or system components (e.g., operating system, application, pager, Blackberry)
that are identified as critical in an IT plan. 20 Tests can take several forms, including the following:

       Component testing is testing individual hardware or software components, or groups of related
        components. A component test also might test processes and procedures that are part of any of
        the organization’s IT plans. The testing of hardware or software components at the conclusion of
        their development should also be conducted, but this is not within the scope of this document.
        Component testing in this document is concerned with individual components already operational
        that are critical to the effective operation of the organization that they should be regularly tested.
       System testing is testing complete systems to evaluate each system’s compliance with specified
        requirements. A system test should also include an examination of any processes or procedures
        related to the system being tested.
       Comprehensive testing is testing all systems and components that support an IT plan. These
        tests generally involve multiple components and systems and may become quite extensive in their
        scope. An example of a comprehensive test is confirming that IT operations can be restored at a
        backup site in the event of an extended power failure at the primary site.
A test is conducted in as close to an operational environment as possible, which means that the test should
be conducted in a manner that resembles the everyday work environment in which the system or
component is found. If feasible, an actual test of the components or systems used to conduct daily
operations for the organization should be used. Tests can potentially be disruptive to an organization’s
operations, so tests are sometimes performed on systems that mimic the actual operational systems,
especially if there is not strong confidence that the tests will be completely successful.

This section provides guidance on evaluating the need for testing; creating a test plan; and designing,
developing, conducting, and evaluating a test. The section then summarizes the key elements to consider
during a test and after conducting a test. Appendix C provides test documentation examples, including a
test plan, a test briefing, test validation and evaluation worksheets, and an after action report.

6.1     Evaluate the Need for a Test and Create a Schedule

As part of the TT&E program, the program coordinator should routinely determine the need for a test by
considering the organization’s overall objectives for conducting a test and answering questions such as
the following:

       Is the system or component to be tested installed and ready for operational use?
       Are the processes and procedures for the system or component established?
       Have the personnel been trained on the use of the system or component? Was the training
        effective?

      The testing described in this publication should not be confused with testing performed in support of system certification
      and accreditation (C&A) efforts. Testing for C&A focuses on the security of systems under normal conditions, whereas
      TT&E test events focus on the functionality of systems under adverse conditions as defined in IT plans, such as contingency
      plans and incident response plans. Although the requirements of C&A and TT&E test events are usually quite different, in
      some cases it might reduce duplication of efforts to have a single testing event that encompasses both the C&A and the
      TT&E sets of requirements.
