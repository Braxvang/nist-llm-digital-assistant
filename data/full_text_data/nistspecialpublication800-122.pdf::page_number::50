                                 GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



 Purpose Specification—The purposes for which personal data are collected should be specified not
  later than at the time of data collection and the subsequent use limited to the fulfillment of those
  purposes or such others as are not incompatible with those purposes and as are specified on each
  occasion of change of purpose.
 Use Limitation—Personal data should not be disclosed, made available or otherwise used for
  purposes other than those specified, except with the consent of the data subject or by the authority of
  law.
 Security Safeguards—Personal data should be protected by reasonable security safeguards against
  such risks as loss or unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure of data.
 Openness—There should be a general policy of openness about developments, practices and policies
  with respect to personal data. Means should be readily available of establishing the existence and
  nature of personal data and the main purposes of their use, as well as the identity and usual residence
  of the data controller.
 Individual Participation—An individual should have the right: (a) to obtain from a data controller,
  or otherwise, confirmation of whether or not the data controller has data relating to him; (b) to have
  communicated to him, data relating to him within a reasonable time; at a charge, if any, that is not
  excessive; in a reasonable manner; and in a form that is readily intelligible to him; (c) to be given
  reasons if a request made under subparagraphs (a) and (b) is denied, and to be able to challenge such
  denial; and (d) to challenge data relating to him and, if the challenge is successful, to have the data
  erased, rectified, completed, or amended.
 Accountability—A data controller should be accountable for complying with measures which give
  effect to the principles stated above.
In 2004, the Federal CIO Council published the Federal Enterprise Architecture Security and Privacy
Profile (FEA-SPP).96 It included a set of privacy control families based on Fair Information Practices.
The privacy control families were intended to provide guidance for integrating privacy requirements into
the Federal Enterprise Architecture. In 2009, the CIO Council drafted a revised set of privacy control
families.97 The revised set contains the following privacy control families:

 Transparency—Providing notice to the individual regarding the collection, use, dissemination, and
  maintenance of PII.
 Individual Participation and Redress—Involving the individual in the process of using PII and
  seeking individual consent for the collection, use, dissemination, and maintenance of PII. Providing
  mechanisms for appropriate access, correction, and redress regarding the use of PII.
 Purpose Specification— Specifically articulating the authority that permits the collection of PII and
  specifically articulating the purpose or purposes for which the PII is intended to be used.
 Data Minimization and Retention—Only collecting PII that is directly relevant and necessary to
  accomplish the specified purpose(s). Only retaining PII for as long as is necessary to fulfill the
  specified purpose(s) and in accordance with the National Archives and Records Administration
  (NARA) approved record retention schedule.

     This set of privacy control families is based on the working draft of Version 3 of FEA-SPP, August 28, 2009. It is expected
     to be finalized and published in 2010.
