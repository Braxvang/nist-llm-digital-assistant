527   3.2.1. Literacy Training and Awareness
528           REQUIREMENT: 03.02.01
529           a. Provide security literacy training to system users:
530               1. As part of initial training for new users and periodically thereafter;
531               2. When required by system changes or following [Assignment: organization-defined
532                  events]; and
533               3. On recognizing and reporting indicators of insider threat, social engineering, and social
534                  mining.
535           b. Update security literacy training content periodically and following [Assignment: organization-
536              defined events].

537           DISCUSSION
538           Organizations provide basic and advanced levels of security literacy training to system users
539           (including managers, senior executives, system administrators, and contractors) and measures to
540           test the knowledge level of users. Organizations determine the content of literacy training based
541           on specific organizational requirements, the systems to which personnel have authorized access,
542           and work environments (e.g., telework). The content includes an understanding of the need for
543           security and the actions required of users to maintain security and to respond to incidents. The
544           content also addresses the need for operations security and the handling of CUI.
545           Security awareness techniques include displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed with
546           security reminders, displaying logon screen messages, generating email advisories or notices
547           from organizational officials, and conducting awareness events using podcasts, videos, and
