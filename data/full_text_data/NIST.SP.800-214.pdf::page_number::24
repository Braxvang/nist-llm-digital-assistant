In November 2019, NIST held the Third Lightweight Cryptography Workshop to discuss
the candidate algorithms, including their design strategies, implementations, performance,
cryptanalysis, and target applications. In addition, NIST organized a virtual workshop to take
place at the start of FY 2021 and continued public collaboration on lightweight cryptography at
academic conferences and meetings with industry and government representatives.
Transition to FIPS 140-3
NIST has continued to develop new tools and processes to support an ISO-based cryptographic
module testing program as a validation authority while supporting the existing validation
process. For more than a quarter of a century, NIST’s FIPS 140 publication series has been used
to coordinate requirements and standards of cryptographic modules for use by U.S. agencies.
In March 2019, the Secretary of Commerce approved FIPS 140-3, Security Requirements for
Cryptographic Modules. The update to FIPS 140 includes references to two existing international
standards: ISO/IEC 19790:2012, Information technology — Security techniques —
Security requirements for cryptographic modules; and ISO/IEC 24759:2017, Information
technology — Security techniques — Test requirements for cryptographic modules.
In support of this update, NIST developed a series of draft Special Publications (the SP 800-140x
“subseries”) for public comment. They directly support FIPS 140-3 and its associated program,
the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP):
• Draft SP 800-140, FIPS 140-3 Derived Test Requirements (DTR)
• Draft SP 800-140A, CMVP Documentation Requirements
• Draft SP 800-140B, CMVP Security Policy Requirements
• Draft SP 800-140C, CMVP Approved Security Functions
• Draft SP 800-140D, CMVP Approved Sensitive Parameter Generation and Establishment
  Methods
• Draft SP 800-140E, CMVP Approved Authentication Mechanisms
• Draft SP 800-140F, CMVP Approved Non-Invasive Attack Mitigation Test Metrics
Table 1 describes the transition timeline for implementation of the new standard.
