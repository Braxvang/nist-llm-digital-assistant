      NIST SP 800-73pt2-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                       Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 2
      September 2023                                                                          PIV Card Application Card Command Interface

520   If P1='00' and L c and the command data field are present, then the authentication data in the
521   command data field SHALL be compared against the reference data associated with the key
522   reference, as specified in the following subsections. However, if the key reference is '00', '80',
523   '96', or '97' and the current value of the retry counter associated with the key reference is zero,
524   then the PIV Card Application SHALL return the status word '69 83'. 6 In order to protect against
525   blocking over the contactless interface, PIV Card Applications that implement secure messaging
526   SHALL define an issuer-specified intermediate retry value for each of these key references and
527   return '69 83' if the command is submitted over the contactless interface (over secure messaging
528   or the VCI, as required for the key reference) and the current value of the retry counter
529   associated with the key reference is at or below the issuer-specified intermediate retry value. If
530   status word '69 83' is returned, then the comparison SHALL NOT be made, and the security
531   status and the retry counter of the key reference SHALL remain unchanged.
532   If P1='FF', and L c and the command data field are absent, the command SHALL reset the
533   security status of the key reference in P2. The security status of the key reference specified in P2
534   SHALL be set to FALSE, and the retry counter associated with the key reference SHALL remain
535   unchanged.

536   3.2.1.1.                 PIV Card Application PIN and Global PIN
537   If the key reference is '00' or '80' and the authentication data in the command data field does not
538   satisfy the criteria in Section 2.4.3, then the card command SHALL fail, and the PIV Card
539   Application SHALL return either the status word '6A 80' or '63 CX'. If status word '6A 80' is
540   returned, the security status and the retry counter of the key reference SHALL remain
541   unchanged. 7 If status word '63 CX' is returned, the security status of the key reference SHALL
542   be set to FALSE, and the retry counter associated with the key reference SHALL be decremented
543   by one.
544   If the authentication data in the command data field is properly formatted (see previous
545   paragraph) and does not match reference data associated with the key reference, then the card
546   command SHALL fail, the PIV Card Application SHALL return the status word '63 CX', the
547   security status of the key reference SHALL be set to FALSE, and the retry counter associated
548   with the key reference SHALL be decremented by one.
549   If the card command succeeds, then the security status of the key reference SHALL be set to
550   TRUE, and the retry counter associated with the key reference SHALL be set to the reset retry
551   value associated with the key reference. The initial value of the retry counter and the reset retry
552   value associated with the key reference (i.e., the number of successive failures/retries before the
553   retry counter associated with the key reference reaches zero) is 10 or less for both key references
554   in accordance with FIPS 201 Section 2.9.3.

555   3.2.1.2.                 On-Card Biometric Comparison
556   If the key reference is '96' or '97' and the authentication data in the command data field is not of
557   length 3N, where N satisfies the requirements for the minimum and maximum number of
558   minutiae specified in the BIT, then the card command SHALL fail, and the PIV Card
      6
          There is no retry counter associated with the pairing code, so the authentication method cannot be blocked for that key reference.
      7
          It is recommended that in this case the authentication data not be compared to the on-card reference data.
