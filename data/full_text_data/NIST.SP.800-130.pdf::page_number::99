A short summary is provided for each of the items below so that the reader can
immediately determine the applicability of the item to the readerâ€™s needs.

1. [FIPS 140]
   FIPS 140-2: Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, May 2001,
   www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html.
   FIPS 140-2 specifies the requirements in eleven areas that must be met by
   cryptographic modules (modules) protecting U.S. Government information. This
   applies to hardware, software, firmware and hybrid modules. The standard provides
   four increasing, qualitative levels of security that are intended to cover a wide range
   of potential applications and environments. The security requirements cover areas
   related to the secure design and implementation of a cryptographic module. These
   areas include the cryptographic module specification; the cryptographic module ports
   and interfaces; the roles, services, and authentication mechanisms; the finite state
   model; the physical security of the module; the operational environment;
   cryptographic key management; electromagnetic interference/electromagnetic
   compatibility (EMI/EMC); self-tests; design assurance; and mitigation of other
   attacks. Compliance with this Standard is validated under the NIST Cryptographic
   Module Validation Program (CMVP).

2. [FIPS 180]
   FIPS 180-4: Secure Hash Standard (SHS), March 2012,
   www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html.
   FIPS 180-4 specifies hash algorithms that can be used to generate digests of
   messages. The digests are used to detect whether messages have been changed since
   the digests were generated. Digests may be used in the generation and validation of
   digital signatures, random number generation and the generation of message
   authentication codes. Compliance with this Standard is validated under the NIST
   Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP).

3. [FIPS 186]
   FIPS 186-4: Digital Signature Standard (DSS), July 2013,
   www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html.
   FIPS 186-4 specifies algorithms for applications requiring a digital signature. The
   standard allows the use of DSA, RSA, and ECDSA signature techniques, along with
   an appropriate hash function from FIPS 180-4 to compute the digital signature. FIPS
   186-4 also includes requirements and algorithms for the generation of keys and
   domain parameters. Compliance with this Standard is validated under the NIST
   Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP).
