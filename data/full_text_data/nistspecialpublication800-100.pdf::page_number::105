11. Certification, Accreditation, and
    Security Assessments
    Security certification and accreditation are important activities that support a risk
management process and an integral part of an agency's information security
program. The security certification and accreditation process is designed to ensure
that an information system will operate with the appropriate management review,
that there is ongoing monitoring of security controls, and that reaccreditation occurs
periodically.
    Required by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix
III, Security of Federal Automated Information Resources, security certification and
accreditation serves a function similar to quality control. It is the official
management decision given by a senior agency official to authorize operation of an
information system and to explicitly accept the risk on behalf of the agency. In this
vein, it makes senior officials who accept risk fully accountable for their decisions,
and in doing so, encourages diligence in the decision-making process.
    The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and OMB Circular A-
130, Appendix III, both require that federal agencies perform IT security risk
assessments and prepare security plans for all systems. Both risk assessments and
security plans are essential components of the security certification and accreditation
process. Whether formal or informal, risk assessments provide much of the data
needed to formulate a security plan that addresses the risks identified for a given
system. Both the risk assessment and the development and maintenance of a
security plan that accurately reflects the security requirements and controls in place
for a particular system must be incorporated into the system development life cycle
(SDLC). 70
    In addition to risk assessments and system security plans, security assessments
have an important role in security accreditation. It is essential that agency officials
have the most complete and accurate information possible on the security status of
their information systems in order to make timely and sound risk-based decisions.
The information and supporting evidence needed for security accreditation are
developed during a detailed security evaluation of a system, typically referred to as
security certification.
   Security certification is a comprehensive assessment of the management,
operational, and technical security controls in an information system, made in
support of security accreditation, to determine the extent to which the controls are
implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome
with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system. The results of a
security certification are used to reassess the risks and update the system security
plan, thus providing the factual basis for an authorizing official to render a security
accreditation decision.
