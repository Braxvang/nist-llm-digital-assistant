                                                                                GUIDE TO SECURE WEB SERVICES



 A publishing API is used to place information into the registry. The publishing is restricted, so
  publishers must be authenticated. Authentication can be performed using a username/password
  combination, SAML, Kerberos, or some other method.
 An inquiry API provides read-only access to the registry. The inquiry API allows Web services to
  search for organization details, services offered, and binding information for the services. This API is
  usually publicly accessible. In UDDI v2, the inquiry API does not support authentication, but in
  UDDI v3, authentication can be required for inquiries—limiting access to the registry only to trusted
  Web services.
 UDDI v3 introduces a new subscription API that provides notifications about additions or updates to
  the registry. The subscription API is also restricted, requiring authentication by the registry.
In addition to the SOAP-based APIs, many implementations of UDDI registries provide a Web interface
for publishing to and searching the registry. Because this is not part of the UDDI standard and is not
implemented by all UDDI registry vendors, these UDDI Web interfaces are not covered in this guide.

3.9.3   Secure Access to the Registry

As described in Section 3.9.2, some portions of the UDDI API require authentication. SOAP over
HTTPS is usually required to make certain that publisher credentials cannot be intercepted during
transmission. In addition, all publishers should be designated as Tier 1 publishers. In UDDI v2, Tier 1
publishers have defined restrictions for what services they can publish to the registry. In a private
registry, these restrictions can vary based on the needs of the organization. In contrast, the specification
does not require restrictions on a Tier 2 publisher.

Some UDDI registries provide the ability to restrict publishers’ activities at the account level, which
provides some control over Tier 2 publishers. UDDI v3 provides the ability to define policies, which
provide finer control over publishers than the Tier model available in v2. UDDI v3 adds support for
XML Signatures to the registry, providing a way for inquirers to verify the integrity and publisher of data
in the registry. In UDDI registries, a publisher is only allowed to alter entries the publisher created, so
inquirers can be reasonably certain that any changes made to an entry in the registry were made by the
appropriate publisher. Nevertheless, even with digital signatures, there is no guarantee the information in
a UDDI registry is correct—only that it was published by a trusted entity.

3.9.4   Service Inquiry API

The inquiry API is used to search for Web services within the UDDI registry that meet the requester’s
needs. In UDDI v2, the inquiry API is accessed through SOAP over HTTP and requires no
authentication. The requester must have a pre-existing trust relationship with the UDDI service, which
can be achieved by accessing a private UDDI registry within the organization or a trusted public UDDI
registry (e.g., the UBR). Most UDDI registries run from a functioning Web server and are unaware as to
whether or not the Web server is using HTTPS. It may be possible to configure a UDDI v2 registry’s
inquiry API to use SSL/TLS, which in turn can be configured for authentication in addition to encryption.

UDDI v3 specifies that the inquiry API can be accessed over HTTPS and supports authorization. If a
UDDI v3 service is being used with authentication, the requester has previously established a relationship
with the registry and can likely trust its results. In UDDI v3, authentication usually consists of a
username and plaintext password transmitted over SSL/TLS, but the UDDI specification states that any
authentication method can be used to access the registry, from X.509 certificates to SAML assertions.
Also, because UDDI v3 allows the inquiry API to use SSL/TLS, the requesting service can be certain that
the results from the registry were not tampered with during transit.
