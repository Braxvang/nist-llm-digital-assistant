          configured to suspend its functionality completely when logging fails. Another example is
          handling full log files, as described in Section 5.1.2.
       Implement secure mechanisms for transporting log data from the system to the centralized
        log management servers, if such protection is needed and not provided automatically by the log
        management infrastructure. Many transport protocols, such as FTP and Hypertext Transfer
        Protocol (HTTP), do not provide protection. An administrator might need to upgrade a system’s
        logging software to a version that has additional security features, or to encrypt the logging
        communications through a separate protocol such as Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) or SSL.
5.2     Analyze Log Data

Effective analysis of log data is often the most challenging aspect of log management, but is also usually
the most important. Although analyzing log data is sometimes perceived by administrators as
uninteresting and inefficient (e.g., little value for much effort), having robust log management
infrastructures and automating as much of the log analysis process as possible can significantly improve
analysis so that it takes less time to perform and produces more valuable results. This section provides
recommendations on gaining an understanding of logs and prioritizing log entries, and also compares
system-level and infrastructure-level analysis.

5.2.1     Gaining an Understanding of Logs

The key to performing log analysis is understanding the typical activity associated with each system.
Although some log entries are very easy to understand, many are not. The primary reasons for this are as
follows:

       Need for Context. The meaning of an entry often depends upon the context surrounding it.
        Administrators need to determine how this context is defined, such as through additional log
        entries in one or more logs, or through non-log sources (e.g., configuration management records).
        Context is needed to validate unreliable log entries, such as security software that often generates
        false positives when looking for malicious activity. Infrastructure administrators should reach out
        to system-level administrators as needed to help provide context for entries.
       Unclear Messages. A log entry might contain a cryptic message or code that is meaningful to the
        software vendor but not to the administrator reviewing the entry. Such entries might necessitate
        discussions with the software vendor to determine their meanings. Using SIEM software to
        analyze logs typically reduces the number of unclear messages because the SIEM software often
        has detailed knowledge of software vendors’ logging practices. However, even SIEM software
        cannot understand every message, such as new message types associated with a just-released
        update to a product.
In some cases, it might not be possible to gain a full understanding of a log entry. For example, a log
source might not be capable of recording the supporting data necessary to provide adequate context for an
entry. Also, a software vendor might be unable to provide sufficiently detailed information on the
meaning of a particular message. Although it is certainly preferable for administrators to understand all
log entries, in many cases it is simply not feasible. Also, there may be so many different types of log
entries that it is not possible to understand them all fully with the limited resources available.

The most effective way to gain a solid understanding of log data is to review and analyze portions of it
regularly (e.g., every day). The goal is to eventually gain an understanding of the baseline of typical log
entries, likely encompassing the vast majority of log entries on the system. (Because a few types of
entries often comprise a significant percentage of the log entries, this is not as difficult as it may first
