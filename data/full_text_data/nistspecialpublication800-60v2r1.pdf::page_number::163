Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of energy production
information on the activities of responsible agencies with respect to transformation of raw energy
resources into useable, deliverable energy. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most
energy production information would have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some
energy production information can result in major financial consequences. In some cases,
premature disclosure of this information can impact financial markets. Unauthorized disclosure
to a single institution could damage faith in government institutions, result in adverse financial
events, and have a serious adverse effect on public confidence in the agency. Therefore, the
confidentiality impact should be at least moderate for this energy production information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most energy production information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of energy production information may
depend on the urgency with which the information is typically needed. Unauthorized
modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages,
electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but the
damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: If the energy production information is
time-critical or very sensitive, the integrity impact level may be moderate or high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most energy production information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to energy production information.
Missions supported by energy production information are generally tolerant of delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
energy production information is low.

D.8 Environmental Management
Environmental management includes all functions required to determine proper
environmental standards and ensure their compliance.
