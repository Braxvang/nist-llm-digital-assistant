           other computing environments [Ris09]. For example, an attacker could determine
           periods of high activity, estimate high-traffic rates, and possibly launch keystroke timing
           attacks to gather passwords and other data from a target server.

4.7       Data Protection
Data stored in a public cloud typically resides in a shared environment collocated with data from
other customers. Organizations placing sensitive and regulated data into a public cloud,
therefore, must account for the means by which access to the data is controlled and the data is
kept secure. Similar concerns exist for data migrated within or between clouds.

          Value Concentration. A response to the question “Why do you rob banks?” is often
           attributed to Willie Sutton, a historic and prolific bank robber [Coc97]—his purported
           answer: “because that is where the money is.” In many ways, data records are the
           currency of the 21st century and cloud-based data stores are the bank vault, making them
           an increasingly preferred target due to the collective value concentrated there [Row07].
           Just as economies of scale exist in robbing banks instead of individuals, a high payoff
           ratio also exists for successfully compromising a cloud. Successful exploits against
           highly regarded security firms illustrate that no one is beyond the reach of a determined
           adversary (e.g., [And11], [Bra11], and [Pep11b]).

           As opposed to a direct approach, Willie’s trademark was a combination of finesse and
           circumvention. That style works as well in the digital world of cloud computing. For
           instance, a recent exploit involved targeting a personal electronic mail account of a social
           networking service administrator, reportedly by answering a set of security questions to
           gain access to the account, and using the information found there to gain access to
           company files stored in a PaaS cloud [Inf09, Sut09]. A similar weakness in password
           resets was identified in an IaaS public cloud [Gar07]. A registered electronic mail
           address and valid password for an account were all that were required to download
           authentication credentials from the cloud provider’s management dashboard, which in
           turn granted access to all of the account’s resources. Since lost passwords for the cloud
           service could be reset by electronic mail, an attacker controlling the mail system
           associated with an account, or passively eavesdropping on the network through which
           electronic mail containing a password reset would pass, could effectively take control of
           the account.

           Having data collocated with that of an organization with a high threat profile could also
           lead to a denial of service, as an unintended casualty from an attack targeted against that
           organization [Row07]. Similarly, side effects from a physical attack against a high
           profile organization’s cloud-based resources are also a possibility. For example, over the
           years, facilities of the Internal Revenue Service have attracted their share of attention
           from would-be attackers [Kat10, Lab95, Lat96, Sch10].

          Data Isolation. Data can take many forms. For example, for cloud-based application
           development, it includes the application programs, scripts, and configuration settings,
           along with the development tools. For deployed applications, it includes records and
           other content created or used by the applications, including deallocated objects, as well as
