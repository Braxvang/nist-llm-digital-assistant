6.4.10 Associate a Key with its Metadata
A cryptographic key may have several metadata elements associated with it. The CKMS
designer must determine which metadata must or can be associated with a key and also
the protection mechanism that provides the association. Depending on the nature of the
information stored in a metadata element, the metadata element may require
confidentiality protection, integrity protection, and source authentication. The association
function uses cryptography or a trusted process to provide this protection.

FR: 6.40 For each key type used, the CKMS design shall specify what metadata is
associated with the key, how the metadata is associated with the key, and the
circumstances under which metadata is associated with the key.

FR: 6.41 For each key type used, the CKMS design shall describe how the following
security services (protections) are applied to the associated metadata: source
authentication, integrity, and confidentiality.

6.4.11 Modify Metadata
The modify metadata function can be used to modify existing writable metadata that is
associated with a key. Metadata that has been associated with a key should not be
modifiable by an unauthorized entity. For example, if the identifier of the keyâ€™s owner is
included in the metadata, an unauthorized entity should not be permitted to modify the
key owner identifier or add additional owners. The binding of a key to its metadata can
be achieved using a MAC or a digital signature. The integrity of the key and its metadata
may be determined by verifying the MAC or digital signature.

FR: 6.42 The CKMS design shall specify the circumstances under which associated
metadata is modified.

6.4.12 Delete Metadata
This function deletes metadata (for which delete permission has been granted) associated
with a key. Metadata elements may be deleted as an entire complete group, as individual
elements, or as a specific subset of the elements.

FR: 6.43 The CKMS design shall specify the circumstances under which the metadata
associated with a key is deleted.

FR: 6.44 The CKMS design shall specify the technique used to delete associated
metadata.

6.4.13 List Key Metadata
This function allows an entity to list the metadata elements of a key for which the entity
is authorized. An entity may have multiple keys with associated metadata in storage.
There may be keys for digital signature generation and verification, authentication,
encryption/decryption, data integrity, key establishment, and key storage. Authorization
to use a key does not automatically imply access to every metadata element associated
