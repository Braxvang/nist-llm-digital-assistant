Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for capital planning information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of information affecting external communications that contain capital planning information (e.g.,
web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency,
but the damage to the mission would usually be limited. Public confidence consequences will be
more serious for agencies that have national defense, intelligence, or information security
missions. In such cases, the impact may be at least moderate.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity level recommended for capital
planning information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the capital planning information.

The capital planning processes are usually tolerant of delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
capital planning information is low.
C.2.3.3 Enterprise Architecture Information Type

Enterprise Architecture is an established process for describing the current state and defining the
target state and transition strategy for an organizationâ€™s people, processes, and technology. The
recommended provisional security categorization for the enterprise architecture information type
is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of enterprise architecture
information on the ability of responsible agencies to describe the current state and define the
target state and transition strategy for an organizations people, processes, and technology. The
effects of loss of confidentiality of preliminary draft enterprise architecture plans can result in
attempts by affected entities and other interested parties to influence and/or impede the policy
and guideline development process. Premature public release of draft plans before internal
coordination and review can result in unnecessary damage to public confidence in the agency.
This is particularly likely where the release includes unedited internal commentary and
discussion. However, the consequence of loss of confidentiality of most enterprise architecture
information is likely to do only limited harm to government assets, personnel, or missions.
