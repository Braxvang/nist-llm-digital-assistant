services. Some common types of services and applications that should usually be disabled if not required
include the following:

 File and printer sharing services (e.g., Windows Network Basic Input/Output System [NetBIOS] file
  and printer sharing, Network File System [NFS], File Transfer Protocol [FTP])

 Wireless networking services

 Remote control and remote access programs, particularly those that do not strongly encrypt their
  communications (e.g., Telnet) 20

 Directory services (e.g., Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [LDAP], Kerberos, Network
  Information System [NIS])

 Email services (e.g., Simple Mail Transfer Protocol [SMTP])

 Language compilers and libraries

 System development tools

 System and network management tools and utilities, including Simple Network Management Protocol
  (SNMP).

Removing unnecessary services and applications is preferable to simply disabling them through
configuration settings because attacks that attempt to alter settings and activate a disabled service cannot
succeed when the functional components are completely removed. Disabled services could also be
enabled inadvertently through human error.

Eliminating or disabling unnecessary services enhances the security of a Web server in several ways
[Alle00]:

 Other services cannot be compromised and used to attack the host or impair the services of the Web
  server. Each service added to a host increases the risk of compromise for that host because each
  service is another possible avenue of access for an attacker. Less is more secure in this case.

 Other services may have defects or may be incompatible with the Web server itself. By disabling or
  removing them, they should not affect the Web server and should potentially improve its availability.

 The host can be configured to better suit the requirements of the particular service. Different services
  might require different hardware and software configurations, which could lead to unnecessary
  vulnerabilities or negatively affect performance.

 By reducing services, the number of logs and log entries is reduced; therefore, detecting unexpected
  behavior becomes easier (see Section 9).

Organizations should determine the services to be enabled on a Web server. Services in addition to the
Web server service that might be installed include database access protocols, file transfer protocols, and

     If a remote control or remote access program is absolutely required and it does not strongly encrypt its communications, it
     should be tunneled over a protocol that provides encryption, such as secure shell (SSH) or IP Security (IPsec). Section 7
     provides additional information on requirements for cryptography.
