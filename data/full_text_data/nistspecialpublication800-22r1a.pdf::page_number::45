A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



           example. The value for the expected value and variance for the case where L = 2, although not
           shown in the above table, were taken from the indicated reference3.

2.9.5 Decision Rule (at the 1% Level)
If the computed P-value is < 0.01, then conclude that the sequence is non-random. Otherwise, conclude
that the sequence is random.

2.9.6 Conclusion and Interpretation of Results
Since the P-value obtained in step 5 of Section 2.9.4 is ≥ 0.01 (P-value = 0.767189), the conclusion is that
the sequence is random.

Theoretical expected values for ϕ have been computed as shown in the table in step (5) of Section 2.9.4.
If fn differs significantly from expectedValue(L), then the sequence is significantly compressible.

2.9.7 Input Size Recommendation
This test requires a long sequence of bits (n ≥ (Q + K)L) which are divided into two segments of L-bit
blocks, where L should be chosen so that 6 ≤ L ≤ 16. The first segment consists of Q initialization blocks,
where Q should be chosen so that Q = 10 • 2L. The second segment consists of K test blocks, where K =
n/L - Q ≈ 1000 • 2L. The values of L, Q and n should be chosen as follows:

                                               n             L    Q = 10 • 2L
