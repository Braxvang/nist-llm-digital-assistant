three modes in ANSI X9.52 are variants of the CBC, CFB, and OFB modes of Triple DES that
use interleaving or pipelining.

Thus, there are three new elements in this recommendation: 1) the extension of the four
confidentiality modes in FIPS Pub 81 for use with any FIPS-approved block cipher; 2) the
revision of the requirements for these modes; and 3) the specification of an additional
confidentiality mode, the CTR mode, for use with any FIPS-approved block cipher.
