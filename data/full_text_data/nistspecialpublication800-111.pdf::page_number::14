                                                      GUIDE TO STORAGE ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES FOR END USER DEVICES



environment with the management, operational, and technical controls necessary to provide adequate
security for the storage encryption implementation. Examples of supporting measures are as follows:

 Revise organizational policies as needed to incorporate appropriate usage of the storage encryption
  solution. Policies should provide the foundation for the planning and implementation of storage
  encryption.

 Ensure that end user devices are secured and maintained properly, which should reduce the risk of
  compromise or misuse. This includes securing device OSs, applications, and communications (e.g.,
  encrypting wired and wireless network traffic) and physically securing devices, such as requiring that
  laptops be secured using cable locks when in hotels, conferences, and other locations where third
  parties could easily gain physical access to the devices. Physical security for devices is also an
  important consideration in home environments, such as preventing others within the house from using
  an organization-issued device by keeping the device in a locked desk or room.

 Make users aware of their responsibilities for storage encryption, such as encrypting sensitive files,
  physically protecting mobile devices and removable media, and promptly reporting loss or theft of
  devices and media.

Organizations should select and deploy the necessary security controls based on existing guidelines.
Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199 establishes three security categories—low,
moderate, and high—based on the potential impact of a security breach involving a particular system. 10
NIST SP 800-53 provides recommendations for minimum management, operational, and technical
security controls for information systems based on the FIPS 199 impact categories. 11 The
recommendations in NIST SP 800-53 should be helpful to organizations in identifying controls that are
needed to protect end user devices, which should be used in addition to the specific recommendations for
storage encryption listed in this document. 12

     In addition to securing the wireless networks, the wireless devices using the networks also need to be secured; however, an
     explanation of securing laptops, PDAs, and other wireless devices is outside the scope of this guide.
