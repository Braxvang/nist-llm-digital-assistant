Information Technology Security Training Requirements

    •   Sample Learning Objectives    —    Links the verbs from the "Knowledge Levels" section to
        the "Behavioral Outcomes" by providing examples of the activities an individual should
        be capable of doing after successful completion of training associated with the cell.
        Again, the Learning Objectives recognize that training must be provided at Beginning,
        Intermediate, and Advanced levels. For some of the cells, there will not be three distinct
        levels (i.e., there may be only two levels or even one). In these instances, there is no clear
        distinction between performance objectives that allows separation into Beginning,
        Intermediate, and Advanced levels. (Note: Beginning, Intermediate, and Advanced refer
        to levels of IT security responsibility associated with the functional area, not to levels of
        the functional area as such. For example, an experienced (Advanced level) IT system
        developer could be taking entry-level (Beginning) training in the IT security
        responsibilities associated with the system development function.)

        The purpose of the Beginning Level is to focus the generic understanding of IT security,
        which the individual will have acquired from Security Basics and Literacy (per Chapter
        3), on their job requirements.


   •    Sample Job Functions   —   Presents sample position titles or job functions of individuals
        who would be expected to obtain the training for a particular cell. Individuals designated
        as IT Security specialists need to be acquainted with the training content in all cells,
        whether or not they themselves need training in a specific programmatic role (e.g.,
        responsibility for selecting a back-up site for a specific IT system). An aggregate of 26
        Sample Job Functions for all cells is presented as Exhibit 4-3, together with the number
        of cells in which each occurs. It is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all possible
        job functions. Appendix E, Job Function-Training Cross Reference, contains tables that
        show the recommended training modules (cells) for each of these 26 job functions.

   •    IT Security Body of Knowledge Topics and Concepts       — This block (on the back of    the
        page for each cell), provides suggested topics and concepts which pertain to the
        particular cell or training module that will increase the knowledge, skills, and abilities of
        the student. The numbers on the back of the cell page refer to Exhibit 4-4, which presents
        twelve high-level topics and concepts intended to incorporate the overall body of
        knowledge required for training in IT security. Each of these topics and concepts is then
        broken down into more specific subjects that should be included in the training for that
        topic. By identifying the twelve topics and concepts at a high level, they become general
        and flexible categories under which more specific topics or subjects can be added or
        removed to keep up with evolving technology, laws, regulations, policies, or guidance.

        To customize the training in a cell, topics and detailed subjects may be presented at
        different depths to accomplish the desired learning objective level (i.e.. Beginning,
        Intermediate, and Advanced). For example, if an individual has no acquisition
        responsibilities and therefore, no need for in-depth training in acquisition, that topic
        might be introduced, but not explained in depth.    Thus, the student would become
        familiar with the associated FT security considerations, but would not learn how to write
