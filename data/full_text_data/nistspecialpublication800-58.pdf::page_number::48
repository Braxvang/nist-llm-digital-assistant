 5.2.6.1 SIP Authenticated Identity Body

       SIP Authenticated Identity Body (AIB) defines a generic SIP authentication
       token. The token is provided by adding an S/MIME body to a SIP request or
       response in order to provide reference integrity over its headers. The document
       defines a format for this message body referred to as an authenticated identity
       body (AIB). This is a digitally signed SIP message (sip/message) or message
       fragment (sip/frag).

 5.2.6.2 SIP Authenticated Identity Management

       The existing mechanisms for expressing identity in SIP often do not permit an
       administrative domain to securely verify the identity of the originator of a request.
       This document recommends practices and conventions for authenticating end
       users, and proposes a way to distribute cryptographically secure authenticated
       identities within SIP messages by including an authentication token (as a MIME
       body). This token is then added to the message.

 5.2.6.3 S/MIME AES Requirement for SIP

       RFC 3261 specifies 3DES as the required minimum encryption algorithm for
       implementations of S/MIME in SIP. Although 3DES is still a viable algorithm,
       NIST has selected an improved algorithm, AES, as a replacement for DES and
       3DES. Standards-track RFC 3853, the S/MIME AES Requirement for SIP,
       updates the normative guidance of RFC 3261 to require AES for S/MIME. This
       specification may be found at: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3853.txt. AES provides
       higher throughput and lower computational complexity than 3DES, and can be
       implemented with low memory requirements, making it more suitable for mobile
       or embedded devices, including VOIP phones.


 5.2.6.4 Security Mechanism Agreement for SIP

       SIP has a number of security mechanisms. Some of them have been built in to the
       SIP protocol directly, such as HTTP authentication. These mechanisms have
       alternative algorithms and parameters. The idea originates from the 3rd Generation
       Partnership Project (3GPP), a collaboration of telecommunications companies,
       and provides a mechanism for selecting which security mechanisms to use
       between two entities. RFC 3261 itself does not provide any mechanism agreement
       options. Moreover, even if some mechanisms such as OPTIONS were used to
       perform a mechanism agreement, the agreement would be vulnerable to Bidding-
       Down attacks (a phase of man-in-the-middle attack where the attacker modifies
       messages to convince communicating parties that both sides support only weak
       algorithms). Three header fields are defined for negotiating the security
       mechanisms within SIP between a SIP User Agent entity and its next hop SIP
       server. It is a proposed standard (RFC 3329) from the IETF. Five mechanisms
       are currently supported:


                                                                                          43
