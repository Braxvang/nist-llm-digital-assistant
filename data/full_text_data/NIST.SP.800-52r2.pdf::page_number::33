NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                          GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


   7. The Encrypt-then-MAC extension shall be supported if the server is configured to
       negotiate CBC cipher suites.
   8. The Truncated HMAC extension may be supported if the server communicates with
       constrained-device clients, cipher suites that use CBC mode are supported, and the server
       implementation does not support variable-length padding.
   9. The Pre-Shared Key extension may be supported if the server supports TLS 1.3.
   10. The Pre-Shared Key Exchange Modes extension shall be supported if the server supports
       TLS 1.3 and the Pre-Shared Key extension.
   11. The Supported Versions extension shall be supported if the server supports TLS 1.3.
   12. The Cookie extension shall be supported if the server supports TLS 1.3.
   13. The Certificate Signature Algorithms Extension shall be supported if the server supports
       TLS 1.3 and should be supported for TLS 1.2.
   14. The Post-handshake Client Authentication extension may be supported if the server
       supports TLS 1.3.
   15. The Signed Certificate Timestamps extension should be supported if the serverâ€™s
       certificate was issued by a publicly trusted CA and the certificate does not include a
       Signed Certificate Timestamps List extension.

3.4.2.1 Fallback Signaling Cipher Suite Value (SCSV)

Applies to TLS versions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2

TLS 1.3 includes a downgrade protection mechanism that previous versions do not. In versions
prior to TLS 1.3, an attacker can use an external version negotiation as a means to force
unnecessary protocol downgrades on a connection. In particular, the attacker can make it appear
that the connection failed with the requested TLS version, and some client implementations will
try the connection again with a downgraded protocol version. This cipher suite value, described
in RFC 7507 [42], provides a mechanism to prevent unintended protocol downgrades in versions
prior to TLS 1.3. Clients signal when a connection is a fallback, and if the server deems it
inappropriate (i.e., the server supports a higher TLS version), the server returns a fatal alert.

When TLS versions prior to TLS 1.2 are supported by the server and TLS version 1.3 is not
supported, the fallback SCSV shall be supported.

3.4.2.2 Supported Groups

Applies to TLS versions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3

The Supported Groups extension (supported_groups) allows the client to indicate the domain
parameter groups that it supports to the server. The extension was originally called the Supported
Elliptic Curves extension (elliptic_curves) and was only used for elliptic curve groups, but it may
now also be used to negotiate finite field groups. In TLS 1.3, the Supported Groups extension
must be used to negotiate both elliptic curve and finite field groups. Servers that support either
ephemeral ECDH cipher suites or TLS 1.3 shall support this extension. When elliptic curve
cipher suites are configured, at least one of the NIST-approved curves, P-256 (secp256r1) and P-
384 (secp384r1), shall be supported as described in RFC 8422 [52]. Additional NIST-
