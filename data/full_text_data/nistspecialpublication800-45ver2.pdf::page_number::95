 Investigate similar 63 hosts to determine if the attacker also has compromised other systems
 Analyze the intrusion, including:

     –    Capture the current state of the server starting with the most ephemeral data first (e.g., current
          network connections, memory dump, files time stamps, logged in users, etc.)

     –    Modifications made to the system’s software and configuration

     –    Modifications made to the data

     –    Tools or data left behind by attacker

     –    System logs, intrusion detection, and firewall log files
 Restore the system

     –    One of the following two options:

          –    Install clean version of operating system

          –    Restore from backups (this option can be more risky, as the backups may have been made
               after the compromise, and restoring from a compromised backup may still allow the attacker
               access to the system)

     –    Disable unnecessary services

     –    Apply all patches

     –    Change all passwords (even on uncompromised hosts as required)

     –    Reconfigure network security elements (firewall, router, IPS) to provide additional protection and
          notification
 Test system to ensure security
 Reconnect system to network
 Monitor system and network for signs that the attacker is attempting to access the system or network
  again
 Document lessons learned.
System administrators should decide whether to reinstall the operating system of a compromised system
or restore it from a backup based on organization policy and procedures. Factors that are often considered
include the following:

 Level of access that the attacker gained (e.g., root, user, guest, system)
 Type of attacker (internal or external)

     Similar hosts would include hosts that are in the same IP address range, have the same or similar passwords, share a trust
     relationship, and/or have the same operating system and/or applications.
