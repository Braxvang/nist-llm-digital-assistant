2.    Test Overview

2.1   Test Architecture

SP 800-166 covers the following two types of tests for removable tokens: (i) Derived PIV
Application and (ii) Data Model of the Derived PIV Application. The conceptual architecture for
these tests is highlighted with dashed lines and shown in Figure 1.

The Derived PIV Application resides on the removable hardware cryptographic token, 3
implements the commands in the Derived PIV Application command interface, 4 and provides
access to data objects on the Derived PIV Application.

Given that [SP800-157] does not specify an application interface or an explicit data model for
embedded tokens, vendors may implement Derived PIV Credentials on these devices in a
manner of their choosing. Test entities may develop test assertions to test Derived PIV
Credentials implemented on such tokens using functional testing developed specifically for the
environment and application that they are being used within. Appendix A provides guidelines on
testing Derived PIV Credentials (i.e., Derived PIV Authentication certificates) as well as other


3
 “Token” in this context refers to the secure element that contains the Derived PIV Application.
4
 The Derived PIV Application command interface is as defined in [SP800-157], Appendix B.2 - Derived PIV
Application Token Command Interface.
