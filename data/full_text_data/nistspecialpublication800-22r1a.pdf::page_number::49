A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



2.11.3 Test Statistic and Reference Distribution
∇ψ2m(obs) and∇ 2ψ2m(obs):   A measure of how well the observed frequencies of m-bit patterns match
                            the expected frequencies of the m-bit patterns.

The reference distribution for the test statistic is the χ2 distribution.

2.11.4 Test Description
(1)    Form an augmented sequence ε′: Extend the sequence by appending the first m-1 bits to the end
       of the sequence for distinct values of n.

        For example, given n = 10 and ε = 0011011101. If m = 3, then ε´ = 001101110100. If m = 2,
        then ε´ = 00110111010. If m = 1, then ε´ = the original sequence 0011011101.

(2)     Determine the frequency of all possible overlapping m-bit blocks, all possible overlapping (m-1)-
        bit blocks and all possible overlapping (m-2)-bit blocks. Let vi1 ...im denote the frequency of the m-
        bit pattern i1…im; let vi1 ...im −1 denote the frequency of the (m-1)-bit pattern i1…im-1; and let
         vi1 ...im − 2 denote the frequency of the (m-2)-bit pattern i1…im-2.

        For the example in this section, when m = 3, then (m-1) = 2, and (m-2) = 1. The frequency of all
        3-bit blocks is: v000 = 0, v001 = 1, v010 = 1, v011 = 2, v100 = 1, v101 = 2, v110 = 2, v111 = 0. The
        frequency of all possible (m-1)-bit blocks is: v00 = 1, v01 = 3, v10 = 3, v11 = 3. The frequency of all
        (m-2)-bit blocks is: v0 = 4, v1 = 6.
