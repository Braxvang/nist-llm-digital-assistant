                                                          CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS




4.2       Activation and Notification Phase

The Activation and Notification Phase defines initial actions taken once a system disruption or outage has
been detected or appears to be imminent. This phase includes activities to notify recovery personnel,
conduct an outage assessment, and activate the plan. At the completion of the Activation and Notification
Phase, ISCP staff will be prepared to perform recovery measures to restore system functions.

4.2.1     Activation Criteria and Procedure

The ISCP should be activated if one or more of the activation criteria for that system are met. If an
activation criterion is met, the designated authority should activate the plan. 31 Activation criteria for
system outages or disruptions are unique for each organization and should be stated in the contingency
planning policy. Criteria may be based on:

         Extent of any damage to the system (e.g., physical, operational, or cost);
         Criticality of the system to the organization’s mission (e.g., critical infrastructure protection
          asset); and
         Expected duration of the outage lasting longer than the RTO.

The appropriate recovery teams may be notified once the system outage or disruption has been identified
and the ISCP Coordinator has determined that activation criteria have been met. Notification procedures
should follow the procedures outlined in Section 4.2.2 below.

4.2.2     Notification Procedures

An outage or disruption may occur with or without prior notice. For example, advance notice is often
given that a hurricane is predicted to affect an area or that a computer virus is expected on a certain date.
However, there may be no notice of equipment failure or a criminal act. Notification procedures should
be documented in the plan for both types of situation. The procedures should describe the methods used to
notify recovery personnel during business and non business hours. Prompt notification is important for
reducing the effects of a disruption on the system; in some cases, it may provide enough time to allow
system personnel to shut down the system gracefully to avoid a hard crash. Following the outage or
disruption, notification should be sent to the Outage Assessment Team 32 so that it may determine the
status of the situation and appropriate next steps. Outage assessment procedures are described in Section
4.2.3. When outage assessment is complete, the appropriate recovery and system support personnel
should be notified.

Notifications can be accomplished through a variety of methods, either automated or manual and include
telephone, pager, electronic mail (email), cell phone, and messaging. Automated notification systems
follow established protocols and criteria and can include rapid authentication and acceptance and secure
messaging. Automated notification systems require up-front investment and learning curve, but may be
an effective way for some organizations to ensure prompt and accurate delivery.


31
   The designated authority (typically a senior manager or CIO) has the authority to activate the contingency plan. That authority
   may vary based on the organization or system, but the individual with this authority should be designated clearly in the plan.
   Only one individual should have this authority, and a successor should be clearly identified to assume that responsibility if
   necessary.
32
   The Outage Assessment Team is a representative title. Depending on how the organization establishes their roles and
   responsibilities, other names and titles may be used.
