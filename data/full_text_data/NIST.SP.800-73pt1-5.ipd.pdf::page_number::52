1135   Appendix B. PIV Authentication Mechanisms
1136   PIV authentication mechanisms and application scenarios are described in this section to provide
1137   guidelines on the usage and behavior supported by the PIV Card. FIPS 201 describes PIV
1138   authentication as “the process of establishing confidence in the identity of the cardholder
1139   presenting a PIV Card” [FIPS201]. The fundamental goal of using the PIV Card is to
1140   authenticate the identity of the cardholder to a system or person that is controlling access to a
1141   protected resource or facility. This end goal MAY be reached by various combinations of one or
1142   more of the validation steps described below:
1143           •    Card Validation (CardV) — This is the process of verifying that a PIV Card is authentic
1144                (i.e., not a counterfeit card). Card validation mechanisms include:
1145                      o Visual inspection of the tamper-proofing and tamper-resistant features of the PIV
1146                        Card, per Section 4.1.2 of FIPS 201
1147                      o Use of cryptographic challenge-response schemes with symmetric keys
1148                      o Use of asymmetric authentication schemes to validate private keys embedded
1149                        within the PIV Card
1150           •    Credential Validation (CredV) — This is the process of verifying the various types of
1151                credentials (e.g., visual credentials, biometrics, and certificates) held by the PIV Card.
1152                Credential validation mechanisms include:
1153                      o Verification of certificates on the PIV Card
1154                      o Verification of signatures on the PIV biometrics and the CHUID
1155                      o Checking the expiration date
1156                      o Checking the revocation status of the credentials on the PIV Card
1157                      o Visual inspection of PIV Card visual elements 32 (e.g., the photo, the printed
1158                        name, rank).
1159           •    Cardholder Validation (HolderV) — This is the process of establishing that the PIV Card
1160                is in the possession of the individual to whom the card was issued. Classically, identity
1161                authentication is achieved using one or more of these factors: a) something you have, b)
1162                something you know, and c) something you are. The assurance of the authentication
1163                process increases with the number of factors used. In the case of the PIV Card, these
1164                three factors translate as follows: a) something you have — possession of a PIV Card, b)
1165                something you know — knowledge of the PIN, and c) something you are — the live
1166                fingerprint, facial image, or iris image samples provided by the cardholder. Thus,
1167                mechanisms for PIV cardholder validation include:
1168                      o Presentation of a PIV Card by the cardholder
1169                      o Matching the PIN provided with the PIN on the PIV Card
