                          Figure 3 - Authorization Submission Package
The authorization decision letter (see Appendix F for examples) informs the OIMO that the
issuer is— (i) authorized to operate; (ii) authorized to operate on an interim basis; or (iii) not
authorized to operate. The supporting rationale includes the justification for the DAO’s decision.
The terms and conditions for the authorization provide a description of any limitations or
restrictions placed on the operation of the issuer, including which issuing facilities are included
in the decision. The authorization decision letter is attached to the authorization submission
package and becomes the authorization decision package.

The DAO sends the authorization decision package to the OIMO and retains a copy of it. The
OIMO carefully reviews the terms and conditions of authorization before initiating the necessary
steps for issuer operations. Both parties mark the authorization decision package appropriately
for storage under the organization’s record retention policy.
