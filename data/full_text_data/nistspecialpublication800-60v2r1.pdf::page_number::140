Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of domestic intelligence
information on the ability of responsible agencies to develop and manage accurate,
comprehensive, and timely domestic intelligence on homeland security topics and other national
threats. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of domestic intelligence information may
include loss of the ability and/or authorization to collect information necessary to provide
warning or to interdict from major threats (e.g., terrorist threats to critical infrastructures and/or
key national assets).

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Given the criticality of much domestic intelligence
information and the severe or catastrophic consequences to agencies that disclose domestic
intelligence information without proper authorization (e.g., Privacy Act provisions, Fourth
Amendment issues), the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for the domestic
intelligence information is high.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Domestic
intelligence information is generally associated with other mission-related information (e.g., anti-
terrorism, firearms and explosive protection, narcotics interdiction). The consequences of
unauthorized modification or destruction of domestic intelligence information is determined to a
large extent on the missions being supported by the intelligence information and on whether the
intelligence information is time-critical. Unauthorized modification or destruction of
intelligence information may adversely affect mission operations in a manner that results in
unacceptable damage to critical infrastructures, damage to or loss of key national assets, or loss
of human life.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
domestic intelligence information is high.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to domestic intelligence information.
Generally, missions supported by domestic intelligence information are not reliably tolerant
of delays. Significant degradation in mission capability and resultant catastrophic
consequences for critical infrastructures, key national assets, and/or human life may result
from disruption of access to domestic intelligence information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
domestic intelligence information is high.

D.4 Disaster Management
Disaster management involves the activities required to prepare for, mitigate, respond to, and
repair the effects of all physical and humanitarian disasters whether natural or man-made.
