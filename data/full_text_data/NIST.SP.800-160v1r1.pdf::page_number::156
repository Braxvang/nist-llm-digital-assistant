NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                              Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

         VA-3.2 Record the security characteristics of operational incidents and problems, and track
                their resolution.
         Note: Incidents that occur in the operational environment of the system are recorded and
         subsequently correlated to validation activities and results. This is an important feedback loop
         for continuous improvement in the engineering of trustworthy secure systems.
         VA-3.3 Obtain agreement that the security validation criteria have been met.
         VA-3.4 Maintain traceability of the security aspects of validation.
         Note: Bidirectional traceability of the security aspects of validated system elements to
         stakeholder protection needs, security concerns, and security requirements is maintained.
         Traceability demonstrates completeness of the validation process and provides evidence that
         supports assurance and trustworthiness claims.
         VA-3.5 Provide the security-relevant artifacts that have been selected for baselines.

H.12.1.            Security Purpose
-   Inform the security aspects of the requirements and constraints to securely operate the system
    and monitor the security aspects of products, services, and operator-system performance.
-   Identify and analyze security-relevant operational anomalies.

H.12.2.            Security Outcomes
-   Security aspects of operation constraints that influence system requirements, architecture, or
    design are identified.
-   Enabling systems, services, and material for the security aspects of operation are available.
-   Trained and qualified personnel who can securely operate the system are available.
-   System products or services that meet stakeholder security requirements are delivered.
-   Security aspects of system performance during operation are monitored.
-   Security support is provided to stakeholders.

H.12.3.            Security Activities and Tasks
OP-1     PREPARE FOR OPERATION
         OP-1.1 Define the security aspects of the operation strategy.
