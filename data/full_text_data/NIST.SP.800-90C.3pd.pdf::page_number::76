2141   B.2.1. Instantiation of the RBG1 Construction
2142   A physically secure channel is required to transport the entropy bits from the randomness source
2143   (the RBG2(P) construction) to the HMAC_DRBG during instantiation; an example of an RBG2(P)
2144   construction is provided in Appendix B.4. Thereafter, the randomness source and the secure
2145   channel are no longer available.
2146   The HMAC_DRBG is instantiated using the Instantiate_function, as specified in Section 2.8.1.1,
2147   with the following call:
2148          (status, RBG1_state_handle) = Instantiate_function (256, prediction_resistance_flag =
2149                                        FALSE, “Device 7056”).
2150           A security strength of 256 bits is requested for the HMAC_DRBG used in the RBG1
2151           construction.
2152           Since an RBG1 construction does not provide prediction resistance (see Section 4), the
2153           prediction_resistance_flag is set to FALSE.
2154           The personalization string to be used for this example is “Device 7056.”
