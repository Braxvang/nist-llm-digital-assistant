                                                                          Guidelines on PDA Forensics



7. Examination and Analysis

       The examination process gives light to probative data. The results, gained through applying
       established scientifically based methods, should describe the content and state of the data
       completely. Such documentation allows all parties to discover what is contained, including
       information that may have been hidden or obscured. Once all the information is exposed, data
       reduction can begin, thereby separating relevant from irrelevant information. The analysis
       process differs from examination in that it looks at the product of the examination for its
       significance and probative value to the case [ACPO]. Examination is a technical process that
       is the province of the forensic specialist. However, analysis may be done by roles other than
       the forensic analyst, such as the investigator or the forensic examiner. One individual may
       perform all the roles involved.

       The examination process begins after a forensic workstation has been set up with the
       appropriate tools and a copy of the evidence acquired from the device. If available, the
       examiner should have studied the case and become familiar with the parameters of the offence,
       the parties involved, and potential evidence that might be found. Conducting the examination
       in a partnership with the forensic analyst or the investigator guiding the case construction is
       advisable for the examiner. The investigator or analyst provides insight into the types of things
       sought, while the forensic examiner provides the means to find relevant information that might
       be on the system [Wol03].

       If the forensic examiner performs the analysis independently, without conferring with the
       forensic analyst or investigator, the knowledge gained by studying the case should provide
       ideas about the specific keywords or phrases to use when searching the image acquired from
       the device. Fortunately, compared with classical examination of individual workstations or
       network servers, the amount of acquired data, in terms of raw image size, is many times
       smaller (i.e., Mbytes vs. Gbytes).

       Depending on the type of case, the strategy varies. A case about child pornography may begin
       with browsing all of the graphic images on the system, while a case about an Internet-related
       offence might begin with browsing the Internet history files [Wol03]. Examination often
       reveals not only potentially incriminating data but also useful information such as passwords,
       network logon names, and Internet activity. In addition to evidence directly related to an
       incident, information can be uncovered about the lifestyle of a suspect, their associates, and the
       types of activities in which they are involved.

7.1   Locating Evidence

       Standard PDAs typically offer similar information handling features and capabilities, including
       Personal Information Management (PIM) applications, support for e-mail, and Web browsing.
       Hybrid devices that incorporate both PDA and cell phone functionality also exist. Potential
       evidence on these devices includes [DOJ01]:

               Address book                                              Documents

               Appointment                                               E-mail
               calendars/information
                                                                         Handwriting

                                                  45
