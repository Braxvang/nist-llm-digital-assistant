                                              TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



1.4     Document Structure

The remainder of this document is organized into seven major sections:

       Section 2 presents an overview of information security assessments, including policies, roles and
        responsibilities, methodologies, and techniques.
       Section 3 provides a detailed description of several technical examination techniques, including
        documentation review, log review, network sniffing, and file integrity checking.
       Section 4 describes several techniques for identifying targets and analyzing them for potential
        vulnerabilities. Examples of these techniques include network discovery and vulnerability
        scanning.
       Section 5 explains techniques commonly used to validate the existence of vulnerabilities, such as
        password cracking and penetration testing.
       Section 6 presents an approach and process for planning a security assessment.
       Section 7 discusses factors that are key to the execution of security assessments, including
        coordination, the assessment itself, analysis, and data handling.
       Section 8 presents an approach for reporting assessment findings, and provides an overview of
        remediation activities.
This guide also contains the following appendices:

       Appendix A describes two live operating system (OS) CD distributions that allow the user to boot
        a computer to a CD containing a fully operational OS and testing tools.
       Appendix B provides a template for creating Rules of Engagement (ROE).
       Appendix C briefly discusses application security assessment.
       Appendix D contains recommendations for performing remote access testing.
       Appendix E offers a list of resources that may facilitate the security assessment process.
       Appendix F features a glossary of terms used throughout this document.
       Appendix G provides a list of acronyms and abbreviations.
