                                                CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



Executive Summary

NIST Special Publication 800-34, Rev. 1, Contingency Planning Guide for Federal Information Systems,
provides instructions, recommendations, and considerations for federal information system contingency
planning. Contingency planning refers to interim measures to recover information system services after a
disruption. Interim measures may include relocation of information systems and operations to an
alternate site, recovery of information system functions using alternate equipment, or performance of
information system functions using manual methods. This guide addresses specific contingency planning
recommendations for three platform types and provides strategies and techniques common to all systems.

       Client/server systems;
       Telecommunications systems; and
       Mainframe systems.
This guide defines the following seven-step contingency planning process that an organization may apply
to develop and maintain a viable contingency planning program for their information systems. These
seven progressive steps are designed to be integrated into each stage of the system development life cycle.

    1. Develop the contingency planning policy statement. A formal policy provides the authority
       and guidance necessary to develop an effective contingency plan.

    2. Conduct the business impact analysis (BIA). The BIA helps identify and prioritize information
       systems and components critical to supporting the organization’s mission/business processes. A
       template for developing the BIA is provided to assist the user.

    3. Identify preventive controls. Measures taken to reduce the effects of system disruptions can
       increase system availability and reduce contingency life cycle costs.

    4. Create contingency strategies. Thorough recovery strategies ensure that the system may be
       recovered quickly and effectively following a disruption.

    5. Develop an information system contingency plan. The contingency plan should contain
       detailed guidance and procedures for restoring a damaged system unique to the system’s security
       impact level and recovery requirements.

    6. Ensure plan testing, training, and exercises. Testing validates recovery capabilities, whereas
       training prepares recovery personnel for plan activation and exercising the plan identifies
       planning gaps; combined, the activities improve plan effectiveness and overall organization
       preparedness.

    7. Ensure plan maintenance. The plan should be a living document that is updated regularly to
       remain current with system enhancements and organizational changes.

This guide presents three sample formats for developing an information system contingency plan based
on low-, moderate-, or high-impact level, as defined by Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems. Each
format defines three phases that govern actions to be taken following a system disruption. The
Activation/Notification Phase describes the process of activating the plan based on outage impacts and
notifying recovery personnel. The Recovery Phase details a suggested course of action for recovery
teams to restore system operations at an alternate site or using contingency capabilities. The final phase,
