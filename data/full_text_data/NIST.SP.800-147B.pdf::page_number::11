A Basic Server is architecturally similar to a client PC system with a single BIOS update mechanism.
The requirements for protecting BIOS updates for a Basic Server can be satisfied by meeting the
requirements listed in this document or those in Section 3.1 of NIST SP 800-147. Typically the Root of
Trust for Update (RTU) on a Basic Server is part of the system BIOS (see Section 2.5 for more on RTUs).

A Managed Server is a computer system with a dedicated management channel used for device
maintenance and additional server management features. In addition to host processors, a Managed Server
may have a Service Processor (see below) capable of performing system management, possibly including
BIOS updates. It is critical to prevent the execution of malicious or corrupt code on the Service Processor
since it has direct control over other operational aspects of the server. As a potential BIOS update
mechanism, the code executed on the Service Processor may contain an RTU and must be protected from
unauthorized modification.

A Blade Server is a specialized server hardware platform design that is configured as a mounted device
in a chassis/enclosure that can be installed in a rack system. These platforms often have shared power and
cooling and a shared management interface. Blades function either autonomously in a
chassis/enclosure/rack as a bank of servers or they may be controlled by a central bus manager. This
system configuration also may have multiple paths for updating the BIOS used to run the individual
blades. From the BIOS update perspective, a Blade Server is typically similar to a managed server.
Industry also uses the term multi-node (or modular) servers which have the same requirements as the
Blade Servers for BIOS protections.

Server architectures vary greatly. While most servers fit into one of the classes list above, in some cases
it may be difficult to classify a server as strictly belonging to one of those classes. The classes are
provided as examples to help clarify requirements, however the security guidelines in this document are
intended to have broad applicability to any type of server.

A server may have a Service Processor, sometimes called a Baseboard Management Controller, which is
a specialized microcontroller. The Service Processor is often a special add-in card or embedded on the
server motherboard. The Service Processor microcontroller runs a specialized operating system typically
stored in flash memory, and provides administrators with an interface to manage the host server. The
Service Processor is typically a highly privileged component in modern servers, often capable of updating
firmware and software on the system, changing configuration settings, and reading from system memory.
This document assumes administrators will implement proper computer, network, and physical security
controls to mitigate the unique risks to Service Processors. For instance, typically administrators interact
with the Service Processor over a network interface. Security best practices dictate that the Service
Processor should be on a private LAN accessible only to system administrators.

Service Processors are responsible for various features, depending on the implementation of the system.
The Service Processor will typically monitor various sensors in the server, such as temperature and power
sensors for thermal and power management. It might provide administrators with a mechanism to update
software or firmware on the server and host operating system. Maintaining the security of the Service
Processor is critical to maintaining the integrity and availability of the server. See Section 5 for security
requirements for Service Processors.

2.3   System BIOS Update Mechanisms
The guidelines in this publication are intended to secure BIOS update mechanisms so that only authentic,
authorized BIOS images are written to BIOS flash memory, a process sometimes referred to as “flashing”
the image. While client systems typically only have one path for updating the BIOS, server systems may
implement several update mechanisms to allow administrators to update the BIOS from different
