                                                                             GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


subnet mask, which denotes how many high-order bits of the address are assigned to the network address
(RFC 950). The remaining lower-order bits are used to identify the node.

Three primary subnet types or network classifications were designed for IPv4: Class A, Class B, and
Class C (RFC 791). Typically, Class A networks were assigned to the early pioneers of the Internet.
Class B networks typically were assigned to larger enterprises and service providers, and Class C network
addresses usually were allocated to smaller organizations and treated as subnets of larger networks. The
following are examples of IPv4 network addresses and their related subnet masks:

          Class A: 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 The first octet denotes the network and the remaining
           three octets (24 bits) are available to identify a node on that network. This means that over 16
           million host addresses are available on this single Class A network. Class A allocations were
           often made to organizations that could never put 16 million distinct host addresses to use.

          Class B: 172.30.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 The first two octets denote the network and the
           remaining two octets (16 bits) are available to identify a node on that network. More than
           65,000 distinct addresses are available to network nodes in each Class B network. As with
           Class A allocations, this also produced a wasteful situation, because many recipients of Class
           B address allocations did not need to employ more than a small fraction of the addresses.

          Class C: 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 The first three octets denote the network and
           the final octet (8 bits) is available to identify a node on that network. This provides 254
           addresses for allocation to network nodes (the all ones and all zeros addresses are reserved for
           other uses). More than two million Class C networks were available. Class C was the
           smallest, most granular network and host address allocation possible until the introduction of
           CIDR in 1993.

     3.1.6   IPv4 Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) Addressing

CIDR addresses do not follow the Class A/B/C model. Netmasks in CIDR addresses are not confined to
the octet boundaries of an IPv4 address. For example, the CIDR address 192.168.1.1/27 indicates that the
IP address is 192.168.1.1 and the netmask splits the address after the 27th bit.12 The first 27 bits are
designated for the network address, and the final five bits are available to provide 30 node or host
addresses within that network. This allows for a much more granular approach to address allocation
because ranges of addresses can be sized appropriately to the organization receiving them. Of equal
importance to address conservation is the related mechanism for routing efficiency that CIDR brings.
CIDR addressing allows multiple subnets, defined by common netmasks and having adjacent addresses,
to be supernetted together. This means that multiple networks are aggregated and reachable under one
routing table entry.

The Internet and many large enterprise networks are comprised of core routers (also known as backbone
routers) that move vast amounts of data between networks. These routers connect disparate networks and
thus make the Internet what it truly is: a network of networks. This same concept applies to large,
geographically dispersed enterprise networks. Core routers maintain large, complex routing tables that
contain accurate and timely information about how to reach nearly every network that is a part of the
global Internet.

The number of entries in these backbone routing tables has increased dramatically since CIDR addressing
was introduced in 1993 (RFC 4632), despite the best intentions of supernetting CIDR address space

      If written in the classful notation described previously, it would be represented as 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.224.
