                                                                       DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

                             2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                                along with the status word '90 00'.
                             3. From Step 3, the digitalSignature bit has been set. No other bits
                                have been set.

9.3.1.5 Certificate Policy

 Test Assertion              TA-09.03.01.05
 Purpose                     Verifies that the Derived PIV Authentication certificate asserts the
                             appropriate certificate policy OID.
 DTR(s)                      • DTR-07.03.01.06
 Issuer Documentation        None.
 Precondition(s)             • A token with the Derived PIV Application token is inserted
                                into an appropriate token reader.
                             • Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                                an instance of the reader.
                             • A Derived PIV Authentication certificate is present within the
                                Derived PIV Application.
 Test Scenario               1. Send the SELECT command with
                                   • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                             2. Send the GET DATA command with
                                   • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                      ('5FC105') of the X.509 Certificate for
                                      Derived PIV Authentication data object.
                             3. Extract the value of the certificatePolicies
                                extension from the certificate.
 Expected Result(s)          1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                                template with the status word '90 00'.
                             2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                                along with the status word '90 00'.
                             3. From Step 3, the certificatePolicies extension asserts either the
                                id-fpki-common-derived-pivAuth or id-fpki-common-derived-
                                pivAuth-hardware OID.

9.3.1.6 Authority Information Access Extension

 Test Assertion              TA-09.03.01.06
 Purpose                     Verifies that the authority information access extension in the
                             Derived PIV Authentication certificate is populated with: (i) the
                             location to the OCSP server that provides status information for
                             this certificate and (ii) the location to an HTTP accessible Web
                             server where certificates issued to the issuer of this certificate may
                             be found.
