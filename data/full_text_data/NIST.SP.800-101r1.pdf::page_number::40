                                                                 Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

themselves off if the battery level drops below a certain threshold to protect data stored in
volatile memory, which defeats the original purpose of keeping it turned on. Keeping such a
device in the active state is troublesome, requiring periodic interaction with the device. If
additional power cannot be supplied to a device and it is turned off to conserve power and
preserve memory contents, the risk of encountering a protection mechanism when turned on
again is likely. Moreover, authentication mechanisms, such as passwords, typically cannot be
deactivated without first satisfying the mechanism (e.g., supplying the correct password).

The time maintained on the mobile device may be set independently of that from the network.
Always record the date and time shown on the handset, if it is turned on, and compare them
with a reference clock, noting any inconsistencies. If the screen is dim due to power
management, it may be necessary to press an “insignificant” key, such as the volume key, to
light the screen.

Security mechanisms, key remapping and malicious programs may be present on mobile
devices. Certain types of modifications to the software applications and operating system of
the device might affect the way it is handled. The following is a list of examples of some
classes of modifications to consider:

         Security Enhancements – Organizations and individuals may enhance their handheld
          devices with add-on security mechanisms. A variety of login, biometric, and other
          authentication mechanisms are available for mobile devices may be as replacements
          or supplements to password mechanisms. Improper interaction with a mechanism
          could cause the device to lock down and even destroy its contents. This is particularly
          a concern with mechanisms that use security tokens whose presence is constantly
          monitored and whose disconnection from a card slot or other device interface is
          immediately acted upon.

         Malicious Programs – A mobile device may contain a virus or other malicious
          software. Such malware13 may attempt to spread to other devices over wired or
          wireless interfaces, including cross-platform jumps to completely different platforms.
          Common utilities or functions may also be intentionally replaced with versions of
          software designed to alter or damage data present on a mobile device. Such programs
          could conditionally be activated or suppressed based on conditions such as input
          parameters or hardware key interrupts. Watchdog applications could also be written to
          listen for specific events (e.g., key chords or over the air messages) and carry out
          actions such as deleting the contents of the device.

         Key Remapping – Hardware keys may be remapped to perform a different function
          than the default. A key press or combination of key presses intended for one purpose
          could launch an arbitrary program.

         Geo Fencing – Some devices may be configured to automatically wipe all data when
          the GPS in the device determines that it has left (or entered) a specific predetermined
          geographic area. This method may also employ WiFi towers for location
          determination as well.
