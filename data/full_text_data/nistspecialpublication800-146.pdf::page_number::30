                                                            CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



 Workload locations are hidden from clients (outsourced-community). The implications appear to
  be the same as for the outsourced private cloud scenario.
 Risks from multi-tenancy (outsourced-community). The implications appear to be the same as for
  the on-site community cloud scenario.
 Data import/export, and performance limitations (outsourced-community). The implications
  appear to be the same as for the outsourced private cloud scenario.
 Potentially strong security from external threats (outsourced-community). The implications
  appear to be the similar to those for the on-site community cloud scenario.
 Modest-to-significant up-front costs to migrate into the cloud (outsourced-community). The
  implications appear to be the same as for the outsourced private cloud scenario.
 Extensive resources available (outsourced-community). The implications appear to be the same as
  for the outsourced private cloud scenario.
4.6   The Public Cloud Scenario

Figure 7 depicts a public cloud. This diagram is essentially similar to Figure 1 except that a consumer
facility implementing a security perimeter is shown. In the case of a public cloud, however, more
statements can be made based on the diagram than could be made based on Figure 1. For example, in the
public setting, the provider's computing and storage resources are potentially large; the communication
links can be assumed to be implemented over the public Internet; and the cloud serves a diverse pool of
clients (and possibly attackers).




                                          Figure 7: Public Cloud

As with the other scenarios, although the general statements remain true for the public cloud scenario, the
public cloud scenario also allows for a more detailed view of some of the general statements:
