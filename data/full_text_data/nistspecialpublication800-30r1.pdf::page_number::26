2.4 APPLICATION OF RISK ASSESSMENTS
As stated previously, risk assessments can be conducted at all three tiers in the risk management
hierarchyâ€”organization level, mission/business process level, and information system level.
Figure 4 illustrates the risk management hierarchy defined in NIST Special Publication 800-39,
which provides multiple risk perspectives from the strategic level to the tactical level. Traditional
risk assessments generally focus at the Tier 3 level (i.e., information system level) and as a result,
tend to overlook other significant risk factors that may be more appropriately assessed at the Tier
1 or Tier 2 levels (e.g., exposure of a core mission/business function to an adversarial threat based
on information system interconnections).

                                   FIGURE 4: RISK MANAGEMENT HIERARCHY

Risk assessments support risk response decisions at the different tiers of the risk management
hierarchy. At Tier 1, risk assessments can affect, for example: (i) organization-wide information
security programs, policies, procedures, and guidance; (ii) the types of appropriate risk responses
(i.e., risk acceptance, avoidance, mitigation, sharing, or transfer); (iii) investment decisions for
information technologies/systems; (iv) procurements; (v) minimum organization-wide security
controls; (vi) conformance to enterprise/security architectures; and (vii) monitoring strategies and
ongoing authorizations of information systems and common controls. At Tier 2, risk assessments
can affect, for example: (i) enterprise architecture/security architecture design decisions; (ii) the
selection of common controls; (iii) the selection of suppliers, services, and contractors to support
organizational missions/business functions; (iv) the development of risk-aware mission/business
processes; and (v) the interpretation of information security policies with respect to organizational
information systems and environments in which those systems operate. Finally, at Tier 3, risk
assessments can affect, for example: (i) design decisions (including the selection, tailoring, and
supplementation of security controls and the selection of information technology products for
organizational information systems); (ii) implementation decisions (including whether specific
information technology products or product configurations meet security control requirements);
and (iii) operational decisions (including the requisite level of monitoring activity, the frequency
of ongoing information system authorizations, and system maintenance decisions).
