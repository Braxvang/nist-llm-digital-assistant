                                                  Federal Information Systems and Organizations




In addition to malware detection, a variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate
the effects of malicious code attacks. Used in conjunction with configuration management and
control procedures and strong software integrity controls, malware detection mechanisms can be
even more effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. Additional risk mitigation
measures, such as secure coding practices, trusted procurement processes, and regular monitoring
of secure configurations, can help to ensure that unauthorized functions are not performed.

The implementation and effective use of malware detection technologies can assist organizations
in automating the implementation, assessment, and continuous monitoring of several NIST SP
800-53 security controls, including CA-2, Security Assessments; CA-7, Continuous Monitoring;
IR-5, Incident Monitoring; RA-3, Risk Assessment; SA-12, Supply Chain Protection; SA-13,
Trustworthiness; SI-3, Malicious Code Protection; SI-4, Information System Monitoring; SI-7,
Software and Information Integrity; and SI-8, Spam Protection. Malware detection technologies
may also provide supporting data to assist organizations in meeting US-CERT incident reporting
requirements and in responding to OMB and agency CIO reporting requirements related to
incident management, remote access, and boundary protections.

D.1.4 ASSET MANAGEMENT
Asset management tools help maintain inventory of software and hardware within the
organization. This can be accomplished via a combination of system configuration, network
management, and license management tools, or with a special-purpose tool. Asset management
software tracks the life cycle of an organization’s assets and provides tools such as remote
management of assets and various automated management functions.

The implementation and effective use of asset management technologies can assist organizations
in automating the implementation, assessment, and continuous monitoring of several NIST SP
800-53 security controls including CA-7, Continuous Monitoring; CM-2, Baseline Configuration;
CM-3, Configuration Change Control; CM-4, Security Impact Analysis; CM-8, Information
System Component Inventory; and SA-10, Developer Configuration Management.

D.1.5 CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
Configuration management tools allow administrators to configure settings, monitor changes to
settings, collect setting status, and restore settings as needed. Managing the numerous
configurations found within information systems and network components has become almost
impossible using manual methods. Automated solutions may lower the cost of configuration
management efforts while enhancing efficiency and improving reliability.

System configuration scanning tools provide the automated capability to audit and assess a target
system to determine its compliance with a defined secure baseline configuration. A user may
confirm compliance with, and identify deviations from, checklists appropriate for relevant
operating systems and/or applications.

If an information system or system component is unknowingly out of synchronization with the
approved secure configurations as defined by the organization’s baseline configurations and the
System Security Plan, organization officials and system owners may have a false sense of
security. An opportunity to take actions that would otherwise limit vulnerabilities and help protect
the organization from attack would subsequently be missed. Monitoring activities offer the
organization better visibility into the state of security for its information systems, as defined by
the security metrics being monitored.
