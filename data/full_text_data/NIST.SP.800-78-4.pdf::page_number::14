4       Certificate Status Information

The FIPS 201-2 functional component PIV Card Issuance and Management Subsystem generates
and distributes status information for PIV asymmetric keys, other than PIV Secure Messaging
keys. FIPS 201-2 mandates two formats for certificate status information:

    +    X.509 CRLs; and
    +    OCSP status response messages.
The CRLs and OCSP status responses shall be digitally signed to support authentication and
integrity using a key size and hash algorithm that satisfy the requirements for signing PIV
information, as specified in Table 3-2, and that are at least as large as the key size and hash
algorithm used to sign the certificate.

CRLs and OCSP messages rely on object identifiers to specify which signature algorithm was
used to generate the digital signature. The object identifiers specified in Table 3-3 must be used
in CRLs and OCSP messages to identify the signature algorithm.
