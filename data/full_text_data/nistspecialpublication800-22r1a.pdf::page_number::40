A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS




(2)     Calculate the number of occurrences of B in each of the N blocks. The search for matches
        proceeds by creating an m-bit window on the sequence, comparing the bits within that window
        against B and incrementing a counter when there is a match. The window slides over one bit after
        each examination, e.g., if m = 4 and the first window contains bits 42 to 45, the next window
        consists of bits 43 to 46. Record the number of occurrences of B in each block by incrementing
        an array vi (where i = 0,…5), such that v0 is incremented when there are no occurrences of B in a
        substring, v1 is incremented for one occurrence of B,…and v5 is incremented for 5 or more
        occurrences of B.

        For the above example, if m = 2 and B = 11, then the examination of the first block (1011101111)
        proceeds as follows:

                        Bit Positions         Bits         No. of occurrences of B = 11
                             1-2               10                        0
                             2-3               01                        0
                             3-4             11 (hit)              Increment to 1
                             4-5             11 (hit)              Increment to 2
                             5-6               10                        2
                             6-7               01                        2
                             7-8             11 (hit)              Increment to 3
                             8-9             11 (hit)              Increment to 4
                            9-10             11 (hit)              Increment to 5

        Thus, after block 1, there are five occurrences of 11, v5 is incremented, and v0 = 0, v1 = 0, v2 = 0,
        v3 = 0, v4 = 0, and v5 = 1.

        In a like manner, blocks 2-5 are examined. In block 2, there are 2 occurrences of 11; v2 is
        incremented. In block 3, there are 3 occurrences of 11; v3 is incremented. In block 4, there are 4
        occurrences of 11; v4 is incremented. In block 5, there is one occurrence of 11; v1 is incremented.

        Therefore, v0 = 0, v1 = 1, v2 =1, v3 = 1, v4 = 1, v5 = 1 after all blocks have been examined.

(3)     Compute values for λ and η that will be used to compute the theoretical probabilities πi
        corresponding to the classes of v0:
                                    λ = (M-m+1)/2m         η = λ/2.

        For the example in this section, λ = (10-2+1)/22 = 2.25, and η = λ/2=1.125.


                    2
                                 5     (vi − Nπ i )2
(4)     Compute χ ( obs ) = ∑                          , where π0 = 0.364091, π1 = 0.185659, π2 = 0.139381, π3
                                i =0       Nπ i
        = 0.100571, π4 = 0.070432 and π5 = 0.139865 as specified in Section 3.8.

        For the example in this section, the values of πi were recomputed, since the example doesn’t fit
        the requirements stated in Section 2.8.7. The example is intended only for illustration. The values
        of πi are: π0 = 0.324652, π1 = 0.182617, π2 = 0.142670, π3 = 0.106645, π4 = 0.077147, and π5 =
        0.166269.
