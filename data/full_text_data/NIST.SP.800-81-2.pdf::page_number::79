                                                          SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



        •   RSASHA512

        •   ECDSAP256SHA256


    bits (key size) for the –b parameter has the following ranges:

        •   [512..4096] for RSASHA1 and RSASHA256, etc.

        •   [512..1024] for DSA (must be divisible by 64)

        •   [] for ECDSA
    Note: Even though the key generation utility allows for key sizes smaller than the approved size, US
    Federal DNS administrators shall only generate keys with approved lengths for use to sign their DNS
    zone [800-57P3].

    type for the –n parameter can be one of ZONE | HOST

    name is the owner of the key (usually the domain name in the zone apex).

This command generates two files—one containing the public key and the other the associated private
key. The generic names for these files are as follows:

        K<domain_name>+algorithm_id+Key_id.key
        K<domain_name>+algorithm_id+Key_id.private

The domain_name is the value of the name parameter specified on the command line. Example algorithm
IDs are:

        003 – DSA

        005 – RSASHA1

        008 – RSASHA256

The key_id is the unique identifier for the key generated by the program.

For example, to generate a ZSK keyset of length 1024 bits that uses the RSASHA256 algorithm suite for
signing the zone example.com, the following command would be issued:

        dnssec-keygen –a RSASHA256 –b 1024 –n ZONE example.com

For this command, the following files containing the private and public keys, respectively, are generated:

        Kexample.com.+008+28345.private
        Kexample.com.+008+28345.key

In these file names, 005 stands for the algorithm_id and 28345 is the unique key ID.

In the *.key file, the public key information is expressed in the same syntax as that of a zone file RR. The
content of the file Kexample.com.+005+28345.key will be:


                                                    9-7
