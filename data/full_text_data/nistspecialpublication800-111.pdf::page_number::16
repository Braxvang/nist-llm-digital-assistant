computer or shutting it down. Delays may also occur when using hibernation 18 features, because the FDE
software has to encrypt and decrypt the large hibernation file (which includes a copy of the computer’s
memory) that is stored on the hard drive. The length of delays is dependent on the size of memory, the
hard drive’s size and speed, and other factors.

Because FDE alters how a computer boots, it can cause operational problems. For example, modifying
the MBR can prevent computers with dual-boot configurations from functioning properly, 19 and storing
the PBE in the space between the MBR and the boot sector can cause conflicts with other software, such
as disk-level software tools, that also store code in that space. FDE-protected devices may also have
problems with asset management tools and the use of wake-on-LAN. 20

FDE software is most commonly used on desktop and laptop computers. The requirement for pre-boot
authentication means that users have to be able to authenticate using the most fundamental components of
a device, such as a standard keyboard—because the OS is not loaded, OS-level drivers are unavailable.
For example, a PDA or smart phone could not display a keyboard on the screen for entering a password
because that is an OS-level capability.

As mentioned at the beginning of the section, FDE can also be built into a hard drive disk controller. 21
Hardware and software-based FDE offer similar capabilities through different mechanisms. When a user
tries to boot a device protected with hardware-based FDE, the hard drive prompts the user to authenticate
before it allows an OS to load. The FDE capability is built into the hardware in such a way that it cannot
be disabled or removed from the drive. The encryption code and authenticators, such as passwords and
cryptographic keys, are stored securely on the hard drive. Because the decryption and encryption is
performed by the hard drive itself, with no OS participation, typically there is very little performance
impact.

     Hibernation refers to saving the state of the computer, including the contents of memory, and placing the computer in a low
     power-usage mode that uses just enough power to maintain its state. Depending on the OS, hibernation mode may also be
     called sleep, standby, or suspend mode; however, some of these terms do not have universally accepted definitions, and
     some OSs have features with these names that do not actually write memory out to a file. Modes that do not write memory
     to a file should not be used with FDE software because the FDE software will not protect the data in these modes.
19
     Dual-boot computers usually modify the MBR to enable users to select which OS will be booted. The details of this depend
     on the OSs and any utilities used to manage the disk partitions. Using FDE with a dual-boot computer increases the
     complexity of the configuration and the likelihood for errors that cause loss of data or loss of availability.
20
     The problem with wake-on-LAN technologies is the requirement to perform PBA before booting the system. Some FDE
     products can be configured to skip PBA when wake-on-LAN is used, either every time or for a certain number of reboots.
     Access to the OS logon can be suppressed to somewhat compensate for the lack of PBA. However, skipping PBA during
     wake-on-LAN still introduces additional risk, because an attacker that takes a device that is configured this way could easily
     set up wake-on-LAN services, circumvent PBA, and use forensic tools to gain access to the device’s information.
     Organizations should carefully consider these risks before using wake-on-LAN for FDE-protected devices.
21
     As of mid-2007, few hardware-based FDE products were yet available, but vendors had announced that several additional
     products would be available in the coming months.
