In some implementations, the STA does not have access to IP network services until it successfully
authenticates with an AS. When IP services are unavailable, the most common approach is to use EAP
over LAN (EAPOL) encapsulation, which enables EAP to be transported in the frames of IEEE 802 link
layer protocols. EAPOL is defined in IEEE 802.1X. The WLAN vendor’s EAP implementation typically
will determine whether the transport mechanism is EAP over RADIUS or EAPOL.

6.5   Summary

Defined in RFC 3748, EAP is used during the authentication phase of an IEEE 802.11 RSN and provides
the authentication framework for IEEE 802.11 RSNs that use IEEE 802.1X port-based access control.
EAP can be adapted to new authentication methods as they become available and can operate over a
variety of different network and link layer protocols, including IP and IEEE 802-series medium access
protocols. For these reasons, EAP is well-suited to providing authentication services for WLANs.

EAP defines the stages of an EAP conversation that consists of one or more EAP methods. The EAP
methods perform the authentication transaction and generate key material. While the basic rules of the
EAP conversation are common to all EAP implementations, the EAP methods can vary from one
implementation to another, requiring different levels of user interaction, using different authentication
methods, and employing different cipher suites. This flexibility has benefits, but it may also introduce
risk. To maintain security, organizations should select EAP methods appropriate to their environment.

IANA has defined numerous EAP method types, but not all of these are appropriate for WLAN
applications. For example, RFC 3748 defines three methods—MD5-Challenge, One-Time Password, and
Generic Token Card—but none of these can satisfy the necessary security requirements for WLANs.
