OT Discussion: Shutting down and restarting the OT may not always be feasible upon the
identification of an anomaly. These actions should be scheduled according to OT operational
requirements.

             AUTHENTICATION

OT Discussion: The organization determines whether the use of integrity verification
applications would adversely impact operation of the ICS and employs compensating controls
(e.g., manual integrity verifications that do not affect performance).
Control Enhancements: (1) OT Discussion: The organization ensures that the use of integrity
verification applications does not adversely impact the operational performance of the OT.
Control Enhancement: (2) OT Discussion: When the organization cannot employ automated
tools that provide notifications about integrity discrepancies, the organization employs
nonautomated mechanisms or procedures. Example compensating controls include performing
scheduled manual inspections for integrity violations.
Control Enhancement: (5) OT Discussion: Shutting down and restarting the ICS may not always
be feasible upon identification of an anomaly. These actions should be scheduled according to
ICS operational requirements.
Control Enhancement: (7) OT Discussion: When the ICS cannot detect unauthorized security-
relevant changes, the organization employs compensating controls (e.g., manual procedures) in
accordance with the general tailoring guidance.
Control Enhancement: (15) OT Discussion: Code authentication provides assurance that the
software and firmware have not been tampered with. If automated mechanisms are not available,
organizations could manually verify code authentication by using a combination of techniques,
