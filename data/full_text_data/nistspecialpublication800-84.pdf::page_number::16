Once the TT&E policy is developed, the policy statement should be updated as new guidance is applied to
or impacts the program.

2.2     Identify TT&E Roles and Responsibilities

The office with primary oversight of and responsibility for a TT&E program varies based on the structure
or requirements of the organization. In many organizations, it is led within the Office of the Chief
Information Officer (OCIO). The TT&E program should be managed by a person or team with direct
responsibility for the organization’s IT planning capability. The program should have an IT plan
coordinator who is responsible for all aspects of IT planning, including the TT&E element of maintaining
the IT plans. The IT plan coordinator has overall responsibility for the IT plans, including development,
implementation, and maintenance. One of the IT plan coordinator’s responsibilities is to identify a TT&E
program coordinator, who is responsible for developing a TT&E plan and coordinating events. To plan
and conduct TT&E events, the TT&E program coordinator works with event design teams. Organizations
might elect to purchase specialized software or obtain external support to assist in forming or staffing
these teams. Sections 4 through 6 contain information on the individual design teams and the roles within
each team.

2.3     Establish Overall TT&E Schedule

The TT&E plan should document the projected schedule of activities to be performed within the TT&E
program. Although events should be conducted as needed, organizations should evaluate the required
frequency of its events and document the frequency of each event in a TT&E schedule. For example,
NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 requires Federal agencies to conduct exercises or tests for their
systems’ contingency plans and incident response capabilities at least annually. Sections 4 through 6
provide additional detail on how to evaluate an organization’s specific TT&E needs.

2.4     Document TT&E Event Methodology

As part of creating a TT&E program, an organization should select and document a high-level
methodology for planning and performing TT&E events. Figure 2-1 shows one commonly used
methodology, which has four phases:

       Design the event. The TT&E program coordinator works with the plan coordinator to determine
        the TT&E event topic and scope based on the current needs of the organization. Examples of
        topics include training personnel on their specific roles and responsibilities within an IT plan,
        exercising response procedures, and testing a specific system. Next, the TT&E program
        coordinator identifies the objectives based on the topic and scope, and the personnel that should
        participate in the event. The TT&E program coordinator also identifies an event design team,
        which may consist of one person or a group of people, depending on the requirements of the
        event. The TT&E program coordinator oversees the event logistics, which could include
        document printing, room setup, meals, and audiovisual equipment.
       Develop the event documentation. Upon completion of the design phase, the TT&E program
        coordinator works with the design team on the development of the documentation to be used
        before, during, and after the event. The types of documentation vary for each type of event, but
