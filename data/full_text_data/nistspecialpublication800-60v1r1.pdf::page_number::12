2.0 PUBLICATION OVERVIEW
Security categorization provides a vital step in integrating security into the government agency’s
business and information technology management functions and establishes the foundation for
security standardization amongst their information systems. Security categorization starts with
the identification of what information supports which government lines of business, as defined
by the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA). Subsequent steps focus on the evaluation of the
need for security in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The result is strong
linkage between missions, information, and information systems with cost effective information
security.

2.1 Agencies Support the Security Categorization Process
Agencies support the categorization process by establishing mission-based information types for
the organization. The approach to establishing mission-based information types at an agency
begins by documenting the agency’s mission and business areas. In the case of mission-based
information, the responsible individuals, in coordination with management, operational,
enterprise architecture, and security stakeholders, should compile a comprehensive set of the
agency’s lines of business and mission areas. In addition, responsible individuals should identify
the applicable sub-functions necessary to accomplish the organization’s mission. For example,
one organization’s mission might be related to economic development. Sub-functions that are
part of the organization’s economic development mission might include business and industry
development, intellectual property protection, or financial sector oversight. Each of these sub-
functions represents an information type.

Agencies should conduct FIPS 199 security categorizations of their information systems as an
agency-wide activity with the involvement of the senior leadership and other key officials within
the organization (e.g., mission and business owners, authorizing officials, risk executive, chief
information officer, senior agency information security officer, information system owners, and
information owners) to ensure that each information system receives the appropriate
management oversight and reflects the needs of the organization as a whole. Senior leadership
oversight in the security categorization process is essential so that the next steps in the NIST
Risk Management Framework 4 (e.g., security control selection) can be carried out in an effective
and consistent manner throughout the agency.

2.2 Value to Agency Missions, Security Programs and IT Management
Federal agencies are heavily dependent upon information and information systems to
successfully conduct critical missions. With an increasing reliability on and growing complexity
of information systems as well as a constantly changing risk environment, information security
has become a mission-essential function. This function must be conducted in a manner that
reduces the risks to the information entrusted to the agency, its overall mission, and its ability to
do business and to serve the American public. In the end, information security, as a function,
becomes a business enabler through diligent and effective management of risk to information
confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
