Appendix B—Terms, Acronyms, and Notation

B.1            Terms

Application Identifier   A globally unique identifier of a card application as defined in ISO/IEC 7816-4.

Algorithm Identifier     A PIV algorithm identifier is a one-byte identifier that specifies a cryptographic
                         algorithm and key size. For symmetric cryptographic operations, the algorithm
                         identifier also specifies a mode of operation (i.e., ECB).

Authenticable Entity     An entity that can successfully participate in an authentication protocol with a
                         card application.

BER-TLV Data Object A data object coded according to ISO/IEC 8825-2.

Card                     An integrated circuit card.

Card Application         A set of data objects and card commands that can be selected using an
                         application identifier.

Card Management          Any operation involving the PIV Card Application Administrator.
Operation

Card Verifiable          A certificate stored on the card that includes a public key, the signature of a
Certificate              certification authority, and further information needed to verify the certificate.

Data Object              An item of information seen at the card command interface for which is specified
                         a name, a description of logical content, a format, and a coding.

Key Reference            A PIV key reference is a one-byte identifier that specifies a cryptographic key
                         according to its PIV Key Type. The identifier is part of cryptographic material
                         used in a cryptographic protocol such as an authentication or a signing protocol.

MAC Chaining Value MAC Chaining Value is a 16-byte value that is input to the CMAC function. It is
                   used to detect communication errors in duplicate or missing commands.

Object Identifier        A globally unique identifier of a data object as defined in ISO/IEC 8824-2.

Reference Data           Cryptographic material used in the performance of a cryptographic protocol such
                         as an authentication or a signing protocol. The reference data length is the
                         maximum length of a password or PIN. For algorithms, the reference data length
                         is the length of a key.

Status Word              Two bytes returned by an integrated circuit card after processing any command
                         that signify the success of or errors encountered during said processing.

Template                 A (constructed) BER-TLV data object whose value field contains specific BER-
                         TLV data objects.
