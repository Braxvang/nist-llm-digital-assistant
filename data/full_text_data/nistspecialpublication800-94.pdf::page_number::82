GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



7.3.2    Operation

Host-based IDPSs should be operated according to the recommendations presented in Section 3.3.2. The
only exception is in updating the agents. Some agents can periodically check the management server for
updates and automatically retrieve and install or apply those updates. Other agents cannot do this,
requiring an administrator to manually check for, transfer, and install or apply updates. In many cases, an
agent’s update capability is related to the type of operating system on which it is deployed.

7.4     Summary

Host-based IDPSs monitors the characteristics of a single host and the events occurring within that host
for suspicious activity. Examples of the types of characteristics a host-based IDPS might monitor are
wired and wireless network traffic, system logs, running processes, file access and modification, and
system and application configuration changes. Most host-based IDPSs have detection software known as
agents installed on the hosts of interest. Each agent monitors activity on a single host and if prevention
capabilities are enabled, also performs prevention actions. The agents transmit data to management
servers. Each agent is typically designed to protect a server, a desktop or laptop, or an application
service.

The network architecture for host-based IDPS deployments is typically very simple. Because the agents
are deployed to existing hosts on the organization’s networks, the components usually communicate over
those networks instead of using a management network. Host-based IDPS agents are most commonly
deployed to critical hosts such as publicly accessible servers and servers containing sensitive information.
However, because agents are available for various server and desktop/laptop operating systems, as well as
specific server applications, organizations could potentially deploy agents to most of their servers and
desktops/laptops. Organizations should consider several criteria when selecting agent locations, including
the need to analyze activity that cannot be monitored by other security controls; the cost of the agents’
deployment, maintenance, and monitoring; the OSs and applications supported by the agents; the
importance of each host’s data or services; and the ability of the network infrastructure to support the
agents’ communications.

Most IDPS agents alter the internal architecture of the hosts on which they are installed through shims,
which are layers of code placed between existing layers of code. Although it is less intrusive to the host
to perform monitoring without shims, which reduces the possibility of the IDPS interfering with the
host’s normal operations, monitoring without shims is also generally less accurate at detecting threats and
often precludes the performance of effective prevention actions.

Host-based IDPSs provide a variety of security capabilities. They typically perform extensive logging of
data related to detected events and can detect several types of malicious activity. Detection techniques
used include code analysis, network traffic analysis, network traffic filtering, filesystem monitoring, log
analysis, and network configuration monitoring. Host-based IDPSs that use combinations of several
detection techniques should generally be capable of achieving more accurate detection than products that
use one or a few techniques, because each technique can monitor different characteristics of hosts.
Organizations should determine which characteristics need to be monitored and select IDPS products that
provide adequate monitoring and analysis of those characteristics.

Host-based IDPSs usually require considerable tuning and customization. For example, many rely on
observing host activity and developing baselines or profiles of expected behavior. Others need to be
configured with detailed policies that define exactly how each application on a host should behave. As
the host environment changes, administrators should ensure that host-based IDPS policies are updated to
take those changes into account.
