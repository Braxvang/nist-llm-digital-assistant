SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


   5. Assist Agencies in performing an initial assessment of their FCKMSs to clearly
      understand where potential gap areas might exist, where there are areas for potential
      improvements and to understand requirements for future migrations, procurements
      and upgrades to their FCKMSs.

Designing a secure CKMS is the responsibility of CKMS designers, who must choose among
various key-management capabilities to be included in a product being designed for a
particular market. Purchasing an acceptable FCKMS or FCKMS service is the responsibility
of Federal procurement officials and their technical associates. Managing/administering an
FCKMS is the responsibility of appropriate FCKMS service providers when installing,
configuring, operating, and maintaining an FCKMS.

This Profile is based on the Framework, and readers of this Profile are strongly encouraged to
be familiar with the information in the Framework. The Framework contains tutorial
information that may be needed to understand the cryptographic key-management topics of
this Profile. This Profile introduces each topic that is also covered in the Framework.

The Framework and this Profile could be used by other organizations that have security
requirements similar to those specified in these documents, and the Profile could be used as a
model for the development of other profiles.

1.1   Profile Terminology

The Profile often uses terminology that is not used in the Framework. A glossary of terms is
provided in Appendix B, but some of the more general terms merit an introduction below.

“CKMS” is used to mean any Cryptographic Key Management System that satisfies the
requirements of the Framework. The term refers to the system that is designed and
implemented, possibly with configurable options.

An “FCKMS” performs the key and metadata functions that are the foundation of all
cryptographic key-management services needed by one or more Federal service-using
organizations and their employees.

An FCKMS includes a CKMS, possibly after configuring the CKMS functions to support the
desired services of a Federal service-using organization. An FCKMS also meets all the
requirements of this Profile for its impact-level and provides FCKMS services for a U.S.
Federal organization and/or its contractors.

This Profile uses the terms “FCKMS service-providing organization” (or “FCKMS service
provider”) and “FCKMS service-using organization”. An FCKMS service provider may be a
part of an FCKMS service-using organization or may be an independent organization
providing the services required by FCKMS service-using organizations (e.g., under contract).
Federal CKMS service providers may be Federal organizations, Federal contractors, or both.
This Profile includes requirements for both FCKMS service providers and FCKMS service-
using organizations.
