owners, chief information officers, chief information security officers, information system

•   Establish risk management roles and responsibilities;
•   Develop and implement an organization-wide risk management strategy that guides and
    informs organizational risk decisions (including how risk is framed, assessed, responded to,
    and monitored over time);
•   Manage threat and vulnerability information with regard to organizational information
    systems and the environments in which the systems operate;
•   Establish organization-wide forums to consider all types and sources of risk (including
    aggregated risk);
•   Determine organizational risk based on the aggregated risk from the operation and use of
    information systems and the respective environments of operation;
•   Provide oversight for the risk management activities carried out by organizations to ensure
    consistent and effective risk-based decisions;
•   Develop a greater understanding of risk with regard to the strategic view of organizations and
    their integrated operations;
•   Establish effective vehicles and serve as a focal point for communicating and sharing risk-
    related information among key stakeholders internally and externally to organizations;
•   Specify the degree of autonomy for subordinate organizations permitted by parent
    organizations with regard to framing, assessing, responding to, and monitoring risk;
•   Promote cooperation and collaboration among authorizing officials to include security
    authorization actions requiring shared responsibility (e.g., joint/leveraged authorizations);
•   Ensure that security authorization decisions consider all factors necessary for mission and
    business success; and
•   Ensure shared responsibility for supporting organizational missions and business functions
    using external providers receives the needed visibility and is elevated to appropriate decision-
    making authorities.

The risk executive (function) presumes neither a specific organizational structure nor formal
responsibility assigned to any one individual or group within the organization. Heads of agencies
or organizations may choose to retain the risk executive (function) or to delegate the function.
The risk executive (function) requires a mix of skills, expertise, and perspectives to understand
the strategic goals and objectives of organizations, organizational missions/business functions,
technical possibilities and constraints, and key mandates and guidance that shape organizational
operations. To provide this needed mixture, the risk executive (function) can be filled by a single
individual or office (supported by an expert staff) or by a designated group (e.g., a risk board,
executive steering committee, executive leadership council). The risk executive (function) fits
into the organizational governance structure in such a way as to facilitate efficiency and
effectiveness.
