7. Reporting

     Reporting is the process of preparing a detailed summary of all the steps taken and conclusions
     reached in the investigation of a case. Reporting depends on maintaining a careful record of all
     actions and observations, describing the results of tests and examinations, and explaining the
     inferences drawn from the data. A good report relies on solid documentation, notes,
     photographs and tool-generated content.

     Reporting occurs once the data has been thoroughly searched and relevant items bookmarked.
     Many forensic tools come with a built-in reporting facility that usually follows predefined
     templates and may allow customization of the report structure. Permitted customizations
     include allowing for organization logos and report headers and selection of styles and structure
     to provide a more professional look tailored to the organization’s needs. Reports generated by
     a forensic tool typically include items from the case file, such as the specialist’s name, a case
     number, a date and title, the categories of evidence, and the relevant evidence found. Report
     generation typically either outputs all of the data obtained or allows examiners to select
     relevant data (i.e., bookmarked items) for the final report. Including only relevant findings in
     the report minimizes its size and lessens confusion for the reader.

     The software-generated contents are only one part of the overall report. The final report
     contains the software-generated contents along with data accumulated throughout the
     investigation that summarizes the actions taken, the analysis done, and the relevance of the
     evidence uncovered. Ideally, the supporting documentation is in electronic form and able to be
     incorporated directly into the report.

     Reporting facilities vary significantly across mobile device acquisition applications. Report
     generation typically can render a complete report in one of several common formats (e.g., .txt,
     .csv, .doc, .html, .pdf) or at least provide a means to export out individual data items to
     compose a report manually. A few tools include no means of report generation or data export
     and instead require examiners to capture individual screenshots of the tool interface for later
     assembly into a report format. Regardless of how reports are generated, checking that the
     finalized report is consistent with the data presented in the user interface representation is vital
     to identify and eliminate any possible inconsistencies that may appear [Aye11].

     The ability to modify a pre-existing report and incorporate data (e.g., images, video stills)
     captured by alternative means is advantageous. Auxiliary acquisition techniques are sometime
     required to recover specific data types, as mentioned earlier. For example, video recording a
     manual examination documents the recovery of data that the automated forensic tool may not
     have acquired. Video editing software allows still images to be captured for inclusion into the
     report. Pictures could also be taken of the manual exam using a digital camera; though this
     process is less efficient and may not document the entire process, it may be the only method
     available.

     The type of data determines whether it is presentable in a hard-copy format. Today, many
     popular mobile devices are capable of capturing audio and video. Such evidentiary data (e.g.,
     audio, video) cannot easily be presented in a printed format and instead should be included
     with the finalized report on removable media (e.g., CD-R, DVD-R, or flash drive) along with
     the appropriate application for proper display.
