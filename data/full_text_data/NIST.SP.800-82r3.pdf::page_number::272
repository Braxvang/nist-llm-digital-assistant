NIST SP 800-82r3                                               Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

OT Discussion: The OT Discussion for IA-2, Identification and Authentication (Organizational
Users) is applicable for non-organizational users.
Control Enhancement: (1) OT Discussion: Acceptance of PIV credentials is only required for
organizations that follow OMB Memorandum M-19-17 [OMB-M1917] (e.g., federal agencies
and contractors).
Control Enhancement: (2) (4) OT Discussion: Example compensating controls include
implementing support external to the OT and multi-factor authentication.

OT Discussion: Identity proofing is likely performed by different departments within the
organization. Existing organizational systems (e.g., HR or IT processes) should be leveraged to
perform this control.
Control Enhancement: (1) OT Discussion: Maintenance, engineering, or third-party
organizations may require OT access in order to support operations. The organization should
determine the AO for proving identity prior to allowing access to the OT environment. Consider
obtaining supervisor or sponsor authorization, where the sponsor may be someone within
operations.
Control Enhancement: (2) (3) (4) (5) OT Discussion: If the organization already performs these
controls, existing organizational processes should be leveraged. For example, HR may provide a
system for tracking identity evidence. OT does not need to develop an independent system for
achieving this control.
