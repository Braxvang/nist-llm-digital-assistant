                                        GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



2.     Establishing a Test, Training, and Exercise Program

An organization’s IT plans need to be maintained to sustain the organization’s ability to prepare for,
respond to, manage, and recover from disasters affecting its mission. 2 Common types of IT plans used
for this purpose are as follows:

      Contingency plan: Recovering and reconstituting IT systems. 3 Contingency plans include
       continuity of operations plans, business continuity plans, and disaster recovery plans.
      Incident response plan: Reporting and managing computer security incidents. 4
The following are the major types of events used to maintain these plans:

      Tests. A test is an evaluation tool that uses quantifiable metrics to validate the operability of a
       system or system component in an operational environment specified in an IT plan. 5 For
       example, an organization could test if call tree cascades can be executed within prescribed time
       limits; another test would be removing power from a system or system component. The
       quantifiable metrics are created by developing a test plan that identifies the systems or
       components to be tested (and the components of any systems being tested) and the overall test
       objectives. Testing that results in components or systems malfunctioning or becoming inoperable
       could indicate problems in personnel training or in IT plans and procedures. Tests often focus on
       recovery and backup operations; however, testing varies depending on the goal of the test and its
       relation to a specific IT plan. Section 6 contains detailed information about testing.
      Training. For the purposes of this publication, training refers only to informing personnel of
       their roles and responsibilities within a particular IT plan, such as decision making, and teaching
       them skills related to those roles and responsibilities. 6 This prepares the personnel for
       participation in exercises, tests, and actual emergency situations related to the IT plan. Training
       personnel on their roles and responsibilities before an exercise or test event is typically split
       between a presentation on their roles and responsibilities, and activities that allow personnel to
       demonstrate their understanding of the subject matter. Section 3 contains a brief overview of
       training events, which are already discussed in detail in other NIST publications.
      Exercises. An exercise is a simulation of an emergency designed to validate the viability of one
       or more aspects of an IT plan. Exercises helps to identify gaps and inconsistencies within IT
       plans and procedures, as well as cases where personnel need additional training or when training
       needs to be changed. In an exercise, personnel with roles and responsibilities in a particular IT
       plan meet to validate the content of a plan through discussion of their roles and their responses to
       emergency situations, execution of responses in a simulated operational environment, or other
       means of validating responses that does not involve using the actual operational environment for

     Organizations also need to maintain IT capabilities, such as incident response capabilities, that are not necessarily
     documented in a plan. For the sake of simplicity, this guide refers to “IT plans” instead of “IT plans and capabilities”.

     Additional information on contingency plans can be found in NIST SP 800-34, Contingency Planning Guide for Information
     Technology Systems.

     Additional information on incident response can be found in NIST SP 800-61, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide.

     The terms “test” and “exercise” are often used interchangeably. There are, however, distinctions between the two terms.
     For the purpose of this document, the term “test” is reserved for testing systems or system components; it is not used to
     describe “exercising” plans.

     There are many types of training events not discussed in this publication. Some are discussed in detail in NIST SP 800-16,
     Information Technology Security Training Requirements: A Role- and Performance-Based Model, and SP 800-50, Building
     an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program. Both publications are available for download from
     http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/index.html.
