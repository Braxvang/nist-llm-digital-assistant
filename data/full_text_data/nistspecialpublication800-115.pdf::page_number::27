placing the scanner on a segment that can access the devices, or attempting to evade the firewall through
the use of alternate scan types (e.g., SYN/FIN or Xmas scan). 13

It is recommended that if both external and internal scanning are to be used and the assessors are
intentionally performing the testing “blind,” that external scanning be performed first. Done in this order,
logs can be reviewed and compared before and during internal testing. When performing external
scanning, assessors may use any existing stealth techniques to get packets through firewalls while evading
detection by IDS and IPS. 14 Tools that use fragmentation, duplication, overlap, out-of-order, and timing
techniques to alter packets so that they blend into and appear more like normal traffic are recommended.
Internal testing tends to use less aggressive scanning methods because these scans are blocked less often
than external scans. Using more aggressive scans internally significantly increases the changes of
disrupting operations without necessarily improving scan results. Being able to scan a network with
customized packets also works well for internal testing, because checking for specific vulnerabilities
requires highly customized packets. Tools with packet-builder ability are helpful with this process. Once
built, packets can be sent through a second scanning program that will collect the results. Because
customized packets can trigger a denial of service (DoS) attack, this type of test should be conducted
during periods of low network traffic—such as overnight or on the weekend.

Although port scanners identify active hosts, operating systems, ports, services, and applications, they do
not identify vulnerabilities. Additional investigation is needed to confirm the presence of insecure
protocols (e.g., Trivial File Transfer Protocol [TFTP], telnet), malware, unauthorized applications, and
vulnerable services. To identify vulnerable services, the assessor compares identified version numbers of
services with a list of known vulnerable versions, or perform automated vulnerability scanning as
discussed in Section 4.3. With port scanners, the scanning process is highly automated but interpretation
of the scanned data is not.

Although port scanning can disrupt network operations by consuming bandwidth and slowing network
response times, it enables an organization to ensure that its hosts are configured to run only approved
network services. Scanning software should be carefully selected to minimize disruptions to operations.
Port scanning can also be conducted after hours to cause minimal impact to operations.

4.3     Vulnerability Scanning

Like network port and service identification, vulnerability scanning identifies hosts and host attributes
(e.g., operating systems, applications, open ports), but it also attempts to identify vulnerabilities rather
than relying on human interpretation of the scanning results. Many vulnerability scanners are equipped to
accept results from network discovery and network port and service identification, which reduces the
amount of work needed for vulnerability scanning. Also, some scanners can perform their own network
discovery and network port and service identification. Vulnerability scanning can help identify outdated
software versions, missing patches, and misconfigurations, and validate compliance with or deviations
from an organization’s security policy. This is done by identifying the operating systems and major
software applications running on the hosts and matching them with information on known vulnerabilities
stored in the scanners’ vulnerability databases.

Vulnerability scanners can:

       Check compliance with host application usage and security policies

      Many firewalls can recognize and block various alternate scan types, so testers may not be able to use them to evade
      firewalls in many environments.

      This can be particularly helpful in improving the tuning and configuration of IDSs and IPSs.
