      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                   Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

515   and related documents. The issuer SHALL then be authorized (i.e., using the guidelines specified
516   in this document). An organization has certain flexibility in implementing its issuance functions,
517   such as outsourcing some of the required processes or establishing multiple units to fulfill these
518   processes. Regardless of its structure, the organization is responsible for the management and
519   oversight of its issuers and SHALL maintain full responsibility as required in [HSPD-12]. Given
520   that the issuer is responsible for issuing PIV credentials on behalf of an organization, the issuer is
521   sometimes referred to as a Credential Service Provider (CSP).

522           Issuing Facilities
523   An issuing facility is a physical site or location — including all equipment, staff, and
524   documentation — that is responsible for carrying out one or more of the following PIV
525   functions: (i) identity proofing/registration, (ii) card/token production, (iii) activation/issuance,
526   and (iv) maintenance, including reissuance. An issuing facility operates under the auspices of a
527   PIV Card or derived PIV credential issuer and implements the policies and procedures prescribed
528   by the issuer for those functions sanctioned for the facility (e.g., an identity proofing/registration
529   facility).
530   Based on certain characteristics (e.g., size, geographic locations, etc.), an issuer can have its
531   services and functions provided centrally, distributed across multiple locations, or performed
532   remotely. For example, in the case of PIV Card issuance, a geographically dispersed organization
533   may decide to set up issuing facilities to have identity proofing/registration and
534   activation/issuance functions performed in different parts of the country so that applicants can
535   minimize travel. In this example, the different issuing facilities fall under the purview (i.e.,
536   policy and management) of a single issuer that encompasses all of the functions necessary to
537   issue PIV Cards for the organization.

538           Outsourcing Issuing Facilities
539   An organization MAY outsource the issuance of PIV Cards or derived PIV credentials in part or
540   in full. As the complexity and cost of new technologies increase, the organization may decide
541   that the most efficient and cost-effective solution for implementing [HSPD-12] is to seek the
542   services of an external service provider. An external service provider MAY be a federal agency,
543   a private entity, or some other organization that offers the services or functions necessary to issue
544   PIV Cards or derived PIV credentials. Regardless of the outsourcing arrangement, the
545   organization is responsible for ensuring that all PIV credential issuance functions are being
546   performed according to the approved processes for issuing an authorization to operate to an
547   issuer (Sec. 2.10).
548   Figure 1 provides an illustration of the functions that can be outsourced. Only the organization
549   can decide which of its employees and contractors are required to apply for a PIV Card and,
550   optionally, a derived PIV credential (i.e., via sponsorship, wherein a responsible official of the
551   organization provides the biographic and organizational affiliation of the applicant) and under
552   what conditions the application will be approved (e.g., via adjudication, or the kind of
553   background information that will form the basis for authorization to issue the PIV Card).
554   Therefore, these two functions SHALL NOT be outsourced.
