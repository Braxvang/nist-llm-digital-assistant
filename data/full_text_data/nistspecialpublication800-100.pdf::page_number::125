                          Techniques and concerns normally addressed by management in the
Management Services       organization’s computer security program. They focus on managing the computer
                          security program and the risk within the organization.
                          Services focused on controls implemented and executed by people (as opposed to
Operational Services      systems). They often require technical or specialized expertise and rely on
                          management activities and technical controls.
                          Technical services focused on security controls a computer system executes.
Technical Services        These services are dependent on the proper function of the system for
                          effectiveness.


     Selecting the most appropriate services, service mix, and service level is a
 complex decision, as is deciding who should provide the needed services. A broad
 range of possible service arrangements exists. An organization may select its
 internal employees and teams to provide the service required, or it may choose to
 fully export the service to an external service provider. This external service
 provider could be any organization, including an external group from a subsidiary
 organization, a business unit, or a commercial service provider.

 12.2.1 Selecting Information Security Services Management Tools
     Because of the potential harm caused by inadequate security, information
 security program managers and decision makers must employ effective management
 tools to increase the likelihood of success of acquired security services. Two
 important tools are metrics and service agreements, both of which can be used to
 make security service providers accountable for the results derived from the services
 they provide to the organization.
     • Metrics are a management tool that facilitates decision making and
       accountability through practical, relevant data collection, data analysis, and
       performance data reporting.
     • A service agreement is an agreement between the service provider and the
       organization requesting the service that specifies all services the service
       provider is to provide, to what extent, the duration of services, etc.

 12.2.2 Information Security Services Issues
     Implementing a security service and service arrangement can be complex. Each
 security service carries its own costs and associated risks, as does each service
 arrangement. Making a decision based on one single issue can have major
 implications for the organization in other areas. For example, if it becomes clear that
 an external organization can provide the service more cost-effectively than the
 current internal service provider, security decision makers will have to consider the
 implications to the organization’s current personnel. The decision makers will have
 to balance near-term cost/value with potential long-term risks associated with
 potential loss of employee morale, attrition, and intellectual capital. Table 12-3
 provides a list of general factors and issues associated with acquiring security
 services, grouped into six categories. This list is not intended to be exhaustive; it
 provides the most common, but not all, related factors and issues.
