       new Annex I. Error reporting is also improved. Annex G is also discussed to
       support H.235v3. Annex G describes a profile to support SRTP.

 4.2.2.1 H.235 Annex D – Baseline Security Profile Enhancements

       Using this profile, either message authentication and integrity is achieved by
       calculating an integrity check value over the complete message, or authentication
       only by computing an integrity check over a special part of the message. The
       latter option is useful in environments where NAT and Firewalls are applied. The
       version used is distinguished by an identifier.

 4.2.2.2 Draft H.235v3 Annex G – SRTP & MIKEY usage

       Annex G discusses the incorporation of key management supporting the Secure
       Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP). SRTP provides confidentiality, message
       authentication and replay protection to the RTP/RTCP traffic. The RTP standard
       provides the flexibility to adapt to application specific requirements with the
       possibility to define profiles in companion documents. SRTP is defined as such a
       profile of the RTP protocol and is currently stardards-track RFC 3711. SRTP
       may be used within multimedia sessions to ensure a secure media data exchange.
       It can be used with several session control protocols, e.g., with H.323 or SIP.
