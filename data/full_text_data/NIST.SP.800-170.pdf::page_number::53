            Assist IPv6 Adoption
                            Internet Protocol (IP) Version
                          6 (IPv6) is an updated version of
                          the current Internet Protocol, IPv4.
                          The primary motivations for the
                          development of IPv6 were to increase
                          the number of unique IP addresses
available for use and to handle the needs of new Internet
applications and devices. In addition, IPv6 was designed with
the following goals: increased ease of network management
and configuration; expandable IP headers; improved mobility
and security; and quality of service controls. IPv6 has been,
and continues to be, developed and defined by the Internet
