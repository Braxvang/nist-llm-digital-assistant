NIST SP 800-166                                                   DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                  DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

                      6. If the Discovery Object is supported, send the GET DATA
                         command with
                            • Data field of the command containing the tag
                               ('7E') of the Discovery Object
                      7. If the Security Object is supported, send the GET DATA
                         command with
                            • Data field of the command containing the tag
                               ('5FC106') of the Security Object
                      8. Send the GET DATA command with
                            • Data field of the command containing a tag that
                               does not identify any of the data objects within
                               the Derived PIV Application.
 Expected Result(s)   1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property template
                         with the status word '90 00'.
                      2. For Steps 2, 3, 4, 5A, 5B, 6 and 7, each command returns the
                         requested data object along with the status word '90 00'.
                      3. For Step 8, the command returns status word '6A 82' (data object not
                         found).

 Precondition(s)      •   A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                          appropriate token reader.
                      •   Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and an
                          instance of the reader.
                      •   The Derived PIV Application Password is recorded.
                      •   The Derived PIV Application Password’s retry counter is not 0.
 Test Scenario        1. Send the SELECT command with
                            • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                      2. Send the GENERAL AUTHENTICATE command
                            • CLA is set to:
                                1. '00' if command chaining is not needed or
