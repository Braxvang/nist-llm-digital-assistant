NIST SP 800-82r3                                            Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

the OT security policies and procedures, and the specific health, safety, and environmental risks
associated with a particular facility and/or process. The organization ensures that the assessment
does not affect system operation or result in unintentional system modification. If assessment
activities must be performed on the production OT, it may need to be taken offline before an
assessment can be conducted, or the assessment should be scheduled to occur during planned OT
outages whenever possible.
Control Enhancement: (1) No OT Discussion on this control.
Control Enhancement: (2) OT Discussion: The organization conducts risk analysis to support the
selection of an assessment target (e.g., the live system, an offline replica, or lab system).

OT Discussion: Organizations perform risk-benefit analysis to determine whether an OT should
be connected to other systems. The authorizing official (AO) fully understands the organizational
information security policies and procedures; the OT security policies and procedures; the risks
to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation
associated with the connection to other systems; the individuals and organizations that operate
and maintain the systems, including maintenance contractors or service providers; and the
specific health, safety, and environmental risks associated with a particular interconnection.
Connections from the OT environment to other security zones may cross the authorization
boundary such that two different authorizing officials may be required to approve the connection.
Decisions to accept risk are documented.
Control Enhancement: (6) No OT Discussion for this control.

OT Discussion: Corrective actions identified in assessments may not be immediately actionable
in an OT environment. Therefore, short-term mitigations may be implemented to reduce risk as
part of the gap closure plan or plan of action and milestones.
