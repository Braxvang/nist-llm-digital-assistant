automation to improve the efficiency and timeliness of the CMVP operation and processes. This
project will demonstrate a suite of tools to modernize and automate manual review processes in
support of existing policy and efforts to include CMVP technical testing.
The CMVP has partnered with the Cryptographic Module Users Forum (CMUF) to identify areas
of change that make interpreting the standards difficult. The CMVP is also working with the CMUF
to minimize communications confusion between vendors and the laboratories and between the
laboratories and the CMVP. These improvements are captured in publicly available supporting
documents and standards. Through this work, NIST will identify ways to make the process more
efficient and faster for vendors, laboratories, and the CMVP while providing assurance of correct
implementation.
Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP)
The Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP) continued to perform algorithm validations
with the NIST-hosted Automated Cryptographic Validation Test System (ACVTS). The program
has offered more than 435,000 algorithm tests over FY 2021 on a test-only demonstration server
and a validation production server.
Entropy source validation has been a focus of the validation programs over the past year. Many
discussions were held with the cryptographic validation community to determine the best way to
meet the needs of NIST, the validation authority, and the entropy source developers and testers.
Additional documentation and instructions on how to cite conformance to the Recommendation
for the Entropy Sources Used for Random Bit Generation (SP 800-90B) has been provided and
will continue to be provided in FY 2022. Additionally, based on the success of the ACVTS, a new
server has been developed called the Entropy Source Validation Test System. This system will
collect information on SP 800-90B-compliant entropy sources in order to issue validations on a
new entropy source validation list. The system is expected to be made available in 2022.
