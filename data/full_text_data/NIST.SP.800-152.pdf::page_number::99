SP 800-152                                                    A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


               AU-2        For Moderate and High impact-level systems, a Federal
PR:8.17
                           CKMS shall support the ability for the FCKMS auditor and
                           administrator roles to select (from an implemented set) the
                           security-relevant events to be audited.
                           For Moderate and High impact-level systems, a Federal
PR:8.18
                           CKMS shall support the use of SCAP to monitor the status
                           and integrity of an FCKMS.

                SI-4       For Low impact-level systems, a Federal CKMS should
PA:8.4
              SI-7 (+2)    support the monitoring of its internal components, modules,
                           devices, services, functions, and files in order to detect and/or
                           prevent their unauthorized modification, and then report the
                           results of this monitoring to an FCKMS audit administrator.
               AU-2        For Low impact-level systems, a Federal CKMS should
PA:8.5
                           support the ability for the FCKMS auditor and administrator
                           roles to select the security-relevant events to be audited.
                           For Low impact-level systems, a Federal CKMS should
PA:8.6
                           support the use of SCAP to monitor the status and integrity of
                           an FCKMS.

8.3   Network Security Control Mechanisms

Network security-control mechanisms should be used to protect computer systems and their
network communications against unauthorized access and use. They should be used to detect
and prevent network activities that could reduce the security of the transmitted information,
especially the cryptographic keys and sensitive metadata.

Networked FCKMS devices should be protected using a combination of firewalls and
intrusion detection and prevention systems as boundary-control devices. These devices
should be placed in physically secure locations and used to protect FCKMS users, sensitive
applications, and vulnerable network services. In order to provide defense-in-depth,
boundary-control functions should also be implemented directly in FCKMS devices.

An FCKMS could be designed to be configurable or dynamic, capable of adapting to
network threats based on the results of monitoring network performance, communication
error detection/correction, and network overload. For example, an attempt to flood a network
with repetitive or nonsense data could cause an FCKMS to not accept a data packet or
connection request. An intentional and intelligent, but unauthorized, modification of network
packets could result in packets being refused or a shutdown of the affected device or even the
entire network.
