       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                            Digital Identity Guidelines

1372   necessary for identity proofing, including whether such attributes are voluntary or
1373   mandatory in order to complete the identity proofing transactions, and the consequences
1374   for not providing the attributes.
1375   An effective notice will take into account user experience design standards and research,
1376   and an assessment of privacy risks that may arise from the collection. Various factors
1377   should be considered, including incorrectly inferring that applicants understand why
1378   attributes are collected, that collected information may be combined with other data
1379   sources, etc. An effective notice is never only a pointer leading to a complex, legalistic
1380   privacy policy or general terms and conditions that applicants are unlikely to read or
1381   understand.

1382   8.3. Use Limitation
1383   The guidelines require CSPs to use measures to maintain the objectives of predictability
1384   (enabling reliable assumptions by individuals, owners, and operators about PII and
1385   its processing by an information system) and manageability (providing the capability
1386   for granular administration of PII, including alteration, deletion, and selective
1387   disclosure) commensurate with privacy risks that can arise from the processing of
1388   attributes for purposes other than identity proofing, authentication, authorization, or
1389   attribute assertion, related fraud mitigation, or to comply with law or legal process
1390   [NISTIR8062].
1391   CSPs may have various business purposes for processing attributes, including providing
1392   non-identity services to subscribers. However, processing attributes for other purposes
1393   than those disclosed to a subject can create additional privacy risks. CSPs can determine
1394   appropriate measures commensurate with the privacy risk arising from the additional
1395   processing. For example, absent applicable law, regulation or policy, it may not be
1396   necessary to get consent when processing attributes to provide non-identity services
1397   requested by subscribers, although notices may help subscribers maintain reliable
1398   assumptions about the processing (predictability). Other processing of attributes may
1399   carry different privacy risks that call for obtaining consent or allowing subscribers more
1400   control over the use or disclosure of specific attributes (manageability). Subscriber
1401   consent needs to be meaningful; therefore, when CSPs do use consent measures, they
1402   cannot make acceptance by the subscriber of additional uses a condition of providing the
1403   identity service.
1404   Consult your SAOP if there are questions about whether the proposed processing falls
1405   outside the scope of the permitted processing or the appropriate privacy risk mitigation
1406   measures.

1407   8.4. Redress
1408   The guidelines require the CSP to provide effective mechanisms for redressing applicant
1409   complaints or problems arising from the identity proofing, and make the mechanisms easy
