4.7     Summary

This section describes a phased approach to SSL VPN planning and implementation and highlights
various issues that may be of significance to implementers. The following summarizes the key points
from the section:

 The use of a phased approach for SSL VPN planning and implementation can help to achieve
  successful SSL VPN deployments. The five phases of the approach are as follows:
      1. Identify Requirements. Identify the requirements for remote access and determine how they can
         best be met.

      2. Design the Solution. Make design decisions in five areas: access control, endpoint security,
         authentication methods, architecture, and cryptography policy.

      3. Implement and Test a Prototype. Test a prototype of the designed solution in a lab, test, or
         production environment to identify any potential issues.

      4. Deploy the Solution. Gradually deploy the SSL VPN solution throughout the enterprise,
         beginning with a pilot program.

      5. Manage the Solution. Maintain the SSL VPN components and resolve operational issues.
         Repeat the planning and implementation process when significant changes need to be
         incorporated into the solution.

 The organization should base its access control policy on its organizational requirements for remote
  access. These requirements stipulate which resources should be accessed by which groups or
  individuals. The access control policy could provide additional requirements and make access to
  resources dependent on other characteristics such as the authentication method used, computer type
  and location, and user identification.
 The endpoint security policy specifies the host integrity checks that are performed before a host logs
  in. The policy also defines the checks that are performed after logout to guarantee the security of data
  that is downloaded during the VPN session.
 The organization should select an authentication solution that is consistent with its security policy.
  The method of authentication can vary by user, group, or specific resource.
 There are three main types of hardware configuration: a hardware appliance, an option to an existing
  security product, and a software solution. The hardware appliance configuration is the most common.
 The placement of an SSL VPN device has potential security, functionality, and performance
  implications.
 Routing policy is an important consideration, especially if the VPN implementation supports network
  extension, split tunneling, or multiple sites. It is recommended that NAT not be used so traffic to and
  from individual remote hosts can be tracked.
 SSL VPN devices vary widely in how they support load balancing and high availability, so the
  organization should select a device that supports its load balancing or high availability requirements.
 Although SSL VPNs are described as clientless, some forms of SSL VPN access such as network
  extension require dynamically downloaded agents to be run on the host.
