                                            ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



RSNAs enable the following security features for IEEE 802.11 WLANs, which are explained thoroughly
later in this section and in Section 5:

       Enhanced user authentication mechanisms
       Cryptographic key management
       Data confidentiality
       Data origin authentication and integrity
       Replay protection.
An RSNA relies on IEEE 802.1X to provide an authentication framework. To achieve the robust security
of RSNAs, the designers of the IEEE 802.11i amendment used numerous mature cryptographic
algorithms and techniques (as described in Section 3.3). Figure 4-3 provides a taxonomy of the
cryptographic algorithms included in the IEEE 802.11 standard. These algorithms can be categorized as
being used for confidentiality, integrity (and data origin authentication), or key generation. All of the
algorithms specifically referenced in the IEEE 802.11 standard are symmetric algorithms, which use the
same key for two different steps of the algorithm, such as encryption and decryption.

4.2     Key Hierarchies and Key Distribution and Management

Fundamental to any cryptographic system are the cryptographic keys used in the transformation
(enciphering or deciphering) processes. Since cryptography is the security foundation of IEEE 802.11
WLANs, the security of keys is particularly important. NISTâ€™s 2-volume guidance document on Key
Management, SP 800-57, includes general guidance as well as best practices recommendations. 27 Keys
typically need to meet the following requirements:

       Randomly generated to reduce the probability that they can be determined by an adversary or that
        they will be reused
26
      The IEEE 802.11i amendment specifically references these cryptographic algorithms. Other cryptographic algorithms for
      confidentiality, integrity, or key generation may be incorporated by reference in one of the numerous EAP methods that may
      be used in a particular implementation. These additional cryptographic algorithms have been excluded from this diagram.
