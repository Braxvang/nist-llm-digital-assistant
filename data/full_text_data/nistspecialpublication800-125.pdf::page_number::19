these attacks is to reveal cryptographic keys. These attacks are considered difficult, usually requiring
direct physical access to the host.

Attackers may attempt to break out of a guest OS so that they can access the hypervisor, other guest OSs,
or the underlying host OS. Breaking out of a guest OS is also known as escape. If an attacker can
successfully escape a guest OS and gain access to the hypervisor, the attacker might be able to
compromise the hypervisor and gain control over all of its guest OSs. So the hypervisor provides a single
point of security failure for all the guest OSs; a single breach of the hypervisor places all the guest OSs at
high risk.

Guest OSs are often not completely isolated from each other and from the host OS because that would
prevent necessary functionality. For example, many hosted virtualization solutions provide mechanisms
called guest tools through which a guest OS can access files, directories, the copy/paste buffer, and other
resources on the host OS or another guest OS. These communication mechanisms can inadvertently serve
as an attack vector, such as transmitting malware or permitting an attacker to gain access to particular
resources. Bare metal virtualization software does not offer such sharing capabilities.

3.2   Guest OS Monitoring

The hypervisor is fully aware of the current state of each guest OS it controls. As such, the hypervisor
may have the ability to monitor each guest OS as it is running, which is known as introspection.
Introspection can provide full auditing capabilities that may otherwise be unavailable. Monitoring
capabilities provided through introspection can include network traffic, memory, processes, and other
elements of a guest OS. For many virtualization products, the hypervisor can incorporate additional
security controls or interface with external security controls and provide information to them that was
gathered through introspection. Examples include firewalling, intrusion detection, and access control.
Many products also allow the security policy being enforced through hypervisor-based security controls
to be moved as a guest OS is migrated from one physical host to another.

Network traffic monitoring is particularly important when networking is being performed between two
guest OSs on the host or between a guest OS and the host OS. Under typical network configurations, this
traffic does not pass through network-based security controls, so host-based security controls should be
used to monitor the traffic instead.

3.3   Image and Snapshot Management

Creating guest machine images and snapshots does not affect the vulnerabilities within them, such as the
vulnerabilities in the guest OSs, services, and applications. However, images and snapshots do affect
security in several ways, some positive and some negative, and they also affect IT operations.

Note that one of the biggest security issues with images and snapshots is that they contain sensitive data
(such as passwords, personal data, and so on) just like a physical hard drive. Because it is easier to move
around an image or snapshot than a hard drive, it is more important to think about the security of the data
in that image or snapshot. Snapshots can be more risky than images because snapshots contain the
contents of RAM memory at the time that the snapshot was taken, and this might include sensitive
information that was not even stored on the drive itself.

An operating system and applications can be installed, configured, secured, and tested in a single image
and that image then distributed to many hosts. This can save considerable time, providing additional time
for the contents of the image to be secured more effectively, and also improve the consistency and
strength of security across hosts. However, because images can be distributed and stored easily, they need
