starts when a vendor voluntarily submits an SCAP-enabled           (301) 975-5259
product to a NVLAP-accredited laboratory. Once the lab             melanie.cook@nist.gov
completes product testing, and all validation requirements
are met, the lab submits a test report to the SCAP Validation
Program for review. NIST reviews the test report and will
award a validation if all requirements have been met. Once         IDENTITY MANAGEMENT
a validation is awarded, the SCAP Validation Record is sent
to the lab, and the newly validated product is posted on the       Perso nal Identity Verif icatio n (P IV )

     The SCAP Validation Program resources web page
(http://scap.nist.gov/validation) was introduced in FY 2013,
and was updated in FY 2014 to provide the public with a
centralized location for all resources and information
necessary for preparing products for SCAP 1.2 validation.
Resources include documentation, a list of Frequently
Asked Questions (FAQ), the SCAP validation-test content,
and tools for validating and processing SCAP data streams.
The SCAP validation-test content should be used by vendors
for quality assurance testing prior to entering formal SCAP
testing with an NVLAP accredited laboratory. The open-
source tools that are available for download may be used by
SCAP content authors for testing SCAP source content. The
SCAP Content Validation Tool (SCAPVal) may be used to
determine if the content conforms to the SCAP specification.
Open-source SCAP reference implementation tools, such as
the SCAP Reference Implementation Tool, may be used to                           Figure 17: Government Employees
