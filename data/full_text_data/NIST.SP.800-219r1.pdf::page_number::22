NIST SP 800-219r1                                                    Automated Secure Configuration
July 2023                                                                 Guidance from the mSCP

   •   Baselines: A baseline folder can be included within the custom folder to create
       customized baselines that fit an organization’s needs. These baseline files may include
       rule, section, and template customization (discussed below). An existing baseline can be
       configured to create a custom benchmark. Additionally, it is possible to customize an
       included benchmark, but in doing so, it may no longer be compliant with the original
       requirements of that benchmark.
   •   Rules: Existing rules can have their setting values overridden via the custom folder
       instead of modifying the mSCP-supplied rule file. New rules can be created and added to
       existing baselines or to user-defined baselines. Organizations can create their own
       discussions, checks, results, fixes, and mappings of rules to security frameworks not
       included in the project. In order to override an existing rule, the custom rule file name
       must match an existing rule so that the generate_guidance.py script will pick up the
       new values. New rules not included in mSCP must be listed in the baseline YAML file
       specified when running generate_guidance.py. Additional information on custom
       rules can be found in an article written by mSCP contributor Allen Golbig [13].
   •   Sections: Custom sections can be used to organize existing or custom YAML rule files.
       Sections defined in the custom folder must be included in a baseline YAML file in order
       to be used by generate_guidance.py.
   •   Templates: Custom templates can be used to define new template structures for the
       project and affect the organization and appearance of generated documentation. The
       template files must match the name of an existing template and will override that
       template when running generate_guidance.py.
   •   Logos: An organization can include a custom logo when running the
       generate_guidance.py script by using the -l argument to point to an image file.

   •   Tailoring: The generate_baseline.py script allows for a baseline to be tailored using
       the -t argument. During the tailoring process, the script will prompt for each control
       containing an ODV to have its values customized. If a value is not supplied to a control
       with an ODV, it will use the default value in the rule file. Refer to Appendix C for an
       example of tailoring with ODVs.

       Directories
mSCP source code releases available on the mSCP GitHub include the following directories:
   •   baselines – Contains the defined YAML baseline files

   •   build – Holds scripts, documents, and configuration profiles generated by running
       scripts
   •   custom – Used for creating customized baselines, rules, sections, or templates to meet an
       organization’s requirements
   •   includes – Contains the YAML-based libraries required for running the scripts

   •   rules – Contains YAML rule files with one rule per file

   •   scripts – Contains the content generation scripts and their required files
