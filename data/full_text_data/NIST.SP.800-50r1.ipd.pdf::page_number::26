      NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                       Building a Cybersecurity and
      August 2023                                                                  Privacy Learning Program

631   are written in broad terms and include who, what, when, and why. Procedures describe how the
632   policy will be implemented or enacted. Procedures are written to include who will do what, the
633   steps or phases for the action, defined criteria or implementation levels, and related
634   documentation.
635   For both cybersecurity and privacy business operations, policies and procedures identify
636   acceptable practices and expectations, as well as guidance for how to train personnel on those
637   requirements and expectations. It is important for the organization to have CPLP policies and
638   procedures that align with the broader policies and clearly describe the expectations for the
639   learning programs.
640   The benefits of establishing policies and procedures include:
641      •   Defining clear expectations for the workplace
642      •   Providing executive buy-in of the program
643      •   Providing a documented management and oversight capability that can be audited
644      •   Supporting cybersecurity and privacy assurance strategic goals and objectives
645      •   Clearly identifying information and resources
646      •   Enabling the training of personnel on their information security and privacy
647          responsibilities

649   Examples of Learning Program Policy Statements:
650   The following policy statements are not a prescriptive list of what should be included in
651   Learning Program policies. These are examples to provide context on what is important when
652   establishing, reviewing, or updating cybersecurity and privacy learning program policies. Thus,
653   the statements can include, but are not limited to:
654      •   The CIO and CISO establish a cybersecurity training program for users of [organization]
655          information systems.
656      •   The CPO establishes a privacy training program for users of [organization] information
657          systems that process personally identifiable information (PII).
658      •   All personnel, contractors, or others who work on behalf of [organization] accessing
659          [organization] systems receive initial training and annual refresher training in
660          cybersecurity and privacy awareness and accepted cybersecurity and privacy practices.
661      •   Personnel complete cybersecurity and privacy awareness training within 24 hours of
662          being granted a user account. If a user fails to meet this training requirement, user access
663          is not granted or will be suspended.
664      •   All personnel, contractors, or others who work on behalf of [organization] with
665          significant security responsibilities receive specialized training prior to obtaining access
666          to the systems that process sensitive information and will be required to complete
667          refresher training each fiscal year.
