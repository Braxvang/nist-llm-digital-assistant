NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                             Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                    Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


   3. Section 5: The ECDLP abbreviation and the floor and gcd symbols were removed.
      Definitions of the leftmost, rightmost, min and select functions have been added, and
      have been used throughout the document.
   4. Section 6: The reference to number-theoretic problems was removed, as well as the old
      Appendix A that provided security considerations for DRBGs based on elliptic curves,
      and the old Appendix F that listed shall statements.
   5. Section 7: The first paragraph has been modified, and includes an additional shall
      statement. In Section 7.1, the first two sentences have been modified for clarity. In
      Section 7.2, the second paragraph and the first sentence of the third paragraph have been
      modified for clarity; the personalization string is now recommended, rather than required,
      to be unique. In Section 7.4, the second item has been modified for clarity, and the last
      paragraph has been removed, since it was not needed here.
   6. Section 8: In Section 8.1, the second sentence has been modified for clarity. In Section
      8.2, additional text has been added to the last sentence for clarity. In Section 8.3, item 1b,
      the reference to blocks was removed, since it pertained to the Dual_EC_DRBG. In
      Section 8.4, the third sentence is a general statement that replaces the last two sentences
      of that paragraph; the subject with more detail is now discussed below Table 1. In the
      paragraph under Figure 4, text has been inserted in the second sentence for clarity. The
      first sentence of the next paragraph has been modified for clarity, and an additional
      paragraph has been added to the section to mention the relationship between a DRBG
      sub-boundary and a cryptographic module boundary.
   7. Section 8.5: A reference to the cryptographic boundary for FIPS 140 has been inserted in
      bold to draw the reader’s attention to the fact that it is different than the DRBG’s
      boundaries. In the paragraph under item 3, an example has been provided for clarity. In
      the following two paragraphs, a reference to SP 800-90C has been inserted to direct the
      reader to that document for further discussion on cryptographic module boundaries.
   8. Section 8.6: In Section 8.6.2, a reference to fresh entropy has been inserted in the second
      sentence. In Section 8.6.3, text has been inserted at the end of the second sentence for
      clarity. In Section 8.6.4, a shall statement has been inserted at the end of the first
      sentence. Sections 8.6.5 and 8.6.7 were revised to clarify the source of the entropy input
      and nonce. In Section 8.6.6, text was inserted that states that entropy input is a critical
      security parameter for cryptographic module validation. Section 8.6.7 was modified to
      provide more information about suitable nonces and to state that the uniqueness of the
      nonce is applicable to the cryptographic module in which it is used, and to indicate that
      the nonce is a critical security parameter. In Section 8.6.8, text was added about enforcing
      the seedlife. In Section 8.6.9, ‘DRBG’ was changed to ‘DRBG instantiation’ for clarity.
   9. Section 8.7: Sections 8.7.1 and 8.7.2 have been modified to clarify that the optional
      personalization string and additional input may be obtained from outside a cryptographic
      module, that the personalization string is not a critical security parameter, and that the
      additional input may be a critical security parameter if secret information is included.
   10. Section 8.8: The last sentence of the second paragraph under the list has ‘direct or
       indirect’ inserted for clarity. A paragraph has been added to the end of the section to
       recommend reseeding whenever possible.
