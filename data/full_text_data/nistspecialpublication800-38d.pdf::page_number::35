Moreover, as with most block cipher modes of operation, the security assurance of GCM
degrades as more data is processed with a single key. Therefore, the total number of blocks of
plaintext and AAD that are protected by invocations of the authenticated encryption function
during the lifetime of the key should be limited. A reasonable limit for most applications would
be 264, consistent with the requirement on the number of invocations in Sec. 8.3.
