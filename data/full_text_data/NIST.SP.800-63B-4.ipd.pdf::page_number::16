393   possession and control of two different authentication factors is required through secure
394   authentication protocols. Approved cryptographic techniques are required at AAL2 and
395   above.
396   Authentication Assurance Level 3: AAL3 provides very high confidence that
397   the claimant controls one or more authenticators bound to the subscriber account.
398   Authentication at AAL3 is based on proof of possession of a key through a cryptographic
399   protocol. AAL3 authentication requires a hardware-based authenticator and a
400   phishing-resistant authenticator (see Sec. 5.2.5); the same device may fulfill both
401   these requirements. In order to authenticate at AAL3, claimants are required to prove
402   possession and control of two distinct authentication factors through secure authentication
403   protocols. Approved cryptographic techniques are required.
