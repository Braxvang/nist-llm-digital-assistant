IRISSTD     ISO/IEC 19794-6:2011 Information technology -- Biometric data interchange formats -- Part 6: Iris image data
            This document revises and replaces the 2005 iris standard. Published September 29, 2011.

            This standard is being amended, with publication expected 2014. The amendment does two things: It
            establishes conformance tests for 19794-6 iris records and, in support of that, clarifies the Image Type 7
            appearance requirements. In particular it emphasizes that the sclera shall be masked. The title of the
            amendment is: Information Technology — Biometric data interchange formats — Part 6: Iris image format -
            Amendment 1: Conformance testing methodologies.
IRISQUAL    ISO/IEC 29794-6:2014 (est. date) Information technology -- Biometric sample quality -- Part 6: Iris image quality
            This standard is currently nearing completion, at the Draft IS level.
