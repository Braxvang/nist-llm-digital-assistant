NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

                   Reporting requirements should be documented along with contact
                   information and the reporting format to reduce confusion.
                   Response actions should also include steps for detection,
                   analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident
                   activity. Some considerations for OT may include:
                       o Determining a priority, such as returning to normal
                         operations as quickly as possible or performing an
                         investigation and preserving forensic data
                       o Communicating with the incident response team
                       o Disconnecting infected systems from the network
                       o Physically isolating operationally independent networks
                         (e.g., enterprise from control or control from safety)
                       o Transitioning to manual operations
                       o Resourcing for additional operations support to manually
                         validate data
                       o Notifying management, public relations, and/or outside
                         companies and agencies as required
            If an incident is discovered, organizations should conduct a focused risk
            assessment on the OT environment to evaluate the effects of the attack
            and the options to respond. For example, one possible response option is
            to physically isolate the system under attack. However, this may have a
            negative impact on the OT and may not be possible without impacting
            operational performance or safety. A focused risk assessment should be
            used to determine the response action.
            The plan should also indicate requirements for the timely replacement of
            components in the case of an emergency. If possible, replacements for
            hard-to-obtain critical components should be kept in inventory.
            The organization should have a means for prioritizing recovery
            activities. This prioritization may leverage existing documentation, such
            as risk assessments or startup procedures. For example, the focus may be
            to recover the systems that support critical utilities prior to the systems
            that support manufacturing based on the order of start-up activities.
            Testing recovery plan procedures for OT components may be difficult
            due to operational and safety requirements. Organizations may need to
            determine if “bench tests” or other offline testing is possible to confirm
            the recovery procedures for OT components. At a minimum,
            organizations should verify the integrity of the backups if a full recovery
            test cannot be performed.
