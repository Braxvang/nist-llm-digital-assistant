                                                                                                    42. In Section 6.2.1.3, “keying material” has been changed to a list of items to be kept secret:
                                                                                                        symmetric keys, private keys, key components, and secret metadata.
                                                                                                    43. In Section 6.2.3, the metadata subsections were combined into a single section. Additional

                                                                                                    44. In Section 7, a sentence was added about the use of disallowed keys. In Transition 7, a
