CHAPTER 14                                                             Configuration Management



Chapter 14
14. Configuration Management
    The purpose of Configuration Management (CM) is to manage the effects of
changes or differences in configurations on an information system or network. CM
assists in streamlining change management processes and prevents changes that
could detrimentally affect the security posture of a system before they happen. In
its entirety, the CM process reduces the risk that any changes made to a system
(insertions/installations, deletions/uninstalling, and modifications) result in a
compromise to system or data confidentiality, integrity, or availability in that it
provides a repeatable mechanism for effecting system modifications in a controlled
environment. In accordance with the CM process, system changes must be tested
prior to implementation to observe the effects of the change, thereby minimizing the
risk of adverse results.
    Each organization must take into account the associated costs and expenses, the
required planning and scheduling, and the necessary training associated with a
thorough and effective CM process. However, since each general CM approach is
universal, agencies can structure and implement a repeatable CM process to save
organizational resources on future projects. Additionally, CM helps to eliminate the
risk of confusion, problems, and unnecessary spending. The additional resources
required to correct a problem that could have been prevented through sound CM
practices, is likely to far exceed the amount of resources required to develop and
implement an effective enterprise CM process.
    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP)
800-64, Security Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle,
states “Configuration management and control procedures are critical to establishing
an initial baseline of hardware, software, and firmware components for the
information system and subsequently to controlling and maintaining an accurate
inventory of any changes to the system. Changes to the hardware, software, or
firmware of a system can have a significant impact on the security of the
system…changes should be documented, and their potential impact on security
should be assessed regularly.” NIST SP 800-53, Revision 1, Recommended Security
Controls for Federal Information Systems, defines seven CM controls that
organizations are required to implement based on an information system’s security
categorization. The required CM controls are defined in Table 14-1. 82

     CM-1     Configuration       The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates:
              Management          (1) a formal, documented CM policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
              Policy and          responsibilities, and compliance; and (2) formal, documented procedures to
              Procedures          facilitate the implementation of the CM policy and associated CM controls.
     CM-2     Baseline            The organization develops, documents, and maintains a current baseline
              Configuration       configuration of the information system and an inventory of the system’s
                                  constituent components.
