4.        General Cloud Environments

At the time of this writing, many individuals and organizations have made general statements about cloud
computing, its advantages, and its weaknesses. It is important to understand, however, that the term
"cloud computing" encompasses a variety of systems and technologies as well as service and deployment
models, and business models. A number of claims that are sometimes made about cloud computing, e.g.,
that it "scales," or that it converts capital expenses to operational expenses, are only true for some kinds of
cloud systems. The goal of this section is to clearly describe a division of cloud computing systems into
five significant scenarios and, for each scenario, to explain general issues about cloud computing, such as
scalability, and how those issues apply in that scenario. 5

As implied by the NIST cloud computing definition, a cloud system is a collection of network-accessible
computing resources that customers (i.e., cloud consumers) can access over a network. In general terms,
a cloud system and its consumers employ the client-server model [Com88], which means that consumers
(the clients) send messages over a network to server computers, which then perform work in response to
the messages received.




                                        Figure 1: General Cloud and Consumer View

Figure 1 gives a general view of a cloud and its clients: the cloud's computing resources are depicted as a
grid of computer systems where clients access a cloud over network connections. As shown in the
figure, new clients may arrive, existing clients may depart, and the number of clients using a cloud at any
one time is variable. Similarly, a cloud maintains a pool of hardware resources that it manages to
maximize service and minimize costs. To maintain highly available services despite expected component
failures and service life expirations, a cloud incorporates new hardware components as needed and retires
old or failing components. To provide services cost-effectively, a cloud will manage the pool of hardware
resources for resource efficiency; one of the strategies that a cloud provider employs during periods of
reduced consumer demand is to power off unused components. Whether for power management, or for

    This section presents a physical, network-oriented view of how cloud systems can be connected with consumers. An
       understanding of cloud software and of which parts of the traditional software "stack" are made available to consumers is
       also important, and is presented in Sections 5, 6, and 7.
