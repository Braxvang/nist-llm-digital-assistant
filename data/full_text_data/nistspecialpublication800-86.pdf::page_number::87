7.2.3     Interactive Communications

Unlike e-mail messages, which typically take minutes to go from sender to recipient, interactive
communications services provide real-time (or near-real-time) communications. Types of applications
commonly used for interactive communications include the following:

      ! Group Chat. Group chat applications provide virtual meeting spaces where many users can
        share messages at once. Group chat applications typically use a client/server architecture. The
        most popular group chat protocol, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), is a standard protocol that uses
        relatively simple text-based communications.121 IRC also provides a mechanism for users to send
        and receive files.
      ! Instant Messaging Applications. IM applications are either peer-to-peer, allowing users to send
        text messages and files directly to each other, or client/server, passing messages and files through
        a centralized server. IM application configuration settings may contain user information, lists of
        users that the user has communicated with, file transfer information, and archived messages or
        chat sessions. There are several major Internet-based IM services, each of which uses its own
        proprietary communications protocols. Several companies also offer enterprise IM products that
        are run within an organization. Such products are often integrated to some extent with the
        organization’s e-mail services and can be used only by authenticated e-mail users.
      ! Audio and Video. As the capacity of networks continues to increase, conducting real-time video
        and audio communications across computer networks also becomes more common. Technologies
        such as Voice over IP (VoIP) permit people to conduct telephone conversations over networks
        such as the Internet.122 Some audio implementations provide computer-based service from end to
        end, whereas others are only partially computer-based, with an intermediate server converting the
        communications between computer networks and standard phone networks. Many audio
        technologies are primarily peer-to-peer applications. Video technologies can be used to hold
        teleconferences or to have “video phone” communications between two individuals. Commonly
        used protocols for audio and video communications include H.323 and Session Initiation Protocol
        (SIP).123
7.2.4     File Sharing

Users can share files through many different programs. As described previously in this section, e-mail,
group chat programs, and IM software all offer the ability to send and receive particular files. However,
these programs generally do not allow a recipient to browse through files and to choose the files to
transfer. Full-fledged file sharing programs and protocols are needed for this level of functionality. File
sharing programs can be grouped by architecture, as follows:

      ! Client/Server. Traditional file sharing services use client/server architectures, with a central file
        server containing a repository of files. Clients can use the server by initiating connections to it,
        authenticating to it (if required), reviewing the list of available files (if needed), then transferring
        files to or from the server. Some commonly used client/server file sharing services are FTP,
        Network File Sharing (NFS), Apple Filing Protocol (AFP), and Server Message Block (SMB).124

      The original standard for IRC is documented in RFC 1459, Internet Relay Chat Protocol, available at
      http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1459.txt. RFCs 2810 through 2813 contain additional information that supplements RFC 1459.

      The standard for SIP is available as RFC 3261, SIP: Session Initiation Protocol, located at
