NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                 Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

principles such as Commensurate Rigor and Commensurate Trustworthiness inform the trade
space analysis.

The benefits of a design option are determined by its effectiveness in providing the required
protection capability, the trustworthiness that can be placed on it, and the loss potential
associated with it, given the value, criticality, exposure, and importance of the assets protected.
An optimal balance between cost and benefit may be realized by using a less costly combination
of engineering activities and system features and functions rather than the use of a single cost-
prohibitive activity or security feature or function. Moreover, an adverse performance impact
may preclude some security options.


                                          CONSERVATION OF RISK
            “The law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created
            nor destroyed, only change in form. This law has many important implications
            in engineering, including implying the impossibility of creating a perpetual
            motion machine … There is a parallel pseudo-principle that is often offered in
            a half-joking maxim – risk can neither be created nor destroyed, only moved
            around. It is not universally true [but] it is worthwhile considering the pseudo-
            principle because often, a change to a design often does end up ‘squeezing the
            risk balloon,’ only to discover that the risk appears elsewhere, perhaps in an
            unexpected place in the system, which could cause the defended system to be
            less secure than the engineering intended.”
