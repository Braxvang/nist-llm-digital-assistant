Special Publication 800-85B                                   PIV Data Model Testing Specification


Test Steps            1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                      2. Set OID := <<Card Holder Fingerprints
                         (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.96.16)>>
                      3. Call pivGetData w/
                         • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                      4. Extract the digestAlgorithms field contents from the
                         CBEFF_SIGNATURE_BLOCK
                      5. Extract the certificates field contents from the
                         CBEFF_SIGNATURE_BLOCK (if present)
                      6. Set OID := <<CHUID (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.48.0)>>
                      7. Call pivGetData w/
                         • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                      8. Extract the expiration date value from the CHUID (i.e.
                          Tag 0x35)
                      9. If a certificate extracted from the certificates field
                          of the CBEFF_SIGNATURE_BLOCK does not exist, then
                          extract the certificates field contents from the
                          asymmetric signature of the CHUID
                      10. From the certificate obtained (either from the
                          CBEFF_SIGNATURE_BLOCK or the CHUID signature field),
                          extract the subjectPublicKeyInfo->subjectPublicKey
                      11. Compute the size of the signer’s public key
                      12. Match the digest algorithm obtained from step 4 with
                          Table 3-3 of SP80078 based on the card expiration date,
                          and the public key algorithm and size used to sign the
                          fingerprint biometric
Expected              The digestAlgorithms field value of the SignedData is in accordance with
Result(s)             Table 3-3 of SP80078.


10.2.1.4 Verify contents of encapContentInfo

Purpose                Confirms that the eContentType of the encapContentInfo is id-PIV-
                       biometricObject and the eContent field of the encapContentInfo is
                       omitted.
Reference(s)          1.      FIPS201, Section 4.4.2

                      3.      AS06.02.06
Precondition          1.      A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                      2.      A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and the
                              contact reader.
                      3.      The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                      4.      A valid card holder fingerprint object is present on the PIV card.
