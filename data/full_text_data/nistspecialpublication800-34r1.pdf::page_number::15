                                                  CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



Chapter 1.       Introduction

 Information systems are vital elements in most mission/business processes. Because information system
 resources are so essential to an organization’s success, it is critical that identified services provided by
 these systems are able to operate effectively without excessive interruption. Contingency planning
 supports this requirement by establishing thorough plans, procedures, and technical measures that can
 enable a system to be recovered as quickly and effectively as possible following a service disruption.
 Contingency planning is unique to each system, providing preventive measures, recovery strategies, and
 technical considerations appropriate to the system’s information confidentiality, integrity, and availability
 requirements and the system impact level.

   Information system contingency planning refers to a coordinated strategy involving plans, procedures,
   and technical measures that enable the recovery of information systems, operations, and data after a
   disruption. Contingency planning generally includes one or more of the following approaches to
   restore disrupted services:
           Restoring information systems using alternate equipment;
           Performing some or all of the affected business processes using alternate processing (manual)
            means (typically acceptable for only short-term disruptions);
           Recovering information systems operations at an alternate location (typically acceptable for
            only long–term disruptions or those physically impacting the facility); and
           Implementing of appropriate contingency planning controls based on the information system’s
            security impact level.


 This document provides guidelines to individuals responsible for preparing and maintaining information
 system contingency plans (ISCPs). The document discusses essential contingency plan elements and
 processes, highlights specific considerations and concerns associated with contingency planning for
 various types of information system platforms, and provides examples to assist readers in developing their
 own ISCPs.

 1.1   Purpose

 This publication assists organizations in understanding the purpose, process, and format of ISCP
 development through practical, real-world guidelines. While the principles establish a baseline to meet
 most organizational needs, it is recognized that each organization may have additional requirements
 specific to its own operating environment. This guidance document provides background information on
 interrelationships between information system contingency planning and other types of security and
 emergency management-related contingency plans, organizational resiliency, and the system development
 life cycle (SDLC). The document provides guidance to help personnel evaluate information systems and
 operations to determine contingency planning requirements and priorities. Requirements from FIPS 199,
 Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems, security impact
 levels, and NIST Special Publication 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information
 Systems and Organizations contingency planning controls are integrated throughout the guideline.
 Considerations for impact levels and associated security controls for contingency planning are presented
 to assist planners in developing the appropriate contingency planning strategy. Although the information
 presented in this document is largely independent of particular hardware platforms, operating systems,
 and applications, technical considerations specific to common information system platforms are
 addressed.
