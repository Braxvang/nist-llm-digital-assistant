SP 800-130                                                               August 2013



6.4.8 Key Derivation or Key Update
When a key is derived from other information, some of which is secret, in a non-
reversible manner, the process is called key derivation. Key derivation is often used in
key establishment protocols to derive a shared key from a common shared secret (see [SP
800-56A], [SP 800-56B], [SP 800-56C], and [SP 800-135]).

Key derivation may also be used to derive a key from another key (see [SP 800-108]) or
from a password (see [SP 800-132]). In the case where a key (e.g., K1) is used to derive
another key (K2), and the derived key (K2) is used to replace the original key (i.e., K1),
then the process is called key update. In the past, keys were merely updated in order to
avoid having to use a key establishment protocol to establish a new key; all entities
sharing the key merely updated the key to form a new key without using any other secret
data. This process of key updating has the possible security exposure that an adversary
who obtains a key (by compromise or cryptanalysis) and knows the update
transformation can update the known key to any of its future updates.

FR:6.36 The CKMS design shall specify all processes used to derive or update keys and
the circumstances under which the keys are derived or updated.

FR:6.37 For each key type, the CKMS design shall specify requirements for advance
notification of the derivation or update of the keys, including which parties are notified,
how they are notified, what security services are applied to the notification, and the time-
frames for notification(s).

6.4.9 Destroy Key and Metadata
Keys and some portion of their metadata should be destroyed beyond recovery when they
are no longer to be used. Destroying a key in a high-security application can be a
complex process, depending on the storage media for the key and the extent of
distribution of key copies. Historically, the secure burning of paper keying material
(paper tape, punched cards, or printed key lists) in a prescribed manner was used. Keys in
electronic storage media may be overwritten with random patterns of zeros and ones.
Magnetic media that has a propensity for retaining low levels of magnetism may be
physically destroyed, degaussed, or over-written with various bit patterns numerous
times. Designers should include provisions for destroying a key in backup storage media
if such media are utilized.

FR:6.38 The CKMS design shall specify how and the circumstances under which keys
are intentionally destroyed and whether the destruction is local to a component or
universal throughout the CKMS.

FR:6.39 For each key type, the CKMS design shall specify requirements for an advance
notification of key destruction, including which parties are notified, how they are
notified, what security services are applied to the notification, and the time-frames for
notification(s).
