                                                   CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



1.        Introduction

Information systems are vital to {Organization’s} mission/business processes; therefore, it is critical
that services provided by {system name} are able to operate effectively without excessive interruption.
This Information System Contingency Plan (ISCP) establishes comprehensive procedures to recover
{system name} quickly and effectively following a service disruption.

1.1       Background

This {system name} ISCP establishes procedures to recover {system name} following a disruption. The
following recovery plan objectives have been established:
         Maximize the effectiveness of contingency operations through an established plan that consists of
          the following phases:
          o   Activation and Notification phase to activate the plan and determine the extent of damage;
          o   Recovery phase to restore {system name} operations; and
          o   Reconstitution phase to ensure that {system name} is validated through testing and that
              normal operations are resumed.
         Identify the activities, resources, and procedures to carry out {system name} processing
          requirements during prolonged interruptions to normal operations.
         Assign responsibilities to designated {organization name} personnel and provide guidance for
          recovering {system name} during prolonged periods of interruption to normal operations.
         Ensure coordination with other personnel responsible for {organization name} contingency
          planning strategies. Ensure coordination with external points of contact and vendors associated
          with {system name} and execution of this plan.

1.2       Scope

This ISCP has been developed for {system name}, which is classified as a high-impact system, in
accordance with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199 – Standards for Security
Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems. Procedures in this ISCP are for high-
impact systems and designed to recover {system name} within {RTO hours}. This plan does not address
replacement or purchase of new equipment, short-term disruptions lasting less than {RTO hours}, or loss
of data at the onsite facility or at the user-desktop levels.

1.3       Assumptions

The following assumptions were used when developing this ISCP:
         {System name} has been established as a high-impact system, in accordance with FIPS 199.
         Alternate processing sites and offsite storage are required and have been established for this
          system.
         Current backups of the system software and data are intact and available at the offsite storage
          facility in {City, State}.
         Alternate facilities have been established at {City, State} and are available if needed for relocation
          of {system name}.
