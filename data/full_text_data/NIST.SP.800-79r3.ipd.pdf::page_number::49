       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                    Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1529                    issuer operations. The logic for using the latter as the basis for an authorization
1530                    decision is described in Sec. 2.10.
1531                    Subtask 6.3: Share the authorization package with an independent party for
1532                    review, and arrive at an authorization decision.
1533                    Responsibility: DAO
1534                    Guidance: Before providing the final authorization decision, the DAO may seek
1535                    an independent review of the risks involved in the issuer operations. If the DAO
1536                    finds it necessary, the DAO shares the results of the assessment and the perceived
1537                    risks with another issuer (e.g., another agency that issues PIV Cards or derived
1538                    PIV credentials) to get their opinion and establish trustworthiness in the issued
1539                    credentials.
1540           Task 7: Authorization Documentation
1541           The authorization documentation task includes (i) completing and transmitting the
1542           authorization decision package to the appropriate individuals and organizations and (ii)
1543           updating the issuer’s operations plan.
1544                    Subtask 7.1: Provide copies of the authorization decision package in either paper
1545                    or electronic form to the EIMO and any other organization officials who have
1546                    interests, roles, or responsibilities in the issuer’s operations.
1547                    Responsibility: DAO
1548                    Guidance: The authorization decision package, including the authorization
1549                    decision letter, is transmitted to the EIMO. Upon receipt of the authorization
1550                    decision package, the EIMO reviews the authorization and its terms and
1551                    conditions. The original authorization decision package is kept on file by the
1552                    EIMO. The DAO retains copies of the contents of the authorization decision
1553                    package. The authorization decision package needs to be appropriately
1554                    safeguarded and stored in a centralized organization filing system whenever
1555                    possible to ensure accessibility. The authorization decision package is made
1556                    available to authorized auditors and oversight organizations upon request. The
1557                    authorization decision package needs to be retained in accordance with the
1558                    organization’s records retention policy. The issuer and specific facilities are
1559                    authorized for a maximum of three years from the date of the ATO. After the
1560                    period ends, reauthorization is performed.
1561                    Subtask 7.2: Update the operations plan.
1562                    Responsibility: EIMO
1563                    Guidance: The operations plan needs to be updated to reflect all changes made as
1564                    a result of the assessment and authorization. All conditions of the issuer’s
1565                    operations that are set forth in the authorization decision need to be noted in the
1566                    plan and addressed in a timely manner, as conveyed by the DAO.
