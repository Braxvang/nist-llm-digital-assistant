system to the high watermark or highest impact level must be applied when grouping
minor applications/subsystems with varying FIPS 199 impact levels into a single general
support system or major application unless there is adequate boundary protection, e.g.,
firewalls and encryption, around those subsystems or applications with the highest impact
level. Additionally, there must be assurance that the shared resources, i.e., networks,
communications, and physical access within the whole general support system or major
application, are protected adequately for the highest impact level. Having the ability to
isolate the high impact systems will not only result in more secure systems, but will also
reduce the amount of resources required to secure many applications/systems that do not
require that level of security. NIST SP 800-53 provides three security control baselines,
i.e., low, moderate, and high, that are associated with the three FIPS 199 impact levels; as
the impact level increases, so do the minimum assurance requirements. For reporting
purposes, i.e., FISMA annual report, when an information system has varying FIPS 199
impact levels, that system is categorized at the highest impact level on that information
system.


2.2 Major Applications
All federal applications have value and require some level of protection. Certain
applications, because of the information they contain, process, store, or transmit, or
because of their criticality to the agency's mission, require special management oversight.
These applications are major applications. A major application is expected to have a FIPS
199 impact level of moderate or high. OMB Circular A-130 defines a "major information
system" as an information system that requires special management attention because of
its importance to an agency mission; its high development, operating, or maintenance
costs; or its significant role in the administration of agency programs, finances, property,
or other resources. Major applications are by definition major information systems.

Major applications are systems that perform clearly defined functions for which there are
readily identifiable security considerations and needs (e.g., an electronic funds transfer
system). A major application might comprise many individual programs and hardware,
software, and telecommunications components. These components can be a single
software application or a combination of hardware/software focused on supporting a
specific, mission-related function. A major application may also consist of multiple
individual applications if all are related to a single mission function (e.g., payroll or
personnel). If a system is defined as a major application and the application is run on
another organization's general support system, the major application owner is responsible
for acceptance of risk and in addition:

   •   Notifies the general support system owner that the application is critical and
       provides specific security requirements;

   •   Provides a copy of the major application's system security plan to the operator of
       the general support system;
