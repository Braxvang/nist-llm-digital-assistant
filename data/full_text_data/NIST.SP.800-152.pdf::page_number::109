9.9    Development, Delivery, and Maintenance Assurances

The secure development, delivery, and maintenance of CKMS products can play a
significant role in the security of the CKMS. The following areas should be considered:
   a) Configuration management,
   b) Secure delivery,
   c) Development and maintenance environmental security, and
   d) Flaw remediation.

Each of these areas is described in the following subsections.

9.9.1 Configuration Management
An FCKMS should incorporate products that are developed and maintained under an
appropriate configuration management system in order to ensure that security is not
reduced, and functional flaws are not introduced due to unauthorized or unintentional
changes to the products.

FR:9.11 The CKMS design shall specify:
   a) The devices (including their source code, documentation, build scripts, executable
      code, firmware, hardware design specification, documentation, and test code) to
      be kept under configuration control.
   b) The protection requirements (e.g., formal authorizations and proper record
      keeping) to ensure that only authorized changes are made to the components and
      devices under configuration control.

PR:9.15        CM-2        A Federal CKMS shall be under configuration management
               CM-3        during design, implementation, procurement, installation,
               CM-9        configuration, operation, maintenance, and final destruction.
               SA-10
                           The Federal CKMS configuration management system shall
PR:9.16
                           maintain records of the make, model, version, and
                           identification number of each FCKMS module and device.
