Special Publication 800-157                                           Guidelines for Derived PIV Credentials


Appendix E—Glossary (Informative)

Selected terms used in the guide are defined below.

Applicant: An individual who has applied for, but has not yet been issued, a Derived PIV Credential.

Application Protocol Data Unit: A part of the application layer in the Open Systems Interconnection
Reference model that is used for communication between two separate device's applications. In the
context of smart cards, an APDU is the communication unit between a smart card reader and a smart card.
The structure of the APDU is defined by [ISO7816-4].

Derived PIV Application: A standardized application residing on a removable, hardware cryptographic
token that hosts a Derived PIV Credential and associated mandatory and optional elements.

Derived PIV Credential: An X.509 Derived PIV Authentication certificate, which is issued in
accordance with the requirements specified in this document where the PIV Authentication certificate on
the Applicant’s PIV Card serves as the original credential. The Derived PIV Credential is an additional
common identity credential under HSPD-12 and FIPS 201 that is issued by a Federal department or
agency and that is used with mobile devices.

Mobile Device: A portable computing device that: (i) has a small form factor such that it can easily be
carried by a single individual; (ii) is designed to operate without a physical connection (e.g., wirelessly
transmit or receive information); (iii) possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and (iv)
includes a self-contained power source. Mobile devices may also include voice communication
capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the devices to capture information, and/or built-in features for
synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones, tablets, and e-readers.

Subscriber: The individual who is the subject named or identified in a Derived PIV Authentication
certificate and who holds the token that contains the private key that corresponds to the public key in the
certificate.
