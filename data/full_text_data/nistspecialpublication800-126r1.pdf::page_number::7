                The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



Executive Summary

The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is a suite of specifications that standardize the format
and nomenclature by which security software products communicate security content, particularly
software flaw and security configuration information1. SCAP is a multi-purpose protocol that supports
automated configuration, vulnerability, and patch checking, technical control compliance activities, and
security measurement. Goals for the development of SCAP include standardizing system security
management, promoting interoperability of security products, and fostering the use of standard
expressions of security content.

SCAP Version 1.1 is comprised of seven specifications—eXtensible Configuration Checklist Description
Format (XCCDF), Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL®), Open Checklist Interactive
Language (OCIL), Common Platform Enumeration (CPE™), Common Configuration Enumeration
(CCE™), Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE®), and Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS). These specifications are grouped into three categories:

 Languages. The SCAP languages provide standard vocabularies and conventions for expressing
  security policy, technical check mechanisms, and assessment results.

 Enumerations. Each SCAP enumeration defines a standard nomenclature (naming format) and an
  official dictionary or list of items expressed using that nomenclature. For example, CVE provides a
  dictionary of publicly known information security vulnerabilities and exposures.2

 Measurement and scoring systems. In SCAP this refers to evaluating specific characteristics of a
  vulnerability and, based on those characteristics, generating a score that reflects the vulnerability‘s
  severity.

SCAP utilizes software flaw and security configuration standard reference data. This reference data is
provided by the National Vulnerability Database (NVD),3 which is managed by NIST and sponsored by
the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

This publication defines the technical composition of SCAP Version 1.1 in terms of its component
specifications, their interrelationships, and the requirements for SCAP content, and also describes details
of how the component specifications of SCAP interoperate. The technical specification for SCAP in this
publication describes the requirements and conventions that are to be employed to ensure the consistent
and accurate exchange of SCAP content and the ability to reliably use the content with SCAP validated
products.

The U.S. Federal Government, in cooperation with academia and private industry, is adopting SCAP and
encourages its use in support of security automation activities and initiatives.4 SCAP has achieved
widespread adoption by major software and hardware manufacturers and has become a significant
component of large information security management and governance programs. The protocol is expected
to evolve and expand in support of the growing needs to define and measure effective security controls,
assess and monitor ongoing aspects of that information security, and successfully manage systems in

    Products implementing SCAP can also be used to support non-security use cases such as configuration management and
    software inventory.
