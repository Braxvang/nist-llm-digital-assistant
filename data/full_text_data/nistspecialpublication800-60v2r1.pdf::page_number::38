Recommended Availability Impact Level: the provisional availability impact level recommended for
policy and guidance development information is low.
C.2.2.2 Public Comment Tracking Information Type

Public Comment Tracking involves the activities of soliciting, maintaining, and responding to
public comments regarding proposed regulations. Subject to exception conditions described
below, the recommended security categorization for the public comment tracking information
type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of public comment
tracking information on the ability of responsible agencies to solicit, maintain, and respond to
public comments regarding proposed regulations. The effects of loss of confidentiality of
information associated with the public comment process are unlikely to pose the threat of serious
harm to agency assets, personnel or operations.

In a few cases, the rationale for public comments can include information that is sensitive in
terms of proprietary information sensitive Federal government information, or even national
security information. However, such cases are exceptional and the information in question
would be expected to be representative of information types covered elsewhere in this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for public comment tracking information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications that
contain public comment tracking information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely
affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would
usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
public comment tracking information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the public comment tracking
information. The effects of disruption of access to public comment tracking information or
information systems can delay development of standards, guidelines, or regulations.
