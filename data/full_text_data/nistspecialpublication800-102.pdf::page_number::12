       information may be omitted from the TSP data that is transmitted by the TTA:
           •   Any portion of the user_supplied_info may be omitted, since it is known
               by entity A.
           •   Any portion of the TTA_supplied_info may be omitted when this
               information is known or can be determined by entity A.
       However, any such information omitted from the transmitted data shall be
       included in the timestamped_data that is used in the generation / verification of
       timestamp_signatureTTA = SIGTTA(timestamped_data).
       Upon receiving the TSP from the TTA, entity A should 1) check that the
       transmitted portions of the user_supplied_info are correct and 2) verify
       timestamp_signatureTTA using the TTA’s public signature verification key.
   3. Entity A signs (M, TSP), assembles D and sends it to entity B:
           D = M, TSP, SIGA(M, TSP),
       where the TSP is as specified in step 2.
       If any portion of the user_supplied_info was omitted from the TSP received from
       the TTA, then the entire user_supplied_info shall be inserted into the TSP used in
       the assembly of D unless there is a mutual agreement between entity A and entity
       B, in which case, any portion of the user_supplied_info may be omitted from the
       TSP data transmitted by entity A if it is known or can be determined by entity B.
       However, the entire user_supplied_info shall be included in the
       timestamped_data that is used in the generation / verification of
       timestamp_signatureTTA and SIGA(M, TSP).
       If any portion of the TTA_supplied_info was omitted from the TSP received from
       the TTA, then the entire TTA_supplied_info shall be inserted into the TSP used in
       the assembly of D unless there is a mutual agreement between entity A and entity
       B, in which case, any portion of the TTA_supplied_info may be omitted from the
       TSP data transmitted by entity A if it is known or can be determined by entity B.
       However, the entire TTA_supplied_info shall be included in the
       timestamped_data that is used in the generation / verification of
       timestamp_signatureTTA and SIGA(M, TSP).
   4. Upon receiving D, entity B does the following:
           •   Verifies timestamp_signatureTTA using the TTA’s public signature
               verification key, and
           •   Verifies SIGA(M, TSP) using entity A’s public signature verification key.
       Note that it is irrelevant which of these steps is performed first; it is only
       important that both verifications are successful.
Because of the verifications performed in step 4, entity B knows (and/or has assurance
of) the following:
   a. M could have been assembled either before or after the TSP was received.
