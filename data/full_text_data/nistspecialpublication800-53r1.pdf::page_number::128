SA-10     DEVELOPER CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT

          Control: The organization requires that information system developers create and implement a
          configuration management plan that controls changes to the system during development, tracks
          security flaws, requires authorization of changes, and provides documentation of the plan and its
          implementation.
          Supplemental Guidance: This control also applies to the development actions associated with
          information system changes.

SA-11     DEVELOPER SECURITY TESTING

          Control: The organization requires that information system developers create a security test and
          evaluation plan, implement the plan, and document the results.
          Supplemental Guidance: Developmental security test results are used to the greatest extent feasible
          after verification of the results and recognizing that these results are impacted whenever there have
          been security relevant modifications to the information system subsequent to developer testing.
          Test results may be used in support of the security certification and accreditation process for the
          delivered information system. Related security controls: CA-2, CA-4.
          Control Enhancements: None.
