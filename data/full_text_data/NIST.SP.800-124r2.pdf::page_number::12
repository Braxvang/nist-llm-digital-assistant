Organizations can implement the following to build and maintain the security of their mobile
device deployment:
   •   Conduct a threat analysis for mobile devices and any information systems accessed from
       mobile devices.
   •   Employ enterprise mobility management, mobile threat defense, mobile application
       vetting, and other applicable enterprise mobile security technologies.
   •   Implement and test a pilot of a mobile device solution before putting the solution into
       production.
   •   Fully secure each organization-issued mobile device before allowing a user to access the
       organization’s systems or information.
   •   Keep mobile operating systems and apps updated.
   •   Regularly monitor and maintain mobile device security.



       Introduction
Mobile devices are no longer new to the workplace. Modern mobile devices are essentially
general-purpose computing platforms capable of performing tasks far beyond the voice and text
capabilities of legacy mobile devices. Smartphones and tablets process enterprise information
and are regularly included in the design phase of modern network architectures. Multiple mature
mobile operating systems (OSs) are available in the marketplace and have a variety of
functionality to secure these devices in the workplace. New mobile technologies for the
enterprise are still being introduced. Full equity does not yet exist when comparing the
