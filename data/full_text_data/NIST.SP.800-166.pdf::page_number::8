1.     Introduction

1.1    Background

Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) for
Federal Employees and Contractors [FIPS201], specified a common set of identity credentials
for the purpose of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 [HSPD12] in a smart card form
factor, known as the PIV Card. [FIPS201] originally required that all PIV credentials and
associated keys be stored on the PIV Card, and although the use of the PIV Card for electronic
authentication works well with traditional desktop and laptop computers, it is not optimized for
mobile devices. 1

In response to the growing use of mobile devices within the Federal Government, [FIPS201] was
revised to permit the issuance of an additional credential specifically for mobile devices. This
PIV credential is called a Derived PIV Credential, for which the corresponding private key is
stored in a cryptographic module within a mobile device. The use of this Derived PIV Credential
is restricted to provide PIV-enabled authentication services on mobile devices in order to
authenticate the credential holder to remote systems.

1.2    Purpose and Scope

The objective of this document is to provide test requirements and test assertions that could be
used to validate the compliance/conformance of the following: (i) the Derived PIV Application
and (ii) the Derived PIV data model. Because NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-157,
Guidelines for Derived Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Credentials [SP800-157], was
developed for meeting interoperability goals of [FIPS201], the conformance tests in this
document provide the assurance that the Derived PIV Application and associated derived PIV
data objects that have passed these tests are conformant to the specification. This in turn
facilitates procurement of [FIPS201]-products that are interoperable and meet the goals of
[HSPD12].

[SP800-157] specifies the use of removable tokens with form factors that may be inserted into
mobile devices, such as Secure Digital (SD) Cards, Universal Service Bus (USB) tokens,
Universal Integrated Circuit Cards (UICC - the new generation of Subscriber Identity Module
(SIM) cards), and non-removable tokens that are embedded in mobile devices. [SP800-157] does
not define an application interface for embedded tokens, because these tokens are built into the
mobile device and the interface to these tokens is natively supported. Since [SP800-157] does
not specify application interface requirements for embedded tokens, testing the interfaces for
embedded tokens is outside the scope of this document. 2 In addition, this document does not

  A mobile device “is a portable computing device that: (i) has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried
by a single individual; (ii) is designed to operate without a physical connection (e.g., wirelessly transmit or receive
information); (iii) possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and (iv) includes a self-contained
power source. Mobile devices may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the
devices to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples
include smart phones, tablets, and e-readers.” [SP800-157, p. iv]
