      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                                 Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                                                        and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

918   2.10.4.                  Authorization Impact of Information Systems Under SP 800-37
919   An issuer SHALL NOT be authorized to operate if one or more of its critical information
920   systems is deemed insecure and it is therefore issued a DATO according to [SP800-37]. If an
921   IATO has been issued for an information system, the DAO MAY NOT issue greater than an
922   IATO for the issuer. Once the [SP800-37] IATO is replaced with an [SP800-37] ATO, the DAO
923   can issue an SP 800-79 ATO. If the [SP800-37] ATO expires for one or more information
924   systems during the course of operation of an issuer, the EIMO SHALL assess the criticality of
925   the system for operations and present the analysis to the DAO. The DAO can then exercise the
926   following options:
927           •    Specify a short time during which the information systems of the issuer must be
928                reauthorized under then without changing the ATO status,
929           •    Downgrade the current SP 800-79 ATO to an IATO, or
930           •    If circumstances warrant, issue an SP 800-79 DATO and halt all issuer operations.

931                Use of Risk in the Authorization Decision
932   Authorization is the official management decision by the DAO to permit the operation of an
933   issuer based on an assessment of its reliability and an acceptance of the risk inherent in that
934   decision. By granting an authorization to operate, the DAO accepts responsibility for the
935   reliability of the issuer and is fully accountable for any adverse impacts to the organization or
936   any other organization from the use of issued PIV Cards or derived PIV credentials.
937   The assessment of an issuer enables the DAO to determine its reliability and whether to accept
938   the risk to the organization in granting an ATO. As the requirements in [FIPS201] and related
939   documents form the basis of the authorization and are ultimately derived from the policy
940   objectives of [HSPD-12], those not reliably met by the issuer and its issuing facilities represent
941   the potential for adverse impact.
942   The PIV Card is used to establish assurance of an identity, and as such, it must be trusted as a
943   basis for granting access to the logical and physical resources of the organization. Similarly, the
944   derived PIV credential alternative form factors greatly improve the usability of electronic
945   authentication to remote IT resources while maintaining identity assurance through post-
946   enrollment binding. The incorrect or inconsistent implementation of an [HSPD-12] program
947   exposes an organization to an unacceptable level of risk since any problem with an issued PIV
948   Card or derived PIV credential that undermines this assurance could allow unauthorized access
949   to sensitive organizational resources and expose an organization to harm. Furthermore, the
950   collection, processing, and dissemination of personal information is required to issue these
951   credentials and increases the threat of this information being used for malicious purposes 8 if not
952   secured. It is the DAO’s responsibility to weigh the risks of these and other security and privacy
953   impacts when making the authorization decision. Furthermore, as [HSPD-12] is a government-
954   wide mandate based on a standard of interoperability that allows organizations to accept other
955   organizations’ credentials, authorization decisions within a single organization directly impact
956   other organizations. For example, an interoperable credential issued by an authorized federal
957   organization becomes the source of trust for another organization to grant access to physical and
      8
          The collection of personally identifiable information (PII) is minimized for derived PIV credentials because of the derivation process.
