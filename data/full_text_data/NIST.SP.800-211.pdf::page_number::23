Lightweight Cryptography
Many elements of modern technology rely on cryptography to provide confidentiality
and to ensure the integrity of information being exchanged. While many of today’s
cryptographic methods are reliable, they require time and power that many devices
(e.g. sensor networks, healthcare, distributed control systems, IoT, and cyber-
physical systems) may not have available. The small and simple nature of the millions
of electronic devices making up the IoT renders them unequipped to process the
current cryptographic algorithms. To address this challenge, NIST is working with the
cryptographic community to solicit, evaluate, and standardize lightweight cryptographic
algorithms that are suitable for use in constrained environments where the requirements
and performance of the current NIST cryptographic standards is not acceptable. NIST
published a call for algorithms to be considered for lightweight cryptographic standards
in FY 2019.
In FY 2019, NIST also announced the publication of NISTIR 8268, Status Report on the
First Round of the NIST Lightweight Cryptography Standardization Process [17]. This
report described the application of a public, competition-like process to select one or
more authenticated encryption and hashing schemes that are suitable for constrained
environments. NIST received 57 candidate algorithms for consideration, of which 56
were accepted as first-round candidates. NISTIR 8268 describes the evaluation criteria
and selection process based on public feedback and an internal review of the candidates
and provides the list of 32 candidate algorithms selected for the second round of the
evaluation process. (See https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/lightweight-cryptography/
round-2-candidates.) NIST continued public collaboration on the topic in its third
gathering at the Lightweight Cryptography Workshop in Gaithersburg, MD, where the
candidate algorithms, including their design strategies, implementations, performance,
cryptanalysis, and target applications.


Transition to FIPS 140-3
In FY 2019, NIST continued to develop
new tools and processes to support an
ISO-based cryptographic module testing
program as a validation authority while
supporting the existing validation process.
For more than a quarter century, NIST’s
Federal Information Processing Standard
(FIPS) 140 publication series has been
used to coordinate the requirements and                           CREDIT: Shutterstock / Victor Moussa

use by U.S. agencies.
On March 22, 2019, the Secretary of Commerce approved FIPS 140-3, Security
Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. The update to FIPS 140 includes references                       15
to two existing international standards: ISO/IEC 19790:2012, Information technology—
