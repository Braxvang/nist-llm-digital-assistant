                                                                          SECTION 7: RECOMMENDED PRACTICES



7.    Recommended Practices

As explained in Sections 2 through 5, there are numerous ways to implement and configure RFID systems
to support a wide variety of applications. RFID systems typically must be highly customized to support
the business processes they automate; no one-size-fits-all approach will work across implementations.
Nevertheless, organizations can benefit from following some general principles when using RFID
technology. This section describes a set of recommended security practices that can help organizations
manage RFID risks to an acceptable level.

To be most effective, RFID security controls should be incorporated throughout the entire life cycle –
from policy development to operations. This section references a five-phase life cycle to help
organizations determine the most appropriate actions to take at each point in the development of the RFID
system. The life cycle is based on a model introduced in NIST Special Publication 800-64, Security
Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle. Organizations may follow a project
management methodology or life cycle model that does not directly map to the phases presented here, but
the types of tasks and their sequencing are probably similar. The phases of the life cycle are as follows:

 Phase 1: Initiation. This phase covers the tasks that an organization should perform before it starts
  to design its RFID system. These tasks include conducting a risk assessment and developing policy
  and requirements with which the RFID system must comply.
 Phase 2: Acquisition/Development. For the purposes of this guide, the acquisition/development
  phase is split into two sub-phases:

        –   Phase 2a: Planning and Design. In this phase, RFID network architects specify the
            standards with which the RFID system must comply, the network infrastructure that will
            support the system, and the technical characteristics of the RFID system, including the types
            of tag and readers that will be deployed. This phase should also include site surveys of the
            facilities and relevant IT infrastructure.

        –   Phase 2b: Procurement. In this phase, the organization specifies the RFID components that
            must be purchased, the feature sets and protocols they must support, and any standards on
            which they must be based.
 Phase 3: Implementation. In this phase, procured equipment is configured to meet operational and
  security requirements, RFID data is integrated with legacy enterprise systems, and staff are trained in
  the proper use and maintenance of the system.
 Phase 4: Operations/Maintenance. This phase includes security-related tasks that an organization
  should perform on an ongoing basis once the RFID system is operational, including conducting
  periodic security assessments, applying security-related software patches, and reviewing RFID event
  logs.
 Phase 5: Disposition. This phase encompasses tasks that occur when a system or its components
  have been retired, perhaps as a result of a significant upgrade. These tasks include preserving
  information to meet legal requirements and disabling or destroying tags and other components when
  they are taken out of service.
The practices presented in this section are provided in tables corresponding to the life cycle phases. Each
practice is accompanied by a brief explanation of the rationale for its inclusion and is rated as
“recommended” or “should consider.” Organizations are strongly encouraged to adopt the
“recommended” practices. Failure to implement them significantly increases the risk of an RFID security
