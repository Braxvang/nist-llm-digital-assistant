                      Reports on Computer Systems Technology

The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical leadership for the Nation’s
measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test methods, reference data, proof of
concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the development and productive use of
information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the development of management, administrative,
technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of other than
national security-related information in Federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series
reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its
collaborative activities with industry, government, and academic organizations.



                                                Abstract

This recommendation provides technical guidelines for the implementation of standards-based, secure,
reliable, interoperable public key infrastructure (PKI) based identity credentials that are issued by Federal
departments and agencies to individuals who possess and prove control over a valid PIV Card. The scope
of this document includes requirements for initial issuance and maintenance of these credentials,
certificate policies and cryptographic specifications, technical specifications for permitted cryptographic
token types and the command interfaces for the removable implementations of such cryptographic tokens.
