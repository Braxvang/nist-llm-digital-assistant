          ESSENTIAL DESIGN
                                                                                 DESCRIPTION
              CRITERIA

          NON-BYPASSABLE             The mechanism must not be circumventable.

          EVALUATABLE                The mechanism must be sufficiently small and simple enough to be assessed to produce
                                     adequate confidence in the protection provided, the constraint (or control objective)
                                     enforced, and the correct implementation of the mechanism. The assessment includes the
                                     analysis and testing needed. (Clear Abstractions, Reduced Complexity, and Structured
                                     Decomposition and Composition)

          ALWAYS INVOKED             The protection provided by a mechanism or feature that is not always invoked is not
                                     continuous, and, therefore, a loss may occur while the mechanism or feature is suspended
                                     or turned off. (Continuous Protection)

          TAMPER-PROOF               The mechanism or feature and the data that the mechanism or feature depends on cannot
                                     be modified in an unauthorized manner.



The design criteria described above are based on the generalized reference monitor concept. The
reference monitor concept 72 is an abstract model of the necessary and sufficient properties that
must be achieved by any mechanism that performs an access mediation control function [21]
[37]. The reference monitor concept is a foundational access control concept for assured system
design. It is defined as a trustworthy abstract machine that mediates all accesses to objects by
subjects [38]. As a concept for an abstract machine, the reference monitor does not address any
specific implementation. A reference validation mechanism, which includes a combination of
hardware and software, realizes the reference monitor concept to provide the access mediation
foundation for a trustworthy secure system.

The generalized reference monitor concept and the four essential design criteria can be used
effectively as the design basis for individual system elements, collections of elements, networks,
and systems where intentional and unintentional adversity can prevent the realization of a loss.
The reference monitor concept drives the need for rigor in engineering activities commensurate
with the trust to be placed in the system or its constituent system elements. 73 The concept
describes an abstract model of the necessary properties that must be realized by any mechanism
that claims to achieve a constraint or set of constraints and the basis for determining the extent to
which the properties are satisfied. A mechanism that achieves successful constraint has two
parts: (1) a means to decide whether to constrain or not constrain and (2) enforcement of the
decision. Enforcement of the decision must sufficiently:
•       Enforce constraints to achieve only the authorized and intended system behaviors and
        outcomes
•       Provide self-protection against targeted attacks on the mechanism enforcing the decision
        (including applying the essential design criteria)


72
     The reference monitor concept is described in the Trustworthy System Control principle in Appendix E.
73
     Conceptually, the reference monitor concept can be extended to any control function that is to enforce a system constraint [39].
