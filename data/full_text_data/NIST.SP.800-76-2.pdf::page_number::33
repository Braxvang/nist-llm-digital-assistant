6.3                                        Iris image specification for PIV Cards
6.3.1                                          General case
Iris images on PIV Cards shall conform to the requirements expressed in the Table 9 profile of the ISO/IEC 19794-6:2011
standard. Where required values and practice are not stated, the underlying requirements of the base standard shall
apply. The profile defines a standard record that contains one or two specialized iris images each of size around 3
kilobytes. These images shall follow the semantic requirements of Image Type 7 images defined in the standard. The
objective of these specifications is to afford maximum possible iris accuracy, low storage requirements, and
corresponding fast read times. These requirements include centering and masking of the eyelid and sclera regions (an
example is shown in Figure 5, column B). The masked regions can be very efficiently compressed. This affords small
record sizes and, vitally, preservation of the iris texture.

                                                                       Table 9 − ISO/IEC 19794-6 profile for iris images stored on PIV Cards
