FR:6.93 The CKMS design shall specify the capabilities of its ACS to accommodate,
implement, and enforce the CKMS Security Policy.

                AC-24       all its key and metadata management services and functions,
                            granting access to and permission to initiate a requested
                            service or function only after verifying the authorization of
                            the requesting entity to perform the requested service or
                            function.

6.7.2 Restricting Cryptographic Module Entry and Output of Plaintext Keys
An FCKMS should minimize human access to plaintext keys. The primary need for keys to
be in plaintext is when they are performing cryptographic functions within a cryptographic
module. A major concern is the entry and output of plaintext secret and private keys
into/from the cryptographic module.

Note that Section 6.4.19 addresses the entry of keys and metadata into a cryptographic
module, and Section 6.4.20 addresses the output from the module.

Also, note that Section 6.1.2 requires that keys for Moderate and High impact-level systems
be cryptographically protected from unauthorized disclosure when outside a cryptographic
module, i.e., when outside the module, secret and private keys need to be encrypted, rather
than in plaintext form. Therefore, the entry and output of plaintext secret and private keys is
only allowed for Low impact-level systems. However, Section 6.1.2 also recommends that
these keys be encrypted.

FR:6.94 The CKMS design shall specify the circumstances under which plaintext secret or
plaintext private keys are entered into or output from a cryptographic module.

FR:6.95 If plaintext secret or plaintext private keys are entered into or output from any
cryptographic module, then the CKMS design shall specify how the plaintext keys are
protected and controlled outside of the cryptographic module.

FR:6.96 If plaintext secret or plaintext private keys are entered into or output from any
cryptographic module, then the CKMS design shall specify how such actions are audited.

6.7.3 Controlling Human Input
If a key-management function requires that a human input a key or sensitive metadata, the
human must accept responsibility for the accuracy and security of the input, as well as
entering the input at the proper time or when the proper event occurs. Minimizing human
