GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



       Facilitator Guide. The facilitator guide includes the following:

          –    The purpose for conducting the exercise

          –    The exercise’s scope and objectives

          –    The exercise’s scenario, which is a sequential, narrative account of a hypothetical incident
               that provides the catalyst for the exercise and is intended to introduce situations that will
               inspire responses and thus allow demonstration of the exercise objectives

          –    A list of questions regarding the scenario that address the exercise objectives 14

          –    A copy of the IT plan being exercised.
          The types of questions documented in the facilitator guide should be tailored to the participants.
          For example, if senior-level personnel are the participants, the questions should be of a more
          general, high-level nature and focus on decision-making and oversight, which are consistent with
          their roles and responsibilities within the plan. If operational personnel are the participants, the
          questions should typically be focused on specific procedures and processes that are followed to
          carry out roles and responsibilities.
       Participant Guide. The participant guide includes the same information as the facilitator guide
        without the list of questions. Participant guides contain a modified, shorter list of questions to
        orient participants to the types of issues that may be discussed during the exercise.
       After Action Report. An after action report is developed after the exercise event; it contains
        information based on pre-identified evaluation criteria. The criteria should be developed before
        the exercise to ensure data collectors know what type of information to capture during the
        exercise and, ultimately, document in the after action report. Evaluation criteria are based on the
        exercise objectives and provide a means to evaluate how well exercise objectives were met and
        identify areas where additional exercises might be necessary. After action reports are discussed
        in more detail in Section 4.5.

Sample tabletop exercise documentation is located in Appendix A.

A common misconception is that scenarios must be very detailed to be effective. Actually, it is often
more effective to develop a short, concise scenario. During tabletop exercises with long, detailed
scenarios, participants often spend more time dissecting the scenario and discussing its content than they
spend on meeting the objectives of the exercise. If a detailed scenario is desired, a trusted agent with
detailed knowledge of the plan and all the procedures documented within the plan should aid in the
development of the scenario to ensure accuracy. In addition, the facilitator should have the ability to
redirect the participants’ focus from the scenario to the objectives, should they begin focusing too much
on the content of the scenario.

4.4     Conduct the Tabletop Exercise

Tabletop exercises are usually conducted in a classroom-type setting. This permits a facilitator to address
each individual or the participants as a group while facilitating the exercise. This also fosters
communication among the participants, as does placing a name tent on the table for each participant
