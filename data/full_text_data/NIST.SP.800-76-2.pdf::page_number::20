4.      Fingerprint off-card authentication specifications

4.1     Scope
This Section specifies how the PIV mandatory biometric elements specified in [FIPS] are to be generated and stored.
This specification applies to templates stored within the PIV Card, and to [MINUSTD] templates otherwise retained by
agencies. The templates constitute the enrollment biometrics for PIV authentication and as such are supported by a
high quality image acquisition specification, and an FBI-certified compression format. The specification of a
standardized template here enables use of the PIV Card in a multi-vendor product environment.

4.2     Source images
Two [MINUSTD] fingerprint templates shall be stored on the PIV Card; these are hereafter referred to as PIV Card
templates. These shall be prepared from images of the primary and secondary fingers. These fingers should be
selected on the basis of:
―     Availability: Ability of individuals to mechanically place the finger on a generic sensor – this contraindicates ring
      fingers, and sometimes thumbs.
―     Quality: High quality fingers, preferably those of NFIQ = 1 or 2, should be used. Lower quality fingers should only
      be used if recapture (per Section 3.2.1) has failed and if other items in this list preclude use of better quality
      fingers.
―     Control: Ability to use fine motor control in placing the finger on a sensor – for most individuals this indicates use
      of index fingers.
―     Handedness: Individuals should favor their preferred hand, for most people this is the right hand.
―     Injury: Presence of permanent or temporary injury to the friction ridge structure, or the finger itself – this
      contraindicates use of afflicted fingers.
―     Area: Physical area of the finger's volar pad – this favors use of thumbs, and contraindicates little "pinky" fingers.
―     Two-finger sensors: If two-finger sensors are deployed and used, adjacent fingers can be placed simultaneously.
―     Sensor placement: If the fingerprint sensor is to the side of a user vs. in front (as for the driver of a vehicle), the
      fingers from the same hand might be used.
Thus a PIV Card applicant, in consultation with an attending operator, should select primary and secondary fingers
with the following being the default, in descending order of priority.
          1. Preferred index    3. Preferred middle 5. Preferred thumb 7. Preferred ring         9. Preferred little
          2. Other index        4. Other middle     6. Other thumb     8. Other ring             10. Other little
These images shall be either:
―     those obtained by segmenting the initial plain impressions of the full set of fingerprints captured during PIV
      Registration and stored in Row 8 of Table 3, or
―     new images collected and matched against the initial plain impressions (see [FIPS]).
Significant rotation, exceeding 30 degrees, of the multi-finger plain impressions (for example, that which can occur
when four fingers are imaged using a narrow platen) shall be removed prior to, or as part of, the generation of the
mandatory minutiae templates. The rotation angle shall be that which makes the inter-phalangeal creases
approximately horizontal or, equivalently, the inter-finger spaces approximately vertical. This requirement supports
interoperable fingerprint matching.

4.3     Card issuance
[FIPS] establishes requirements on authentication of card applicants for example to bind the PIV Cardholder to the
individual whose background was checked. This authentication shall use images collected using either a [EBTS,
Appendix F] multi-finger fingerprint imaging device of Section 3.2, or a [SINGFING] device of Section 4.7.
