each data file. For both bit stream images and logical backups, the message digests created to ensure data
integrity should be stored on read-only or write-once media or printed, and then secured in a proper
location.

4.2.3     File Modification, Access, and Creation Times

It is often important to know when a file was created, used, or manipulated, and most OSs keep track of
certain timestamps related to files. The most commonly used timestamps are the modification, access,
and creation (MAC) times, as follows:
     ! Modification Time. This is the last time a file was changed in any way, including when a file is
       written to and when it is changed by another program.
     ! Access Time. This is the last time any access was performed on a file (e.g., viewed, opened,
       printed).
     ! Creation Time. This is generally the time and date the file was created; however, when a file is
       copied to a system, the creation time will become the time the file was copied to the new system.
       The modification time will remain intact.
Different types of filesystem may store different types of times. For example, Windows systems retain
the last modified time, the last access time, and the creation time of files.41 UNIX systems retain the last
modification, last inode42 change, and last access times; however, some UNIX systems (including
versions of BSD and SunOS) do not update the last access time of executable files when they are run.
Some UNIX systems record the time when the metadata for a file was most recently altered. Metadata is
data about data; for filesystems, metadata is data that provides information about a file’s contents.
If an analyst needs to establish an accurate timeline of events, then the file times should be preserved.
Accordingly, analysts should be aware that not all methods for collecting data files can preserve file
times. Bit stream images can preserve file times because a bit-for-bit copy is generated; performing a
logical backup using some tools may cause file creation times to be altered when the data file is copied.
For this reason, whenever file times are essential, bit stream imaging should be used to collect data.
Analysts should also be aware that file times may not always be accurate. Among the reasons for such
inaccuracies are the following:
     ! The computer’s clock does not have the correct time. For example, the clock may not have been
       synchronized regularly with an authoritative time source.
     ! The time may not be recorded with the expected level of detail, such omitting the seconds or
       minutes.
     ! An attacker may have altered the recorded file times.
4.2.4     Technical Issues

Several technical issues may arise in collecting data files. As noted in Section 4.2.1, the primary issue is
the collection of deleted files and remnants of files existing in free and slack space on media. Individuals
can use a variety of techniques to hinder the collection of such data. For example, there are many utilities
available that perform wiping—the overwriting of media (or portions of media, such as particular files)
with random or constant values (e.g., all 0’s). Such utilities vary in services and reliability, but most are

     Windows systems using the NTFS filesystem also record the entry modified time.

     An inode is a set of data regarding certain characteristics of a file, such as the privileges set for the file and the file’s owner.
