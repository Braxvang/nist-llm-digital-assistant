                                                                               GUIDE TO SECURE WEB SERVICES



4.3   Portal Interaction with the SOA’s Discovery Service

As described in Section 4.2, pages presented to the user can be tailored to analyze a user’s credentials to
prevent users from searching for services that the user is not authorized to interact with.

If a portal’s SAML assertion (on behalf of a user) does not include the proper credentials to access a
service (as determined by the discovery service), the user will not be permitted to know that the service
exists. Controlling access to services at the discovery level may be beneficial to the service. It can
simplify the administration of access controls required to maintain the service’s expected level of
security.

4.4   Summary

In a SOA, the Web portal is an SSO starting point for users interfacing with a SOA. Web portals interact
with provider services and identity providers to perform actions on behalf of the user. By acting as a
middleman between the user and the provider services, portals must provide authentication information
about the user, coordinate with the provider's authorization mechanisms and policy administration as well
as provide auditing services, integrity, confidentiality, availability, and non-repudiation of messages sent
to both the user and provider. Through SAML and WS-Security, these goals can be achieved. SAML
allows the user to authenticate with the identity provider and will provide SAML assertions that can be
sent along with all requests on behalf of the user. Provider services can then verify the contents of the
SAML assertions and determine whether the user is authorized to perform the action.
