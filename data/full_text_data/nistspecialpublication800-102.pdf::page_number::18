             TSP = timestamped_data, timestamp_signatureTTA
         where:
             user_supplied_info = SIGA(M), other_info.
             timestamped_data = user_supplied_info, TTA_supplied_info, timestamp.
             timestamp_signatureTTA = SIGTTA(user_supplied_info, TTA_supplied_info,
                timestamp).
         If there is a mutual agreement between entity B and the TTA, the following
         information may be omitted from the TSP transmitted by entity B:
             •    Any portion of the user_supplied_info may be omitted, since it is known
                  by entity B.
             •    Any portion of the TTA_supplied_info may be omitted when this
                  information is known or can be determined by entity B.
         However, the entire user_supplied_info and the entire TTA_supplied_info shall be
         included in the generation / verification of timestamp_signatureTTA.
      4. Upon receiving the TSP, entity B does the following:
             •    Checks that the transmitted portions of the user_supplied_info are correct,
             •    Verifies timestamp_signatureTTA using the TTA’s public signature
                  verification key, and
             •    Verifies SIGA(M) using entity A’s public signature verification key if it
                  was not verified prior to sending it to the TTA.
         Note that the order of performing these steps is irrelevant; it is only important that
         all verifications are successful.
Because of the verifications performed in step 4, entity B has evidence of the following:
      a. M and SIGA (M) were generated before the time indicated by the TSP’s
         timestamp, and
      b. SIGA(M) was included in the timestamped_data that was signed by the TTA.
This evidence (i.e., M, SIGA(M) and the TSP) can be presented to any third party who
also trusts the TTA.

4.4      Using an Additional Timestamp
A refinement of the signature generation time may be obtained if a second timestamp is
requested from a TTA. Any entity could make the request, although requests by entity A
and entity B are discussed below. This procedure has the most value if the second
timestamp request is made as close as possible to the generation of entity A’s signature
on the first timestamp packet; thus, a minimal time interval is established during which
the signature was generated. The discussions assume that all digital signatures are
successfully verified.
