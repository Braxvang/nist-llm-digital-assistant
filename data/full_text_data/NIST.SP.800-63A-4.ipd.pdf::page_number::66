1775   10.3. Equity and Identity VeriÔ¨Åcation
1776   Identity verification involves proving the binding between the applicant undergoing the
1777   identity proofing process and the validated, real-world identity established through the
1778   identity resolution and validation steps. It most often involves collecting a picture (facial
1779   image capture) of the applicant taken during the identity proofing event and comparing it
1780   a photograph contained on a presented and validated piece of identity evidence.
1781   This section provides a set of possible problems and mitigations with the inequitable
1782   treatment or outcomes associated with the identity verification phase:
1783   Description: Image capture technologies lack the ability to capture certain skin
1784   tones or facial features of sufficient quality to perform a comparison.
1785   Possible mitigations include:
1786      1. Employing robust image capture technologies that are able to accommodate
1787         different skin tones, facial features, and lighting situations
1788      2. Conducting operational testing to determine if the image capture technologies have
1789         introduced unintentional biases
1790      3. Providing risk-based alternative processes that compensate for residual bias and
1791         technological limitations
1792   Description: Facial coverings worn for religious purposes impede the ability to
1793   capture a facial image of an applicant.
1794   Possible mitigations include:
1795      1. Providing Trusted Referees (Sec. 5.1.9.1) who can make risk-based decisions based
1796         on the specific applicant circumstances.
1797      2. Providing alternative ways to accomplish identity verification, such as an in-person
1798         proofing.
1799   Description: When using 1:1 facial image comparison technologies, biased facial
1800   comparison algorithms may result in false non-matches.
1801   Possible mitigations include:
1802      1. Using algorithms that are independently tested for consistent performance across
1803         demographic groups and image types
1804      2. Supporting alternative processes to compensate for residual bias and technological
1805         limitations
1806      3. Conducting ongoing quality monitoring and operational testing to identify
1807         performance variances are identified across demographic groups and implementing
1808         corrective actions as needed (e.g., updated algorithms, machine learning, etc.)
