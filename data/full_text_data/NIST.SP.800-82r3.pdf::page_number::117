NIST SP 800-82r3                                             Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            The physical protection of the cyber components and data associated
            with OT must be addressed as part of the overall security for OT
            environments. Security at many OT facilities is closely tied to
            operational safety. A primary goal is to keep personnel out of hazardous
            situations without preventing them from doing their jobs or carrying out
            emergency procedures.
            Physical access controls are often applied to the OT environment as
            compensating controls when legacy systems do not support modern IT
            logical access controls (e.g., an asset could be locked in a cabinet when
            the USB port or power button cannot be logically disabled). When
            implementing these mitigations, organizations should consider whether
            the OT component being protected can be compromised using a wireless
            or network connection that might bypass the physical security controls.
            A defense-in-depth solution to physical security should consider the
            following attributes:
                   •   Protection of physical locations. Classic physical security
                       considerations typically include an architecture of layered
                       security measures that create several physical barriers around
                       buildings, facilities, rooms, equipment, or other informational
                       assets. Physical security controls should be implemented to
                       protect physical locations and may include fences, anti-vehicle
                       ditches, earthen mounds, walls, reinforced barricades, gates, door
                       and cabinet locks, guards, or other measures.
                   •   Physical access control. Equipment cabinets should be locked
                       when not required for operation or safety, and wiring should be
                       neat and contained within cabinets or under floors. Additionally,
                       consider keeping all computing and networking equipment in
                       secured areas. Keys of OT assets, like PLCs and safety systems,
                       should be in the “Run” position at all times unless they are being
                       actively programmed.
                   •   Access monitoring systems. Access monitoring systems include
                       electronic surveillance capabilities, such as still and video
                       cameras, sensors, and identification systems (e.g., badge readers,
                       biometric scanners, electronic keypads). Such devices typically
                       do not prevent access to a particular location. Rather, they store
                       and record either the physical presence or the lack of physical
                       presence of individuals, vehicles, animals, or other physical
                       entities. Adequate lighting should be provided based on the type
                       of access monitoring device deployed. These systems can also
                       sometimes alert or initiate action upon the detection of
                       unauthorized access.
                   •   People and asset tracking. Locating people and vehicles in a
                       facility can be important for both safety and security reasons.
