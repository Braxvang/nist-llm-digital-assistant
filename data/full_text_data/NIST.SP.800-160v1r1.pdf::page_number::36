      LOSS CONTROL
                                                                               DISCUSSION
        OBJECTIVE
     (Limit the extent of       - Limited dispersion (e.g., migration, propagation, spreading, ripple, domino, or cascading effects)
     the loss)                  - Limited duration (e.g., milliseconds, minutes, hours, days)
                                - Limited capacity (e.g., diminished utility, delivery of function, service, or capability)
                                - Limited volume (e.g., bits or bytes of data/information)
                            •   Decisions to limit the extent of loss may require prioritizing what constitutes acceptable loss across
                                a set of losses, whereby the objective to limit the loss for one asset requires accepting a loss of
                                some other asset.
                            •   The extreme case of loss limitation is to avoid destruction of the asset.
                            •   Terms such as tolerate, withstand, remove, continue, constrain, stop/halt, and restart fall into this
                                category in the case where the loss occurs and the system can, or enables the ability to, limit the
                                effect of the loss.
                            •   Loss recovery and loss delay are two means to limit loss:
                                - Loss Recovery: Action is taken by the system or enabled by the system to recover (or allow the
                                  recovery of) some or all of its ability to function (i.e., behave, interact, produce outcomes) and to
                                  recover assets used by the system (e.g., re-imaging, reloading, or recreating data and
                                  information, including software in the system). The restoration of the asset, fully or partially, can
                                  limit the dispersion, duration, capacity, or volume of the loss.
                                - Loss Delay: The loss event is avoided until the adverse effect is lessened or when a delay enables
                                  a more robust response or quicker recovery.
                            •   System and environmental conditions may be assumed to result in loss, but measures are taken to
                                limit impacts.
                            •   Terms such as contain, recover, restore, reconstitute, reconfigure, and restart are typically used to
                                characterize approaches to achieving this objective.



             Reasoning about Asset Loss
As shown in Figure 6, the elements of a structured approach to reason about asset loss include
the (1) context of loss, (2) confidence in addressing loss, (3) significance of loss, (4) addressing
loss, and (5) cause of loss. The elements provide an asset-protection basis to determine the
objectives for a secure system, optimize the system protection capability, and judge the overall
suitability and effectiveness of the implemented protections. 33 The elements are also grouped
into two objectives to facilitate reasoning about the asset of interest:
•       Objective 1: Determine asset protection needs
        -    Context of Loss: The scope and criteria that bounds reasoning about asset loss
        -    Significance of Loss: The effect of asset loss (or consequences) based on its valuation 34
        -    Confidence in Addressing Loss: The assurance to be achieved based on claims-driven and
             evidence-based arguments about the effectiveness of what is done to address potential
             and actual loss



33
   Applying the asset reasoning approach works equally to reason about assets in terms of mission (i.e., mission-driven asset reasoning),
organization (i.e., organization-driven asset reasoning), and enterprise (i.e., enterprise-driven asset reasoning).
34
   Valuation is a stakeholder determination. Factors that stakeholders may consider include the various costs associated with the asset and the
effects of loss. The effects of loss may be short-term (e.g., completing a business transaction) or long-term (e.g., extended loss of capability
awaiting replacement of asset).
