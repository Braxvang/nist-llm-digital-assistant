   l) Selecting other configuration options that are secure.

FR:8.5: The CKMS design shall specify the BIOS protection features that ensure the
proper instantiation of the operating system.

8.2.2 Individual CKMS Device Security
A CKMS may consist of a variety of devices. It is preferable that each device be designed
to protect itself from unauthorized use. Otherwise, externally applied protections are
necessary. Depending on the system design and functional requirements, a CKMS device
may provide finer-grained access control and device-specific event logging that is not
captured by the host operating system. For example, a cryptographic module could have
its own access control system. Thus, a well-designed CKMS device should have the
following security features:
    a) Self-protection from other CKMS devices (e.g., by utilizing operating system
       process isolation),
    b) Self-protection from CKMS device users,
    c) Isolation features to provide and maintain separate sessions for the users and user
       processes so that they do not interfere with each other and thus violate the security
       policy of data separation,
    d) Fine-grained access controls on CKMS device-level objects (e.g., keys and
       metadata or Data Base Management System rows and tables) to allow users to
       share data based on user, group or other metadata elements,
    e) CKMS device-level event logging in order to support personal accountability and
       to investigate anomalies, and
    f) User account management for the CKMS.

FR:8.6 The CKMS design shall specify the security controls required for each CKMS
device.

FR:8.7 The CKMS design shall specify the device/CKMS secure configuration
requirements and guidelines that the hardening is based upon.

8.2.3 Malware Protection
CKMS devices that receive communications, data, files, etc. over unprotected networks
should scan the information for malware. Malware protection may be less critical if no
information is received over unprotected networks, or if all information is strongly (e.g.,
cryptographically) authenticated. Malware protection falls into the following three
general categories:
    a) Anti-virus software that protects CKMS devices from unwittingly installing and
       executing programs that perform unintended actions and may cause a security
       compromise,
   b) Anti-spyware software that protects CKMS devices from unauthorized parties
      obtaining system administrator status or authorized user status, and prevents the
      spyware from taking on authorized device behavior, and
