CHAPTER 14                                                              Configuration Management


Identifier         Title                                            Control
     CM-3    Configuration      The organization documents and controls changes to the information
             Change Control     system. Appropriate organization officials approve information system
                                changes in accordance with organizational policies and procedures.
     CM-4    Monitoring         The organization monitors changes to the information system and conducts
             Configuration      security impact analyses to determine the effects of the changes.
             Changes
     CM-5    Access             The organization enforces access restrictions associated with changes to
             Restrictions for   the information system.
             Change
     CM-6    Configuration      The organization configures the security settings of information technology
             Settings           (IT) products to the most restrictive mode consistent with information system
                                operational requirements.
     CM-7    Least              The organization configures the information system to provide only essential
             Functionality      capabilities and specifically prohibits and/or restricts the use of the following
                                functions; ports, protocols, and/or services: [Assignment: organization-
                                defined list of prohibited and/or restricted functions, ports, protocols, and/or
                                services]. Information systems are capable of providing a wide variety of
                                functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by
                                default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations
                                (e.g., key missions, functions). The functions and services provided by
                                information systems should be carefully reviewed to determine which
                                functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., voice over
                                internet protocol, instant messaging, file transfer protocol, hyper text transfer
                                protocol, file sharing).


14.1 Configuration Management in the System Development Life Cycle
    Although CM is not traditionally regarded as a security function, it must be
addressed in the system development life cycle (SDLC) 83 because of its serious
security implications. CM is just one component of an information systemâ€™s security
posture. It falls under the operational controls of an information system and is
interrelated with numerous other security disciplines such as project management,
risk management, security certification and accreditation, 84 and security awareness
training. 85
    CM should be addressed throughout the entire life cycle of any given project or
task. As mentioned earlier, it is nearly impossible to carry out a systems
development or management project with success in the absence of a sound and
effective CM process. In the SDLC, the planning of the CM process falls in Phases 2
and 3; the primary implementation of the CM process is performed during Phase 4,
the Operations/ Maintenance phase. SDLC and its associated key tasks are depicted
in Figure 14-1.
