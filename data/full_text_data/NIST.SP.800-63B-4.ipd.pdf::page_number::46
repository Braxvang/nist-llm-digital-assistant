       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                       Authentication and Lifecycle Management


1316       • An authenticated protected channel between sensor (or an endpoint containing a
1317         sensor that resists sensor replacement) and verifier SHALL be established and the
1318         sensor or endpoint SHALL be authenticated prior to capturing the biometric sample
1319         from the claimant.
1320       • All transmission of biometrics SHALL be over an authenticated protected channel.
1321   Biometric samples collected in the authentication process MAY be used to train
1322   comparison algorithms or — with user consent — for other research purposes. Biometric
1323   samples and any biometric data derived from the biometric sample such as a probe
1324   produced through signal processing SHALL be zeroized immediately after any training or
1325   research data has been derived.
1326   Biometric authentication technologies SHALL provide similar performance for
1327   subscribers of different demographic types (racial background, gender, ethnicity, etc.).

1328   5.2.4. Attestation
1329   An attestation is information conveyed to the verifier regarding a connected authenticator
1330   or the endpoint involved in an authentication operation. Information conveyed by
1331   attestation MAY include, but is not limited to:
1332       • The provenance (e.g., manufacturer or supplier certification), health, and integrity
1333         of the authenticator and endpoint
1334       • Security features of the authenticator
1335       • Security and performance characteristics of biometric sensors
1336       • Sensor modality
1337   If this attestation is signed, it SHALL be signed using a digital signature that provides at
1338   least the minimum security strength specified in the latest revision of [SP800-131A] (112
1339   bits as of the date of this publication).
1340   Attestation information MAY be used as part of a verifier’s risk-based authentication
1341   decision.

1342   5.2.5. Phishing (Veriﬁer Impersonation) Resistance
1343   Phishing attacks, previously referred to in SP 800-63B as “verifier impersonation,” are
1344   attempts by fraudulent verifiers and RPs to fool an unwary claimant into presenting an
1345   authenticator to an impostor. In some prior versions of SP 800-63, protocols resistant to
1346   phishing attacks were also referred to as “strongly MitM resistant.”
1347   The term phishing is widely used to describe a variety of similar attacks. For the purposes
1348   of this document, phishing resistance is the ability of the authentication protocol to detect
1349   and prevent disclosure of authentication secrets and valid authenticator outputs to an
