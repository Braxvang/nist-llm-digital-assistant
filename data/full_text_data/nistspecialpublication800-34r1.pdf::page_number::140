                                               CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



During the Initiation, the mission/business processes that the new information system will support should
be evaluated to determine the users’ recovery time requirements.

Contingency Planning controls to be addressed during this phase include:
    CP 1: Contingency Planning Policy and Procedures;
    CP 6: Alternate Storage Site;
    CP 7: Alternate Processing Site;
    CP 8: Telecommunications Services; and
    CP 9: Information System Backup.

Development/Acquisition Phase. As initial concepts evolve into information system development,
specific contingency solutions may be determined. As in the Initiation phase, technical contingency
planning considerations in this phase should reflect system and operational requirements. The design
should incorporate redundancy and robustness directly into the system architecture to optimize reliability,
maintainability, and availability during the later Operation/Maintenance phase. By considering the
recovery strategy during the initial design, costs are reduced and problems associated with retrofitting or
modifying the system during the Operation/Maintenance phase are minimized. Security controls are
refined during the Development/Acquisition phase, lending an opportunity to ensure that contingency
planning controls are appropriately addressed by the recovery strategy. If multiple applications are hosted
within the new information system, recovery priority sequence for those applications should be set to
assist with selecting the appropriate recovery strategy and sequencing for the contingency plan
implementation. Examples of contingency measures that should be considered in this phase are
redundant communications paths, elimination of single points of failure, enhanced fault tolerance of
network components and interfaces, power management systems with appropriately sized backup power
sources, load balancing, and data mirroring and replication to ensure a uniformly robust system. If a
recovery site is chosen as part of the strategy, requirements for the alternate site should be addressed in
this phase.

Contingency Planning controls to be addressed during this phase include:
    CP 6: Alternate Storage Site;
    CP 7: Alternate Processing Site;
    CP 8: Telecommunications Services; and
    CP 9: Information System Backup.

Implementation/Assessment Phase. The recovery strategy selected is now documented into the formal
Information System Contingency Plan in coordination with the System Test and Evaluation (ST&E)
effort. As the system undergoes an initial testing, contingency strategies also should be exercised to
resolve any issues with the procedures. Exercise results may prompt modifications to the recovery
procedures and the contingency plan.

Contingency Planning controls to be addressed during this phase include:
    CP 2: Contingency Plan;
    CP 3: Contingency Training; and
    CP 4: Contingency Plan Testing and Exercise.

Operation/Maintenance Phase. When the information system is operational, users, administrators, and
managers should maintain a test, training, and exercise program which continually validates the
