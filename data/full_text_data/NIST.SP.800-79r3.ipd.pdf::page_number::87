NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                      Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
December 2023                                                                             and Derived PIV Credential Issuers


   Identifier                                  Issuer Control                                                  Source

                   (ii) At least one of the identity source documents used to verify the
                        claimed identity of the applicant is a valid federal or state
                        government-issued photo identification (observe).
                  (iii) Driver’s licenses and ID cards presented by applicants comply with
                        [REAL-ID] when required pursuant to DHS regulations. State-
                        issued driver’s licenses and ID cards that are not [REAL-ID]-
                        compliant can be used until the full enforcement date under [6 CFR
                        § 37.5] (review, observe).
      EI-7      The biometric data (e.g., fingerprints, facial image, and optional iris          [FIPS201], Sec. 2.8 – PIV Card
                images) used to personalize the PIV Card are captured during the identity        Issuance Requirements
                proofing and registration process.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                   (i) The requirement to capture biometric data (e.g., fingerprints, facial
                       image, and optional iris images) used to personalize the PIV Card
                       are captured during the identity proofing and registration process
                       and documented as part of standard operating procedures (review).
                  (ii) The biometric data (e.g., fingerprints, facial image, and optional iris
                       image) used to personalize the PIV Card are captured during the
                       identity proofing and registration process (observe).
      EI-9      The issuing facility captures the applicant’s fingerprints in accordance with [SP800-76], Sec. 3.2 – Fingerprint
                any of the three imaging modes: (i) plain live scan, (ii) rolled live scan, or Image Acquisition
                (iii) rolled ink card.

                Assessment
                  (i) The issuing facility captures the applicant’s fingerprints in
                      accordance with any of the three imaging modes: (i) plain live scan,
                      (ii) rolled live scan, or (iii) rolled ink card (observe).
     EI-10      The issuing facility has an in-person or remote operator present at the time [SP800-76], Sec. 3.2 – Fingerprint
                of biometric (e.g., fingerprint, facial image, and optional iris images)      Image Acquisition
                capture.
                                                                                              [SP800-76], Sec. 6.6 – Iris image
                Assessment                                                                    quality control
                Determine that:
                   (i) The requirement that the issuing facility has an attending official    [FIPS201], Sec. 2.7.1 – Supervised
                       present at the time of biometric (e.g., fingerprint, facial image, and Remote Identity Proofing
                       optional iris images) capture is documented (review).
                   (i) The issuing facility has an attending official present at the time of
                       biometric (e.g., fingerprint, facial image, and optional iris images)
                       capture (observe).
     EI-11      The issuing facility acquires fingerprint images in accordance with Table 3      [SP800-76], Sec. 3.2 – Fingerprint
                in [SP800-76].                                                                   Image Acquisition

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                   (i) Fingers are inspected to ensure the absence of dirt, coatings, gels,
                       and other of foreign materials (observe).
                  (ii) Scanner and card surfaces are clean (observe).
                 (iii) The presentation of fingers for a plain live scan, rolled live scan, or
                       rolled ink card are based on procedures in Table 2 of [SP800-76]
                       (observe).
                 (iv) Multi-finger plain impression images are properly segmented into
                       single finger images (observe).
