NIST SP 800-58                                              Voice Over IP Security
_____________________________________________________________________________

      UDP-encapsulated packet is set to zero to differentiate it from an actual IKE
      communication. This solution allows IPsec packets to traverse standard NATs in
      both directions. The adoption of this standard method should allow VOIPsec
      traffic to traverse NATs cleanly, although some extra overhead is added in the
      encapsulation/decapsulation process. IKE negotiation will also be required to
      allow for NAT traversal. The problem still remains that IP-based authentication of
      the packets cannot be assured across the NAT, (although fully qualified domain
      names could be used) but the use of a shared secret (symmetric key) negotiated
      through IKE could provide authentication. It is important to note that IP-based
      authentication is weak compared with methods using cryptographic protocols.
