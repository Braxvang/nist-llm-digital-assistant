                             Business [Section 4.1.1]
                          o As applicable, identify Management and Support Information Type categories based on
                             supporting FEA Lines of Business [Section 4.1.2]
                          o Specify applicable sub-functions for the identified Mission-based and Management and
                             Support categories [Volume II, Appendices C and D]
                          o As necessary, identify other required information types [Sections 4.1.3, 4.1.4]
                        • Document applicable information types for the identified information system along with the
                          basis for the information type selection [Section 4.5]
          Step 2        • Select the security impact levels for the identified information types                             Information
                          o from the recommended provisional impact levels for each identified information type              System

                        • Determine the security category (SC) for each information type: SC information type =
                          {(confidentiality, impact), (integrity, impact), (availability, impact)}
                        • Document the provisional impact level of confidentiality, integrity, and availability associated
                          with the system’s information type [Section 4.5]
          Step 3        • Review the appropriateness of the provisional impact levels based on the organization,             SAISO; ISSO;
                          environment, mission, use, and data sharing [Section 4.3]                                          Mission
                        • Adjust the impact levels as necessary based on the following considerations:                       Owners;
                          o Confidentiality, integrity, and availability factors [Section 4.2.2]                             Information
                          o Situational and operational drivers (timing, lifecycle, etc.) [Section 4.3]                      Owners
                          o Legal or statutory reasons
                        • Document all adjustments to the impact levels and provide the rationale or justification for
                          the adjustments [Section 4.5]
          Step 4        • Review identified security categorizations for the aggregate of information types.                 CIO, SAISO;
                        • Determine the system security categorization by identifying the security impact level high         ISSO; Mission
                          water mark for each of the security objectives (confidentiality, integrity, availability):         Owners;
                          SC System X = {(confidentiality, impact), (integrity, impact), (availability, impact)}             Information
                        • Adjust the security impact level high water mark for each system security objective, as            Owners
                          necessary, by applying the factors discussed in section 4.4.2.
                        • Assign the overall information system impact level based on the highest impact level for the
                          system security objectives (confidentiality, integrity, availability)
                        • Follow the agency’s oversight process for reviewing, approving, and documenting all
                          determinations or decisions [Section 4.5]

  Security perimeter is synonymous with the term accreditation boundary and includes all components of an
information system to be accredited by an authorizing official and excludes separately accredited systems to
which the information system is connected.
