Leadership and Participation In Developing National and
International Standards
The standards community is built upon international collaboration. NIST leverages its
foundational and applied research efforts along with its experience in leadership to
contribute to the development of national and international standards. Today, these
standards activities span cybersecurity, privacy, cryptography, and critical fields such as 5G
mobile and cellular technologies, quantum information, and the Internet of Things (IoT).
About 40 NIST staff members work with other agencies and industry to develop
cybersecurity and privacy standards through voluntary consensus Standards
Developing Organizations (SDOs). NISTâ€™s standards strategy is captured in NIST
Interagency Report (NISTIR) 8074, Cybersecurity Interagency Report on Strategic U.S.
Government Engagement in International Standardization to Achieve U.S. Objectives for
Cybersecurity.
During FY 2019, NIST staff actively contributed to and held leadership positions in
various SDOs, including the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF), and the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO). The NIST staff actively participated in standards bodies to raise awareness and
influence the development of privacy and cybersecurity standards, including efforts
within the ISO/IEC joint technical committee (JTC) 1 Subcommittee (SC) 27, that aligned                  3
with the principles of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. NIST representatives also
