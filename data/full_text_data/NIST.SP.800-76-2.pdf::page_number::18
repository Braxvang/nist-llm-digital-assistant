1.    The Capture Device ID should indicate the hardware model. The CBEFF PID [FINGSTD, 7.1.4] should indicate the
      firmware or software version.
2.    If certain fingers cannot be imaged, the value of this field shall be decremented accordingly.
3.    The left and right four-finger images and two-thumb images may also be included. The value of this field shall be
      incremented accordingly.
4.    For PIV enrollment sets, the number of images will ordinarily be thirteen (that is, the ten segmented images from
      the multi-finger plain impressions, and the three plain impressions themselves, 10+4+4+2) or fourteen (if the plain
      thumb impressions were imaged sequentially, 10+4+4+1+1).
5.    Images shall either be uncompressed or compressed using an implementation of the Wavelet Scalar Quantization
      (WSQ) algorithm that has been certified by the FBI. As of February 2011, Version 3.1 of the WSQ algorithm shall be
      used [WSQ31]. The FBI's requirement for a 15:1 nominal compression ratio shall apply.
6.    Image compression should only be applied after the record content has been prepared, and the NFIQ quality
      values have been computed.
7.    The term view refers to the number of images of that particular finger (position). This value would exceed one if
      imaging has been repeated. Inclusion of more than one image of a finger can afford some benefit in a matching
      process. This document recommends that any additionally available images (say, from a PIV Card re-issuance
      procedure) with quality value 1 to 3 should be included in the record. In all cases the images shall be stored in
      order of capture date, with newest first.
8.    Quality values shall be present. These shall be calculated from the NIST Fingerprint Image Quality (NFIQ) method
      described in [NFIQ] using the formula Q = 20*(6 - NFIQ). This scale reversal ensures that high quality values
      connote high predicted performance and consistency with the dictionary definition. The values are intended to
      be predictive of the relative accuracy of a minutia based fingerprint matching system. It is recommended that a
      user should be prompted to first attempt authentication using the finger with the highest quality, regardless of
      whether this is the primary or secondary finger.
9.    The quality value shall be set to 254 (the [FINGSTD] code for undefined) if this record is not a single finger print
      (i.e., , it is a multi-finger image, or a palm print) or if the NFIQ implementation fails.
10. There is no restriction on the image size. However non-background pixels of the target finger shall be retained
    (i.e., cropping of the image data is prohibited).
11. [FINGSTD, Table 4] refers to a single-byte field labeled "reserved", but there is no corresponding clause to
    formally define it. The M1 committee has undertaken to resolve this by inserting a new sub-clause to require
    inclusion of the "Reserved" field. This will appear in a revision of [FINGSTD]. In any case, PIV implementations
    shall include the single byte field, setting the value to 0.
12. Line 27 indicates that the "Reserved" field shall have length 2 bytes. [FINGSTD, 7.1.15] indicates a length of 4
    bytes which disagrees with the value in [FINGSTD, Table 2]. The INCITS M1 committee has indicated 2 bytes is the
    correct value. PIV implementations shall include the 2 byte field, setting the value to 0.

3.4     Fingerprint image specifications for background checks
PIV fingerprint images transmitted to the FBI as part of the background checking process shall be formatted
according to the ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2011 standard [AN2011] and the CJIS-RS-0010 [EBTS] specification. Such records shall
be prepared from, and contain, only those images collected per specifications in Section 3.2.
Table 5 enumerates the appropriate transaction formats for the three acquisition options of Section 3.2. The FBI
documentation [EBTS] should be consulted for definitive requirements.
