software, and firmware components) in a separate facility or in a fire-rated container that is not
collocated with the operational system.

(4) [Withdrawn: Incorporated into CP-9].

(5) The organization transfers information system backup information to the alternate storage site
[Assignment: organization-defined transfer rate consistent with the recovery time and recovery point
objectives].

(6) The organization accomplishes information system backup by maintaining a redundant
secondary system, not collocated, that can be activated without loss of information or disruption to
the operation.

CP-10 INFORMATION SYSTEM RECOVERY AND RECONSTITUTION

Control: The organization provides for the recovery and reconstitution of the information system to a
known state after a disruption, compromise, or failure.

Supplemental Guidance: Recovery and reconstitution to a known secure state means that all system
parameters (default or organization-established) are set to secure values, security-critical patches are
reinstalled, security-related configuration settings are reestablished, system documentation and operating
procedures are available, application and system software is reinstalled and configured with secure
settings, information from the most recent, known secure backups is loaded, and the system is fully
tested. The information system recovery and reconstitution capability employed by the organization is
based on organizational priorities, established recovery point/time and reconstitution objectives, and
appropriate metrics. The recovery and reconstitution includes the deactivation of any information systems
located at the relocation site. Deactivation is the process of finalizing the system recovery and validation
operations and includes the necessary activities to prepare the system against another outage or
disruption. The recovery and reconstitution capability employed by the organization can be a combination
of automated mechanisms and manual procedures.

Control Enhancements:

(2) The organization implements transaction recovery for information systems that are transaction-
based.

        Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Database management systems and transaction-
        processing systems are examples of information systems that are transaction-based. Transaction
        rollback and transaction journaling are examples of mechanisms supporting transaction recovery.

(3) The organization provides compensating security controls for [Assignment: organization-defined
circumstances that inhibit recovery to a known, secure state].

(4) The organization provides the capability to re-image information system components in
accordance with [Assignment: organization defined restoration time-periods] from configuration-
controlled and integrity-protected disk images representing a secure operational state for the
components.
