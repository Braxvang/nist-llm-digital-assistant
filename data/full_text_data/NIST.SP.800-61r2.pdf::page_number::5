                                               Abstract

Computer security incident response has become an important component of information technology (IT)
programs. Because performing incident response effectively is a complex undertaking, establishing a
successful incident response capability requires substantial planning and resources. This publication
assists organizations in establishing computer security incident response capabilities and handling
incidents efficiently and effectively. This publication provides guidelines for incident handling,
particularly for analyzing incident-related data and determining the appropriate response to each incident.
The guidelines can be followed independently of particular hardware platforms, operating systems,
protocols, or applications.
