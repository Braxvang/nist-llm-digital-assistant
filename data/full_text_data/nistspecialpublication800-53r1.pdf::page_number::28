Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1                Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


Compensating Security Controls
With the diverse nature of todayâ€™s information systems, organizations may find it necessary, on
occasion, to specify and employ compensating security controls. A compensating security
control is a management, operational, or technical control (i.e., safeguard or countermeasure)
employed by an organization in lieu of a recommended security control in the low, moderate, or
high baselines described in NIST Special Publication 800-53, that provides equivalent or
comparable protection for an information system. 43 A compensating control for an information
system may be employed by an organization only under the following conditions: (i) the
organization selects the compensating control from NIST Special Publication 800-53, or if an
appropriate compensating control is not available in the security control catalog, the organization
adopts a suitable compensating control; 44 (ii) the organization provides a complete and
convincing rationale 45 for how the compensating control provides an equivalent security
capability or level of protection for the information system and why the related baseline security
control could not be employed; and (iii) the organization assesses and formally accepts the risk
associated with employing the compensating control in the information system. The use of
compensating security controls should be documented in the security plan for the information
system and approved by the authorizing official.

Organization-Defined Security Control Parameters
Security controls containing organization-defined parameters (i.e., assignment and/or selection
operations) give organizations the flexibility to define selected portions of the controls to support
specific organizational requirements or objectives (see AU-2 example in Section 2.1). After the
application of the scoping guidance and the selection of compensating security controls,
organizations should review the list of security controls for assignment and selection operations
and determine appropriate organization-defined values for the identified parameters. Where
specified, minimum and maximum values for organization-defined parameters should be adhered
to unless more restrictive values are prescribed by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives,
policies, standards, or regulations or are indicated by the risk assessment in order to adequately
mitigate risk. Organization-defined security control parameters should be documented in the
security plan for the information system.

3.4 SUPPLEMENTING THE TAILORED BASELINE
The tailored security control baseline should be viewed as the foundation or starting point in the
selection of adequate security controls for an information system. The tailored baseline
represents, for a particular class of information system (derived from the FIPS 199 security
categorization and modified appropriately for local conditions), the starting point for determining
the needed level of security due diligence to be demonstrated by an organization toward the
protection of its operations and assets. As described in Section 3.1, the final determination of the
appropriate set of security controls necessary to provide adequate security for an information

43
  More than one compensating control may be required to provide the equivalent or comparable protection for a
particular security control in NIST Special Publication 800-53. For example, an organization with significant staff
limitations may have difficulty in meeting the separation of duty security control but may employ compensating
controls by strengthening the audit, accountability, and personnel security controls within the information system.
44
  Organizations should make every attempt to select compensating controls from the security control catalog in NIST
Special Publication 800-53. Organization-defined compensating controls should be used only as a last resort when the
security control catalog does not contain suitable compensating controls.
45
   The depth and rigor of the rationale provided should be scaled to the FIPS 199 impact level of the information
system, with significantly less explanation needed for a low-impact system than for a high-impact system.
