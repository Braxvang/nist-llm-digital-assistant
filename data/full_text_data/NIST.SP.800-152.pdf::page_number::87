SP 800-152                                                                  A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


The following PRs specify default (i.e., mandatory-to-implement) algorithms (including
modes of operation, key-derivation methods, etc.) that provide FCKMS interoperability.
Other approved algorithms may be used instead of the defaults during interactions, if
previously agreed upon. Communication protocols generally include their own CKMS with
selected default algorithms for interoperability; as long as the algorithms used as defaults are
approved and are suitable for the impact level or security strength of the information being
communicated, the defaults in this section are not required.

Note that the minimum security strengths to be provided by the algorithms and keys for the
Low, Moderate and High impact levels are identified in PR:2.3, PR:2.4 and PR:2.5,
respectively.
