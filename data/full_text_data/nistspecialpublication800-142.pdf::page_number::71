Combining Operators

The operators above can be combined with symbols to create arbitrarily complex
expressions. Examples include:

       .*a.*b.*c.*   “a” followed by “b” followed by “c” with zero or more
                     symbols prior to “a”, following “c”, or interspersed with the three
                     symbols
       a|b*          null or “a” or zero or more occurrences of “b”
       a+            equivalent to aa*

Many regular expression utilities such as egrep support a broader range of operators and
features. Readers should consult documentation for grep, egrep, or other regular
expression processors for detailed coverage of the options available on particular tools.
