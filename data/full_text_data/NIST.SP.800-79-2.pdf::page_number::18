                                                                         and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



       Do personnel understand the responsibilities of their roles and/or positions, and reliably
        perform all required activities as described in the issuer’s documentation?
       Are services and functions at the issuer and its facilities (e.g., identity
        proofing/registration, card/token production, activation/issuance) carried out in a
        consistent, reliable, and repeatable manner?
       Have deficiencies identified during the assessment been documented, current and
        potential impact on security and privacy been highlighted, and the recommendations and
        timelines for correction or mediation been included in the assessment report?

2.5 Authorization Boundary of the Issuer

The first step in authorizing an issuer is to identify the appropriate authorization boundary. The
authorization boundary defines the specific operations that are to be the target of the assessment
and authorization. A PCI comprises the complete set of functions required for the issuance and
maintenance of PIV Cards while a DPCI comprises of the complete set of functions required for
the issuance and maintenance of Derived PIV Credentials. In determining the authorization
boundary, the organization must consider if the functions are being performed identically in all
issuing facilities, are using identical information technology components, and are under the same
direct management control. For instance, an organization may have two sub-organizations, each
of which has distinct processes and management structures. The organization may decide to
establish two separate issuers, each with its own authorization boundary. In this example, two
separate assessments would be undertaken. Each assessment would result in an independent
authorization decision.

In drawing an authorization boundary, an organization may want to include only a subset of its
issuing facilities. For example, if a PCI has several facilities, some of which are ready for
operation and some that are still in the development stage, the organization may choose to define
the authorization boundary to include the PCI and only those facilities that are ready to be
assessed. If the authorization is successful, the PCI and a subset of its issuing facilities will be
authorized to operate and begin issuing PIV Cards. The remaining issuing facilities can continue
with implementation and be included in the authorization boundary at a later date.

In the case of outsourcing issuance services that are not under direct management control of the
organization nor physically located within its facilities, the organization must include the
functions provided by external service providers within the authorization boundary to make
certain that they are included within the scope of authorization. This assures that no matter how
and where the functions are performed, the organization maintains complete accountability for
the reliability of its PIV program. From an Issuer point of view, this translates to applying the
necessary due diligence process with respect to assessment of controls to ensure outsourced
functions are conducted in an acceptable and compliant manner.

Care should be used in defining the authorization boundary for the issuer. A boundary that is
unnecessarily expansive (i.e., including many dissimilar processes and business functions or
geographically dispersed facilities) makes the assessment and authorization process extremely
complex. Establishing a boundary and its subsequent authorization are organization-level
activities that should include participation of all key personnel. An organization should strive to
