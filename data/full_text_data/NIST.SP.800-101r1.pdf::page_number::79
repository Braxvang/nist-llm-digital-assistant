                                                        Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) – A set of standards for second
generation, cellular networks currently maintained by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project
(3GPP).

Hardware Driver – Applications responsible for establishing communication between
hardware and software programs.

Hashing – The process of using a mathematical algorithm against data to produce a numeric
value that is representative of that data.

HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) – A standard method for communication between
clients and Web servers.

Image – An exact bit-stream copy of all electronic data on a device, performed in a manner
that ensures the information is not altered.

Inculpatory Evidence – Evidence that tends to increase the likelihood of fault or guilt.

Instant Messaging (IM) – A facility for exchanging messages in real-time with other people
over the Internet and tracking the progress of a given conversation.

Integrated Circuit Card ID (ICCID) – The unique serial number assigned to, maintained
within, and usually imprinted on the (U)SIM.

Integrated Digital Enhanced Network (iDEN) – A proprietary mobile communications
technology developed by Motorola that combines the capabilities of a digital cellular telephone
with two-way radio.

International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) – A unique identification number
programmed into GSM and UMTS mobile devices.

International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) – A unique number associated with every
GSM mobile phone subscriber, which is maintained on a (U)SIM.

Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) – A method of communication used to read
electronic messages stored in a remote server.

Key Chords –Specific hardware keys pressed in a particular sequence on a mobile device.

Location Information (LOCI) – The Location Area Identifier (LAI) of the phone’s current
location, continuously maintained on the (C/U)SIM when the phone is active and saved
whenever the phone is turned off.

Mobile Devices – A mobile device is a small hand-held device that has a display screen with
touch input and/or a QWERTY keyboard and may provide users with telephony capabilities.
Mobile devices are used interchangeably (phones, tablets) throughout this document.

Mobile Subscriber Integrated Services Digital Network (MSISDN) – The international
telephone number assigned to a cellular subscriber.

Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) – An accepted standard for messaging that lets users
send and receive messages formatted with text, graphics, photographs, audio, and video clips.
