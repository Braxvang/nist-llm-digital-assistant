NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                Guidelines for Media Sanitization




Executive Summary

The modern storage environment is rapidly evolving. Data may pass through multiple
organizations, systems, and storage media in its lifetime. The pervasive nature of data
propagation is only increasing as the Internet and data storage systems move towards a
distributed cloud-based architecture. As a result, more parties than ever are responsible for
effectively sanitizing media and the potential is substantial for sensitive data to be collected and
retained on the media. This responsibility is not limited to those organizations that are the
originators or final resting places of sensitive data, but also intermediaries who transiently store
or process the information along the way. The efficient and effective management of information
from inception through disposition is the responsibility of all those who have handled the data.

The application of sophisticated access controls and encryption help reduce the likelihood that an
attacker can gain direct access to sensitive information. As a result, parties attempting to obtain
sensitive information may seek to focus their efforts on alternative access means such as
retrieving residual data on media that has left an organization without sufficient sanitization
effort having been applied. Consequently, the application of effective sanitization techniques and
tracking of storage media are critical aspects of ensuring that sensitive data is effectively
protected by an organization against unauthorized disclosure. Protection of information is
paramount. That information may be on paper, optical, electronic or magnetic media.

An organization may choose to dispose of media by charitable donation, internal or external
transfer, or by recycling it in accordance with applicable laws and regulations if the media is
obsolete or no longer usable. Even internal transfers require increased scrutiny, as legal and
ethical obligations make it more important than ever to protect data such as Personally
Identifiable Information (PII). No matter what the final intended destination of the media is, it is
important that the organization ensure that no easily re-constructible residual representation of
the data is stored on the media after it has left the control of the organization or is no longer
going to be protected at the confidentiality categorization of the data stored on the media.

Sanitization refers to a process that renders access to target data on the media infeasible for a
given level of effort. This guide will assist organizations and system owners in making practical
sanitization decisions based on the categorization of confidentiality of their information. It does
not, and cannot, specifically address all known types of media; however, the described
sanitization decision process can be applied universally.
