Table C-2 summarizes provisional impact level recommendations for administrative,
management, and service information. Provisional impact levels are recommended for each
security objective (confidentiality, integrity, availability) and for each management and support
Federal government information type. The confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact
levels define the security category of each information type.


                                        Implementation Tip
           Most government information systems access, process, and/or disseminate
           more than one class of information. Security objectives and impacts
           associated with all of the types of information and processes served by the
           information system need to be considered in determining the system’s
           information security requirements.


Each information type may include one or more elements. For example, benefits management
information includes employee identification information, benefit plan information for insurance
and other products, cost information, claims and reimbursement policy information, claims
procedures, etc.

In some cases, different impact levels are appropriate for different information elements. For
example, elements of program monitoring information relating to remediation of information
security vulnerabilities may have a different impact level than elements of program monitoring
information relating to an office furniture upgrade.

Each agency that processes an information type may process a distinct combination of elements.
The authority and responsibilities assigned to each agency that processes an information type can
affect the actual impact level associated with the information within the context of that agency’s
operations.

In Table C-2, the existence of exceptions to provisional impact assignments are identified by
displaying impact assignments in a gray font [gray font] and are described as applicable by
security objective in the information type descriptions to follow. The specific descriptions are
