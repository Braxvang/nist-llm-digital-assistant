       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines

2195       • Memorability of the memorized secret
2196            – The likelihood of recall failure increases as there are more items for users to
2197              remember. With fewer memorized secrets, users can more easily recall the
2198              specific memorized secret needed for a particular RP.
2199            – The memory burden is greater for a less frequently used password.
2200       • User experience during entry of the memorized secret
2201            – Support copy and paste functionality in fields for entering memorized secrets,
2202              including passphrases.
2203   Intermittent Events
2204   Usability considerations for intermittent events include:
2205       • When users create and change memorized secrets:
2206            – Clearly communicate information on how to create and change memorized
2207              secrets.
2208            – Clearly communicate memorized secret requirements, as specified in
2209              Sec. 5.1.1.
2210            – Allow at least 64 characters in length to support the use of passphrases.
2211              Encourage users to make memorized secrets as lengthy as they want, using
2212              any characters they like (including spaces), thus aiding memorization.
2213            – Do not impose other composition rules (e.g. mixtures of different character
2214              types) on memorized secrets.
2215            – Do not require that memorized secrets be changed arbitrarily (e.g.,
2216              periodically) unless there is a user request or evidence of authenticator
2217              compromise. (See Sec. 5.1.1 for additional information).
2218       • Provide clear, meaningful and actionable feedback when chosen passwords are
2219         rejected (e.g., when it appears on a “blocklist” of unacceptable passwords or has
2220         been used previously).

2221   10.2.2. Look-Up Secrets
2222   Typical Usage
2223   Users use the authenticator — printed or electronic — to look up the appropriate secret(s)
2224   needed to respond to a verifier’s prompt. For example, a user may be asked to provide a
2225   specific subset of the numeric or character strings printed on a card in table format.
2226   Usability considerations for typical usage include:
2227       • User experience during entry of look-up secrets.
