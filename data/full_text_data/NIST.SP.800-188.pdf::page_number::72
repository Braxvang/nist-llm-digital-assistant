                     Reading Level at Start of School Year           # of Students
                     Below grade level                                   30-39
                     At grade level                                      50-59
                     Above grade level                                   20-29

reported at the start of the school year on October 1. (See example, Sec. 4.3.8)

                     Reading Level at Start of School Year           # of Students
                     Below grade level                                   30-39
                     At grade level                                      50-59
                     Above grade level                                   30-39
Table 2. Reading levels at a hypothetical school, as measured by entrance examinations and
reported one month into the school year on November 1 after a single new student has
transferred to the school. (See example, Sec. 4.3.8)


Then consider that a single new student enrolls at the school on October 15, and the school
updates the table on its website (Table 2). Since the examination is only taken once, it is
possible to infer that the student who joined the school is likely performing above grade
level by comparing the two tables. This reveals protected information. Moreover, if a
person who views both tables knows the specifc student who enrolled in October, they
have learned a private fact about that student.
Aggregation does not inherently protect privacy, and aggregation alone is not suffcient to
provide formal privacy guarantees. Other ad hoc rules that have been proposed include
the threshold rule, the dominance rule, and the ambiguity rule. However, as has been
noted, “aggregated data provides a false sense of security” [15]. An alternative is to use
aggregation primitives based on formal privacy, which can provide aggregations that have
provable privacy guarantees while remaining highly accurate in many cases. Such methods
work through the addition of carefully calibrated noise.

4.3.9.    Challenges Posed by High-Dimensional Data
Even after removing all of the unique identifers and manipulating the quasi-identifers,
data can still be identifying if they are of suffciently high dimensionality and if there is a
way to link the supposedly non-identifying values to an identity.34



34 For example, consider a dataset of an anonymous survey that links responses from parents and their chil-

 dren. In such a dataset, a child might be able to fnd their parents’ confdential responses by searching for
 their own responses and then following the link [109].
