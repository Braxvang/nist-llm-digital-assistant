                                                              CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



      services within the community cloud, the costs appear to be similar to those for the on-site private
      cloud scenario (i.e., significant-to-high).
 Limited resources (on-site community). As with the on-site private cloud scenario, resources for an
  on-site community cloud must be provisioned or scavenged locally. Therefore the resource limitations
  appear to be similar to those of the on-site private cloud, i.e., relatively limited.
4.5     The Outsourced Community Cloud Scenario




                                    Figure 6: Outsourced Community Cloud

Figure 6 depicts an outsourced community cloud. The community depicted in the figure is made up of a
set of participant organizations that consume cloud services. This scenario is very similar to the
outsourced private cloud scenario: server-side responsibilities are managed by a cloud provider that
implements a security perimeter and that prevents mingling of community cloud resources with other
cloud resources that are outside the provider-controlled security perimeter. A significant difference is that
the cloud provider may need to enforce a sharing policy among participant organizations in the
community cloud.

Although the general statements remain true for the outsourced community cloud scenario, the outsourced
community cloud scenario also allows for a more detailed view of some of the general statements as
follows:

 Network dependency (outsourced-community). As can be seen from Figure 6, the network
  dependency of the outsourced community cloud is similar to that of the outsourced private cloud.
  The primary difference is that multiple protected communications links are likely from the
  community members to the provider's facility.
