         – Only outliers can be re-identifed.
         – Only people who are not outliers can be re-identifed.
         – There is a small percentage chance of re-identifcation that is shared by every-
           one in the dataset.
         – There is a small percentage chance of re-identifcation, but some people in the
           dataset are signifcantly more likely to be re-identifed, and the re-identifcation
           probability is somehow bounded.
    • What harm might result from re-identifcation, and what techniques will be used to
      mitigate those harms?
    • How should compliance with that level of risk be determined?
Some goals and objectives are synergistic, while others are in opposition.

4.2.   Conducting a Data Survey
Different kinds of data require different kinds of de-identifcation techniques. As a result,
an important early step in the de-identifcation of government data is to identify the data
modalities that are present in the dataset and formulate a plan for de-identifcation that takes
the goals for data release, data accuracy, privacy protection, and the best available science
into account.
For example:
    • Tabular containing numeric and categorical data is the subject of most de-identifcation
      research and practice. Such tabular data are most often de-identifed by using tech-
      niques based on the designation and removal of direct identifers and the manipula-
      tion of quasi-identifers. The chief criticism of de-identifcation based on direct and
      quasi-identifers is that administrative determinations of quasi-identifers may miss
      variables that can be uniquely identifying when combined and linked with external
      data, including data that are not available when the de-identifcation is performed but
      become available in the future.
       The k-anonymity [151] technique is commonly used for performing and evaluating
       the de-identifcation of tabular numeric and categorical data. However, risk determi-
       nations based on this kind of de-identifcation will be incorrect if direct and quasi-
       identifers are not properly classifed. For example, if there are quasi-identifers that
       are not identifed or subjected to k-anonymity, then it may be possible to re-identify
       records in the de-identifed dataset. Furthermore, because the mechanisms used to
       implement k-anonymity are data-dependent, it is possible to reverse-engineer the ap-
       plication of these mechanisms on the data and recover the data that were thought to
       be detected [32].
