Chapter 11                Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments


11.1.7 Certification Agent
    The certification agent is either an individual, a group, or an organization
responsible for conducting a security certification or a comprehensive assessment of
the effectiveness of security controls in an information system. The impartiality and
independence of the certification agent are important factors in assessing the
credibility of the security assessment results and ensuring that the authorizing
official receives the most objective information possible to make an informed, risk-
based accreditation decision. The certification agent has the following responsibilities
in relation to security certification and accreditation:
   • Assess the system security plan to ensure the plan provides applicable security
     controls prior to initializing the certification process;
   • Performs a comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and
     technical controls in the information system; and
   • Recommend corrective actions to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities in the
     information system.

11.1.8 User Representatives
    Users are responsible for identifying mission/operational requirements and for
complying with the security requirements and security controls described in the
system security plan. User representatives are individuals that represent the
operational interests of the user community and serve as liaisons for that community
throughout the SDLC of the information system. The user representatives assist in
the security certification and accreditation process, when needed, to ensure that
mission requirements are satisfied while meeting the security requirements and
using the security controls defined in the system security plan.

11.2 Delegation of Roles
    At the discretion of senior agency officials, certain security certification and
accreditation roles may be delegated and, if so, appropriately documented. Agency
officials may appoint suitably qualified individuals, including contractors, to perform
the activities associated with any security certification and accreditation role with the
exception of the CIO and authorizing official. The CIO and authorizing official have
inherent U.S. government authority, and those roles should be assigned to
government personnel only. Individuals serving in delegated roles are able to
operate with the authority of agency officials within the limits defined for the specific
security certification and accreditation activities. Agency officials retain ultimate
responsibility, however, for the results of actions performed by individuals serving in
delegated roles.

11.3 The Security Certification and Accreditation Process
   The security certification and accreditation process consists of four distinct
phases, each further divided into well-defined tasks and subtasks. The four phases
are:
   • Initiation Phase;
   • Security Certification Phase;
   • Security Accreditation Phase; and
   • Continuous Monitoring Phase.
