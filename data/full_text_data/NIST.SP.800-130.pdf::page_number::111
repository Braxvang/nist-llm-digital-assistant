Framework. Readers should also review the glossaries contained in [SP 800-57-part1].

                             The key lifecycle state in which a cryptographic key is available
Active State
                             for use for a set of applications, algorithms, and security entities.
                             The processes and procedures used to replace one cryptographic
Algorithm Transition
                             algorithm with another.
                             Assurance that public data cannot be associated with the owner in
Anonymity
                             CKMS supported communications.
                             A computer program designed and operated to achieve a set of
Application
                             goals or provide a set of services.
                             To place an electronic cryptographic key and/or metadata into a
Archive                      long-term storage medium that will be maintained even if the
(key and/or metadata)        storage technology changes. Also, the location where archived
                             keys and/or metadata are stored.
                             In the Framework, parameters used to describe properties
Associated Metadata
                             associated with a cryptographic key that are explicitly recorded,
(also Metadata)
                             managed, and protected by the CKMS.
                             In this document, a function that protects a key and metadata
Association Function         from unauthorized modification and disclosure and authenticates
                             the source of the metadata.
                             The procedures performed by an audit administrator to collect,
Audit                        analyze, and summarize the data required in a report to the
                             system administrator regarding the security of the system.
Authoritative Time Source    A network entity that is relied upon to provide accurate time.
                             To copy key and/or metadata to another facility so that the key
Backup
                             and/or metadata can be recovered if the original values are lost or
(key and/or metadata)
                             modified during operational usage.
                             Policies, procedures, devices, and components designed to
                             protect, manage, and distribute cryptographic keys and metadata.
CKMS
                             A CKMS performs cryptographic key management functions on
                             behalf of one or more entities.
CKMS Component               Any hardware, software, or firmware that is used to implement a
(Component)                  CKMS.
