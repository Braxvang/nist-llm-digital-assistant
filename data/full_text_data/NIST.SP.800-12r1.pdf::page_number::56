                                                                                              Assurance is closely linked to planning for security in the system life cycle. Systems can be

                                                                                              assurance methods tend to be qualitative rather than quantitative, they will need to be evaluated.
                                                                                              Assurance can also be quite expensive, especially if extensive testing is done. It is useful to
                                                                                              evaluate the amount of assurance received for the cost to make a best-value decision. In general,
