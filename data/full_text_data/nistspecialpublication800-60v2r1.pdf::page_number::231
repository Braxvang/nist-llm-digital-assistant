Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of general-purpose data and statistics
information may depend on whether the information is time-critical. Unauthorized modification
or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic
mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the
mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
general-purpose data and statistics information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to general-purpose data and statistics
information. Missions supported by general-purpose data and statistics information are generally
tolerant of delay.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
general-purpose data and statistics information is low.

D.20.3 Advising and Consulting Information Type

Advising and Consulting activities involve the guidance and consultative services provided by
the Federal Government to support the implementation of a specific service provided to citizens.
The recommended provisional categorization of the advising and consulting information type
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of advising and
consulting information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide guidance and
consultative services to support the implementation of a specific service to citizens. The
consequences of unauthorized disclosure of advising and consulting information depends on the
nature of the service being provided and on the sensitivity of the information with which
advisory or consulting entities are working. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of
most advising and consulting information would have a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where consulting support involves
classified or other national security information, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure
can be severe but are outside the scope of this guideline. In other cases, such as consultative
services provided to law enforcement institutions, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure
can be serious or even life threatening. This can result in assignment of a moderate or high
impact level to such information.
