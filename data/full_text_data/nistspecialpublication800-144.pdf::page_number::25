operational expenses.9 If such actions are not governed by an organization, its policies and
procedures for privacy, security, and oversight could be overlooked and the organization put at
risk. For example, vulnerable systems could be deployed, legal regulations could be ignored,
charges could amass quickly to unacceptable levels, resources could be used for unsanctioned
purposes, or other untoward effects could occur.

A study involving more than nine hundred information technology professionals in Europe and
the United States indicates a strong concern by participants that cloud computing services may
have been deployed without their knowledge in parts of their respective organizations [Pon10].
The issue is somewhat akin to the problem with individuals setting up rogue wireless access
points tied into the organizational infrastructure—without proper governance, the organizational
computing infrastructure could be transformed into a sprawling, unmanageable mix of insecure
services. Organizational practices pertaining to the policies, procedures, and standards used for
application development and service acquisition, as well as the design, implementation, testing,
use, and monitoring of deployed or engaged services, should be extended to cover cloud
computing environments.

Dealing with cloud services requires attention to the roles and responsibilities involved between
the organization and cloud provider, particularly with respect to managing risks and ensuring
organizational requirements are met. Ensuring systems are secure and risk is managed is
challenging in any environment and even more daunting with cloud computing. Audit
mechanisms and tools should be in place to determine how data is stored, protected, and used, to
validate services, and to verify policy enforcement. A risk management program should also be
in place that is flexible enough to deal with the continuously evolving and shifting risk
landscape.

4.2        Compliance
Compliance refers to an organization’s responsibility to operate in agreement with established
laws, regulations, standards, and specifications. Various types of security and privacy laws and
regulations exist within different countries at the national, state, and local levels, making
compliance a potentially complicated issue for cloud computing. For example, at the end of
2010, the National Conference of State Legislatures reported that forty-six states have enacted
legislation governing disclosure of security breaches of personal information, and that at least
twenty-nine states have enacted laws governing the disposal of personal data held by businesses
and/or government.10

           Law and Regulations. For U.S. Federal agencies, the major security and privacy
            compliance concerns include the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, the Office of Management
            and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-130, particularly Appendix III, the Privacy Act of

 Combating improper and abusive purchases in the federal government demands constant vigilance. For example, see the U.S.
