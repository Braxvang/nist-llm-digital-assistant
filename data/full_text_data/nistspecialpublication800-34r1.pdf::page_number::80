4.2     Recovery Procedures

The following procedures are provided for recovery of {system name} at the original location. Recovery
procedures are outlined per team and should be executed in the sequence presented to maintain an
efficient recovery effort.

Provide general procedures for the recovery of the system from backup media. If an alternate location is
part of the recovery strategy, include procedures for recovery to that site. Specific keystroke level
procedures may be provided in an appendix. If specific procedures are provided in an appendix, a
reference to that appendix should be included in this section. Teams or persons responsible for each
procedure should be identified.

4.3     Recovery Escalation Notices/Awareness

Provide appropriate procedures for escalation notices during recovery efforts. Notifications during
recovery include problem escalation to leadership and status awareness to system owners and users.
Teams or persons responsible for each escalation/awareness procedure should be identified.

5.      Reconstitution

Reconstitution is the process by which recovery activities are completed and normal system operations
are resumed. If the original facility is unrecoverable, the activities in this phase can also be applied to
preparing a new permanent location to support system processing requirements. A determination must be
made on whether the system has undergone significant change and will require reassessment and
reauthorization. The phase consists of two major activities: validating successful reconstitution and
deactivation of the plan.

5.1     Validation Data Testing

Validation data testing is the process of testing and validating data to ensure that data files or databases
have been recovered completely at the permanent location. The following procedures will be used to
determine that the data is complete and current to the last available backup:

Provide procedures for testing and validation of data to ensure that data is correct and up to date. This
section may be combined with the Functionality Testing section if procedures test both the functionality
and data validity. Teams or persons responsible for each procedure should be identified. An example of a
validation data test for a low-impact system would be to see if the last known complete transaction was
updated in the database. Detailed data test procedures may be provided in Appendix E, System
Validation Test Plan.

5.2     Validation Functionality Testing

Validation functionality testing is the process of verifying that {system name} functionality has been
tested, and the system is ready to return to normal operations.

Provide system functionality testing and/or validation procedures to ensure that the system is operating
correctly. This section may be combined with the Data Testing section if procedures test both the
functionality and data validity. Teams or persons responsible for each procedure should be identified. An
example of a functional test for a low-impact system may be logging into the system and running a report
or performing a transaction to see if the system is operating correctly. Detailed functionality test
procedures may be provided in Appendix E, System Validation Test Plan.
