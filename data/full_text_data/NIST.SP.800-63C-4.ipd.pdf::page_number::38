976   Pre-provisioning
977      An RP subscriber account is created by the IdP pushing the attributes to the RP or the
978      RP pulling attributes from the IdP. Pre-provisioning of accounts generally occurs in
979      bulk through a provisioning API as discussed in Sec. 5.4.3, as the provisioning occurs
980      prior to the represented subscribers authenticating through a federated transaction.
981      Pre-provisioned accounts SHALL be bound to a federated identifier at the time
982      of provisioning. Any time a particular federated identifier is seen by the RP, the
983      associated account can be logged in as a result. This form of provisioning requires
984      infrastructure and planning on the part of the IdP and RP, but these processes can
985      be facilitated by automated protocols. The RP also collects attributes about users
986      who have not interacted with the RP system yet, which can cause privacy issues.
987      Additionally, the IdP and RP must keep the set of provisioned accounts synchronized
988      over time as discussed in Sec. 5.4.2.
