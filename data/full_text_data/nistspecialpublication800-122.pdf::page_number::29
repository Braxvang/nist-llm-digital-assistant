                                   GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



usually involves the application of statistical disclosure limitation techniques59 to ensure the data cannot
be re-identified, such as: 60

 Generalizing the Data—Making information less precise, such as grouping continuous values
 Suppressing the Data—Deleting an entire record or certain parts of records
 Introducing Noise into the Data—Adding small amounts of variation into selected data
 Swapping the Data—Exchanging certain data fields of one record with the same data fields of
  another similar record (e.g., swapping the ZIP codes of two records)
 Replacing Data with the Average Value—Replacing a selected value of data with the average value
  for the entire group of data.
Using these techniques, the information is no longer PII, but it can retain its useful and realistic
properties. 61

Anonymized information is useful for system testing. 62 Systems that are newly developed, newly
purchased, or upgraded require testing before being introduced to their intended production (or live)
environment. Testing generally should simulate real conditions as closely as possible to ensure the new
or upgraded system runs correctly and handles the projected system capacity effectively. If PII is used in
the test environment, it is required to be protected at the same level that it is protected in the production
environment, which can add significantly to the time and expense of testing the system.

Randomly generating fake data in place of PII to test systems is often ineffective because certain
properties and statistical distributions of PII may need to be retained to effectively test the system. There
are tools available that substitute PII with synthetic data generated by anonymizing PII. The anonymized
information retains the useful properties of the original PII, but the anonymized information is not
considered to be PII. Anonymized data substitution is a privacy-specific protection measure that enables
system testing while reducing the expense and added time of protecting PII. However, not all data can be
readily anonymized (e.g., biometric data).

4.3      Security Controls

In addition to the PII-specific safeguards described earlier in this section, many types of security controls
are available to safeguard the confidentiality of PII. Providing reasonable security safeguards is also a
Fair Information Practice. Security controls are often already implemented on a system to protect other
types of data processed, stored, or transmitted by the system. The security controls listed in NIST SP
800-53 address general protections of data and systems. The items listed below are some of the NIST SP
800-53 controls that can be used to help safeguard the confidentiality of PII. Note that some of these
59
      Both anonymizing and de-identifying should be conducted by someone with appropriate training. It may be helpful, as
      appropriate, to consult with a statistician to assess the level of risk with respect to possible unintended re-identification and
      improper disclosure. For additional information on statistical disclosure limitation techniques, see OMB‘s Statistical Policy
      Working Paper #22, http://www.fcsm.gov/working-papers/spwp22.html. See also Census Bureau, Report on Confidentiality
      and Privacy 1790-2002, http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/conmono2.pdf.

      The Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology provides a checklist to assist in the assessment of risk for re-
      identification and improper disclosure. For additional information, see the Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology:

      The retention of useful properties in anonymized data is dependent upon the statistical disclosure limitation technique
      applied.

      Anonymization is also commonly used by agencies to release datasets to the public for research purposes.
