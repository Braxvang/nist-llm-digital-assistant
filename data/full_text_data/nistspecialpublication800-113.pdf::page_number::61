 Access control policy
 Routing and firewall configuration policies
 Standard operating procedures for the SSL VPN implementation
 Endpoint security requirements.
Typical issues that could arise at various stages of the deployment process are as follows:

 Encrypted traffic can negatively affect services such as firewalls, intrusion detection, Quality of
  Service (QoS), remote monitoring (RMON) probes, and congestion control protocols.
 Unexpected performance issues may arise, either with the SSL VPN components themselves or with
  intermediate devices such as routers.
 SSL VPN traffic may not flow properly on some production networks because of firewalls, routers, or
  other intermediate packet filtering devices that block SSL VPN traffic.
 The environment may change during the deployment. For example, active content controls used for
  network extensions may be broken by a client operating system update or new application
  installation. This issue can be handled rather easily in a managed environment, but it can pose a
  major problem if users have full control over their systems and can select their own client software.
4.6   Manage the Solution

The last phase of the SSL VPN planning and implementation model lasts the longest. Managing the
solution involves maintaining the SSL VPN architecture, policies, software, and other components of the
deployed solution. Examples of typical maintenance actions are testing and applying patches or software
updates to the SSL VPN devices, deploying SSL VPN connectivity to additional remote sites, renewing
SSL server certificates that are going to expire, and adapting the policies as requirements change. It is
also important to monitor the performance of SSL VPN components so that potential resource issues can
be identified and addressed before performance becomes seriously degraded. Another important task is to
perform testing periodically to verify that the access controls are functioning as expected. Any new
hardware, software, or significant configuration changes start the process again at the Identify
Requirements phase. This ensures that the SSL VPN solution lifecycle operates effectively and
efficiently.

Another aspect of managing the SSL VPN solution is handling operational issues. For example, poor
performance may be caused by connection problems such as fragmentation. Fragmentation occurs when
network packets are broken down into smaller fragments, which then need to be reassembled at the
receiving host. A network sniffer such as tcpdump or Wireshark is typically very helpful in
troubleshooting SSL VPN connections. A sniffer allows the administrator to analyze the communications
as they take place and correct problems. Because SSL traffic is encrypted and may not be decipherable
from a standard packet capture, some SSL VPN devices provide decrypted network sniffing capability so
that connectivity from one of the VPN endpoints may be analyzed. SSL VPN device logs and client logs
may also be valuable resources during troubleshooting. Additionally, firewall and router logs may
validate whether the SSL VPN traffic is reaching them, passing through them, or being blocked.
