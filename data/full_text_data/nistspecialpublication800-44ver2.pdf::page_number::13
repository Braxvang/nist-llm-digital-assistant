                                                                   GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



supports encryption. Web servers may be configured to use different cryptographic algorithms, providing
varying levels of security and performance.

Without proper user authentication in place, organizations cannot selectively restrict access to specific
information. All information that resides on a public Web server is then accessible by anyone with access
to the server. In addition, without some process to authenticate the server, users of the public Web server
will not be able to determine whether the server is the “authentic” Web server or a counterfeit version
operated by a malicious entity.

Even with an encrypted channel and an authentication mechanism, it is possible that attackers may
attempt to access the site via a brute force attack. Improper authentication techniques can allow attackers
to gather valid usernames or potentially gain access to the Web site. Strong authentication mechanisms
can also protect against phishing and pharming attacks. Therefore, an appropriate level of authentication
should be implemented based on the sensitivity of the Web server’s users and content.

Organizations should employ their network infrastructure to help protect their public Web servers.

The network infrastructure (e.g., firewalls, routers, IDSs) that supports the Web server plays a critical role
in the security of the Web server. In most configurations, the network infrastructure will be the first line
of defense between a public Web server and the Internet. Network design alone, however, cannot protect
a Web server. The frequency, sophistication, and variety of Web server attacks perpetrated today support
the idea that Web server security must be implemented through layered and diverse protection
mechanisms (i.e., defense-in-depth).

Organizations should commit to the ongoing process of maintaining the security of public Web
servers to ensure continued security.

Maintaining a secure Web server requires constant effort, resources, and vigilance from an organization.
Securely administering a Web server on a daily basis is an essential aspect of Web server security.
Maintaining the security of a Web server will usually involve the following steps:

 Configuring, protecting, and analyzing log files

 Backing up critical information frequently

 Maintaining a protected authoritative copy of the organization’s Web content

 Establishing and following procedures for recovering from compromise

 Testing and applying patches in a timely manner

 Testing security periodically.
