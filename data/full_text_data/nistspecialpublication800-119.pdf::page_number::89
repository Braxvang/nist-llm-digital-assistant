                                                                   GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


     sophisticated firewall policies (AND/OR/NOT logic rules in place of the current first-match
     approach) are needed to accomplish these goals.
     RFC 4487, Mobile IPv6 and Firewalls: Problem Statement, considers four cases:

     – The MN is in a network protected by firewalls: The MN needs to be able to get IPsec ESP
            packets through the firewall for BUs and Home Test Init messages. The firewall also has to
            understand these protocols and allow appropriate responses (BUA and Home Test). The Care-of
            Test Init and reply also must be allowed through. If the MN moves from a network protected by
            one firewall to a network protected by another, the firewalls need to retain state jointly.

     – The CN is in a network protected by firewalls: The firewall needs to understand inbound Home
            Test Init and Care-of Test Init messages, so that these are not dropped. The firewall has no way
            to examine a BU, distinguish legitimate instances from an attack, and update its state accordingly.

     – The HA is in a network protected by firewalls: The firewalls need to handle ESP and unsolicited
            incoming connections. Movement by the MN may result in traffic arriving at the HA through a
            different firewall from before, so stateful firewalls need to maintain this state jointly.

     – The MN moves into a network protected by firewalls: First, the BU with the HA has to get
            through. Then, existing connections, which have no prior state, need to continue. Finally, return
            routability with CNs needs to work.
      It is unclear how the combined goals of accommodating these cases and still repelling attacks will be
      satisfied, so more work on this topic is needed.

    The HA is likely to reside on a DMZ or a perimeter network, where it is exposed to the Internet. If
     this is the case, the HA itself needs the appropriate level of security controls.

    Many privacy issues exist at all protocol layers, from MAC addresses to application-layers. RFC
     4882, IP Address Location Privacy and Mobile IPv6: Problem Statement, considers only location
     privacy with MIPv6, and only the IP layer. Two issues are identified: disclosure of a MN’s HoA to
     eavesdroppers and disclosure of its CoA to CNs. A solution to the former is to use confidentiality
     with ESP and not to use route optimization. A solution to the latter is not to use route optimization.
The major threat to mobile communications is the ability of a nearby attacker to eavesdrop on these
messages. Since mobility implies wireless communications, it is likely that the MN will be on an insecure
wireless access medium and, thus, subject to eavesdropping by an attacker. This is what makes the use of
IPsec, or an equally secure alternative (e.g. encryption at the application layer such as SSL/TLS [Secure
Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security], SSH [Secure Shell], etc.), such a critical requirement.
    4.4.4     Unknown Aspects

MIPv6 is a flexible yet complex capability. Some aspects of the specification are not yet complete and
not all implementations support mobility yet. This section highlights some considerations for minimizing
unknown or unforeseen behaviors on networks using MIPv6. Emerging topics such as bootstrapping,
dual stack operation, and reliability are covered.

A mobile node needs a HoA, a HA address, and a security association with its HA. Statically
provisioning this information can be administratively expensive, so work has started on obtaining it
automatically through a process called bootstrapping. Variations exist in types of service providers and
