1205   3.6.4. Incident Response Training
1206           REQUIREMENT: 03.06.04
1207           a. Provide incident response training to system users consistent with assigned roles and
1208              responsibilities:
1209               1. Within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of assuming an incident response
1210                  role or responsibility or acquiring system access;
1211               2. When required by system changes; and
1212               3. Periodically thereafter.
1213           b. Review and update incident response training content periodically and following [Assignment:
1214              organization-defined events].

1215           DISCUSSION
1216           Incident response training is associated with the assigned roles and responsibilities of
1217           organizational personnel to ensure that the appropriate content and level of detail are included in
1218           such training. For example, users may only need to know whom to call or how to recognize an
1219           incident; system administrators may require additional training on how to handle incidents; and
1220           incident responders may receive specific training on forensics, data collection techniques,
1221           reporting, system recovery, and system restoration. Incident response training includes user
1222           training in identifying and reporting suspicious activities from external and internal sources.
1223           Incident response training for users may be provided as part of 03.02.02. Events that may
1224           precipitate an update to incident response training content include incident response plan testing,
1225           response to an actual incident, audit or assessment findings, or changes in applicable laws,
1226           Executive Orders, policies, directives, regulations, standards, and guidelines.
