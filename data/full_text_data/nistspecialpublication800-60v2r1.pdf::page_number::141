Compromise of much information associated with any of the missions within the disaster
management mission area may seriously impact the security of a broad range of critical
infrastructures and key national assets.

D.4.1 Disaster Monitoring and Prediction Information Type

Disaster monitoring and prediction involves the actions taken to predict when and where a
disaster may take place and communicate that information to affected parties. [Some disaster
management information occurs in humanitarian aid systems under the International Affairs and
Commerce line of business (e.g., State Department disaster preparedness and planning).] The
recommended provisional categorization of the disaster monitoring and protection information
type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, High), (availability, High)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of disaster monitoring
and prediction information on the ability of responsible agencies to predict when and where a
disaster may take place and communicate that information to affected parties. The purpose of
disaster monitoring and prediction activities is generally to disseminate information. Sharing of
raw information by a diverse group of analysts often improves the quality of predictive analysis.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The consequences of unauthorized
disclosure of some disaster monitoring and prediction information may include public panic or
other responses that jeopardize public safety, disaster prevention, emergency response, disaster
repair, or restoration missions. For example, attempts of large populations to evacuate in an
endangered area before necessary preparations are made for evacuation routes can result in a
clogging of the routes and failure to evacuate large parts of the population in time to save them
from a life-threatening event. Most of the disaster monitoring and prediction information is
critical in terms of potential loss of human life and major property damage. The unauthorized
release of this information may interfere with disaster prevention or emergency response
missions. The confidentiality impact level recommended for the information cited in the
example can be moderate or high.

The unauthorized disclosure of disaster monitoring and prediction information to terrorists may
reveal weak or sensitive points to target, the most effective technique(s use in attacking a target,
and information regarding the status, intent, and plans of our adversaries. Where unauthorized
disclosure of disaster monitoring and prediction information is expected to be of direct use to
terrorists, the confidentiality impact level is recommended to be high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact recommended
for most disaster monitoring and prediction information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
