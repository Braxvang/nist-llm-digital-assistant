4.4                      Minutia record for off-card authentication
4.4.1                              Use of a standard
PIV Card templates shall be a conformant instance of the INCITS 378-2004 [MINUSTD] minutiae template standard. A
standard record is used to satisfy global interoperability objectives. Second generation standards have been
published since the first PIV specification appeared in 2005; these standards are not cited in SP 800-76-2 for the
reasons given in Section 1.6. Implementations shall therefore respect the version number on Line 14 of Table 6.

4.4.2                              General case
The minutiae from both the primary and secondary fingers shall reside within a single INCITS 378 record. This means
that there will be one instance of the "General Record Header" [MINUSTD, 6.2-6.4], and two instances of the "Finger
View Record" [MINUSTD, 6.5]. The entire Table 6 record shall be wrapped in a single instance of the CBEFF structure
specified in Section 8 prior to storage on the PIV Card. The PIV Card templates shall not be encrypted.
Table 6 is a profile of the generic [MINUSTD] standard. Its specifications shall apply to all minutiae templates placed
on PIV Cards. These constraints are included to promote highly accurate and interoperable personal identity
verification. This document recommends that the minutiae records should be prepared soon after the images are
captured and before they are compressed for storage.
                                                                                                            7
To assist implementers, NIST has made [MINUSTD] sample data available . Implementers should buy [MINUSTD] for
information such as the number of bits used in each field.
