SIEM products usually include support for many types of audit record sources, such as operating
systems, application servers (e.g., Web servers, email servers), and security software, and may
even include support for physical security control devices such as badge readers. An SIEM server
analyzes the data from all the different audit record sources, correlates events among the audit
record entries, identifies and prioritizes significant events, and can be configured to initiate
responses to events.

For each supported audit record source type, SIEM products typically can be configured to
provide functionality for categorization of the most important audit record fields (e.g., the value
in field 12 of application XYZ’s logs signifies the source IP address) which can significantly
improve the normalization, analysis, and correlation of audit record data. The SIEM software can
also perform event reduction by disregarding those data fields that are not significant to
information system security, potentially reducing the SIEM software’s network bandwidth and
data storage usage.

The implementation and effective use of SIEM technologies can assist organizations in
automating the implementation, assessment, and continuous monitoring of several NIST SP 800-
53 security controls including AC-5, Separation of Duties; AU-2, Auditable Events; AU-6, Audit
Review, Analysis, and Reporting; AU-7, Audit Reduction and Report Generation; CA-2, Security
Assessments; CA-7, Continuous Monitoring; IR-5, Incident Monitoring; PE-6, Monitoring
Physical Access; RA-3, Risk Assessment; RA-5, Vulnerability Scanning; and SI-4, Information
System Monitoring.

D.2.2 MANAGEMENT DASHBOARDS
A security management dashboard (or security information management console) consolidates
and communicates information relevant to the organizational security status in near real-time to
security management stakeholders. Personnel with responsibility for information security range
from a technical system administrator, to the SISO, to the risk executive (function). The security
management dashboard presents information in a meaningful and easily understandable format
that can be customized to provide information appropriate to those with specific roles and
responsibilities within the organization.

To maximize the benefits of management dashboards, it is important to obtain acceptance and
support from upper-level management, define useful and quantifiable organization-specific
performance metrics that are based on information security policies and procedures, and ensure
the availability of meaningful performance data.

The implementation and effective use of management dashboards can assist organizations in
automating the implementation, assessment, and continuous monitoring of several NIST SP 800-
53 security controls including AC-5, Separation of Duties; CA-6, Security Authorization, CA-7,
Continuous Monitoring; PM-6, Information Security Measures of Performance; PM-9, Risk
Management Strategy; RA-3, Risk Assessment; and SI-4, Information System Monitoring.

D.3 AUTOMATION AND REFERENCE DATA S OURCES
Managing the security of systems throughout an organization is challenging for several reasons.
Most organizations have many systems to patch and configure securely, with numerous pieces of
software (operating systems and applications) to be secured on each system. Organizations need
to conduct continuous monitoring of the security configuration of each system and be able to
determine the security posture of systems and the organization at any given time. Organizations
