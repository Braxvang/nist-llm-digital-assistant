Special Publication 800-78-4                               Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for PIV



1         Introduction

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) mandated the creation of new standards
for interoperable identity credentials for physical and logical access to federal government
locations and systems. Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201), Personal
Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors, was developed to establish
standards for identity credentials [FIPS201]. This document, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-
78-4, specifies the cryptographic algorithms and key sizes for PIV systems and is a companion
document to FIPS 201-2.

1.1       Purpose

FIPS 201-2 defines requirements for the PIV lifecycle activities including identity proofing,
registration, PIV Card issuance, and PIV Card usage. FIPS 201-2 also defines the structure of an
identity credential that includes cryptographic keys. This document contains the technical
specifications needed for the mandatory and optional cryptographic keys specified in FIPS 201-2
as well as the supporting infrastructure specified in FIPS 201-2 and the related NIST Special
Publication 800-73-4, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification [SP800-73], and SP 800-76-2,
Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity Verification [SP800-76], that rely on
cryptographic functions.

1.2       Scope

The scope of this Recommendation encompasses the PIV Card, infrastructure components that
support issuance and management of the PIV Card, and applications that rely on the credentials
supported by the PIV Card to provide security services. The Recommendation identifies
acceptable symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms, digital signature algorithms, key
establishment schemes, and message digest algorithms, and specifies mechanisms to identify the
algorithms associated with PIV keys or digital signatures.

Algorithms and key sizes have been selected for consistency with applicable federal standards
and to ensure adequate cryptographic strength for PIV applications. All cryptographic algorithms
employed in this specification provide at least 112 bits of security strength. For detailed guidance
on the strength of cryptographic algorithms, see [SP800-57(1)], Recommendation on Key
Management â€“ Part 1: General.

1.3       Audience and Assumptions

This document is targeted at federal agencies and implementers of PIV systems. Readers are
assumed to have a working knowledge of cryptography and public key infrastructure (PKI)
technology.

1.4       Document Overview

The document is organized as follows:

      +    Section 1, Introduction, provides the purpose, scope, audience, and assumptions of the
           document and outlines its structure.
