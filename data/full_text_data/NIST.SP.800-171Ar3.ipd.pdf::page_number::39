1091   3.3.7. Time Stamps
1092           REQUIREMENT: 03.03.07

1093           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
1094           Determine if:
1095           A.03.03.07.ODP[01]: the granularity of time measurement for audit record time stamps is
1096           defined.
1097           A.03.03.07.a: internal system clocks are used to generate time stamps for audit records.
1098           A.03.03.07.b[01]: time stamps for audit records meet <A.03.03.07.ODP[01] granularity of time
1099           measurement>.
1100           A.03.03.07.b[02]: time stamps for audit records use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), have a
1101           fixed local time offset from UTC, or include the local time offset as part of the time stamp are
1102           recorded.

1103           ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
1104           Examine

1106           generation; system design documentation; system configuration settings; system audit records;
1107           system security plan; other relevant documents or records]
1108           Interview

1115   3.3.8. Protection of Audit Information
1116           REQUIREMENT: 03.03.08

1117           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
1118           Determine if:
1119           A.03.03.08.a: audit information and audit logging tools are protected from unauthorized access,
1120           modification, and deletion.
1121           A.03.03.08.b: access to the management of audit logging functionality is authorized to only a
1122           subset of privileged users or roles.
