                                Reports on Computer Systems Technology

The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical leadership for the Nation’s
measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test methods, reference data, proof of
concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the development and productive use of
information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the development of management, administrative,
technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of other than
national security-related information in Federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series
reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its
collaborative activities with industry, government, and academic organizations.

FIPS 201 defines the requirements and characteristics of a government-wide interoperable identity
credential. FIPS 201 also specifies that this identity credential must be stored on a smart card. This
document, SP 800-73, contains the technical specifications to interface with the smart card to retrieve and
use the PIV identity credentials. The specifications reflect the design goals of interoperability and PIV
Card functions. The goals are addressed by specifying a PIV data model, card edge interface, and
application programming interface. Moreover, this document enumerates requirements where the
international integrated circuit card standards [ISO7816] include options and branches. The specifications
go further by constraining implementers’ interpretations of the normative standards. Such restrictions are
designed to ease implementation, facilitate interoperability, and ensure performance, in a manner tailored
for PIV applications.
