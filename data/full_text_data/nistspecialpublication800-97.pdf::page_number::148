ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



     Enhanced User and Message Authentication Mechanisms. The Extensible Authentication
      Protocol (EAP) provides the authentication framework for IEEE 802.11 RSNs that use IEEE
      802.1X port-based access control. To accomplish mutual authentication between an AP and a
      STA, the IEEE 802.1X standard defines an additional entity, an authentication server (AS). IEEE
      802.1X allows the client to authenticate to the network through the use of the AS. If the
      authentication succeeds, the AP receives the resulting Pairwise Master Key (PMK).
        EAP defines the stages of an EAP conversation that includes one or more EAP methods. The
        EAP methods perform the authentication transaction and generate cryptographic keying material.
        While the basic rules of the EAP conversation are common to all EAP implementations, the EAP
        methods can vary from one implementation to another, and EAP can be adapted to new
        authentication methods as they become available. This flexibility has benefits, but it may also
        introduce risk. Therefore, organizations should select EAP methods based on a risk assessment
        of the target environment. Only some EAP methods, such as certain Transport Layer Security-
        based methods (e.g., EAP-TLS, EAP-Tunneled TLS [EAP-TTLS], Protected EAP [PEAP], can
        satisfy the security requirements for WLANs.

        Before organizations select WLAN equipment, they should review their existing identity
        management infrastructure, authentication requirements, and security policy to determine the
        EAP method or methods that are most appropriate in their environment, then purchase systems
        that support the chosen EAP methods. Many EAP methods are currently defined only in IETF
        Internet-drafts and thus are not yet official standards. Organizations are encouraged to obtain the
        latest available information before making final determinations on their IEEE 802.11 RSN
        authentication architecture and product procurement.

     Cryptographic Key Management. RSNAs use several cryptographic keys to support key
      generation, encryption, authentication, and integrity functions. The IEEE 802.11i specification
      defines two key hierarchies for RSNAs: the Pairwise Key Hierarchy, which is designed for
      unicast data traffic protection, and the Group Key Hierarchy, which is intended for
      multicast/broadcast traffic protection. In the Pairwise Key Hierarchy, keys may be installed in
      RSNA devices (ASs and STAs) through two methods:

        –   Delivering a pre-shared key (PSK) through an out-of-band mechanism. The IEEE 802.11
            standard does not specify how PSKs are to be generated or distributed, so these decisions are
            left to organizations implementing IEEE 802.11 networks. As a result, organizations should
            review any PSK approach carefully for possible vulnerabilities and evaluate its performance
            implications. Distributing PSKs in a large network might be infeasible. The lack of
            individual user/client authentication in most PSK APs is another reason to avoid the use of
            pre-shared keys.

        –   Delivering an authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) key through EAP during
            authentication. Decisions on the appropriate EAP authentication methods are left to
            organizations implementing STAs and ASs. As a result, organizations should carefully
            review any EAP authentication methods for possible vulnerabilities.
        Most organizations choose to implement EAP for authentication instead of using PSKs because
        of the resources needed for proper PSK administration. EAP authentication requires an
        organization to use an AS, which may necessitate the use of a public key infrastructure (PKI).
        Organizations that already have ASs for Web, e-mail, file and print services, and other
        authentication needs, should consider integrating this technology into their RSN solutions. Most
        leading network operating systems and directory solutions offer the support needed for RSN
        integration.
