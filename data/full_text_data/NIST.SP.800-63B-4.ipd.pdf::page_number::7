      NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                             Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                      Authentication and Lifecycle Management


169      • Are emerging authentication models and techniques – such as FIDO passkey,
170        verifiable credentials, and mobile driver’s licenses – sufficiently addressed and
171        accommodated, as appropriate, by the guidelines? What are the potential associated
172        security, privacy, and usability benefits and risks?
173      • Are the controls for phishing resistance as defined in the guidelines for AAL2 and
174        AAL3 authentication clear and sufficient?
175      • How are session management thresholds and reauthentication requirements
176        implemented by agencies and organizations? Should NIST provide thresholds or
177        leave session lengths to agencies based on applications, users, and mission needs?
178      • What impacts would the proposed biometric performance requirements for this
179        volume have on real-world implementations of biometric technologies?
180   General
181      • Is there an element of this guidance that you think is missing or could be expanded?
182      • Is any language in the guidance confusing or hard to understand? Should we add
183        definitions or additional context to any language?
184      • Does the guidance sufficiently address privacy?
185      • Does the guidance sufficiently address equity?
186             – What equity assessment methods, impact evaluation models, or metrics
187               could we reference to better support organizations in preventing or detecting
188               disparate impacts that could arise as a result of identity verification
189               technologies or processes?
190      • What specific implementation guidance, reference architectures, metrics, or other
191        supporting resources may enable more rapid adoption and implementation of this
192        and future iterations of the Digital Identity Guidelines?
193      • What applied research and measurement efforts would provide the greatest impact
194        on the identity market and advancement of these guidelines?
