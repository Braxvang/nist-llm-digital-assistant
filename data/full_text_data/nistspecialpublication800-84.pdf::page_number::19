                                       GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



3.     Training Sessions

Training is a continuum of learning activities that enables staff to maintain and enhance their skills and
technical proficiencies and to remain current with technological advances. For the purpose of this
publication, training refers only to informing participants of their roles and responsibilities within a
particular IT plan and teaching them skills related to those roles and responsibilities, thereby preparing
them for participation in exercises, tests, and actual emergency situations related to that plan. 10 Training
events can be instructor-led (e.g., classroom setting, interactive online) or self-study (e.g., paper, online).
The scheduling of training events that support IT plans should be coordinated closely with the schedules
of other events in a TT&E program. For example, training sessions typically precede exercises and tests.
This ensures that personnel are familiar with their roles and responsibilities within a given IT plan before
exercising the plan itself. Another outcome of performing training is identifying areas where additional
training might be necessary.

Other NIST publications have already described training programs and events in detail. Refer to NIST SP
800-50, Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program, and NIST SP
800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements: A Role- and Performance-Based
Model, for more information on training. 11
