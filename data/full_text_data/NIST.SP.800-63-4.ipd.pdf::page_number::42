1167   The output of this step is a defined impact level for failures of identity proofing,
1168   authentication, and federation which serve as the primary input to the initial assurance
1169   level selection.

1170   5.2. Select Initial Assurance Levels
1171   The impact analysis serves as a primary input to the process of selecting initial assurance
1172   levels for identity proofing, authentication and federation. The assurance levels may differ
1173   across these areas based on the analysis of the potential impact of failures in each area.
1174   The purpose of these initial assurance levels is to identify baseline digital identity controls
1175   and processes, reflected in the requirements and guidelines in the companion volumes of
1176   [SP800-63A], [SP800-63B], and [SP800-63C], which will be assessed and tailored based
1177   on mission need, cybersecurity risk, and other potential impacts to the organization and
1178   users of the digital identity systems.
