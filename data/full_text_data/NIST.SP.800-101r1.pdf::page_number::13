                                                               Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics


2. Background

       This chapter gives an overview of the hardware and software capabilities of mobile devices
       and their associated cellular networks. The overview provides a summary of general
       characteristics and, where useful, focuses on key features relevant to forensics. Developing an
       understanding of the components and organization of mobile devices (e.g., memory
       organization and its use) is a prerequisite to understanding the intricacies involved when
       dealing with them forensically. For example, mobile device memory that contains user data
       may be volatile (i.e., DRAM/SRAM) and require continuous power to maintain content
       similar to RAM in a personal computer. Similarly, features of cellular networks are an
       important aspect of mobile device forensics, since logs of usage, geographic location, and
       other data are maintained. Mobile device technologies and cellular networks are rapidly
       changing, with new technologies, products, and features being introduced regularly. Because
       of the fast pace with which mobile device technologies are evolving, this discussion captures a
       snapshot of the mobile device discipline at the present time.

 2.1   Mobile Device Characteristics

       Mobile devices perform an array of functions ranging from a simple telephony device to those
       of a personal computer. Designed for mobility, they are compact in size, battery-powered, and
       lightweight. Most mobile devices have a basic set of comparable features and capabilities.
       They house a microprocessor, read only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), a
       radio module, a digital signal processor, a microphone and speaker, a variety of hardware keys
       and interfaces and a liquid crystal display (LCD). The operating system (OS) of a mobile
       device may be stored in either NAND or NOR memory while code execution typically occurs
       in RAM.

       Currently, mobile devices are equipped with system-level microprocessors that reduce the
       number of supporting chips required and include considerable internal memory capacity
       currently up to 64GB (e.g., Stacked NAND). Built-in Secure Digital (SD) memory card slots,
       such as one for the micro Secure Digital eXtended Capacity (microSDXC), may support
       removable memory with capacities ranging from 64GB to 2TB of storage. Non-cellular
       wireless communications such as infrared (i.e., IrDA), Bluetooth, Near Field Communication
       (NFC), and WiFi may also be built into the device and support synchronization protocols to
       exchange other data (e.g., graphics, audio, and video file formats).

       Different mobile devices have different technical and physical characteristics (e.g., size,
       weight, processor speed, memory capacity). Mobile devices may also use different types of
       expansion capabilities to provide additional functionality. Furthermore, mobile device
       capabilities sometimes include those of other devices such as handheld Global Positioning
       Systems (GPS), cameras (still and video) or personal computers. Overall, mobile devices can
       be classified as feature phones that are primarily simple voice and messaging communication
       devices or smartphones that offer more advanced capabilities and services for multimedia,
       similar to those of a personal computer. Table 1 highlights the general hardware characteristics
       of feature and smartphone models, which underscore this diversity.

       The classification scheme is illustrative and intended to give a sense of the range of hardware
       characteristics currently in the marketplace. Over time, characteristics found in smartphones
       tend to appear in feature phones as new technology is introduced to smartphones. Though the
