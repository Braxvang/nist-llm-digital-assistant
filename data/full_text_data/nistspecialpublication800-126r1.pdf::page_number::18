                  The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



3.2.3    The <xccdf:Benchmark> Element

The following requirements and recommendations apply to the <xccdf:Benchmark> element:

     1. The REQUIRED @id attribute SHALL be used to uniquely identify all revisions of a benchmark.
        Multiple revisions of a single benchmark SHOULD have identical identifiers, so that someone
        who reviews the revisions can readily identify them as multiple versions of a single benchmark.

     2. The @style attribute SHALL have the value ―SCAP_1.1‖.

     3. The <xccdf:status> element SHALL indicate the current status of the benchmark
        document. The associated text value SHALL be ―draft‖ for documents released in public draft
        state and ―accepted‖ for documents that have been officially released by an organization. The
        @date attribute SHALL be populated with the date of the status change. Additional
        <xccdf:status> elements MAY be included to indicate historic status transitions.

     4. The <xccdf:version> element SHALL uniquely identify the particular revision of the
        benchmark. Also, these revisions SHOULD have version values that indicate the revision
        sequence, so that the history of changes from the original benchmark can be determined. The
        @time attribute of the <xccdf:version> element SHOULD be used for a timestamp of
        when the benchmark was defined. The @update attribute of the <xccdf:version> element
        SHOULD be used for a URI that specifies where updates to the benchmark can be obtained.

     5. One or more instances of the <xccdf:notice> element MAY be provided indicating
        clarifications, suggestions, or warnings regarding the use of the benchmark, including but not
        limited to terms of use, legal notices, or copyright statements.

     6. The <xccdf:metadata> element SHALL be provided and SHALL, at minimum, contain the
        Dublin Core15 terms from Table 3. Additional Dublin Core terms SHALL follow the required
        terms within the element sequence.

                                Table 3. Use of Dublin Core Terms in XCCDF Metadata

Dublin Core Term             Description of Use
<dc:creator>                 The person, organization, and/or service that created the XCCDF XML instance
<dc:publisher>               The person, organization, and/or service that published the XCCDF XML instance
<dc:contributor>             The person, organization, and/or service that contributed to the creation of the XCCDF
                             XML instance
<dc:source>                  An identifier that indicates the organizational context of the <xccdf:Benchmark>
                             element’s @id attribute. An organizationally specific URI SHOULD be used.


3.2.4    The <xccdf:Profile> Element

The use of an <xccdf:Profile> element SHALL NOT be required. SCAP content commonly
includes <xccdf:Profile> elements, but they are optional.
