3. Relying parties that work within a single organizational PKI (e.g., a PKI that supports
   a company or agency) should be able to discover paths for user certificates issued by
   CAs that are hierarchically subordinate to the trust anchor CA.

4. Relying parties that accept certificates from other organizations should be able to
   discover paths in non-hierarchical PKIs.


2.3.6 Client Software
1. Ensure that client implementations support multiple private keys and certificates for
   each end user to support different cryptographic services. For example, the client
   implementation should support and differentiate between private keys associated
   with public keys in certificates supporting digital signatures, and private keys
   associated with public keys in certificates supporting key establishment.

2. Ensure that client cryptographic modules are validated at FIPS 140-2 Level 1 or
   higher [FIPS 140-2].

3. Client implementations should support the certificate management protocol
   supported by the organization’s CA.15


2.4 Recommendations for System Installers/Administrators
The system installer and administrator is the person (or people) who are responsible for
establishing the PKI and who are responsible for the tasks associated with its day-to-day
operation. The system administrator shall ensure that end users are trained and that the
organization’s security policy is enforced.


2.4.1 Certificate Issuance
1. CAs shall be configured to ensure that certificates specify public keys with approved
   key sizes, valid domain parameters (if appropriate), and approved algorithms.

2. For maximum interoperability, CAs and users should use RSA key pairs for digital
   signatures and key transport.

3. For maximum security and performance, CAs and users should use elliptic curve key
   pairs for digital signatures and key agreement.

4. When signing certificates or CRLs, CAs shall generate digital signatures using a
   signing algorithm, hash function and a padding scheme (if the signing algorithm is
   RSA) combination specified in Table 2-2.


15
  Where keys and certificates are stored on smart cards, and all updates are performed at the RA, user
implementations need not support the certificate management protocol.
