      NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                      Building a Cybersecurity and
      August 2023                                                                 Privacy Learning Program

593      •   Metrics and reporting
594   The CPLP Strategy should also:
595      •   Describe how it supports a culture of risk-based decision making and emphasize the
596          importance of transformational workforce learning, including the development of
597          knowledge, skills, and the capabilities to help workers succeed now and in the future
598      •   Explain how the program will meet knowledge and skill gaps, enhance overall
599          capabilities, and support a culture of personnel engagement in their cybersecurity and
600          privacy roles
601      •   Intersect with the overall mission of the organization (e.g., mission and vision statements,
602          risk tolerance, learning goals and methods, and organizational structure)
603      •   Include information about organizational policies and policy owners, such as how
604          existing rules of behavior, policies, procedures, and guidance will be communicated to
605          personnel
606      •   Include metrics and measures that help determine whether the program is meeting its
607          goals
608      •   Include operational tactics, such as the tools, mechanisms, or methods that the program
609          owners will leverage to achieve program objectives
610      •   Identify key stakeholders, leaders, and roles, many of whom will be within the offices of
611          the Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Senior
612          Agency Information Security Officer (SAISO), Senior Agency Official for Privacy
613          (SAOP), or Chief Privacy Officer (CPO)
614      •   Use risk assessment results and existing strategies to inform the alignment between
615          program development, learning materials, and risk management
616              o Gap analysis: Note that existing CPLPs may benefit from a gap analysis or
617                current program assessment to clearly distinguish between the current and target
618                states and enable the program leadership to shape their approach accordingly.
619      •   Identify how the program will meet regulatory and compliance requirements to minimize
620          risks by educating personnel on their roles in the cybersecurity and privacy culture of the
621          organization
622      •   Plan for and support the needs of a diverse workforce, including those with accessibility
623          requirements and those who work remotely or travel frequently
624      •   Include learning methods that are experiential and atomize content (i.e., take existing
625          content and look at how it can be separated into smaller items or repurposed)

626          Develop CPLP Policies and Procedures
627   The CPLP policies and procedures work together to express what the organization wants to do
628   and how to do it. Policies are clear and simple statements, rules, or assertions that specify the
629   correct or expected behavior of an entity. Policies provide the guiding principles for meeting the
630   mission and conducting operations and they can help with risk-based decision-making. Policies
