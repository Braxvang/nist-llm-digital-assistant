APPENDIX G

LIKELIHOOD OF OCCURRENCE
DETERMINING THE LIKELIHOOD OF THREAT EVENTS CAUSING ADVERSE IMPACTS




T      his appendix provides: (i) a description of potentially useful inputs to the likelihood 55
       determination task; and (ii) exemplary assessment scales for assessing the likelihood of
       threat event initiation/occurrence, the likelihood of threat events resulting in adverse
impacts, and the overall likelihood of threat events being initiated or occurring and doing damage
to organizational operations, assets, or individuals. The assessment scales in this appendix can be
used by organizations as a starting point with appropriate tailoring to adjust for any organization-
specific conditions. Tables G-2, G-3, G-4, and G-5, outputs from Task 2-4, provide relevant
inputs to the risk tables in Appendix I.

   The term likelihood, as discussed in this guideline, is not likelihood in the strict sense of the term; rather, it is a
likelihood score. Risk assessors do not define a likelihood function in the statistical sense. Instead, risk assessors assign
a score (or likelihood assessment) based on available evidence, experience, and expert judgment. Combinations of
factors such as targeting, intent, and capability thus can be used to produce a score representing the likelihood of threat
initiation; combinations of factors such as capability and vulnerability severity can be used to produce a score
representing the likelihood of adverse impacts; and combinations of these scores can be used to produce an overall
likelihood score.
