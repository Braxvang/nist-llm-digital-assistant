the VPN tunnel. It sends all traffic not destined for the internal (protected) network through its standard
network connection and only sends traffic destined for the internal network through the VPN tunnel.
Split tunneling offers the advantages of efficiency and bandwidth conservation, as traffic destined for the
Internet does not have to be sent first to the VPN device. On the other hand, split tunneling also creates a
potential security vulnerability. If an attacker from the Internet compromises the client machine, then this
attacker can use the split tunnel to also access the organization’s internal network. The organization must
weigh the advantages and disadvantages of split tunneling before deciding to implement it.

If split tunneling is implemented, then the organization must decide which IP addresses will be routed
through the split tunnel. If all of an organization’s IP addresses are assigned to internal hosts, then the
routing is straightforward, but some hosts may be in the DMZ and therefore publicly accessible. Traffic
destined for these DMZ hosts will bypass the firewall if split tunneling is not used. It may therefore be
more secure and efficient for the client to reach hosts located in the DMZ via the Internet rather than to
use the split tunnel. If this is the case, then the organization must take care to configure the split tunnel
with internal subnets only.

Section 4.3.4.2 recommends that a VPN device placed into the DMZ be configured with at least two
interfaces: one for external traffic and one for internal traffic. However, using two interfaces introduces
more routing complexity. The device needs to be configured with static routes that correctly point toward
internal hosts or hosts in the DMZ. The routing tables for routers within the DMZ must also be
configured to route all traffic destined for both interfaces on the device toward the device’s external
interface. If any traffic is routed toward the device’s internal interface, this traffic may get dropped
because it must traverse a firewall to reach the internal interface. This firewall will have no knowledge of
the traffic because the original traffic from the VPN device to the DMZ hosts traversed the device’s
external interface and therefore did not go through the firewall. Figure 4-5 illustrates a scenario where
traffic will get dropped if the packets are not correctly routed to the right interface.
