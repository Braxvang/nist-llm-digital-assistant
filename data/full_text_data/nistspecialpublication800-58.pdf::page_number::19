NIST SP 800-58                                              Voice Over IP Security

          Conferencing units – These provide the same type of service as conventional
          conference calling phone systems, but since communication is handled over
          the Internet, they may also allow users to coordinate data communication
          services, such as a whiteboard that displays on computer monitors at both
          ends.

          Mobile units – Wireless VOIP units are becoming increasingly popular,
          especially since many organizations already have an installed base of 802.11
          networking equipment. Wireless VOIP products may present additional
          challenges if certain security issues are not carefully addressed. The WEP
          security features of 802.11b provide little or no protection. The more recent
          WiFi Protected Access (WPA), a snapshot of the ongoing 802.11i standard,
          offers significant improvements in security, and can aid the integration of
          wireless technology with VOIP.

          PC or “softphone” – With a headset, software, and inexpensive connection
          service, any PC or workstation can be used as a VOIP unit, often referred to as
          a “softphone”. If practical, softphone systems should not be used where
          security or privacy are a concern. Worms, viruses, and other malicious
          software are common on PCs connected to the internet, and very difficult to
          defend against. Well known vulnerabilities in web browsers make it possible
          for attackers to download malicious software without a user’s knowledge,
          even if the user does nothing more than visit a compromised web site.
          Malicious software attached to email messages can also be installed without
          the user’s knowledge, in some cases even if the user does not open the
          attachment. These vulnerabilities result in unacceptably high risks in the use
          of “softphones”, for most applications. In addition, because PCs are
          necessarily on the data network, using a softphone system conflicts with the
          need to separate voice and data networks to the greatest extent practical.

       In addition to end-user equipment, VOIP systems include a large number of other
       components, including call processors (call managers), gateways, routers,
       firewalls, and protocols. Most of these components have counterparts used in
       data networks, but the performance demands of VOIP mean that ordinary network
       software and hardware must be supplemented with special VOIP components.
       The unique nature of VOIP services has a significant impact on security
       considerations for these networks, as will be detailed in later chapters.

 2.2   Overview of VOIP Data Handling

       Before any voice can be sent, a call must be placed. In an ordinary phone system,
       this process involves dialing the digits of the called number, which are then
       processed by the telephone company’s system to ring the called number. With
       VOIP, the user must enter the dialed number, which can take the form of a
       number dialed on a telephone keypad or the selection of a Universal Resource
       Indicator (URI), but after that a complex series of packet exchanges must occur,
