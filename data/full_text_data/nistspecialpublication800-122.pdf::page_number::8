                               GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



 Information about an individual that is linked or linkable to one of the above (e.g., date of birth, place
  of birth, race, religion, weight, activities, geographical indicators, employment information, medical
  information, education information, financial information).

Organizations should minimize the use, collection, and retention of PII to what is strictly necessary
to accomplish their business purpose and mission.
The likelihood of harm caused by a breach involving PII is greatly reduced if an organization minimizes
the amount of PII it uses, collects, and stores. For example, an organization should only request PII in a
new form if the PII is absolutely necessary. Also, an organization should regularly review its holdings of
previously collected PII to determine whether the PII is still relevant and necessary for meeting the
organization‘s business purpose and mission. For example, organizations could have an annual PII
purging awareness day.7
OMB M-07-168 specifically requires agencies to:
 Review current holdings of PII and ensure they are accurate, relevant, timely, and complete
 Reduce PII holdings to the minimum necessary for proper performance of agency functions
 Develop a schedule for periodic review of PII holdings
 Establish a plan to eliminate the unnecessary collection and use of SSNs.
Organizations should categorize their PII by the PII confidentiality impact level.
All PII is not created equal. PII should be evaluated to determine its PII confidentiality impact level,
which is different from the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 1999
confidentiality impact level, so that appropriate safeguards can be applied to the PII. The PII
confidentiality impact level—low, moderate, or high—indicates the potential harm that could result to the
subject individuals and/or the organization if PII were inappropriately accessed, used, or disclosed. This
document provides a list of factors an organization should consider when determining the PII
confidentiality impact level. Each organization should decide which factors it will use for determining
impact levels and then create and implement the appropriate policy, procedures, and controls. The
following are examples of factors:

 Identifiability. Organizations should evaluate how easily PII can be used to identify specific
  individuals. For example, a SSN uniquely and directly identifies an individual, whereas a telephone
  area code identifies a set of people.
 Quantity of PII. Organizations should consider how many individuals can be identified from the
  PII. Breaches of 25 records and 25 million records may have different impacts. The PII
  confidentiality impact level should only be raised and not lowered based on this factor.
 Data Field Sensitivity. Organizations should evaluate the sensitivity of each individual PII data
  field. For example, an individual‘s SSN or financial account number is generally more sensitive than

    Disposal of PII should be conducted in accordance with the retention schedules approved by the National Archives and
    Records Administration (NARA), as well as in accordance with agency litigation holds.
