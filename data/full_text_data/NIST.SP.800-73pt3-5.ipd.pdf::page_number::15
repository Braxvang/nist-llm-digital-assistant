      NIST SP 800-73pt3-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)              Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 3
      September 2023                                                                                  PIV Client API

302                           cardHandle                The returned opaque identifier of a
303                                                     communication channel to a particular ICC and,
304                                                     hence, of the card itself. cardHandle is used in all
305                                                     other entry points on the PIV client API to
306                                                     identify which card the functionality of the
307                                                     entry point should be applied to.
308   Return Codes:             PIV_OK
309                             PIV_CONNECTION_DESCRIPTION_MALFORMED
310                             PIV_CONNECTION_FAILURE
311                             PIV_CONNECTION_LOCKED


312   3.1.3. pivDisconnect
313   Purpose:         Disconnect the PIV API from the PIV Card Application and the ICC that contains
314                    the PIV Card Application.
315   Prototype:              status_word pivDisconnect(
316                           IN handle    cardHandle
317                           );
318   Parameters:             cardHandle            Opaque identifier of the card to be acted upon as
319                                                         returned by pivConnect. The value of
320                                                         cardHandle is undefined upon return from
321                                                         pivDisconnect.
322   Return Codes:             PIV_OK
323                             PIV_INVALID_CARD_HANDLE
324                             PIV_CARD_READER_ERROR

325   If secure messaging has been established, then the PIV Middleware SHALL zeroize the secure
326   messaging session keys.

327           Entry Points for Data Access

328   3.2.1.1.         pivSelectCardApplication
329   Purpose:         Set the PIV Card Application as the currently selected card application, and
330                    establish the PIV Card Applicationâ€™s security state.
331   Prototype:       status_word pivSelectCardApplication(
332                    IN handle                       cardHandle,
333                    IN sequence of byte             applicationAID,
334                    IN LONG                         aidLength,
335                    OUT sequence of byte            applicationProperties,
336                    INOUT LONG                      APLength
337                    );
