      supported on the device, and acquisition by directly reading memory that has been removed
      from the device [Bro12].

5.3.1 GSM Mobile Device Considerations

      Mobile devices that do not require a UICC are relatively straightforward as the acquisition
      entails a single device. Mobile devices requiring UICCs are more complex. There are two
      items that must be examined: the handset and the UICC. Depending on the state of the mobile
      device (i.e., active, inactive) the handset and UICC may be acquired jointly or separately. It is
      generally accepted to process the UICC first while the device is in an inactive state.

      If the mobile device is active, a joint acquisition of the handset and UICC contents should be
      acquired first. A direct acquisition recovers deleted messages present on a UICC, while an
      indirect acquisition via the handset does not. The UICC must be removed from the mobile
      device and inserted into an appropriate reader for direct acquisition.

      A well-known forensic issue that arises when performing a joint acquisition is that the status of
      unread text messages change between acquisitions. The first acquisition may alter the status
      flag of an unread message to read. Reading an unread text message from a UICC indirectly
      through the handset causes the operating system of the device to change the status flags.
      UICCs that are read directly by a tool do not make these modifications. One way to avoid this
      issue is to omit selecting the recovery of UICC memory when performing the joint acquisition
      (if the tool allows such an option) [Rei08].

      If the mobile device is inactive, the contents of the UICC may be acquired independently
      before that of the handset. The UICC acquisition should be done directly through a PC/SC
      reader. The handset acquisition should be attempted without the UICC present. Many devices
      permit an acquisition under such conditions, allowing PIN entry for the UICC to be bypassed,
      if it were enabled. If the acquisition attempt is unsuccessful, the UICC may be reinserted and a
      second attempt made. Performing separate independent acquisitions (i.e., acquiring the UICC
      before acquiring the contents of the handset) avoids any operating system related forensic
      issues associated with an indirect read of UICC data. However, removing the SIM can
      reportedly cause data to be deleted on some mobile devices [Cas11].

5.3.2 iOS Device Considerations

      Since mid-2009, beginning with the release of the iPhone 3G[s], Apple has shipped all iOS
      devices with a dedicated cryptographic chip, making hardware accelerated encryption possible.
      Apple has incorporated this accelerated cryptography into the operating system, marketed as a
      feature named Data Protection. Data Protection is the combination of hardware-accelerated
      encryption and an authenticated cryptographic scheme, allowing any file or piece of
      information to be encrypted or decrypted with a separate key.

      Files protected with data protection are encrypted with a random file key, which is then
      encrypted using a higher tier class key, and stored as a file tag with the file. Passwords (and
      other sensitive small data) are stored on the device are encrypted using a similar approach, and
      are stored in the iOS keychain, a device key escrow mechanism built into the operating system.

      Files and keychain elements are both protected by one of a number of access control keys,
      which are also encrypted in a way that incorporates the userâ€™s device passcode. The passcode
