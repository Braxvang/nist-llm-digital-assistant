 Cause integrity loss by injecting false but believable data    Adversary injects false but believable data into organizational information systems,
 into organizational information systems.                       resulting in suboptimal actions or loss of confidence in organizational data/services.
 Cause disclosure of critical and/or sensitive information      Adversary induces (e.g., via social engineering) authorized users to inadvertently

 spilling sensitive information.                                networks) by causing them to handle information of a classification/sensitivity for

 Obtain sensitive data/information from publicly                Adversary scans or mines information on publically accessible servers and web
 accessible information systems.                                pages of organizations with the intent of finding sensitive information.
 Obtain information by opportunistically stealing or            Adversary steals information systems or components (e. g., laptop computers or
 scavenging information systems/components.                     data storage media) that are left unattended outside of the physical perimeters of

 Coordinate a campaign of multi-staged attacks (e.g.,           Adversary moves the source of malicious commands or actions from one
