                                                                            GUIDELINES ON FIREWALLS AND FIREWALL POLICY


changes required to other equipment should also be coordinated as part of the firewall deployment. The
security policy expressed by the firewall’s configuration should be added to the overall security policy of
the organization, and the ongoing changes to its configuration should be integrated with the
organization’s configuration management processes. If multiple firewalls are being deployed, including
personal firewalls or at multiple branch offices, a gradual or phased approach should be considered; a
pilot program would also be helpful, especially for identifying and resolving issues of conflicting policies.
This will provide administrators with an opportunity to evaluate the firewall solution’s impact and resolve
issues before enterprise-wide deployment.

Connecting a firewall to the organization’s network requires more than just inserting the firewall into the
traffic flow from the outside of the network to the inside: it also involves integrating the firewall with
other network elements that will interact with the firewall. Because firewalls usually act as routers, the
firewall has to be integrated into the network’s routing structure. This often means replacing a router that
is at the same spot in the network topology as where the firewall is being placed, but it can also mean
changing the routing tables for other routers in the organization’s network to handle the addition of this
new router. If elements in the network use dynamic routing, those elements will probably need to have
their configuration modified to be aware of the firewall’s routing. Also, the network switch on the outside
of the network being protected may need to be reconfigured to handle the firewall’s addressing. If the
firewall is a set of systems with failover between the systems, the network switch may need to be
configured to handle the failover.

5.5     Manage

This last phase of the firewall planning and implementation model is the longest lasting, because
managing the solution involves maintaining firewall architecture, policies, software, and other
components of the solution chosen to be deployed. One example of a typical maintenance action is testing
and applying patches to firewall devices. 21 Policy rules may need to be updated as new threats are
identified and requirements change, such as when new applications or hosts are implemented within the
network, and should also be reviewed periodically to ensure they remain in compliance with security
policy. It is also important to monitor the performance of firewall components to ensure that potential
resource issues are identified and addressed before components become overwhelmed. Logs and alerts
should also be monitored continuously to identify threats—successful and unsuccessful—that are made to
the system. Another important task is to perform periodic testing to verify that firewall rules are
functioning as expected. Also, firewall policies and rulesets should be backed up regularly. Some
firewalls can store this information in multiple formats, such as a binary format that is used to configure
the firewall and a human-readable format that can be read by auditors. If multiple formats are available,
backups should be kept in all of them.

Changes to firewall rulesets or policies impact security and should be managed as part of a formal
configuration management process. Many firewalls have auditing of changes as part of their
administrative interfaces, but this does not necessarily track policy changes. At a minimum, a log should
be kept of all policy decisions and ruleset changes—and this log should somehow be associated with the
firewall. For example, the log can be attached to the device physically, or the log file can be kept in the
same part of the organization’s inventory management system as the firewall. Also, some firewalls permit
comments to be maintained for each rule; wherever practical, rulesets should be documented with
comments on each rule. Most firewalls allow restrictions on who can make changes to the ruleset; some
even allow restrictions on the addresses from which administrators can make such changes. Such
restrictions should be used when possible.
