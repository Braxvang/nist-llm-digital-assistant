     NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                            Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
     December 2023                                                                   and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

40   Certain commercial equipment, instruments, software, or materials, commercial or non-commercial, are identified in
41   this paper in order to specify the experimental procedure adequately. Such identification does not imply
42   recommendation or endorsement of any product or service by NIST, nor does it imply that the materials or
43   equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the purpose.

44   There may be references in this publication to other publications currently under development by NIST in
45   accordance with its assigned statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication, including concepts and
46   methodologies, may be used by federal agencies even before the completion of such companion publications. Thus,
47   until each publication is completed, current requirements, guidelines, and procedures, where they exist, remain
48   operative. For planning and transition purposes, federal agencies may wish to closely follow the development of
49   these new publications by NIST.

50   Organizations are encouraged to review all draft publications during public comment periods and provide feedback
51   to NIST. Many NIST cybersecurity publications, other than the ones noted above, are available at
