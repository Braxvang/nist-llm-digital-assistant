NIST SP 800-216                                                                   Federal Vulnerability
May 2023                                                                          Disclosure Guidelines

recommended that a list of VDPOs supported by the FCB member along with a link to their
external vulnerability disclosure policies be made publicly available. This allows the reporter to
both choose where to send the report and know which VDPOs work with the FCB member.
Section 3.2.1 provides guidance on the creation of vulnerability disclosure acceptance policies.
Source vulnerability reports should include a description of the product or service affected; how
the potential vulnerability can be identified, demonstrated, or reproduced; and what type of
functional impact the vulnerability allows. Due to the sensitivity of the information, agencies
should provide mechanisms for confidentially receiving additional information within the reports
(e.g., web forms, bug or issue tracking systems, vulnerability reporting services, email
addresses). To facilitate verification of the vulnerability, agencies should design reporting
mechanisms for assessing the validity, technical severity, scope, and impact of vulnerabilities.
This information could include:
        •    Product or service name and affected versions
        •    An identified host or its network interface
        •    Class or type of vulnerability, optionally using a taxonomy like CWE (Common
             Weakness Enumeration)
        •    Possible root cause (or CVE if known)
        •    Proof-of-concept code or other substantial evidence
        •    Tools and steps to reproduce the vulnerable behavior
        •    Impact and severity estimate
        •    Scope assessment and other products, components, services, or vendors thought to be
             affected
        •    Disclosure plans (specifically, embargo and publication timelines)
When applicable, the source vulnerability report should also indicate whether the vulnerability
affects multiple systems, their commonality, and if the other system owners have been notified.

2.1.2. Determine Scope and Obtain Contacts
Prior to the receipt of any vulnerabilities, each FCB member will determine which government
VDPOs fall within the scope of their services. The FCB member will then obtain and maintain a
list of VDPO contacts within the relevant government agencies that receive and handle source
vulnerability reports. Each FCB member should develop the capability to forward reports to
VDPOs and to engage in ongoing communications to enable coordination. Lastly, FCB members
may engage with industry-tied vulnerability coordination entities (e.g., CERT/CC 3) to facilitate
coordination with non-government software and/or service providers.
