ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



     The ability to transfer the cryptographic key generated by the AS to the AP securely. As shown
      in Figure 5-12, the AS to AP communication must provide confidentiality and integrity, and the
      AS must prevent key compromise during storage.

The AS is a critical component of overall RSN security. The IEEE 802.11 standard assumes the
following with respect to the AS:

     It does not expose or compromise the PMK (a subset of the AAA key) to other entities besides
      the AP.
     It does not masquerade as a STA to the AP.
     It does not masquerade as an AP to the STA.
Figure 5-13 depicts a typical enterprise environment with numerous STAs and APs, plus a single AS to
provide authentication services during the third phase of RSN establishment. A AAA server running
RADIUS is commonly used as the AS, but other types of AAA servers such as those supporting Diameter
may also perform the service. In some small or single AP implementations, the AS may be physically
integrated into the AP. In that case, there is no external communication for EAP authentication or for
delivery of the AAA key.
