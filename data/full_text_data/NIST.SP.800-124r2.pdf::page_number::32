4.2.4. Mobile App Vetting
The goal of app vetting is to detect software or configuration flaws that may create
vulnerabilities or violate enterprise security or privacy policies. An app vetting system is
commonly used by enterprise system administrators before an app is deployed to a user’s mobile
device, unlike an MTD system, which can analyze downloaded and installed apps. App vetting
can also be used to vet apps that may not be deployed by an administrator but are installed by
users outside of management. Mobile apps may be developed by mobile device manufacturers
(e.g., Apple’s apps for iOS), the mobile OS vendor (e.g., Google apps for Android), third-party
providers, or in-house enterprise developers. App developers, OS developers, and enterprise
administrators may make mistakes when designing or building an app. They may also
intentionally insert malicious functionality that may impact the security or privacy of the mobile
user or the enterprise.
App vetting involves a sequence of activities that are typically accomplished via automated test
and analysis tools, which may interact with external vetting services. App vetting systems may
analyze app source code, app binaries, or general app behavior. App vetting systems can expose
several security-critical issues, such as problems with the use of cryptography, the collection and
handling of sensitive corporate or user data, or software dependencies on untrustworthy cloud
services. Common problems with app use of cryptography include the use of weak or broken
cryptographic algorithms, small key sizes, or the failure to cryptographically protect
communications or stored data.
Vetting systems may also detect that an app will collect sensitive enterprise data or PII of the
mobile user. Apps may be designed to use the device’s camera or microphone or collect and
share (or sell) sensitive information, including user location information, contact details, sensor
data, photos, and messages with backend services provided by untrustworthy third parties.
Mobile app vetting systems may be able to expose such issues at several phases of the app life
cycle: 1) during development by communicating issues and recommended mitigations to app
developers, 2) following development and prior to deployment by identifying vulnerabilities for
app security analysts or enterprise system administrators, and 3) post-deployment through
integration with an EMM by notifying enterprise system administrators of vulnerabilities in
installed apps [2].

4.2.5. Virtual Mobile Infrastructure
Virtual mobile infrastructure (VMI) provides an alternative, or accompaniment, to EMM
technology. Similar to virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), which hosts a virtual desktop image
for applications and data, VMI uses backend infrastructure to host a virtual mobile device and
mobile apps. A user then accesses their virtual device via an app (i.e., thin client) on their phone,
and the thin client provides access to a virtual OS. This approach may be viewed as
“sidestepping” data confidentiality concerns by storing sensitive information in an external
infrastructure versus on the mobile device itself. Since all enterprise information would only be
available on the cloud-hosted infrastructure, enterprise data would likely be unavailable if there
