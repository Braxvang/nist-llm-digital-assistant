               The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



4.7.3    Mapping OVAL Results to XCCDF Results

When evaluating an <xccdf:Rule> element that references an OVAL Definition, the
<xccdf:rule-result> element SHALL be used to capture the result of this evaluation. This result
SHALL be determined by evaluating the referenced OVAL Definition on a target host. The
<xccdf:result> value recorded SHALL be mapped from the OVAL Definition Result produced
during evaluation.

While the OVAL specification permits limiting result status reporting, SCAP-compliant content SHALL
include full status reporting including Error, Unknown, Not Applicable, Not Evaluated, True, and False.

SCAP compliant processors that generate XCCDF <xccdf:rule-result> elements SHALL apply
the mapping illustrated in Table 7 when deriving <xccdf:Rule> results from OVAL Definition
processing. The corresponding <xccdf:rule-result/xccdf:result> value SHALL be
recorded based on the @class of the OVAL Definition where applicable.
                    Table 7. Deriving XCCDF Rule Results from OVAL Definition Results

                    OVAL Definition Result                           XCCDF Rule Result
                    error                                            error
                    unknown                                          unknown
                    not applicable                                   notapplicable
                    not evaluated                                    notchecked
                     Definition Class  Definition Result
                     compliance          true
                     vulnerability       false                       pass
                     inventory           true
                     patch               false
                     Definition Class    Definition Result
                     compliance            false
                     vulnerability         true                      fail
                     inventory             false
                     patch                 true

The mappings in Table 7 are specific to each OVAL Definition class. For example, if an OVAL
Definition of class ―compliance‖ is processed and the XCCDF returns a result of ―true‖, the product is
conveying the fact that the system was found to be compliant with that check and therefore returns a
―pass‖ result. A similar definition for a vulnerable condition will return results of ―false‖ if that
vulnerability was not found on the examined devices, resulting in a ―pass‖ from the XCCDF rule.

If the <xccdf:Rule> under evaluation has an <xccdf:check-content-ref> element with the
@name attribute omitted, then the result of each evaluated OVAL Definition SHALL be recorded as a
separate <xccdf:rule-result>. This will commonly occur for a “security_patches_up_to_date”
check, as defined in Section 3.2.6.4. In this case the <xccdf:rule-result/xccdf:check-
content-ref> SHALL identify the specific check result of each evaluated OVAL definition using the
@href and @name attributes as described in Section 4.7, item 8c. .

4.8     OVAL Results

Each SCAP OVAL result data stream component SHALL use the <oval-res:oval_results>
element as the document element. Each OVAL result data stream component SHALL validate against
