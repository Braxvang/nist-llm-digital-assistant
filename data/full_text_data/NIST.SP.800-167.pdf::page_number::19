NIST SP 800-167                                                                           GUIDE TO APPLICATION W HITELISTING


     Application control functionality. Basic functionality will need to be checked during the prototype
      testing. Examples include allowing the execution of whitelisted applications, blocking the execution
      of blacklisted applications, and detecting modifications to whitelisted applications. These functions
      should be verified by: installing patches and other updates; manually modifying executables; and
      making other changes to applications to confirm that the application control policies can be properly
      enforced and cannot be easily circumvented.
     Management. Administrators should be able to configure and manage all components of the solution
      effectively and securely. It is particularly important to evaluate the ease of deployment and
      configuration, including how easily the solution can be managed as the solution is scaled to larger
      deployments. Management concerns should include the effects of patching/upgrading the application
      whitelisting software, changing software settings (e.g., changing cryptographic algorithms or key
      sizes), and managing cryptographic keys. Another important management concern that needs special
      attention is whitelist generation and maintenance, such as how the whitelists accommodate software
      patching.
     Logging/alerting. The logging, alerting, and data management functions should work properly in
      accordance with the organization’s policies and strategies.
     Performance. The solution should be able to provide adequate performance during normal and peak
      usage. Testing should incorporate a variety of devices, OSs, and applications.
     Security of the implementation. The application whitelisting technology itself may contain
      vulnerabilities and weaknesses that attackers could exploit. Organizations with high security needs
      may want to perform extensive vulnerability assessments against the application whitelisting
      components.14
Before installing application whitelisting software on a host, organizations should scan the host for
malware and either remove any malware that is detected or rebuild the host. The scan will ensure that
malware files are not included in the whitelist generation process. Organizations should also ensure that
the host’s OS is secured properly, including that it is fully patched and that other necessary security
controls are installed and configured properly. If the OS is not secured properly, the host is more likely to
be compromised, which could weaken the protection provided by the application whitelisting technology.

3.4     Deployment

Once testing is complete and any issues have been resolved, the next phase of the planning and
implementation model involves deploying the solution. When the components are being deployed into
production, organizations should initially use application whitelisting on a small number of hosts.
Deploying it to many hosts at once might overwhelm the management servers or identify other
bottlenecks through loss of availability. Many of the problems that occur are likely to occur on multiple
hosts, so it is helpful to identify such problems either during the testing process or when deploying the
first hosts, so that those problems can be addressed before widespread deployment. A phased deployment
provides administrators an opportunity to evaluate the impact of the solution and resolve issues prior to
enterprise-wide deployment. It also provides time for the IT staff (e.g., system administrators, help desk)
and users to be trained and to become accustomed to the operational lifecycle of the implementation.

Most of the issues that can occur during deployment are the same types of issues that occur during any
large IT deployment. In addition to potential problems described earlier in this publication, another
