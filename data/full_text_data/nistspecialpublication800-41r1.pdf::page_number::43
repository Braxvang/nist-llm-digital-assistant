Appendix A—Glossary

Selected terms used in the publication are defined below.

Application Firewall: A firewall that uses stateful protocol analysis to analyze network traffic for one or
more applications.

Application-Proxy Gateway: A firewall capability that combines lower-layer access control with upper
layer-functionality, and includes a proxy agent that acts as an intermediary between two hosts that wish to
communicate with each other.

Dedicated Proxy Server: A form of proxy server that has much more limited firewalling capabilities
than an application-proxy gateway.

Demilitarized Zone (DMZ): An interface on a routing firewall that is similar to the interfaces found on
the firewall’s protected side. Traffic moving between the DMZ and other interfaces on the protected side
of the firewall still goes through the firewall and can have firewall protection policies applied.

Deny by Default: To block all inbound and outbound traffic that has not been expressly permitted by
firewall policy.

Egress Filtering: Filtering of outgoing network traffic.

Firewall: A device or program that controls the flow of network traffic between networks or hosts that
employ differing security postures.

Host-Based Firewall: A software-based firewall installed on a server to monitor and control its incoming
and outgoing network traffic.

Ingress Filtering: Filtering of incoming network traffic.

Network Access Control (NAC): A feature provided by some firewalls that allows access based on a
user’s credentials and the results of health checks performed on the telework client device.

Network Address Translation (NAT): A routing technology used by many firewalls to hide internal
system addresses from an external network through use of an addressing schema.

Packet Filter: A routing device that provides access control functionality for host addresses and
communication sessions.

Personal Firewall: A software-based firewall installed on a desktop or laptop computer to monitor and
control its incoming and outgoing network traffic.

Personal Firewall Appliance: A device that performs functions similar to a personal firewall for a group
of computers on a home network.

Ruleset: A set of directives that govern the access control functionality of a firewall. The firewall uses
these directives to determine how packets should be routed between its interfaces.

Stateful Inspection: Packet filtering that also tracks the state of connections and blocks packets that
deviate from the expected state.
