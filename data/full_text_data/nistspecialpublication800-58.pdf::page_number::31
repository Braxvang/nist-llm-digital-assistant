 4     H.323


        H.323 is the ITU specification for audio and video communication across
        packetized networks. H.323 is actually an umbrella standard, encompassing
        several other protocols, including H.225, H.245, and others. It acts as a wrapper
        for a suite of media control recommendations by the ITU. Each of these protocols
        has a specific role in the call setup process, and all but one are made to dynamic
        ports. Figure 3 shows the H.323 architecture and Figure 4 provides an overview
        of the H.323 call setup process.

 4.1   H.323 Architecture

        An H.323 network is made up of several endpoints (terminals), a gateway, and
        possibly a gatekeeper, Multipoint control unit, and Back End Service. The
        gatekeeper is often one of the main components in H.323 systems. It provides
        address resolution and bandwidth control. The gateway serves as a bridge
        between the H.323 network and the outside world of (possibly) non-H.323
        devices. This includes SIP networks and traditional PSTN networks. This
        brokering can add to delays in VOIP, and hence there has been a movement
        towards the consolidation of at least the two major VOIP protocols [15]. A
        Multipoint Control Unit is an optional element that facilitates multipoint
        conferencing and other communications between more than two endpoints.
        Gatekeepers are an optional but widely used component of a VOIP network [16].
        If a gatekeeper is present, a Back End Service (BES) may exist to maintain data
        about endpoints, including their permissions, services, and configuration [17].
