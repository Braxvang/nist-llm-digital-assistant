an interval that is compatible with the general model for assurance of possession
described in Section 6.1.
Figure 2 depicts this situation. This figure is based on Figure 1 and will be used to discuss
methods for assigning a useful value to assurance_time. Note that this figure depicts the
initial level of assurance as either HIGH or MEDIUM; this is for illustrative purposes
only and is not always achieved in practice (see Sections 6.3.1.3 and 6.3.2.2). In Figure 2:
   •   a, b and c are as defined for Figure 1.
   •   tG represents the precise time that the assurance_time is explicitly provided.
   •   t1 is a time that is trusted by the relying parties to precede (or equal) tG.
   •   t2 is a time that is trusted by the relying parties to follow (or equal) tG.
   •   d is the maximum time lapse allowed between t1 and t2.
   •   tA is the assigned assurance_time. It must satisfy t1 ≤ tA ≤ t2. In this
       Recommendation, for the purpose of simplicity, tA will be set equal to either t1 or
       t2 (see Sections 6.3.1.2 and 6.3.2.1).

Values for a, b, c and d are selected by relying parties or their organizations with regard
to the following:
   1. a, b and c should be selected with regard to the judgments to be made about the
      validity of the digital signatures processed. Consideration should also be given to
      the ease (or difficulty) of (repeatedly) using a given method to explicitly obtain
      assurance of possession.
   2. A value of d shall be selected such that d is less than one half the minimum of a
      and b (i.e., d < ½ min(a, b)). An interval of length d must allow sufficient time for
      the acquisition of time t1, the actions required to provide/obtain assurance, and the
