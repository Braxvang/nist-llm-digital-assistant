evaluated to determine the types of media employed for persistent information. Some equipment (e.g.
personal computers) employs a single persistent storage mechanism (hard drive); other equipment (e.g.
routers) could employ multiple methods including hard drives, flash memory, Electronically Erasable
Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), and other non-volatile memory. It is important to
address the sanitation of solid-state memory. The method of media destruction should insure the
destruction of the information or media so that the information is unrecoverable. NIST SP 800-88,
Guidelines for Media Sanitization,70 provides information about the proper sanitation or destruction of
equipment. SP 800-88 includes pointers to other resources such as the U.S. Department of Defense
5220.22-M Clearing and Sanitization Matrix.71

One overlooked aspect of disposition is the management of software and hardware license and service
agreements. Licensing agreements often dictate the terms under which software or hardware is
transferable. Once equipment is at end-of-life, it may be possible to remove that equipment from support
agreements, potentially saving money.

Organizations should adopt a proactive approach to media sanitation. Equipment removed from the
network should be sanitized before the replacement equipment is installed. This reduces the window of
vulnerability and greatly decreases the risk of information disclosure. Installers should provide proof of
sanitation, including a certificate of destruction with serial numbers and asset tags.

6.10 Summary

Security risks are inherent during the initial deployment of a new protocol such as IPv6, but mitigation
strategies exist and many of the residual risks are no different from those that challenge existing IPv4
networks.
IPsec is a major component of IPv6 security and should be deployed, wherever possible, to secure IPv6
networks. Transition mechanisms allow existing IPv4 networks to coexist and interoperate with IPv6
networks, systems, and services. These transition mechanisms cover a wide range of technologies and
transition scenarios. Organizations should plan their deployment and account for the full lifecycle of
equipment from inception to disposal.
