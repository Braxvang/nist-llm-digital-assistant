6.      Derived Test Requirements for the Derived PIV Application on Removable
        Tokens

This section lists requirements that apply to a Derived PIV Application resident on a removable
token, such as an SD card, USB token, or UICC, that may be inserted into mobile devices. The
requirements are aimed towards vendors of Derived PIV Applications to ensure that these
applications are implemented correctly and are in accordance to the specification.
