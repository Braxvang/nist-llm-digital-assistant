2096   cyber range
2097   This technique provides a safe environment (sandbox) to deliver hands-on realistic training, scenarios, challenges,
2098   and exercises in an easy-to-access web-based environment.

2099   cybersecurity
2100   The prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers, electronic communications systems,
2101   electronic communications services, wire communication, and electronic communication, including information
2102   contained therein, to ensure its availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation.

2103   Data privacy
2104   a condition that safeguards human autonomy and dignity through various means including confidentiality,
2105   predictability, manageability, and disassociability.

2106   Data Management Officer
2107   Responsible for overviewing and carrying out the data management tasks of research projects. Main duties and
2108   responsibilities include data collection, or the formulation, implementation, and enforcement of proper data
2109   collection policies and procedures. Trains reporting agencies on data collection tools and equipment.
2110   disassociability
2111   Enabling the processing of data or events without association to individuals or devices beyond the operational
2112   requirements of the system.

2113   gap analysis
2114   The process of comparing current Learning Program or activity performance with the desired, expected
2115   performance.

2116   information technology
2117   (A) with respect to an executive agency means any equipment or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment,
2118   used in the automatic acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, management, movement, control,
2119   display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information by the executive agency, if the
2120   equipment is used by the executive agency directly or is used by a contractor under a contract with the executive
2121   agency that requires the use— (i) of that equipment; or (ii) of that equipment to a significant extent in the
2122   performance of a service or the furnishing of a product; (B) includes computers, ancillary equipment (including
2123   imaging peripherals, input, output, and storage devices necessary for security and surveillance), peripheral
2124   equipment designed to be controlled by the central processing unit of a computer, software, firmware and similar
2125   procedures, services (including support services), and related resources; but (C) does not include any equipment
2126   acquired by a federal contractor incidental to a federal contract. [14]

2127   integrity
2128   Guarding against improper information modification or destruction; includes ensuring information non-repudiation
2129   and authenticity.

2130   learning objectives
2131   Identifies the outcomes that the learning program sub-component or module should strive to meet for each of the
2132   participants and their associated roles. which helps to build an understanding of risks and explain everyone’s role in
2133   reducing, managing, and mitigating risks.

2134   Learning Program
2135   Consists of numerous elements led by the Learning Program Manager(s), who develop a Strategic Plan to deliver a
2136   right-sized program to reduce organizational cybersecurity and privacy risks via workforce education and training.
2137   The Learning Program operates throughout the year and incorporates plans for ongoing improvements that are based
2138   on rigorous assessments and metrics that support compliance and other mandated reporting. A supportive objective
2139   is to develop a positive cybersecurity and privacy culture and not to blame or shame the workforce for lapses or
2140   errors.

2141   Learning Program Management
2142   The people and processes that support the cybersecurity and privacy Learning Program.
