NIST SP 800-186                                                 Discrete Logarithm-based Cryptography:
February 2023                                                         Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters

Audience
This document is intended for implementers of cryptographic schemes that include the use of
elliptic curve cryptography.

Conformance Testing
Conformance testing for implementations of this Recommendation will be conducted within the
framework of the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP) and the Cryptographic
Module Validation Program (CMVP). The requirements of this Recommendation are indicated
by the word “shall.” Some of these requirements may be out of scope for CAVP or CMVP
validation testing and are thus the responsibility of entities using, implementing, installing, or
configuring applications that incorporate this Recommendation.
Conformant implementations may perform procedures via an equivalent sequence of operations,
provided that these include all cryptographic checks included with the specifications in this
document. This is important because the checks are essential for the prevention of subtle attacks.
