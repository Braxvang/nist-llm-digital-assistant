of protection. Hardening guidelines specify the procedures to be followed when hardening a
system.

FR:8.3 The CKMS design shall specify all trusted (secure) operating system requirements
(including any required operating system configurations) for each CKMS device.

FR:8.4 The CKMS design shall specify which of the following hardening features are
enforced by the CKMS:

   a) Removing all non-essential software programs and utilities from the computer;
   b) Using the principle of least privilege to control access to sensitive system features and
      applications;
   c) Using the principle of least privilege to control access to sensitive system and
      application files and data;
   d) Limiting user accounts to those needed for legitimate operations, i.e., disabling or
      deleting the accounts that are no longer required;
   e) Running the applications with the principle of least privilege;
   f) Replacing all default passwords and keys with strong passwords and randomly
      generated keys, respectively;
   g) Disabling or removing network services that are not required for the operation of the
      system;
   h) Disabling or removing all other services that are not required for the operation of the
      system;
   i) Disabling removable media, or disabling automatic run features on removable media
      and enabling automatic malware checks upon media introduction;
   j) Disabling network ports that are not required for the system operation;
   k) Enabling optional security features as appropriate; and
   l) Selecting other configuration options that are secure.

FR:8.5: The CKMS design shall specify the BIOS protection features that ensure the proper
instantiation of the operating system.

                CM-7        A Federal CKMS shall support the following hardening
PR:8.2
                 SI-3       procedures:
                              a) Non-essential software is removed from computers,
                              b) Non-essential network services are disabled,
                              c) Non-essential FCKMS services are disabled or
                                 removed,
                              d) Non-essential, removable data storage media or
                                 automatic run features on removable media are
                                 disabled,
                              e) Automatic malware checks on newly attached data-
                                 storage medium are enabled,
                              f) Non-essential network ports are disabled,
