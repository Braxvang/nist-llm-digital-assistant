NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            If feasible, disconnect modems when not in use, or consider automating
            this disconnection process by having modems disconnect after being on
            for a given amount of time. Sometimes, modem connections are part of
            the legal support service agreement with the vendor (e.g., 24/7 support
            with 15-minute response time). Personnel should be aware that
            disconnecting or removing the modems may require contracts to be
            renegotiated.
            VPNs
            VPN devices used to protect OT systems should be thoroughly tested to
            verify that the VPN technology is compatible with the application and
            that implementation of the VPN devices does not negatively impact
            network traffic characteristics.
            VPN technology can also be applied between network segments. For
            example, a remote site might have a boundary protection device on-site
            that uses a VPN to establish a secure tunnel over an untrusted network
            (e.g., the internet) to a VPN-enabled device in the main control center at
            a different location.

6.2.11.        Flaw Remediation and Patch Management
Patches are additional pieces of code that have been developed to address specific problems or
flaws in existing software. A systematic approach to managing and using software patches can
help organizations improve the overall security of their systems in a cost-effective way.
Organizations that actively manage and use software patches can reduce the chances that the
vulnerabilities in their systems can be exploited, and they can save time and money that might be
better spent responding to vulnerability-related incidents.
NIST SP 800-40, Rev. 4 [SP800-40r4] provides guidance for CIOs, CISOs, and others who are
responsible for managing organizational risk related to the use of software. This publication
frames patching as a critical component of preventive maintenance for computing technologies –
a cost of doing business and a necessary part of what organizations need to do in order to achieve
their missions. This publication also discusses common factors that affect enterprise patch
management and recommends creating an enterprise strategy to simplify and operationalize
patching while also improving risk reduction. This guidance may also be useful to business and
mission owners, security engineers and architects, system administrators, and security operations
personnel.
Supplemental guidance for flaw remediation and patch management can be found in the
following document:

       Maintenance for Technology
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Significant care should be exercised when applying patches to OS
            components. Patches should be adequately tested (e.g., offline system
            testing) to determine the acceptability of any performance impacts.
