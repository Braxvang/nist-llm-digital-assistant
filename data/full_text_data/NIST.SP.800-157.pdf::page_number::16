Special Publication 800-157                                           Guidelines for Derived PIV Credentials


3.    Technical Requirements

This section describes technical requirements related to Derived PIV Credentials and their tokens.

3.1   Certificate Policies

Derived PIV Authentication certificates shall be issued under either the id-fpki-common-pivAuth-
derived-hardware (LOA-4) or the id-fpki-common-pivAuth-derived (LOA-3) policy of the X.509
Certificate Policy for the U.S. Federal PKI Common Policy Framework [COMMON]. A Derived PIV
Credential shall be deemed to satisfy e-Authentication LOA-4 if it is issued in conformance with the id-
fpki-common-pivAuth-derived-hardware certificate policy, and e-Authentication LOA-3 if it is issued in
conformance with the id-fpki-common-pivAuth-derived certificate policy.

The Derived PIV Authentication certificate shall comply with Worksheet 10: Derived PIV Authentication
Certificate Profile in [PROF].

The expiration date of the Derived PIV Authentication certificate is based on the certificate policy of the
issuer. There is no requirement to align the expiration date of the Derived PIV Authentication certificate
with the expiration date of the PIV Authentication certificate or the expiration of the PIV Card; however,
in many cases aligning the expiration dates will simplify lifecycle management.

3.2   Cryptographic Specifications

The cryptographic algorithm and key size requirements for the Derived PIV Authentication certificate and
private key are the same as the requirements for the PIV Authentication certificate and private key, as
specified in [SP800-78].

For Derived PIV Authentication certificates issued under id-fpki-common-pivAuth-derived-hardware
(LOA-4), the Derived PIV Authentication key pair shall be generated within a hardware cryptographic
module that has been validated to [FIPS140] Level 2 or higher that provides Level 3 physical security to
protect the Derived PIV Authentication private key while in storage and that does not permit exportation
of the private key.

For Derived PIV Authentication certificates issued under id-fpki-common-pivAuth-derived (LOA-3), the
Derived PIV Authentication key pair shall be generated within a cryptographic module that has been
validated to [FIPS140] Level 1 or higher.

3.3   Cryptographic Token Types

The Derived PIV Credentials and their corresponding private keys may be used in a variety of
cryptographic tokens available for use on mobile devices. These tokens may be hardware or software-
only implementations.

Hardware tokens may either be removable or embedded within a mobile device. Three kinds of
removable hardware tokens are permitted, each with well-defined physical and logical interfaces, to
facilitate token portability between mobile devices in a manner analogous to PIV Card interchangeability.
Embedded hardware tokens are not removable from the mobile device, and may be accessed by software
using the underlying cryptographic interface of the mobile device; however, nothing here is intended to
either require or prohibit emulation of PIV Card or a removable token software interface. Similar rules
apply to embedded software tokens; nothing here is intended to either require or prohibit the emulation of
the software interfaces to PIV Cards or other removable tokens.
