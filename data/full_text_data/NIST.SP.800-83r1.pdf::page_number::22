                                 GUIDE TO MALWARE INCIDENT PREVENTION AND HANDLING FOR DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS


    ï€¼ Disinfecting files, which refers to removing malware from within a file, and quarantining files,
      which means that files containing malware are stored in isolation for future disinfection or
      examination. Disinfecting a file is generally preferable to quarantining it because the malware is
      removed and the original file restored; however, many infected files cannot be disinfected.
      Accordingly, antivirus software should be configured to attempt to disinfect infected files and to
      either quarantine or delete files that cannot be disinfected.
Organizations should use both host-based and network-based antivirus scanning. Organizations should
deploy antivirus software on all hosts for which satisfactory antivirus software is available. Antivirus
software should be installed as soon after OS installation as possible and then updated with the latest
signatures and antivirus software patches (to eliminate any known vulnerabilities in the antivirus software
itself). The antivirus software should then perform a complete scan of the host to identify any potential
infections. To support the security of the host, the antivirus software should be configured and maintained
properly so that it continues to be effective at detecting and stopping malware. Antivirus software is most
effective when its signatures are fully up-to-date. Accordingly, antivirus software should be kept current
with the latest signature and software updates to improve malware detection.

Organizations should use centrally managed antivirus software that is controlled and monitored regularly
by antivirus administrators, who are also typically responsible for acquiring, testing, approving, and
delivering antivirus signature and software updates throughout the organization. Users should not be able
to disable or delete antivirus software from their hosts, nor should they be able to alter critical settings.
Antivirus administrators should perform continuous monitoring to confirm that hosts are using current
antivirus software and that the software is configured properly. Implementing all of these
recommendations should strongly support an organization in having a strong and consistent antivirus
deployment across the organization.

A possible measure for improving malware prevention is to use multiple antivirus products for key hosts,
such as email servers. For example, one antivirus vendor might have a new signature available several
hours before another vendor, or an organization might have an operational issue with a particular
signature update. Another possibility is that an antivirus product itself might contain an exploitable
vulnerability; having an alternative product available in such cases could provide protection until the issue
with the primary product has been resolved. Because running multiple antivirus products on a single host
simultaneously is likely to cause conflicts between the products, if multiple products are used
concurrently, they should be installed on separate hosts. For example, one antivirus product could be used
on perimeter email servers and another on internal email servers. This could provide more effective
detection of new threats, but also would necessitate increased administration and training, as well as
additional hardware and software costs.

Although antivirus software has become a necessity for malware incident prevention, it is not possible for
antivirus software to stop all malware incidents. As discussed previously in this section, antivirus
software does not excel at stopping previously unknown threats. Antivirus software products detect
malware primarily by looking for certain characteristics of known instances of malware. This is highly
effective for identifying known malware, but is not so effective at detecting the highly customized,
tailored malware increasingly being used.
