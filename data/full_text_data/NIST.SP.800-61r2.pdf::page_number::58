share.47 The organization should work with its partner organizations when deciding on the data exchange
models to ensure that the standards selected are compatible with the partner organization’s incident
response systems. When selecting existing data exchange models, organizations may prefer to select
multiple models that model different aspects of the incident response domain and then leverage these
models in a modular fashion, communicating only the information needed at a specific decision point in
the life cycle. Appendix E provides a non-exhaustive list of existing standards defining data exchange
models that are applicable to the incident response domain.

In addition to selecting the data exchange models for sharing incident information, an organization must
also work with its partner organizations to agree on the technical transport mechanisms for enabling the
information exchange to occur in an automated fashion. These transport mechanisms include, at a
minimum, the transport protocol for exchanging the information, the architectural model for
communicating with an information resource, and the applicable ports and domain names for accessing an
information resource in a particular organization. For example, a group of partner organizations may
decide to exchange incident information using a Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture to
exchange IODEF/Real-Time Inter-Network Defense (RID) data over Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
(HTTPS) on port 4590 of a specific domain name within each organization’s DMZ.

4.2.3     Security Considerations

There are several security considerations that incident response teams should consider when planning
their information sharing. One is being able to designate who can see which pieces of incident
information (e.g., protection of sensitive information). It may also be necessary to perform data
sanitization or scrubbing to remove sensitive pieces of data from the incident information without
disturbing the information on precursors, indicators, and other technical information. See Section 4.3 for
more information on granular information sharing. The incident response team should also ensure that the
necessary measures are taken to protect information shared with the team by other organizations.

There are also many legal issues to consider regarding data sharing. See Section 4.1.2 for additional
information.

4.3     Granular Information Sharing

Organizations need to balance the benefits of information sharing with the drawbacks of sharing sensitive
information, ideally sharing the necessary information and only the necessary information with the
appropriate parties. Organizations can think of their incident information as being comprised of two types
of information: business impact and technical. Business impact information is often shared in the context
of a team-to-coordinating-team relationship as defined in Section 4.1.1, while technical information is
often shared within all three types of coordination relationships. This section discusses both types of
information and provides recommendations for performing granular information sharing.

4.3.1     Business Impact Information

Business impact information involves how the incident is affecting the organization in terms of mission
impact, financial impact, etc. Such information, at least at a summary level, is often reported to higher-
level coordinating incident response teams to communicate an estimate of the damage caused by the
incident. Coordinating response teams may need this impact information to make decisions regarding the

      According to the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA), “all Federal agencies and departments
      shall use technical standards that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies”. See
