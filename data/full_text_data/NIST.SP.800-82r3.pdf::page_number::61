     Risk Management for OT Systems
Organizations manage risks every day when meeting their business objectives, including
financial losses, equipment failure, and personnel safety. Organizations develop processes to
evaluate the risks associated with their business and to decide how to manage those risks based
on organizational priorities, risk tolerance, and internal and external constraints. This risk
management is an interactive ongoing process that is part of normal operations. Organizations
that use OT systems have historically managed risk through good practices in safety and
engineering. Safety assessments are well established in most sectors and often incorporated into
regulatory requirements. Information security risk management is an added dimension that can
be complementary. The risk management process and framework outlined in this section can be
applied to managing safety, information security, and cyber supply chain risk. Privacy is also a
risk consideration for some OT systems. For additional guidance on privacy risk management,
refer to the NIST Risk Management Framework [SP800-37r2] and the Privacy Framework [PF].
A risk management process is deployed throughout an organization using a three-level approach
to address risk at the (i) organization level, (ii) mission and business process level, and (iii)
system level (i.e., IT and OT). The risk management process is carried out seamlessly across the
three levels with the overall objective of continuous improvement in the organizationâ€™s risk-
related activities and effective inter-tier and intra-tier communication among all stakeholders
with a shared interest in the success of the organization.
This section focuses primarily on OT system considerations at the system level, though the risk
management activities, information, and artifacts at each level impact and inform the other
levels. Section 6 applies the Cybersecurity Framework to OT systems, while Appendix F
provides OT-specific recommendations to augment the NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 [SP800-53r5]
control families. This section also discusses OT system considerations and the impact that these
considerations have on the risk management process.
For more information on multi-tiered risk management and the risk management process, refer to
NIST SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and Information
System View [SP800-39]. NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 2, Risk Management Framework for
Information Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy
[SP800-37r2], provides guidelines for applying the Risk Management Framework to federal
information systems, including conducting the activities of security categorization, 5 security
control selection and implementation, security control assessment, information system
authorization, 6 and security control monitoring. NIST SP 800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk
Assessments [SP800-30r1], provides a step-by-step process for organizations on how to (i)
prepare for risk assessments, (ii) conduct risk assessments, (iii) communicate risk assessment
results to key organizational personnel, and (iv) maintain the risk assessments over time.

  Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199 [FIPS199] provides security categorization guidance for non-national security systems.
Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) Instruction 1253 provides similar guidance for national security systems.
6
  Security authorization is the official management decision given by a senior organizational official to authorize the operation of an information
system and explicitly accept the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the
implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls.
