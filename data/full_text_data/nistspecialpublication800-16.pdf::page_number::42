                   IT Security ABC's        — Terms and Concepts              (Continued)


    •   Keys to Incident Prevention   — Many IT    security incidents are preventable if individuals
        incorporate three basic concepts into their day-to-day activities: one, awareness - individuals
        should be aware of the value of the assets they use to do their job and the nature of associated
        threats and vulnerabilities; two, compliance - individuals should comply with established
        safeguards (e.g., scanning diskettes, changing passwords, performing backups); and three,
        common sense - if something appears too good to be true, it generally is.
    •   Laws and Regulations    — Congress has enacted a number of laws       (e.g.. Privacy Act, Computer

        Security Act, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act) that establish the basic policy structure for IT
        security in the Federal government.   These laws have been augmented with regulations and
        guidance regarding their applicability to IT systems. Private industry generally grounds its
        security policies on the impact on profitability and potential risk of lawsuits, as there are few
        specific legal requirements. The commonality between Federal and private IT security
        programs demonstrates that the objectives are the same whether the impetus was a law or the
        bottom line.

    •   Model Framework     — This document     presents a model framework for IT security training.     The
        model framework describes individual training needs relative to job function or role within the
        organization. The model recognizes that an individual's need for IT security training will
        change, both in scope and depth, relative to their organizational responsibilities.

    •   Need to Know    — Need   to Know is addressed from two perspectives: first, a need for access to
        information to do a job; and second, need to know as a driver for continued learning. In the
        first case, access to information and processes should be restricted to that which the individual

        requires to do their job. This approach minimizes the potential for unauthorized activities, and
        maximizes the potential that the individual knows and understands the nature of the threats and
        vulnerabilities associated with their use or maintenance of an IT system; and second, given the
        rate of technological change, individuals need to know the characteristics of those technologies
        so they may be better able to address specific vulnerabilities.

    •   Ownership   — Responsibility   for the security of an IT system or asset must be assigned to a
        single, identifiable entity, and to a single, senior official within that entity. This provides for
        accountability for security failures and establishment of the chain of command that authorizes
        access to and use of system assets. This concept of individual responsibility and authority is
        generally termed ownership or stewardship.      The ownership of an asset (particularly data) is
        generally retained, even when that asset is transferred to another organization. For example, tax
        data shared with other Federal and state agencies by the Internal Revenue Service must be
        secured in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code.
