Further guidance for OT maintenance tracking can be found in Section 6. Additional information
with specific examples for OT maintenance tracking are also provided in NIST IR 8183A,
Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile Low Impact Level Example Implementations
Guide [IR8183A].

3.3.8. Develop an Incident Response Capability
Organizations should establish an OT cybersecurity incident response (IR) function that should
include planning, detection, analysis, containment, and reporting activities in the case of a
cybersecurity incident. The IR function requires the establishment of several cybersecurity
capabilities, including incident management, forensic analysis, vulnerability management, and
response communication. As part of building the IR function, the OT cybersecurity department
should create an incident response plan. The purpose of the incident response capability is to
determine the scope and risk of cybersecurity incidents, respond appropriately to the incident,
communicate the incident to all stakeholders, and reduce the future impact. This plan applies to
all OT personnel, networks, systems, and data. The IR plan guides the activities of the
cybersecurity team to respond, communicate, and coordinate in the event of a cybersecurity
incident. Without such a plan, the organization will find it extremely difficult to respond when a
cybersecurity incident occurs. The plan includes the roles and responsibilities of personnel, the
incident response workflow, incident type and severity classification, contacts of critical
personnel who should be involved, contacts of external entities that may be useful in assisting
with IR, information sharing policy, and internal and external communication.
Further guidance for OT incident response can be found in Section 6.2.4.5 and Appendix C.
Additional information with specific examples for OT incident response are also provided in
NIST IR 8183A, Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile Low Impact Level Example
Implementations Guide [IR8183A].

3.3.9. Develop a Recovery and Restoration Capability
The organization should establish the capability to recover from cybersecurity incidents and to
restore the assets and services that were impaired by the cybersecurity incident to a pre-cyber-
incident state. This capability typically includes the following tasks:
   •   Define recovery objectives when recovering from disruptions. For example, the recovery
       capability shall prioritize human safety and environmental safety prior to restarting the
       OT operation that was impaired by the cybersecurity event.
   •   Develop a site disaster recovery plan (DRP) and business continuity plan (BCP) to
       prepare the OT organization to respond appropriately to significant disruptions in their
       operations due to the cybersecurity incident.
   •   Establish backup systems and processes to back up the relevant OT systems’ state, data,
       configuration files, and programs at regular intervals to support recovery to a stable state.
   •   Establish processes for restoring relevant OT systems’ state, data, configuration files, and
       programs from backups in a timely manner.
