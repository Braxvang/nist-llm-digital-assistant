removable media also need to consider how changing keys will affect access to encrypted storage on the
media and develop feasible solutions, such as retaining the previous keys in case they are needed.

Another decision that may need to be made is where the local keys should be stored. For some encryption
technologies, such as FDE and many file/folder encryption products, there are often several options for
key location, including the local hard drive, a USB flash drive, a cryptographic token, or a Trusted
Platform Module (TPM) chip. 30 Some products also permit keys to be stored on a centralized server and
retrieved automatically after the user authenticates successfully. For volume and virtual disk encryption,
the main encryption key is often stored encrypted within the volume or container itself. Some storage
encryption products do not store a key; instead, they perform a cryptographic hash function on the
password entered by the user and use that hash as the key.

Organizations need to ensure that access to keys (other than those intended to be available to others, such
as public keys) is properly restricted. Storage encryption solutions should require the use of one or more
authentication mechanisms, such as passwords, smart cards, and cryptographic tokens, to decrypt or
otherwise gain access to a storage encryption key. The keys themselves should be logically secured (e.g.,
encrypted) or physically secured (e.g., stored in a tamper-resistant cryptographic token). The
authenticators used to retrieve keys should also be secured properly.

In addition to key management, there are several other aspects of cryptography that need to be considered
when planning a storage encryption solution. Setting the cryptography policy involves choosing
encryption and integrity protection algorithms and key lengths.31 Federal agencies must use FIPS-
approved algorithms contained in validated cryptographic modules. 32 Whenever possible, AES 33 should
be used for the encryption algorithm because of its strength and speed. Several FIPS-approved algorithms
are available for integrity checking, including HMAC-SHA, Cipher-Based Message Authentication Code
(CMAC), and Counter with Cipher Block Chaining-Message Authentication Code (CCM). 34
Organizations should consider how easily the solution can be updated when stronger algorithms and key
sizes become available in the future.

4.2.2    Authentication

There are two types of authentication important to storage encryption. Administrators authenticate so that
they can perform storage encryption management functions, including reconfiguring and updating
encryption software, managing user accounts, and recovering encrypted data. 35 Users authenticate so that
they can access encrypted information. If a single authenticator is used (often a user ID and password,
sometimes a token), that authenticator typically grants the storage encryption software access to the key
used to encrypt and decrypt the stored information. If two-factor authentication is used, typically one of

     A TPM chip is a tamper-resistant integrated circuit built into some motherboards that can perform cryptographic operations
     (including key generation) and protect small amounts of sensitive information, such as passwords and cryptographic keys.
     As of this writing, no FIPS-approved TPM chips are yet available.

     guidelines for selecting, specifying, employing, and evaluating cryptographic protection mechanisms in Federal information
     systems. It defines a process for selecting cryptographic products and discusses implementation issues, including solution
     management, key management, and authentication. NIST SP 800-21 is available at
