NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                                               GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


newer than TLS 1.0. Servers that incorrectly implement TLS version negotiation shall not be
used.

3.2      Server Keys and Certificates

The TLS server shall be configured with one or more public-key certificates and the associated
private keys. TLS server implementations should support the use of multiple server certificates
with their associated private keys to support algorithm and key size agility.

Several options for TLS server certificates meet the requirement for NIST-approved
cryptography: an RSA signature certificate, an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
(ECDSA) signature certificate, a Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) 11 signature certificate, a
Diffie-Hellman (DH) certificate, and an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) certificate. At a
minimum, TLS servers conforming to this specification shall be configured with an RSA
signature certificate or an ECDSA signature certificate. The other certificate types and their
associated cipher suites are not commonly used, especially in externally-accessible servers, but
are included in these guidelines for completeness and to cover edge cases. If the server is
configured with an ECDSA signature certificate, either curve P-256 or curve P-384 should be
used for the public key in the certificate. 12

TLS servers shall be configured with certificates issued by a CA that publishes revocation
information in Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) [63] responses. The CA may
additionally publish revocation information in a certificate revocation list (CRL) [19]. The
source(s) for the revocation information shall be included in the CA-issued certificate in the
appropriate extension to promote interoperability.

A TLS server that has been issued certificates by multiple CAs can select the appropriate
certificate based on the client-specified “Trusted CA Keys” TLS extension (see Section 3.4.2.6).
A TLS server that has been issued certificates for multiple server names can select the
appropriate certificate based on the client-specified “Server Name” TLS extension (see Section
3.4.1.2). A TLS server certificate may also contain multiple names in the Subject Alternative
Name extension in order to allow the use of multiple server names of the same name form, such
as a Domain Name System (DNS) name, or multiple server names of multiple name forms (e.g.,
DNS names, IP address, etc.).

Application processes for obtaining certificates differ and require different levels of proof when
associating certificates to domains. An applicant can obtain a domain-validated (DV) certificate
by proving control over a DNS domain. An Organization Validation (OV) certificate requires
further vetting. An Extended Validation (EV) certificate has the most thorough identity vetting
process. This recommendation does not provide guidance on which verification level to use.


11 In the names for the TLS cipher suites, DSA is referred to as DSS (Digital Signature Standard) for historical reasons.

     The recommended elliptic curves now listed in FIPS 186-4 [45] will be moved to SP 800-186. Until SP 800-186 is published,
      the recommended elliptic curves should be taken from FIPS 186-4.
