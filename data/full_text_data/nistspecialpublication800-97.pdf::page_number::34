ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I




                    Figure 3-2. Conceptual View of Authentication Server in a Network

Figure 3-3 provides a simple conceptual view of IEEE 802.1X that depicts all the fundamental IEEE
802.11i components: STAs, an AP, and an AS. In this example, the STAs are the supplicants, and the AP
is the authenticator. Until successful authentication occurs between a STA and the AS, the STA’s
communications are blocked by the AP. Because the AP sits at the boundary between the wireless and
wired networks, this prevents the unauthenticated STA from reaching the wired network. The technique
used to block the communications is known as port-based access control. IEEE 802.1X can control data
flows by distinguishing between EAP and non-EAP frames, then passing EAP frames through an
uncontrolled port and non-EAP frames through a controlled port, which can block access. IEEE 802.11i
extends this to block the AP’s communication until keys are in place as well. Thus, the IEEE 802.11i
extensions prevent a rogue access point from exchanging anything but EAP traffic with the STA’s host.
