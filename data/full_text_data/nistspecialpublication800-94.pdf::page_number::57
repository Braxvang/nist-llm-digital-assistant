                                                         GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



 Sensor Range. The actual range of a sensor varies based on the surrounding facilities (e.g., walls,
  doors). Some wireless IDPS vendors offer modeling software that can analyze building floor plans
  and the attenuation characteristics of walls, doors, and other facility components to determine
  effective locations for sensors. Sensor range can also vary based on the location of people within the
  facility and other changing characteristics, so sensors should be deployed so that their ranges have
  some overlap (e.g., at least 20%).
 Wired Network Connections. The sensors typically need to be connected to the wired network. If
  there is a need to deploy sensors in an area where there is no wired network, then it might be
  necessary to extend the wired network into that area. This is generally a concern only if the
  organization wants to monitor portions of their facilities that are outside the range of the WLAN.
 Cost. Ideally, an organization could deploy sensors throughout its facilities to perform full wireless
  monitoring. However, the number of sensors needed to do so can be quite large, especially in wide-
  open campus environments. Organizations should compare WLAN threats to the cost of sensor
  purchases, deployment, and maintenance, and develop a solution that creates an acceptable level of
  risk. For example, an organization might decide to deploy fixed sensors throughout the range of the
  organization’s WLANs, and to do periodic checks of other areas using mobile sensors.
 AP and Wireless Switch Locations. If a bundled solution (e.g., wireless IDPS software on an AP)
  would meet the organization’s other requirements, then the locations of APs and wireless switches are
  particularly important because the wireless IDPS software could potentially be deployed onto those
  devices.
5.3     Security Capabilities

Wireless IDPSs provide several types of security capabilities. Because wireless IDPS is a relatively new
form of IDPS, capabilities currently vary widely among products; over time, product capabilities should
become more consistent. Sections 5.3.1 through 5.3.4 describe common security capabilities, divided into
four categories: information gathering, logging, detection, and prevention, respectively.

5.3.1     Information Gathering Capabilities

Most wireless IDPSs can collect information on wireless devices. Examples of these information
gathering capabilities are as follows:

 Identifying WLAN Devices. Most IDPS sensors can create and maintain an inventory of observed
  WLAN devices, including APs, WLAN clients, and ad hoc (peer-to-peer) clients. The inventory is
  usually based on SSIDs and the MAC addresses of the devices’ wireless network cards; the first
  portion of each MAC address identifies the vendor of the card. 36 Some sensors can also use
  fingerprinting techniques on observed traffic to verify the vendor, instead of relying on the MAC
  information (which could be spoofed). The inventory can be used as a profile to identify new WLAN
  devices and the removal of existing devices.
 Identifying WLANs. Most IDPS sensors keep track of observed WLANs, identifying them by their
  SSIDs. Administrators can then tag each entry as being an authorized WLAN, a benign neighboring
  WLAN (e.g., another organization in the same building), or a rogue WLAN. This information can be
  used to identify new WLANs, as well as to prioritize responses to identified events.

      Some STAs transmit multiple SSIDs while trying to identify previously accessed WLANs.
