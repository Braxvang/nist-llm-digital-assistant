CD distributions. If tools are directly installed onto a client system, the test team should ensure that the
tools and any files that they generate are removed from the system when testing is done.

6.5      Assessment Plan Development

An assessment plan provides structure and accountability by documenting the activities planned for an
assessment, along with other related information. NIST SP 800-53A provides additional information on
assessment plans, and addresses several distinct steps that assessors should consider in developing a plan.
These steps are: (i) determining the type of security control assessment; (ii) determining the security
controls and control enhancements to be included in the assessment; (iii) selecting the appropriate
assessment procedures to be used during the assessment based on security controls and control
enhancements in the system security plan; (iv) tailoring the selected assessment procedures for the
information system impact level and organization’s operating environment; (v) developing additional
assessment procedures, if necessary, to address other security controls and control enhancements; (vi)
developing a strategy to apply the extended assessment procedure; (vii) optimizing assessment procedures
to reduce duplication of effort and provide cost-effective assessment solutions; and (vi) finalizing the
assessment plan and obtaining the approvals needed for its execution..

Each assessment should be addressed in an assessment plan, regardless of the scope, level of
intrusiveness, or party performing the test (i.e., internal, third party). 28 This plan provides the rules and
boundaries to which assessors must adhere, and protects the organization by reducing the risk of an
incident such as accidental system disruption or the inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information.
Assessment plans also protect the test team by ensuring that the organization’s management understands
and agrees to the assessment’s scope, activities, and limitations. Development of the assessment plan
should be a collaborative process between the assessors and key members of the organization’s security
group.

The assessment plan should answer these basic questions:

       What is the scope of the assessment?
       Who is authorized to conduct the assessment?
       What are the assessment’s logistics?
       How should sensitive data be handled?
       What should occur in the event of an incident?
The assessment plan should identify which systems and networks are authorized to be examined and
tested. This can be done by providing the number of systems and the IP addresses or address ranges that
they use. The plan should also list specific systems—at a minimum by IP address and preferably also by
system name—that are not authorized to be examined or tested. For example, if an organization’s payroll
database is deemed too mission-critical for a particular type of testing, the system name and IP address
should be included in the assessment plan’s exclusion list. If the organization does not control part or all
of its network, such as having a portion of its systems housed on a third party’s network, the owner of the
other network usually must also consent in writing to the assessment plan. A similar situation involves

28
      In addition to an assessment plan, it may be useful to develop a shorter document (a one- or two-page memorandum) that
      assessors can present to parties in the organization (e.g., users or system owners) as authorization to gain access to particular
      systems. The document should describe allowable and unallowable activities, authorized and unauthorized systems, the
      acceptable level of cooperation to be provided by users, and a point of contact in the organization’s security group that users
      can contact for more information.
