      NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                                  Enrollment and Identity Proofing


483           c) The CSP sends an enrollment code to the validated phone number of the
484              applicant, the applicant provides the enrollment code to the CSP, and the CSP
485              confirms they match, verifying they the applicant is in possession and control
486              of the validated phone number.
487           d) The applicant has been successfully identity proofed and can be enrolled into
488              a subscriber account.

489   4.2. Identity Resolution
490   The goal of identity resolution is to use the smallest set of attributes to uniquely
491   distinguish an individual within a given population or context. While identity resolution
492   is the starting point in the overall identity proofing process, to include the initial detection
493   of potential fraud, it in no way represents a complete and successful identity proofing
494   transaction.

495   4.3. Identity Validation and Identity Evidence Collection
496   The goal of identity validation is to collect the most appropriate identity evidence and
497   attribute information from the applicant and determine it is authentic, accurate, current,
498   and unexpired. Identity validation is made up of three process steps: 1) collecting the
499   appropriate identity evidence; 2) confirming the evidence is authentic; and, 3) confirming
500   key data contained on the identity evidence is valid, current, and related to a real-life
501   subject.
502   Identity evidence collection supports the identity validation process and consists of two
503   steps: 1) presentation of identity evidence by the identity proofing applicant to the CSP
504   and 2) determination by the CSP that the presented evidence is acceptable. Evidence can
505   be presented as a physical document or a copy, photograph, or scan of a document, or
506   as a digital record. The characteristics for acceptable physical (documentary) identity
507   evidence are presented in Sec. 4.3.1 and the characteristics for acceptable digital evidence
508   are provided in Sec. 4.3.2.
509   The CSP SHALL determine the acceptability of presented identity evidence for identity
510   proofing based on the evidence characteristics in this section.
511   The characteristics presented in this section are intended to guide CSPs in determining
512   what is acceptable as identity evidence for the identity proofing process and are not an
513   indication of strength of evidence. Once a CSP determines a particular type of evidence is
514   acceptable, a determination must be made as to its strength, as provided in Sec. 4.3.3.

515   4.3.1. Characteristics of Acceptable Physical Evidence
516   Acceptable physical evidence SHALL contain all of the following characteristics:
