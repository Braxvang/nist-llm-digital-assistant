                   The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



1.      Introduction

1.1     Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), ―Securing Agency
Information Systems,‖ as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2     Purpose and Scope

This document provides the definitive technical specification for Version 1.1 of the Security Content
Automation Protocol (SCAP). SCAP (pronounced ess-cap) consists of a suite of specifications for
standardizing the format and nomenclature by which security software communicates information about
software flaws and security configurations. This document defines requirements for creating and
processing SCAP content. These requirements build on the requirements defined within the individual
SCAP component specifications. Each new requirement pertains either to using multiple component
specifications together or to further constraining one of the individual component specifications. The
requirements within the individual component specifications are not repeated in this document; see those
specifications to access their requirements.

The scope of this document is limited to SCAP Version 1.1. Other versions of SCAP and its component
specifications, including emerging specifications, are not addressed here. Future versions of SCAP will be
defined in distinct revisions of this document, each clearly labeled with a document revision number and
the appropriate SCAP version number. SCAP revisions are managed through a coordinated process
defined within the SCAP Release Cycle.6 The release cycle workflow manages changes related to SCAP
specifications and validation processes including the addition of new specifications or updates to existing
specifications. This process encourages community involvement, promotes transparency and awareness
regarding proposed changes, and affords ample lead-time to prepare for pending changes.
