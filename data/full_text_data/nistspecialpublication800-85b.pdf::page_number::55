Special Publication 800-85B                                PIV Data Model Testing Specification


Test Scenario             1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                          2. Set OID := <<Security Object
                              (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.144.0)>>
                          3. Call pivGetData w/
                              • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                          4. Read and parse the byte array in accordance with BER-TLV
                              format.
                          5. Parse the tag 0xBA to extract the Data Groups to Container
                              ID mapping instances.
                          6. Verify that the PIV data containers exist on the card by
                          selecting each container.
Expected Result(s)        1. From Step 4: The size of the byte array does not exceed 1008 bytes.
                          2. From Step 4: All mandatory tags in “Security Object” table are
                             present.
                          3. From Step 5: Verify that all data containers found in the mapping are
                             actually present in the card by performing a select on each container
                             (with appropriate authorization) and expecting ’90 00’ in all cases.
