Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of most information associated with
scientific and technical research and innovation can be seriously disruptive to the progress of
research activities. The effects on future funding can be quite serious and can have a serious
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Unauthorized modification
or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic
mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to
the mission would usually be more limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
scientific and technical research and innovation information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to scientific and technical research and
innovation information. Most research processes are tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption
of access to research and innovation information can be expected to have only a limited adverse
effect on government operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
scientific and technical research and innovation information is low.

D.19.2 Space Exploration and Innovation Information Type

Space Exploration and Innovation includes all activities devoted to innovations directed at
human and robotic space flight and the development and operation of space launch and
transportation systems, and the general research and exploration of outer space. While some
space exploration and innovation is national security information, most sensitive information is
developed under research and development programs that directly support another of the mission
areas described in this Appendix and are not included here. The recommended provisional
categorization of the research and development information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of space exploration and
innovation information on the ability of responsible agencies to conduct activities devoted to [1]
innovations directed at human and robotic space flight and the development and operation of
space launch and transportation systems, and [2] the general research and exploration of outer
space. Many space exploration and innovation activities are conducted with public institutions
of higher learning, and the findings resulting from those activities are intended for publication.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The pre-publication disclosure or
other unauthorized disclosure of information associated with competition for funding and
