                      TABLE E-2: REPRESENTATIVE EXAMPLES â€“ ADVERSARIAL THREAT EVENTS


                    Threat Events                                                                 Description
                 (Characterized by TTPs)

                                                 Perform reconnaissance and gather information.
 Perform perimeter network reconnaissance/scanning.           Adversary uses commercial or free software to scan organizational perimeters to
                                                              obtain a better understanding of the information technology infrastructure and
                                                              improve the ability to launch successful attacks.
 Perform network sniffing of exposed networks.                Adversary with access to exposed wired or wireless data channels used to transmit
                                                              information, uses network sniffing to identify components, resources, and
                                                              protections.
 Gather information using open source discovery of            Adversary mines publically accessible information to gather information about
 organizational information.                                  organizational information systems, business processes, users or personnel, or
                                                              external relationships that the adversary can subsequently employ in support of an
                                                              attack.
 Perform reconnaissance and surveillance of targeted          Adversary uses various means (e.g., scanning, physical observation) over time to
 organizations.                                               examine and assess organizations and ascertain points of vulnerability.
 Perform malware-directed internal reconnaissance.            Adversary uses malware installed inside the organizational perimeter to identify
                                                              targets of opportunity. Because the scanning, probing, or observation does not cross
                                                              the perimeter, it is not detected by externally placed intrusion detection systems.
                                                            Craft or create attack tools.
 Craft phishing attacks.                                      Adversary counterfeits communications from a legitimate/trustworthy source to
                                                              acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or SSNs. Typical
                                                              attacks occur via email, instant messaging, or comparable means; commonly
                                                              directing users to websites that appear to be legitimate sites, while actually stealing
                                                              the entered information.
 Craft spear phishing attacks.                                Adversary employs phishing attacks targeted at high value targets (e.g., senior
                                                              leaders/executives).
 Craft attacks specifically based on deployed information     Adversary develops attacks (e.g., crafts targeted malware) that take advantage of
 technology environment.                                      adversary knowledge of the organizational information technology environment.
 Create counterfeit/spoof website.                            Adversary creates duplicates of legitimate websites; when users visit a counterfeit
                                                              site, the site can gather information or download malware.
 Craft counterfeit certificates.                              Adversary counterfeits or compromises a certificate authority, so that malware or
                                                              connections will appear legitimate.
 Create and operate false front organizations to inject       Adversary creates false front organizations with the appearance of legitimate
 malicious components into the supply chain.                  suppliers in the critical life-cycle path that then inject corrupted/malicious information
                                                              system components into the organizational supply chain.
                                                    Deliver/insert/install malicious capabilities.
 Deliver known malware to internal organizational             Adversary uses common delivery mechanisms (e.g., email) to install/insert known
 information systems (e.g., virus via email).                 malware (e. g., malware whose existence is known) into organizational information
                                                              systems.
 Deliver modified malware to internal organizational          Adversary uses more sophisticated delivery mechanisms than email (e.g., web
 information systems.                                         traffic, instant messaging, FTP) to deliver malware and possibly modifications of
                                                              known malware to gain access to internal organizational information systems.
 Deliver targeted malware for control of internal systems     Adversary installs malware that is specifically designed to take control of internal
 and exfiltration of data.                                    organizational information systems, identify sensitive information, exfiltrate the
                                                              information back to adversary, and conceal these actions.
 Deliver malware by providing removable media.                Adversary places removable media (e.g., flash drives) containing malware in
                                                              locations external to organizational physical perimeters but where employees are
                                                              likely to find the media (e.g., facilities parking lots, exhibits at conferences attended
                                                              by employees) and use it on organizational information systems.
