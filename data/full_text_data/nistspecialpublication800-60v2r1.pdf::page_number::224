Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of criminal incarceration
information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide housing, custody, and general care
for criminals sentenced to serve time in a Federal penitentiary. The consequences of
unauthorized disclosure of most criminal incarceration information are unlikely to have a serious
adverse effect on agency operations. The most serious adverse effects are likely to involve
exposure of information that is proprietary to prisoners that can result in damaging publicity for
an organization. (Unauthorized disclosure of some information can conceivably have serious
impact on the status or resolution of appeal actions). The consequences of unauthorized
disclosures may have an adverse effect on public confidence in the agency.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most criminal incarceration information is normally low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of criminal incarceration information
can be serious if the information is time-critical and results in the premature release of a
criminal, unjust retention of an individual in the prison system, or harm to a citizenâ€™s reputation
or public confidence in the government.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In some cases (e.g., instructions regarding
a need to isolate a prisoner from the general prison population for personal safety reasons), the
unauthorized modification or destruction of criminal incarceration information can result in loss
of human life a high impact potential.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
criminal incarceration information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to criminal incarceration information.
Criminal incarceration processes are usually tolerant of reasonable delays.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: There may be cases (e.g. emergency
bulletins affecting prisoner health and/or safety) in which emergency dissemination of
information regarding life-threatening situations is delayed for excessive periods. Such cases
can result in a high availability impact level.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
criminal incarceration information is low.
