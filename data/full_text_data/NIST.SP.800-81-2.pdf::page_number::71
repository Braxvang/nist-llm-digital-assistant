                                                      SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



•   Checklist item 10: After the key string is copied to the key file in the name server, the two files
    generated by the dnssec-keygen program should either be made accessible only to the server
    administrator account (e.g., root in Unix) or, better still, deleted. The paper copy of these files
    also should be destroyed.

•   Checklist item 11: The key file should be securely transmitted across the network to name
    servers that will be communicating with the name server that generated the key.

•   Checklist item 12: The statement in the configuration file (usually found at /etc/named.conf for
    BIND running on Unix) that describes a TSIG key (key name (ID), signing algorithm, and key
    string) should not directly contain the key string. When the key string is found in the
    configuration file, the risk of key compromise is increased in some environments where there is a
    need to make the configuration file readable by people other than the zone administrator. Instead,
    the key string should be defined in a separate key file and referenced through an include directive
    in the key statement of the configuration file. Every TSIG key should have a separate key file.

•   Checklist item 13: The key file should be owned by the account under which the name server
    software is run. The permission bits should be set so that the key file can be read or modified only
    by the account that runs the name server software.

•   Checklist item 14: The TSIG key used to sign messages between a pair of servers should be
    specified in the server statement of both transacting servers to point to each other. This is
    necessary to ensure that both the request message and the transaction message of a particular
    transaction are signed and hence secured.
