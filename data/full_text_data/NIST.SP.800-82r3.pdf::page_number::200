           bring the pipeline system back online. The U.S. Government was able to recover some of
           the ransom payment. 23
     •     [M][I] Ransomware targeting healthcare. 24 A string of malware delivered via phishing
           attacks targeted the healthcare and public health sectors to disrupt services and steal data.
           In fall 2020, a CISA Alert (AA20-302A) was issued to warn healthcare and public health
           sector companies of the prevalence of these attacks.

C.3.2. Structural Events
     •     [N][D] Bellingham, Washington, gasoline pipeline failure. 25 In June 1999, 237,000
           gallons of gasoline leaked from a 16-inch pipeline and ignited 1.5 hours later, causing
           three deaths, eight injuries, and extensive property damage. The pipeline failure was
           exacerbated by control systems that were unable to perform control and monitoring
           functions. Immediately prior to and during the incident, the SCADA system exhibited
           poor performance that inhibited the pipeline controllers from seeing and reacting to the
           development of an abnormal pipeline operation. A key recommendation from the NTSB
           report issued in October 2002 was to utilize an offline development and testing system
           for implementing and testing changes to the SCADA database.
     •     [M][I] CSX train signaling system. 26 In August 2003, the Sobig computer virus was
           blamed for shutting down train signaling systems throughout the East Coast of the U.S.
           The virus infected the computer system at CSX Corp.’s Jacksonville, Florida,
           headquarters and shut down signaling, dispatching, and other systems. According to
           Amtrak spokesman Dan Stessel, 10 Amtrak trains were affected in the morning. Trains
           between Pittsburgh, PA, and Florence, South Carolina, were halted because of dark
           signals, and one regional Amtrak train from Richmond, Virginia, to Washington and New
           York was delayed for more than two hours. Long-distance trains were also delayed
           between four and six hours.
     •     [N][D] Browns Ferry-3 PLC failure. 27 In August 2006, TVA was forced to manually
           shut down one of their plant’s two reactors after unresponsive PLCs problems caused two
           water pumps to fail and threatened the stability of the plant itself. Although there were
           dual redundant PLCs, they were connected to the same Ethernet network. Later testing on
           the failed devices discovered that they would crash when they encountered excessive
           network traffic.
