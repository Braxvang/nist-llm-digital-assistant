       Tabular data may also be used to create a synthetic dataset that preserves some infer-
       ence validity but does not have a one-to-one correspondence to the original dataset.
    • Dates and times require special attention when de-identifying because temporal in-
      formation is inherently linked to an external dataset: the natural progression of time.
      Some dates and times (e.g., February 22, 1732) are highly identifying, while others
      are not. Dates that refer to matters of public record (e.g., date of birth, death, or home
      purchase) should be routinely taken as having high re-identifcation potential. Dates
      may also form the basis of linkages between dataset records or even within a record.
      For example, a record may contain the date of admission, the date of discharge, and
      the number of days in residence. Thus, care should be taken when de-identifying
      dates to locate and properly handle potential linkages and relationships. Applying
      different techniques to different felds may result in information being left in a dataset
      that can be used for re-identifcation. Specifc issues regarding date de-identifcation
      are discussed in Sec. 4.3.4, “De-Identifying Dates”[.]
    • Geographic and map data also require special attention when de-identifying, as
      some locations can be highly identifying, other locations are not identifying at all,
      and some locations are only identifying at specifc times. As with dates and times, de-
      identifying geographic locations is challenging because locations inherently link to
      an external reality, and some locations during specifc time periods are highly corre-
      lated with specifc individuals (e.g., 38.8977° N, 77.0365° W). Identifying locations
      can be de-identifed through the use of perturbation or generalization. The effec-
      tiveness of such de-identifcation techniques for protecting privacy in the presence of
      external information has not been well-characterized [66, p. 37][143]. Specifc issues
      regarding geographical de-identifcation are discussed in Sec. 4.3.5, “De-Identifying
      Geographical Locations and Geolocation Data.”
    • Unstructured text may contain direct identifers, such as a person’s name, or may
      contain additional information that can serve as a quasi-identifer. Finding such iden-
      tifers invariably requires domain-specifc knowledge [66, p. 30]. Note that unstruc-
      tured text may be present in tabular datasets and require special attention.29
    • Photos and video may contain identifying information, such as printed names (e.g.,
      name tags), as well as metadata in the fle format. A range of biometric techniques
      also exists for matching photos of individuals against a dataset of photos and identi-
      fers [66, p. 32].
    • Medical imagery poses additional problems over photographs and video due to the
      presence of technical, medically-specifc information. For example, identifying in-
      formation may be present in the image itself (e.g., a photo may show an identifying

 a larger structured dataset, see Andrew Peterson’s article, “Why the names of six people who complained
 of sexual assault were published online by Dallas police” [128].
