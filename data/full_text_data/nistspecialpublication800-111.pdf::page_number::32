                                            GUIDE TO STORAGE ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES FOR END USER DEVICES



 Ensure that the OS is secured properly, including that it is fully patched and that other necessary
  security controls, such as antivirus software, are installed and configured properly. If the OS is not
  secured properly, the device is more likely to be compromised, which could weaken the protection
  provided by the storage encryption solution.

 Scan the device for malware and either remove any malware that is detected or rebuild the device.

4.4   Deploy the Solution

Once testing is complete and any issues have been resolved, the next phase of the planning and
implementation model involves deploying the solution. A prudent strategy is to gradually migrate
devices and users to the new solution. The phased deployment provides administrators an opportunity to
evaluate the impact of the solution and resolve issues prior to enterprise-wide deployment. It also
provides time for the IT staff (e.g., system administrators, help desk) and users to be trained.

Most of the issues that can occur during deployment are the same types of issues that occur during any
large IT deployment. In addition to potential problems described earlier in this publication, another
typical issue is that storage encryption technologies might not work properly on some devices because of
incompatibilities with particular hardware configurations.

4.5   Manage the Solution

The last phase of the planning and implementation model is the longest lasting. Managing the solution
involves operating the deployed solution and maintaining the security storage architecture, policies,
software, and other solution components. Examples of typical actions are as follows:

 Testing and applying patches to storage encryption software. It is beneficial to have at least one host
  (one for each type of platform) that is used strictly for testing updates. This can help to identify
  possible conflicts between an update and the normal functions of devices. Software updates should
  be tested and deployed using the same practices that would be used for updating any other major
  security controls, such as antivirus software.

 Deploying storage encryption technologies to additional types of devices

 Configuring additional devices to use the technologies

 Performing key management duties (e.g., issuing new credentials, revoking credentials for
  compromised systems or departing users)

 Performing recovery actions (e.g., regaining access to encrypted data when the authenticator has been
  lost or the storage media has been damaged)

 Adapting the policies as requirements change. An example is switching to a stronger encryption
  algorithm or increasing the key size.

 Monitoring the storage encryption components for operational and security issues

 Periodically performing testing to verify that storage encryption is functioning properly

 Performing regular vulnerability assessments
