before the start of the exercise. This is particularly important if participants and teams work within
different operational areas of the organization. Participants are usually not seated with their teammates to
encourage independent thought processes and provide exposure to other operational areas. A copy of the
participant guide should be placed with each name tent. 15

At the start of the exercise, the facilitator welcomes the participants to the event and request that the
participants introduce themselves by name and give a general description of their roles within the
organization. The facilitator then projects the briefing and discusses the scope of the exercise and
logistics information. The facilitator then walks participants through the scenario and kicks off the
discussion with one of the discussion questions documented in the facilitator guide, designed to prompt
decision-making or coordination among participants. 16 Following the kickoff, the discussion occurs
naturally among participants based on the scenario and the objectives. The facilitator may inject periodic
questions from the facilitator guide. If the discussion does not occur naturally, the facilitator should
prompt discussion by asking additional questions from the facilitator guide until all objectives are met.
During the course of the exercise, the data collector should record observations to be included in the after
action report.

Immediately following the facilitated discussion, the facilitator and data collector should conduct an
exercise debrief, often referred to as a hotwash. During the debrief, the facilitator asks participants in
which areas they felt they excelled, in which areas they could use additional training, and which areas of
the plan should be updated.

4.5      Evaluate the Tabletop Exercise

The comments that surface during the debrief, along with lessons learned documented by the data
collector during the exercise, should be captured in the after action report. The introduction to the after
action report should describe background information about the exercise such as purpose, objectives,
participants, and the scenario. The after action report should also contain documented observations made
by the facilitator and data collector during the exercise and recommendations for enhancing the IT plan
that was exercised.

Following the development of the after action report, the plan coordinator might assign action items to
select personnel to update the IT plan being exercised. The plan coordinator should then update the plan,
if appropriate, by implementing recommendations made in the after action report. It may also be
necessary to brief certain managers on the results of the exercise, update other security-related documents,
and perform other actions based on the exercise.

4.6      Summary

Tabletop exercises are discussion-based events where personnel with roles and responsibilities in a
particular IT plan meet in a classroom setting or in breakout groups to discuss their roles during an
emergency and their responses to a particular emergency situation. Tabletop exercises are conducted in
an informal environment, with a facilitator guiding participants through a discussion designed to meet

      Although participants typically receive the participant guides the day of the exercise, the exercise design team may elect to
      deliver copies of the guide to participants in advance to provide them the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the
      exercise topic. If the guides are sent in advance, it is often most effective to do so approximately one week before the
      exercise. If they are sent too far in advance, the content may be forgotten. If the guides are sent too close to the event,
      participants might not have an opportunity to read them.

      If the tabletop exercise is combined with a training event, the trainer begins the session by providing participants with an
      overview of the plan and their individual and team roles and responsibilities within the plan. The facilitator then administers
      hands-on activities before the scenario discussion that prompt participants to work though problems and identify solutions in
      a discussion-based, team environment.
