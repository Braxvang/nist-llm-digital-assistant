information might jeopardize the success of future trade law enforcement processes. The
subsequent threat to agency image or reputation can cause a serious adverse effect on an
agencyâ€™s mission capability. Where information includes names of informants, informant
contacts, or agency personnel, the effectiveness of those personnel in future enforcement
activities can be permanently impaired, or their lives threatened.

Intelligence information falls under national security systems. National security information and
national security systems are outside the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most trade law enforcement information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of trade law enforcement information
may depend on whether the information is time-critical. The compromise of trade law
enforcement information can be serious or, in some cases, catastrophic if the information is time-
critical. Also, the results of trade law enforcement activities may become matters of public
record, and thus must be accurately recorded.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of information affecting trade law enforcement information may adversely affect mission
operations and result in unacceptable consequences such as loss of human life. The compromise
of trade law enforcement information can be serious or catastrophic if the information is time-
critical. This can result in assignment of a high impact level to such information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most trade law enforcement information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to trade law enforcement information.
The effects of disruption of access to trade law enforcement information or information systems
can be serious or, in some cases, catastrophic if the information is time-critical. Trade law
enforcement missions are typically intolerant of significant time delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
most trade law enforcement information is moderate.
