APPENDIX H

IMPACT
EFFECTS OF THREAT EVENTS ON ORGANIZATIONS, INDIVIDUALS, AND THE NATION




T       his appendix provides: (i) a description of useful inputs to the impact determination task;
        (ii) representative examples of adverse impacts to organizational operations and assets,
        individuals, other organizations, or the Nation; (iii) exemplary assessment scales for
assessing the impact of threat events and the range of effect of threat events; and (iv) a template
for summarizing and documenting the results of the impact determination Task 2-5. The
assessment scales in this appendix can be used as a starting point with appropriate tailoring to
adjust for any organization-specific conditions. Table H-4, an output from Task 2-5, provides
relevant inputs to the risk tables in Appendix I.
