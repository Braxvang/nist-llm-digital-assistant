INFORMATIVE NOTE              NIST's MINEX IV program implements this test [MINEX-IV] – see Annex A.6.

5.7.4         Minimum accuracy specification

5.7.4.1       Specification
To support operational authentication of PIV Card templates against live samples, a template generator and matcher-
pair shall be certified if
1.     it meets all the interoperability criteria of sections 4.5.2.1 and 4.5.2.2, and
2.     it matches single-finger native templates with FNMR less than or equal to 0.02 when the FMR is at or below
       0.0001. The word native here means that all templates originate from one template generator and the provider
       of the template generation algorithm is the same as that of the comparison algorithm. Native mode operation
       will occur within an Agency that procures its template generation and matching equipment from the same
       provider.

5.7.4.2       Test method
The performance specifications shall be tested according to the test defined by Annex A.
INFORMATIVE NOTE              NIST's MINEX IV program implements this test [MINEX-IV] – see Section A.6.

5.7.5         Performance specifications for PIV operations
On-card comparison authentication implementations shall be configured according to the specifications of Section 10.

5.8       Fingerprint capture
On-card comparison shall be implemented using the fingerprint sensors specified in Section 4.7.

5.9       On-card comparison interface
[FIPS] establishes requirements on interfaces to OCC implementations.
