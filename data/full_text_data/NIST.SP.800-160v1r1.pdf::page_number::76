NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                            Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

stakeholder
Individual or organization having a right, share, claim, or interest in a system or in its possession of characteristics
that meet their needs and expectations. [4]

stakeholder (system)
Individual, team, organization, or classes thereof having an interest in a system. [71]

strength of function
Criterion expressing the minimum efforts assumed necessary to defeat the specified security behavior of an
implemented security function by directly attacking its underlying security mechanisms.
         Note 1: Strength of function has a prerequisite that assumes that the underlying security mechanisms are
         correctly implemented. The concept of strength of function may be equally applied to services or other
         capability-based abstraction provided by security mechanisms.
         Note 2: The term robustness combines the concepts of assurance of correct implementation with strength of
         function to provide finer granularity in determining the trustworthiness of a system.

susceptibility
The inability to avoid adversity.

supplier
Organization or an individual that enters into an agreement with the acquirer for the supply of a product or service.
[4]
         Note 1: Other terms commonly used for supplier are contractor, producer, seller, or vendor.
         Note 2: The acquirer and the supplier are sometimes part of the same organization.

system
An arrangement of parts or elements that together exhibit behavior or meaning that the individual constituents do
not. Systems can be physical or conceptual, or a combination of both. [3] [4]
         Note 1: A system is sometimes considered as a product or as the services that it provides.
         Note 2: In practice, the interpretation of its meaning is frequently clarified by the use of an associative noun
         (e.g., aircraft system). Alternatively, the word “system” is substituted simply by a context-dependent
         synonym (e.g., aircraft), though this potentially obscures a system principles perspective.
         Note 3: A complete system includes all associated equipment, facilities, material, computer programs,
         services, firmware, technical documentation, and personnel required for operations and support to the
         degree necessary for self-sufficient use in its intended environment.

system element
Member of a set of elements that constitute a system. [4]
         Note: A system element is a discrete part of a system that can be implemented to fulfill specified
         requirements.

system of interest
System whose life cycle is under consideration. [4]

system of systems
System of interest whose system elements are themselves systems; typically, these entail large-scale
interdisciplinary problems with multiple, heterogeneous, distributed systems. [15]
Set of systems or system elements that interact to provide a unique capability that none of the constituent systems
can accomplish on its own. [88]

system context
The specific system elements, boundaries, interconnections, interactions, and operational environment that define a
system.
