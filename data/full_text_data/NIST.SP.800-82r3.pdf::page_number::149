NIST SP 800-82r3                                              Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            versions of a particular antivirus tool and provide associated installation
            and configuration documentation.
            Generally:
                   •   General-purpose Windows, Unix, and Linux systems that are
                       used as engineering workstations, data historians, maintenance
                       laptops, and backup servers can be secured like commercial IT
                       equipment by installing push or auto-updated antivirus software
                       with updates distributed via an antivirus server located inside the
                       process control network. Follow organization-developed
                       procedures for transferring the latest updates from known vendor
                       sites to the OT antivirus servers and other OT computers and
                       servers.
                   •   Follow vendor recommendations on all other servers and
                       computers (e.g., DCS, PLC, instruments) that have time-
                       dependent code, modified or extended OSs, or any other change
                       that makes them different from a standard PC. Test the antivirus
                       software and updates on an offline system if possible (e.g., install
                       on a backup HMI and validate that performance is not degraded
                       before applying to the primary HMI).
            According to NIST SP 1058 [SP1058], antivirus software may
            negatively impact the time-critical control processes of an ICS. The SP
            also identified significant CPU usage when running manual scans and
            signature updates, which could have negative impacts on OT computers
            and servers. As a result:
                   •   Configuration of the antivirus software should be tested on an
                       offline system, if possible.
                   •   Manual scanning and signature updates should be performed
                       while the system is not critical for operations.
                   •   Redundancy should be considered for critical systems that require
                       ongoing antivirus updates such that signature updates can be
                       performed without impacting operations (e.g., consoles and
                       HMIs).
                   •   When configuring file exclusion lists, determine which control
                       application files should not be scanned during production time
                       because of possible OT system malfunction or performance
                       degradation.
            CISA provides a recommended practice for updating antivirus in OT
            environments.
