    • If the selected transformations fail to remove identifying information, then the
      risk of de-identifcation could be higher than intended. Agencies should select trans-
      formations with well-understood properties and a history of successful use.
    • If the de-identifed dataset does not produce accurate results for its intended use,
      then it may not satisfy the goals of the data release. Future data custodians may be
      forced to oversee additional data releases, and those future releases might be com-
      bined with the already released datasets in unforeseen ways. Agencies should under-
      stand how the de-identifed data will be used and make sure to carefully evaluate its
      utility for those purposes before releasing it.

4.3.13.    Post-Release Monitoring
Following the release of a de-identifed dataset, the releasing agency should monitor it
to ensure that the assumptions made during the de-identifcation remain valid. This is
because – absent the destruction of historical data – the identifability of a dataset can
increase over time. For example, the de-identifed dataset may contain information that can
be linked to an internal dataset that is later the subject of a data breach. In such a situation,
the data breach could also result in the re-identifcation of the de-identifed dataset. The
de-identifed dataset might also be linked to an external dataset released by a completely
separate organization. Agencies have no control over the release of such datasets, and even
monitoring may be challenging in this situation. In some cases, the de-identifed dataset
might be linked with privately held data, making monitoring impossible.
Agencies should develop an action plan that specifes what the agency should do if post-
release monitoring suggests the possibility of unwanted re-identifcation. For example,
agencies may wish to use this information as grounds to determine the new probability of
re-identifcation ( Sec. 3.2.1) as a result of the new public information. Based on the results
of such research, agencies may wish to revise their policies or even notify the public.
Agencies may wish to make releasing units responsible for post-release monitoring or to
centralize the post-release monitoring in a single location. However, proper post-release
monitoring requires knowledge of the datasets that have been released and the kinds of data
that would allow for a re-identifcation attack. These requirements are likely to increase
costs to organizations that wish to delegate post-release monitoring to other organizations
or third parties. One way to decrease the requirement for post-release monitoring is to
perform the de-identifcation using a privacy model that does not make assumptions about
the background information available to the data intruder.

4.4.   Synthetic Data
An alternative to de-identifying using the technique presented in the previous section is to
use the original dataset to create a synthetic dataset [46, p. 8].
Synthetic data can be created using two approaches:

                                               61
