                                             Protected ciphersuite negotiation refers to the negotiation of a cryptographic

                                             conversation. This claim does not refer to the ciphersuite used to protect

                                             subsequent data traffic.
 Packet                                      Packet fragmentation and reassembly enables an EAP method to handle

 and reassembly                              1020 octets. 66
                                             Confidentiality refers to encryption of EAP messages, including EAP
 Confidentiality        Recommended          Requests and Responses, success and failure result indications, and user
                                             identities.
                                             Channel binding can be used to ensure that the authenticator, when in pass-
                                             through mode, is validated and not impersonated. One way of achieving this
 Channel                                     is using media access control (MAC) addresses or other endpoint identifiers
                        Optional
 binding                                     as inputs to the key generation process, which helps ensure that entities
                                             other than the endpoints in the EAP conversation do not participate in that
                                             conversation.
                                             Fast reconnect refers to the ability of an EAP method to refresh a previously

                                             the initial association. 67


In the context of an IEEE 802.11 RSN, man-in-the-middle attack resistance can be among the most
difficult of the claims to establish. In a typical configuration, the AP resides between the STA and AS,
and the AS authenticates the AP, using the RADIUS shared secret, during the EAP exchange. An
authorized and weakly authenticated man-in-the-middle exists under normal operating conditions. In this
environment, an attacker can easily defeat weak authentication methods by setting up a rogue AP.
Therefore, it is critical that appropriate EAP methods be selected to eliminate this risk. As Section 6.1.2
explains, the EAP methods defined in RFC 3748 are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Section
6.1.3 discusses EAP methods that can eliminate the risk of such attacks if implemented properly.

6.1.2      RFC 3748-Defined EAP Methods

RFC 3748 establishes how EAP functions and also defines the following three EAP methods, which are
described later in this section:

        MD5-Challenge
        One-Time Password (OTP)
        Generic Token Card (GTC).
Other IETF RFCs and Internet-Drafts define additional EAP methods. RFC 3748 requires that all EAP
implementations support the MD5-Challenge method; support for the other two methods is optional.
None of the RFC 3748 methods can meet any of the WLAN-required security claims. In some cases,
however, the RFC 3748 methods are tunneled within the TLS methods discussed in Section 6.1.3.

66
       Packet fragmentation and reassembly services ensure proper functioning of the authentication transaction. Failure to support
       this claim might enable an adversary to exploit unintended behavior resulting from large packets, which could include
       bypassing authentication protections or causing a denial of service.
67
       The fast reconnect feature improves functionality, not security. Therefore, this claim is considered optional from a security
       perspective. Nevertheless, organizations that expect their users to change associations frequently may have a strong
       preference for EAP methods that can make this claim.
