Practical Combinatorial Testing

number of random tests. Although ACTS pairwise tests
provide better 3-way coverage than the random tests, at other          A less optimal (by
interaction strengths and values of t, the random tests are            size) array may
roughly the same or slightly better in combination coverage            provide better
than ACTS.         Recall from Section 7.1 that pairwise               failure detection
combinatorial tests detected slightly fewer events than the            because it
equivalent number of random tests. One possible explanation
                                                                       includes more
may be that the superior 4-way and 5-way coverage of the
random tests allowed detection of more events. Almost                  interactions at
paradoxically, an algorithm that produces a larger, sub-optimal        t+1, t+2, etc.
covering array may provide better failure detection because the
larger array is statistically more likely to include t+1, t+2, and higher degree interaction
tests as a byproduct of the test generation. Again, however, the less optimal covering array
is likely to more closely resemble the random test suite in failure detection.

    Note also that the number of failures in the SUT can affect the degree to which random
testing approaches combinatorial testing effectiveness. For example, suppose the random
test set covers 99% of combinations for 4-way interactions, and the SUT contains only one
4-way interaction failure. Then there is a 99% probability that the random tests will
contain the 4-way interaction that triggers this failure. However, if the SUT contains m
independent failures, then the probability that combinations for all m failures are included
in the random test set is .99m. Hence with multiple failures, random testing may be
significantly less effective, as its probability of detecting all failures will be cm, for c =
percent coverage and m = number of failures.
