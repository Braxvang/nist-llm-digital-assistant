B.5 Security Planning – Summary of FAQs
Q. Are specific system security plans for minor applications required?
Q. What are “Rules of Behavior”?
Q. What should be considered when selecting the initial set of security controls?
Q. Can an agency tailor their security control baseline?
Q. After the information system security plan is developed, what is the next step?

Q. Are specific system security plans for minor applications required?
A. No. Specific system security plans for minor applications 89 are not required
   because the security controls for those applications are typically provided by the
   general support system (GSS) or major application (MA) in which they operate.
   In those cases where the minor application is not connected to an MA or GSS, the
   minor application should be briefly described in a GSS plan that has either a
   common physical location or is supported by the same organization.

Q. What are “Rules of Behavior”?
A. The rules should state the consequences of inconsistent behavior or
   noncompliance and identify the formal method used by the organization to
   document the user’s understanding of the rules and associated consequences.
   The rules of behavior should be made available to all users before they receive
   authorization for access to the system.

Q. What should be considered when selecting the initial set of security
   controls?
A. The FIPS 199 impact levels must be considered when the system boundaries are
   drawn and when selecting the initial set of security controls (i.e., control
   baseline). The baseline security controls can then be tailored based on an
   assessment of risk and local conditions including organization-specific security
   requirements, specific threat information, cost-benefit analyses, the availability of
   compensating controls, or special circumstances.

Q. Can an agency tailor their security control baseline?
A. Yes. An agency has the flexibility to tailor the security control baseline in
   accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the standard. Tailoring
   activities include (1) the application of scoping guidance, (2) the specification of
   compensating controls, and (3) the specification of agency-defined parameters in
   the security controls, where allowed. The system security plan should document
   all tailoring activities.
Q. After the information system security plan is developed, what is the next
   step?
A. Once the information system security plan is developed, it is important to
   periodically assess the plan; review any change in system status, functionality,
   design, etc.; and ensure that the plan continues to reflect the correct information
   about the system. This documentation and its accuracy are critical for system
   certification activity. All plans should be reviewed and updated, if appropriate, at
   least annually.

89
     NIST SP 800-37 defines a minor application as an application, other than a major application, that
     requires attention to security due to the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or
     unauthorized access to or modification of the information in the application. Minor applications are
     typically included as part of a GSS.
