E1. The “arf-rel” namespace is updated to the correct namespace as specified in the ARF
    specification.

Date: November 29, 2011                              Type: Technical                                 Location: P. 5, Table 1

Description:
The “arf-rel” namespace is specified incorrectly in Table 1. Therefore, the “arf-rel” namespace is updated
to the correct namespace as specified in the ARF specification (NIST IR 7694, Section 6.1). This
correction is also applicable to the sample document located in NIST IR 7694, Appendix D. The line
<core:relationships xmlns:arfvocab="http://scap.nist.gov/vocabulary/arf/relationships/1.0#">

should be
<core:relationships xmlns:arfvocab=" http://scap.nist.gov/specifications/arf/vocabulary/relationships/1.0#">

In addition, the same correction is made to the schematron rules in the ARF XML schema located at
http://scap.nist.gov/schema/asset-reporting-format/1.1/asset-reporting-format_1.1.0.xsd. The line
<sch:let name="arf-namespace" value="string('http://scap.nist.gov/vocabulary/arf/relationships/1.0#')"/>

should be
<sch:let name="arf-namespace" value="string('http://scap.nist.gov/specifications/arf/vocabulary/relationships/1.0#')"/>
