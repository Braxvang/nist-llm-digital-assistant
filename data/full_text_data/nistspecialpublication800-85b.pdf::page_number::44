Special Publication 800-85B                                PIV Data Model Testing Specification


AS07.03.05: If the public key algorithm is RSA, then the keyUsage extension shall only
assert the keyEncipherment bit.
VE07.03.05.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation that certificates corresponding to
RSA keys assert only the keyEncipherment bit in the keyUsage extension.
TE07.03.05.01: The tester shall validate that certificates corresponding to RSA keys assert only
the keyEncipherment bit in the keyUsage extension.

AS07.03.06: If the public key algorithm is Elliptic Curve, then the keyUsage extension shall
only assert the keyAgreement bit.
VE07.03.06.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation that certificates corresponding to
elliptic curve keys assert only the keyAgreement bit in the keyUsage extension.
TE07.03.06.01: The tester shall validate that certificates corresponding to elliptic curve keys
assert only the keyAgreement bit in the keyUsage extension.

7.3.2   Key Pair and Certificate Conformance


AS07.03.07: The size of the public key for key management shall be determined by the
expiration of the certificate in accordance with Table 3-1 of SP 800-78.
VE07.03.07.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the allowable public key size to
be used while generating key management keys.
TE07.03.07.01: The tester shall validate that the public key size is in accordance with Table 3-1
of SP80078.

AS07.03.08: The public key present in the key management certificate corresponds to the
key management private key.
No requirement for vendor.
TE07.03.08.01: The tester shall validate that the public key present in the key management
certificate is part of the key pair corresponding to the private key on the PIV card.

AS07.03.09: If the public key algorithm is RSA, the exponent shall be greater than or equal
to 65,537.
VE07.03.09.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the size of the exponent permitted
while generating an RSA key pair for key management.
TE07.03.09.01: The tester shall validate that the RSA public key exponent size is greater than or
equal to 65,537.
