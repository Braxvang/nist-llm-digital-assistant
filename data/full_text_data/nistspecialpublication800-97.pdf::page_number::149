                                    ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



     Robust Enciphering and Data Integrity Mechanisms. IEEE 802.11 defines WEP as a data
      confidentiality and integrity protocol. The IEEE 802.11i amendment defines two additional
      protocols for RSNAs: Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) and Counter Mode with Cipher
      Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP). Federal agencies are required
      to use Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)-approved cryptographic algorithms that
      are contained in FIPS-validated cryptographic modules. Of WEP, TKIP, and CCMP, only CCMP
      uses a core cryptographic algorithm that is FIPS-approved, the Advanced Encryption Standard
      (AES). For other security features, CCMP offers the same or stronger implementations than
      WEP and TKIP. Accordingly, NIST requires the use of CCMP for securing Federal agencies’
      IEEE 802.11-based WLANs. For legacy IEEE 802.11 equipment that does not provide CCMP,
      auxiliary security protection is required; one possibility is the use of an IPsec VPN, using FIPS-
      approved cryptographic algorithms.
IEEE 802.11i also uses a function known as IEEE 802.1X port-based access control. The IEEE 802.1X
framework specified by the IEEE 802.11i amendment provides the means to block user access to the DS
until authentication is successful, thereby controlling access to network resources. The technique used to
block access is known as port-based access control; it involves the AP distinguishing between EAP and
non-EAP frames, then passing EAP frames through an uncontrolled port and non-EAP frames through a
controlled port, which can block access.

10.3 Wi-Fi Alliance Product Certification Programs

The Wi-Fi Alliance has established several certification programs to give consumers of WLAN products
assurance that their systems comply with IEEE 802.11 specifications and can interoperate with similar
equipment from other vendors. The following certifications are available that indicate product
compliance with IEEE 802.11i:
     Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), which includes a subset of the IEEE 802.11i specification that
      addresses the weaknesses of WEP
     WPA2, which extends WPA to include the full set of IEEE 802.11i requirements.
Federal agencies should procure WPA2 products that have been FIPS-validated; WPA products cannot be
FIPS-validated because they do not support FIPS-approved encryption algorithms. WPA and WPA2
have both Personal and Enterprise modes of operation. Organizations that plan to deploy authentication
servers as part of an IEEE 802.1X and EAP implementation should procure products with the Enterprise
level certification.

10.4 IEEE 802.11 RSN Operation

IEEE 802.11 RSN operation is based on a frame exchange protocol used to transfer frames between
WLAN components—STAs, APs, and ASs. The protocol uses three types of IEEE 802.11 frames, as
follows:

     Data frames, which encapsulate upper layer protocol packets, including user data (e.g., e-mail,
      Web pages).
     Management frames, which include the management of association and deassociation activities,
      authentication, probes, and beacons.
     Control frames, which are used for requesting and controlling access to the wireless media, such
      as sending an acknowledgement after receiving a data frame.
