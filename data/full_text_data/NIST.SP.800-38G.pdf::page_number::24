NIST SP 800-38G                                      METHODS FOR FORMAT-PRESERVING ENCRYPTION


Description:
The FF3.Decrypt algorithm is similar to the FF3.Encrypt algorithm; the differences are in Step 4,
where: 1) the order of the indices is reversed, 2) the roles of A and B are swapped, and
3) modular addition is replaced by modular subtraction, in Step 4v.

6   Conformance

Implementations of FF1.Encrypt, FF1.Decrypt, FF3.Encrypt, or FF3.Decrypt may be tested for
conformance to this Recommendation under the auspices of NISTâ€™s Cryptographic Algorithm
Validation Program [9].

Component functions such as PRF are not approved for use independent of these four functions.

In order to claim conformance with this Recommendation, an implementation of FF1 or FF3
may support as few as one value for the base.

Two implementations can only interoperate when they support common values for the base.
Moreover, FF1 and FF3 have two parameters, minlen and maxlen, that determine the lengths for
the numeral strings that are supported by an implementation of the encryption or decryption
function for the mode. FF1 also has a parameter, maxTlen, that indicates the maximum supported
length of a tweak string. The selection of these parameters may also affect interoperability.

For every algorithm that is specified in this Recommendation, a conforming implementation may
replace the given set of steps with any mathematically equivalent set of steps. In other words,
different procedures that produce the correct output for any input are permitted.
