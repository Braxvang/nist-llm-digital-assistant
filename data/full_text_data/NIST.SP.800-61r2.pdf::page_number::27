                                                                                  COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE



 Legal Department. Legal experts should review incident response plans, policies, and procedures to
  ensure their compliance with law and Federal guidance, including the right to privacy. In addition, the
  guidance of the general counsel or legal department should be sought if there is reason to believe that
  an incident may have legal ramifications, including evidence collection, prosecution of a suspect, or a
  lawsuit, or if there may be a need for a memorandum of understanding (MOU) or other binding
  agreements involving liability limitations for information sharing.
 Public Affairs and Media Relations. Depending on the nature and impact of an incident, a need may
  exist to inform the media and, by extension, the public.
 Human Resources. If an employee is suspected of causing an incident, the human resources
  department may be involved—for example, in assisting with disciplinary proceedings.
 Business Continuity Planning. Organizations should ensure that incident response policies and
  procedures and business continuity processes are in sync. Computer security incidents undermine the
  business resilience of an organization. Business continuity planning professionals should be made
  aware of incidents and their impacts so they can fine-tune business impact assessments, risk
  assessments, and continuity of operations plans. Further, because business continuity planners have
  extensive expertise in minimizing operational disruption during severe circumstances, they may be
  valuable in planning responses to certain situations, such as denial of service (DoS) conditions.
 Physical Security and Facilities Management. Some computer security incidents occur through
  breaches of physical security or involve coordinated logical and physical attacks. The incident
  response team also may need access to facilities during incident handling—for example, to acquire a
  compromised workstation from a locked office.
2.5      Incident Response Team Services

The main focus of an incident response team is performing incident response, but it is fairly rare for a
team to perform incident response only. The following are examples of other services a team might offer:

 Intrusion Detection. The first tier of an incident response team often assumes responsibility for
  intrusion detection.17 The team generally benefits because it should be poised to analyze incidents
  more quickly and accurately, based on the knowledge it gains of intrusion detection technologies.
 Advisory Distribution. A team may issue advisories within the organization regarding new
  vulnerabilities and threats.18 Automated methods should be used whenever appropriate to disseminate
  information; for example, the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) provides information via XML
  and RSS feeds when new vulnerabilities are added to it.19 Advisories are often most necessary when
  new threats are emerging, such as a high-profile social or political event (e.g., celebrity wedding) that
  attackers are likely to leverage in their social engineering. Only one group within the organization
  should distribute computer security advisories to avoid duplicated effort and conflicting information.
 Education and Awareness. Education and awareness are resource multipliers—the more the users
  and technical staff know about detecting, reporting, and responding to incidents, the less drain there

      See NIST SP 800-94, Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) for more information on IDPS
      technologies. It is available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#800-94.

      Teams should word advisories so that they do not blame any person or organization for security issues. Teams should meet
      with legal advisors to discuss the possible need for a disclaimer in advisories, stating that the team and organization has no
      liability in regard to the accuracy of the advisory. This is most pertinent when advisories may be sent to contractors,
      vendors, and other nonemployees who are users of the organization’s computing resources.
