Control Enhancement: (1) OT Discussion: Vendor relationships and spare parts strategies are
developed to ensure that an adequate supply of critical components is available to meet
operational needs.
Rationale for adding SR-5 (1) to MOD and HIGH baselines: OT systems and system components
are often built for purpose and have a limited number of vendors or suppliers for a specific
component. Organizations identify critical OT system components and controls to ensure an
adequate supply in the event of supply chain disruptions.
