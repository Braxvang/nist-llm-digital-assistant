      NIST SP 800-217 ipd                       Guidelines for PIV Federation (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


858   When the federated identifier is changed, the RP SHALL make the RP subscriber
859   account inactive and SHALL require a succesful federated authentication using the
860   new federated identifier before considering the RP subscriber account active again. The
861   RP SHALL NOT allow the previously used federated identifier to be used to access the
862   account.
863   The RP SHALL make a record of any such change, including the identifiers of all
864   affected RP subscriber accounts at the time of the change. The RP SHALL provide notice
865   to the subscriber when a federated identifier is bound or unbound to an RP subscriber
866   account.
867   The RP SHALL NOT convert an RP subscriber account to be available using local
868   authentication.
