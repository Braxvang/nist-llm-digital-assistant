    This Annual Report, formerly the Computer Security Division Annual Report, has been renamed to the Information
Technology Laboratory (ITL) Cybersecurity Program Annual Report. This change reflects the opportunity to describe the many
cybersecurity program highlights and accomplishments from throughout the laboratory. This Annual Report is organized into
several sections, each identified by a title page.
    Please note: This Annual Report covers the Federal Government’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 from October 1, 2015 to September
30, 2016.
    ITL, an operating unit under NIST, contains seven divisions. Five of these seven divisions are involved with cybersecurity
efforts at NIST. Throughout this Annual Report, there are some references to particular division activities, and to work by
groups within those divisions. Primarily, the authors have attributed accomplishments to ITL, since ITL staff have been
involved with each cybersecurity program included in this Annual Report. At the end of each program/project write-up, one
or more points of contact are provided and may be used to address questions or request for more information. Many sections
also include additional references that readers may find valuable.
      Below is a condensed hierarchical chart of ITL’s structure:
