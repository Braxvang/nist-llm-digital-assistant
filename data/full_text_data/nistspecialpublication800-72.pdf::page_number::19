Property databases are repositories of information that can be stored, searched, and retrieved
by associated applications. To reduce space, compression techniques are also applied
automatically. These databases provide a common way to manage persistent information on
the device.

The Windows CE registry is a database that stores information about applications, drivers,
system configuration, user preferences, and other data. The purpose of the registry is to
provide a single place for storing all the settings for the system, applications, and user. The
registry is always stored in RAM and consequently is volatile. If no registry is available in
RAM, Windows CE can regenerate a default one from a file stored in ROM.

The Windows CE operating system supports four types of memory:

        RAM – RAM is allocated into two separate areas: the object store where data is kept
        and program memory where programs execute. The partitioning of main memory can
        be controlled by the end-user via an application level control and can be adjusted
        without rebooting. A paged virtual-memory management system is used to allocate
        program memory.

        Expansion RAM – Expansion RAM is supported in addition to main system RAM to
        provide users with extra storage. The Expansion RAM is mapped into virtual
        memory after a cold boot and appears identical in the virtual memory map to the OS
        as system RAM.

        ROM – The ROM memory space contains miscellaneous data files like audio files,
        fonts and bitmaps. These are generally compressed and decompressed when brought
        into system RAM for usage. The ROM memory space also contains support for
        uncompressed executables, applications, and DLLs for XIP (eXecute In Place)
        operation. During the image build process, individual elements can be designated for
        either XIP or paged on demand operation.

        Persistent Storage – Much of the support for persistent storage is oriented around
        removable storage cards. For example, files (executables, data, users files) stored in
        persistent storage are memory mapped into system RAM for use.

Pocket PC devices offer users the ability to set a power-on password that can be made up of a
4-digit numeric or a stronger alphanumeric password up to 29 characters long. Additionally,
users can set a timeout that locks the device when not in use for the predefined specified
amount of time. If a password entry attempt is incorrect, the subsequent attempt is penalized
and takes longer to process, to discourage brute force attacks. If a password is forgotten, the
only way to unlock the device is by performing a hard-reset and resynching data. Some recent
models of Pocket PC devices have integrated a fingerprint biometric for additional security
that can be used in tandem with 4-digit or alphanumeric passwords.

Pocket PC permits the hardware developer, system integrator, or developer to decide which
services are incorporated in their Pocket PC version. Pocket PC devices can incorporate
trusted environments where the OS kernel verifies applications and libraries before loading
them. Three possibilities exist: the software module may be trusted without restrictions,
trusted with the restriction that no privileged function calls or registry access can be done, or
not trusted at all [Aho01].
