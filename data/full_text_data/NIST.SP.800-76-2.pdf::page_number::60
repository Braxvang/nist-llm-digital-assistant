    This approach measures accuracy and this necessarily involves using an iris recognition algorithm. Agencies might
    allow each tested camera to be associated with an algorithm, or might instead select a separate reference algorithm
    against which all cameras will be compared. The decision on which of these options to take will depend on the
    operational context and on availability of algorithms.
    Agencies might choose to select cameras that demonstrate adequate accuracy and speed in a scenario test of the
    sort defined below. A test laboratory should execute such a test in formal conformance to the scenario testing
    requirements in Section 7 of the ISO/IEC 19795-2:2007 Testing Methodologies for Technology and Scenario Evaluation
    standard [PERFSCEN]. The test laboratory should additionally execute the test given the design and reporting
    constraints given in Table 19 - the specifications define the scenario under test, and restrict the parameters of the test
    design to ensure production of actionable performance data while mitigating the cost of the test.
    The test laboratory should deliver a test report to the requesting Agency. The test report should conform to the
    reporting requirements of [PERFSCEN] and should report all accuracy and speed data mentioned in Section 6.7 of this
    document.

      clause
1     7.1.2.1   Concept of operations      A test to represent a physical access control scenario for an habituated population.
2     7.1.2.2   Comparison functionality One-to-one verification, after presentation of a PIV Card or equivalent as an identity claim.
                                           The test may proceed without reading iris imagery from the token i.e., it may be stored on a
                                           server.
3     7.1.2.3   Evaluation environment Indoors, entrance, vestibule, atrium, or interior office, without augmentation of the
                                           environmental lighting.
4     7.1.2.4   Test platform              Not specified.
5     7.1.3.1   Test subject instruction   The test crew may be instructed on how to use the biometric system.
6     7.1.3.2   Test subject training      The test crew may execute up to ten enrollment and ten verification attempts before
                                           starting the test.
7     7.1.3.3   Attended enrollment        The enrollment attempts may be attended.
                                           The attendant should be distinct from the laboratory staff involved in the test
                                           measurements.
8     7.1.3.3   Unattended verification The verification attempts shall be unattended.
9     7.1.3.4   Guidance                   During enrollment, the operator may guide the user on correct preparation and use of the
                                           system.
10 7.1.3.5      Test order                 The test may proceed with several devices being evaluated in parallel.
11 7.1.3.6      Test subject identifiers   The test should include presentation of a PIV Card or similar electronic token that identifies
                                           the individual.
12 7.1.4.1      Enrollment level of effort Either or both eyes may be enrolled. The maximum number of presentations allowed for
                                           enrollment is three. The maximum duration of the entire enrollment transaction is 60
                                           seconds.
13 7.1.4.2      Verification level of      Either or both eyes may be verified. The maximum number of presentations allowed for
                effort                     verification is three. The maximum duration of the biometric part of the entire verification
                                           transaction is 12 seconds. This may include presentation of the identity token.
14 7.1.4.3      Reference adaptation       The enrollment data shall not be augmented or updated during verification attempts.
15 7.1.4.5      Native configuration       The camera and ancillary software shall be pre-configured by the manufacturer prior to the
                                           start of the test. The test laboratory shall not further customize or reconfigure any
                                           component.
16 7.1.5        Multiple transactions      A test subject shall execute three attempts to verify as himself. This constitutes a

17 7.1.5        Multiple visits            A test subject shall visit on two separate days. The enrollment and genuine verification
                                           transactions shall not be conducted on the same day.
18 7.1.6        Executing genuine trials A test subject shall execute two or more genuine transactions.
19 7.1.6        Executing impostor trials A test subject shall execute at least three impostor transactions against different identities
                                           by presentation of another individual's identity token.
                                           The test subject should not be aware of whether she is making a genuine or impostor
