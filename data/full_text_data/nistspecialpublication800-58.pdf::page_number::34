 4.2.1    H.235v2

         H.235v2 is the followup version of H.235 that was approved in November 2000.
         Besides enhancements such as the support of elliptic curve cryptography and the
         support for the Advanced Encryption System (AES) standard, several security
         profiles are defined to support product interoperability. These profiles are defined
         in annexes to H.235v2 as follows:
         – Annex D – Shared secrets and keyed hashes
         – Annex E – Digital signatures on every message
         – Annex F – Digital signatures and shared secret establishment on first
             handshake, afterwards keyed hash usage

 4.2.1.1 H.235v2 Annex D – Baseline Security Profile

         The Baseline Security Profile relies on symmetric techniques. Shared secrets are
         used to provide authentication and/or message integrity. The supported scenarios
         for this profile are endpoint to gatekeeper, gatekeeper to gatekeeper, and endpoint
         to endpoint. For the profile the gatekeeper-routed signaling (hop-by-hop security)
         is favored. Using it for the direct call model is generally possible but limited due
         to the fact that a shared secret has to be established between the parties that want
         to communicate before the actual communication takes place. This might be
         possible in smaller environments but may lead to a huge administrative effort in
         larger environments.

         This profile supports secure fast connect and H.245 tunneling, and may be
         combined with the Voice Encryption Option described in section 4.2.1.3. Note:
         that this profile is easy to implement but it is not really scalable for “global” IP
         telephony due to the restricted key management.
