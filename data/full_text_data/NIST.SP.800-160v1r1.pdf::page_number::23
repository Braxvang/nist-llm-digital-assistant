     Systems Engineering Overview
This chapter presents system, systems engineering, trust, and trustworthiness concepts that
provide the foundation for engineering trustworthy secure systems.

           System Concepts
Many system concepts are important to inform engineering trustworthy secure systems. This
includes what constitutes a system, the structure of a system, categories of systems, and the
concept of a system of systems.

2.1.1. Systems and System Structure
A system 9 is an arrangement of parts or elements that together exhibit a behavior or meaning that
the individual constituents do not. The properties of a system (i.e., attributes, qualities, or
characteristics) emerge from the system’s parts or elements and their individual properties, as
well as the relationships and interactions between and among the parts or elements, the system,
and its environment [3]. An engineered system is designed or adapted to interact with an
anticipated operational environment to achieve one or more intended purposes while complying
with applicable constraints [3]. Figure 1 shows the basic structure of a system, including its
constituent system elements. 10 11

The purpose of a system is to deliver one or more capabilities. The capabilities may directly or
indirectly interact with, control, or monitor physical, mechanical, hydraulic, or pneumatic
devices or other systems or capabilities, or it may provide the ability to create, access,
manipulate, transmit, store, or share resources, such as data and information.

  Examples of systems include information systems, communications systems, financial systems, manufacturing systems, transportation systems,
logistics systems, medical systems, weapons systems, mechanical systems, space systems, industrial control systems (ICS), optical systems, or
electrical systems. Systems can be physical or conceptual, use information technology (IT) or operational technology (OT), include humans, be
cyber-physical, and leverage Internet of Things (IoT) or other technologies.
10
   A system element can be a discrete component, product, service, subsystem, system, organization, human, infrastructure, or enterprise. System
elements are implemented by hardware, software, and firmware that perform operations on information or data; physical structures, devices, and
components in the operational environment; and the people, processes, and procedures for operating, sustaining, and supporting the elements.
11
   Systems with few or no active functions (e.g., physical infrastructure) may also exhibit assured trustworthiness. For example, the interstate
highway system employs safety barriers such as Jersey walls (a system element) that contribute to the transportation system’s trustworthiness.
