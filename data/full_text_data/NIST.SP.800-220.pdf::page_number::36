Control System and Operational Technology (OT) Security
NIST is incorporating lessons learned in revisions to the Guide to Industrial Control Systems
(ICS) Security (SP 800-82) (see previous section) to provide alignment to relevant NIST guidance
(e.g., SP 800-37, Rev. 2; SP 800-53, Rev. 5; SP 800-53B; and Cybersecurity Framework v1.1)
and other relevant control system cybersecurity standards and recommended practices, and
address changes in the threat landscape. Updates include expanding the scope from ICS to
control systems/OT, applying new cybersecurity capabilities, adding guidance specific to small
and medium-sized control system/OT owners and operators, and revising the control system/OT
threats, vulnerabilities, standards, and recommended practices.
Ransomware and Data Security
The term “ransomware” describes types of malware used by perpetrators to carry out threats to
publish a victim’s sensitive personal or business information or to perpetually block the victim’s
access to vital information unless a ransom is paid. Ransomware attacks can paralyze or destroy
organizations. NIST undertook several activities (see below) to help organizations protect against
ransomware attacks and to enable recovery from any that are successful.
Ransomware protection and remediation require a coordinated response involving processes,
procedures, and decision-making using technical controls for identifying, mitigating, and recovering
from ransomware events. To help organizations access the NIST guidance and tools that best
address these needs, NIST’s new Ransomware Protection and Response page aggregates NIST
recommendations that directly address the ransomware challenge. The page includes a "tips
and tactics" one-pager providing key actions for defense against ransomware attacks. To support
small and medium-sized organizations, the Small Business Cybersecurity Corner now features a
ransomware page that illustrates ransomware event basics, how ransomware events can impact
businesses of all sizes, and actions that can help in managing ransomware risk.
In response to several major recent ransomware events, NIST also engaged industry experts in
drafting a new Cybersecurity Framework Profile for Ransomware Risk Management publication
(draft NISTIR 8374). This profile identifies relevant subcategories and informative references from
the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and maps them directly to ransomware risk management
activities. Additionally, the document includes a high-level description of security measures that
organizations can take now to prevent future ransomware attacks and mitigate the consequences
of any successful attacks.
Complementing the new ransomware profile, the NCCoE published two practice guides:
Data Integrity: Identifying and Protecting Assets Against Ransomware and Other Destructive
Events (SP 1800-25) and Data Integrity: Detecting and Responding to Ransomware and Other
Destructive Events (SP 1800-26). These publications are a continuation of the previously
published Data Integrity: Recovering from Ransomware and Other Destructive Events
(SP 1800-11). Together, the practice guides demonstrate how commercially available technology
can be used to implement the Cybersecurity Framework. These NCCoE SPs are supplemented by
NIST’s Securing Data Integrity Against Ransomware Attacks (draft NIST CSWP 10012020) white
paper that was published to help organizations apply the architectures described in the practice
guides to preventing or mitigating ransomware events. These are supported by the Ransomware
Protection and Response web page described above.
