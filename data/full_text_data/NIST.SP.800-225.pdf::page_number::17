                     TRUSTWORTHY NETWORKS
                         AND PLATFORMS

  Each of us relies on the hardware, software, and networks that form the fabric of our
  digital ecosystems. NIST’s Trustworthy Networks and Trustworthy Platforms priority
    areas support research and practical implementation guidance to ensure secure,
                reliable, and resilient technology across industry sectors.

Major Accomplishments in FY 2022:
• NIST published guidance to enhance and strengthen the security and integrity of the
  software supply chain in support of Executive Order (EO)14028. This effort included
  cybersecurity supply chain risk management practices and guidelines for software
  developer verification, systems security engineering, and secure software development.
• Hardware security mechanisms and governance safeguards guidance was finalized to
  measure and attest to the integrity of the platform in an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)
  cloud deployment model and other multi-tenant cloud environments.
• The development of the Cybersecurity for IoT program has progressed through stakeholder
  engagement, guidance for consumers of IoT products and federal agencies, and practical
  guidance for securing industrial internet of things (IIoT) devices (e.g., distributed energy
  resources).
