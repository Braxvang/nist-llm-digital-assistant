The rate service may be implemented as an orchestration, as all of the involved Web services would be
internal to the rate service’s organization. To fully calculate the interest rates that the loan service will
use, the rate service consists of a chain of SOAP requests and responses passed from one internal Web
service to another to gather the necessary information to respond with accurate rates. Each transaction
within the orchestration is controlled by the rate service, so that requests and responses occur in the
proper order and failures do not propagate throughout the transaction. Once complete, the rate service
returns the result of the orchestration to the loan service, as shown in Figure 2-8.

2.2     Elements of Security

Because a Web service relies on some of the same underlying HTTP and Web-based architecture as
common Web applications, it is susceptible to similar threats and vulnerabilities. Web services security is
based on several important concepts, including 11:

 Identification and Authentication: Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a
  prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an information system.
 Authorization. The permission to use a computer resource, granted, directly or indirectly, by an
  application or system owner.
 Integrity. The property that data has not been altered in an unauthorized manner while in storage,
  during processing, or in transit.
 Non-repudiation. Assurance that the sender of information is provided with proof of delivery and
  the recipient is provided with proof of the sender’s identity, so neither can later deny having
  processed the information.
