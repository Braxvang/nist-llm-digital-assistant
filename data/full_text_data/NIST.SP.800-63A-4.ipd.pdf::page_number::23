517      1. The presented document contains the printed name of the applicant. (See Sec. 10.1
518         - Equity and Resolution - for guidance on dealing with a printed name that varies
519         from the applicant’s claimed identity.)
520      2. The presented document contains at least one printed reference number.
521      3. The presented document contains the printed name of the issuer of the document.
522      4. The issuer of the document performed identity proofing of the applicant prior to
523         issuing the document.
524      5. There is reasonable assurance that the document was delivered to the intended
525         person.

526   4.3.2. Characteristics of Acceptable Digital Evidence
527   Acceptable digital evidence SHALL contain all of the following characteristics:
528      1. The presented digital evidence contains the name of the applicant as the subject
529         of the digital information or account. (See Sec. 10.1 - Equity and Resolution
530         - for guidance on dealing with a name on digital evidence that varies from the
531         applicant’s claimed identity.)
532      2. The presented digital evidence contains at least one reference (e.g., account
533         number) or sufficient attributes to bind the digital information to the applicant.
534      3. The presented digital evidence contains the name of the issuer of the digital

542   4.3.3. Evidence Strength Requirements
543   This section defines the requirements for identity evidence at each strength. Strength of
544   identity evidence is determined by three aspects: 1) the issuing rigor; 2) the ability to
545   provide confidence in validation, including accuracy and integrity of attributes; and 3) the
546   ability to provide confidence in the verification of the applicant presenting the evidence.
547   Evidence at all levels of strength must be current and unexpired.
