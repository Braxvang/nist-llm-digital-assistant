3.         BIA Data Collection

Data collection can be accomplished through individual/group interviews, workshops, email,
questionnaires, or any combination of these.

3.1        Determine Process and System Criticality

Step one of the BIA process - Working with input from users, managers, mission/business process
owners, and other internal or external points of contact (POC), identify the specific mission/business
processes that depend on or support the information system.

          Mission/Business Process                                Description
                                           Process of obligating funds, issuing check or electronic
Pay vendor invoice
                                           payment and acknowledging receipt




If criticality of mission/business processes has not been determined outside of the BIA, the following
subsections will help to determine criticality of mission/business processes that depend on or support the
information system.

3.1.1      Identify Outage Impacts and Estimated Downtime

This section identifies and characterizes the types of impact categories that a system disruption is likely to
create in addition to those identified by the FIPS 199 impact level, as well as the estimated downtime that
the organization can tolerate for a given process. Impact categories should be created and values
assigned to these categories in order to measure the level or type of impact a disruption may cause. An
example of cost as an impact category is provided. Organizations could consider other categories like
harm to individuals and ability to perform mission. The template should be revised to reflect what is
appropriate for the organization.

Outage Impacts

Impact categories and values should be created in order to characterize levels of severity to the
organization that would result for that particular impact category if the mission/business process could
not be performed. These impact categories and values are samples and should be revised to reflect what
is appropriate for the organization.

The following impact categories represent important
areas for consideration in the event of a disruption or
