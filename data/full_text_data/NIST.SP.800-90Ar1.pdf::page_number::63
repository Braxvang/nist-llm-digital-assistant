                                                                     Generation Using Deterministic RBGs

10.2.1.4     Reseeding a CTR_DRBG Instantiation

Notes for the reseed function specified in Section 9.2:
   The reseeding of a CTR_DRBG instantiation requires a call to the Reseed_function
   specified in Section 9.2. Process step 6 of that function calls the reseed algorithm specified in
   this section. The values for min _length are provided in Table 3 of Section 10.2.1.
The reseed algorithm:
       For this DRBG mechanism, there are two cases for processing. In each case, let
       CTR_DRBG_Update be the function specified in Section 10.2.1.2. The seed length
       (seedlen) is provided in Table 3 of Section 10.2.1.

10.2.1.4.1     Reseeding When a Derivation Function is Not Used

When reseeding is performed using this method, full-entropy input is required.
The following process or its equivalent shall be used as the reseed algorithm for this DRBG
mechanism (see step 6 of the reseed process in Section 9.2):
   CTR_DRBG_Reseed_algorithm (working_state, entropy_input, additional_input):
       1. working_state: The current values for V, Key and reseed_counter (see Section
          10.2.1.1).
       2. entropy_input: The string of bits obtained from the randomness source.
       3. additional_input: The additional input string received from the consuming
          application. Note that the length of the additional_input string may be zero.
   Output:
       1. new_working_state: The new values for V, Key, and reseed_counter.
   CTR_DRBG Reseed Process:
       1. temp = len (additional_input).
                                               Comment: Ensure that the length of the
                                               additional_input is exactly seedlen bits. The
                                               maximum length was checked in Section 9.2,
                                               processing step 2, using Table 3 to define the
                                               maximum length.
       2. If (temp < seedlen), then additional_input = additional_input || 0seedlen - temp.
       3. seed_material = entropy_input âŠ• additional_input.
       4. (Key, V) = CTR_DRBG_Update (seed_material, Key, V).
       5. reseed_counter = 1.
       6. Return (V, Key, reseed_counter).
10.2.1.4.2     Reseeding When a Derivation Function is Used

Let df be the derivation function specified in Section 10.3.2.
