computation, but agencies should carefully consider the trade-off between performance
and security when choosing between secure hardware and cryptographic techniques.

3.9.4.   Physical Enclaves
For extremely sensitive data, a physical enclave ( Sec. 3.4) may provide additional security.
In this model, data are stored on a computer that is not connected to any network and
are accessible only via physical access to a particular room. Access to the data are then
controlled by limiting access to the room. This approach can be quite cumbersome.
