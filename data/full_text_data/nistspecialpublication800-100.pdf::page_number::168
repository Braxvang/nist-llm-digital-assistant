Appendix B                                             Frequently Asked Questions


       1.   Prioritize actions;
       2.   Evaluate recommended control options;
       3.   Conduct cost-benefit analysis;
       4.   Select control;
       5.   Assign responsibility;
       6.   Develop a safeguard implementation plan; and
       7.   Implement selected control(s).

Q. The security controls have been established. Is it possible to proceed to
   the final step of the risk management process?
A. No. It is important to note that even after the controls have been selected and
   implemented, some degree of residual risk will remain. It is impractical to
   assume that all risk will be eliminated and the remaining residual risk should be
   analyzed to ensure that it is at an acceptable level. For federal agencies, after
   the appropriate controls have been put in place for the identified risks, the
   authorizing official will sign a statement accepting any residual risk and authorize
   the operation of the new information system or the continued processing of the
   existing information system. If the residual risk has not been reduced to an
   acceptable level, the risk management cycle must be repeated to identify a way
   of lowering the residual risk to an acceptable level.

Q. What is the formal definition of risk?
A. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP)
   800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems, defines
   risk as, “a function of the likelihood of a given threat-source’s exercising a
   particular potential vulnerability, and the resulting impact of that adverse event
   on the organization.”

Q. Is it possible to calculate the likelihood of a threat exploiting a given
   vulnerability?
A. Yes. The likelihood of a given threat successfully exploiting a given vulnerability
   is estimated by evaluating the threat’s motivation, opportunity, and methods for
   conducting such exploitation. The impact of a successful exploitation is estimated
   through an analysis of the effect the exploitation can have on the confidentiality,
   integrity, and availability of the system and the data it processes.

Q. What are the steps in the risk assessment process?
A. The risk assessment process has six steps:
   • Step 1: System characterization;
   • Step 2: Threat identification;
   • Step 3: Vulnerability identification;
   • Step 4: Control analysis, likelihood determination, impact analysis, risk
     determination;
   • Step 5: Control recommendations; and
   • Step 6: Results documentation.

Q. How is a system described?
A. The system is described in terms of its hardware; software; interfaces to other
   systems, data, people, mission; and criticality and sensitivity (as previously
   described using FIPS 199 to determine the system’s appropriate security
   categorization). In addition, the system’s functional requirements; security
