detection mechanisms could be used to detect an unauthorized access and then take some
defensive action. For example, a detected unauthorized access could sound an alarm or
send an alert to the security officer. Often, a combination of prevention and detection
measures is used.

Once security is breached, the integrity of the entire breached area should be suspect. If
the CKMS detects a breach, it should inform the appropriate entity about the breach, as
specified in the CKMS Security Policy, so that mitigation actions can be taken. In
addition, it might not be sufficient to replace all sensitive data within the breached area,
because the attacker could have modified or added to the logic within the area so that the
new keys and sensitive information could also be compromised in the future.

FR:6.120 The CKMS design shall specify how all CKMS components and devices are
protected from unauthorized physical access.

FR:6.121 The CKMS design shall specify how the CKMS detects unauthorized physical
access.

FR:6.122 The CKMS design shall specify how the CKMS recovers from unauthorized
physical access to components and devices other than cryptographic modules.

FR:6.123 The CKMS design shall specify the entities that are automatically notified if a
physical security breach of any CKMS component or device is detected by the CKMS.

FR:6.124 The CKMS design shall specify how breached areas can be re-established to a
secure state.

7. Interoperability and Transitioning
Interoperability is the ability of diverse systems to communicate and work together (i.e.,
interoperate) 19. A CKMS may interoperate with an application or a peer CKMS.
Interoperability can only be achieved by having a detailed specification of the interfaces
to systems with which the CKMS intends to interoperate. This inherently includes the
following:
    a) Common interfaces and protocols, i.e., the syntax and semantics of interfaces that
        invoke functions and services from one CKMS entity to another CKMS entity are
        the same for interoperating systems,
    b) Formats for keys, metadata, and other exchanged data are the same or can be
        translated by interoperable systems, and
    c) Data exchange mechanisms, including security mechanisms, are the same or are
        equivalent between interoperable systems.
