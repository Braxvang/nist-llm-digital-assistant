                                               GUIDELINES FOR SECURING W IRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (WLANS)


3.1.2      Vulnerability Monitoring

Organizations should do largely the same vulnerability monitoring for WLAN components that they do
for any other software: identifying patches and applying them, and verifying security configuration
settings and adjusting them as needed (see Section 2). These actions should be performed at least as often
for WLAN components as they are for the organization’s equivalent wired systems. Further discussion of
these general vulnerability monitoring techniques is outside the scope of this publication.

In addition to the general vulnerability monitoring, WLAN-specific vulnerability monitoring involves
analyzing WLAN communications and identifying policy violations, such as communications using the
wrong protocols, encryption key lengths, etc. This is effective at identifying misconfigured WLAN
devices as well as devices that are acting differently than their configuration indicates. It is especially
helpful when not all of the WLAN devices are under the organization’s control, such as visitor laptops,
and when unauthorized WLAN devices are a concern (e.g., an employee attaching a personal mobile
device to an organization WLAN without authorization). This form of vulnerability monitoring is often
provided by the same tools that are effective at attack monitoring, as explained in Section 3.2.

3.2       Monitoring Tools

One of the primary tools for WLAN security monitoring is a wireless intrusion detection and prevention
system (WIDPS). A WIDPS has sensors placed at designated locations within an organization’s facilities;
these sensors monitor WLAN bands and channels to sample traffic, allowing them to identify WLAN
attacks and some WLAN vulnerabilities. WIDPS sensors are available in several forms:

          Dedicated. A dedicated sensor performs WIDPS functions but does not pass network traffic from
           source to destination. Dedicated sensors are often completely passive, simply sniffing WLAN
           traffic. Some dedicated sensors analyze the traffic they monitor, while other sensors forward the
           traffic to a management server for analysis. The sensor is typically connected to a wired network.
           Dedicated sensors are usually designed for one of two deployment types:

           o   Fixed—the sensor is deployed to a particular location. Fixed sensors usually depend on the
               organization’s infrastructure for power, wired network access, and other resources.

           o   Mobile—the sensor is designed to be portable so it can be used from multiple locations or
               while in motion. For example, a security administrator could use a mobile sensor while
               walking through an organization’s buildings to find rogue APs.

          Bundled. Many APs and wireless switches offer some WIDPS capabilities as a secondary
           function.

In addition to these hardware-based forms, there are also host-based WIDPS sensor software products that
can be installed on WLAN client devices. The sensor software detects WLAN attacks within range of the
client device, as well as WLAN vulnerabilities of the client device, and reports this information to
WIDPS management servers. The sensor software may also be able to enforce WLAN security policies.
See [SP800-94] for more information on all forms of WIDPS.

Another primary tool for WLAN security monitoring is a WLAN scanner. A passive WLAN scanning
tool captures WLAN traffic being transmitted within the range of the tool’s antenna. Most passive tools
record the key attributes of discovered WLAN devices. This information can be used to identify WLAN
vulnerabilities and to detect potential rogue devices. WLAN scanning tools used to conduct completely
passive scans transmit no data, nor do the tools in any way affect the operation of deployed WLAN
