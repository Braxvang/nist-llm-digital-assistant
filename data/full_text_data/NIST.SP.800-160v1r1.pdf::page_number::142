NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                 Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

       DE-1.2 Determine the security technologies required for each system element composing the
              system.
       DE-1.3 Identify the security concerns associated with each technology required for each system
              element.
       Note 1: This includes the security concerns due to known and potential vulnerability within or
       enabled by the supply chains involved with the acquisition of technologies.
       Note 2: The concerns may have associated risks to record and track.
       DE-1.4 Determine the necessary security and trustworthiness categories of system
              characteristics represented in the design.
       DE-1.5 Define the precepts for trustworthy secure evolution of the system design.
       DE-1.6 Identify the security aspects for enabling systems or services needed to support design
              definition.
       DE-1.7 Identify and plan for enabling systems or services needed to support the security
              aspects of design definition.
       DE-1.8 Obtain or acquire access to the security aspects of enabling systems or services to be
              used in design definition.

DE-2   CREATE THE SYSTEM DESIGN
       DE-2.1 Allocate security requirements to system elements.
       DE-2.2 Transform security-relevant architectural entities and relationships into design
              elements.
       DE-2.3 Transform security-relevant architectural characteristics into trustworthy secure design
              characteristics.
       Note: The characteristics include or reflect the expected level of assurance.
       DE-2.4 Define the necessary trustworthy secure design enablers.
       DE-2.5 Examine trustworthy secure design alternatives.
       DE-2.6 Refine or define the security aspects of interfaces between system elements and with
              external entities.
       Note: The details of the defined interfaces are refined to include the security aspects. These
       include security and security-driven constraints applied to interfaces, interactions, and behavior
       between components and with external entities, such as interfacing systems (Section 2.1.2),
       peripheral devices, and humans interacting with the system.
       DE-2.7 Develop the security aspects of design artifacts.
       Note 1: Design artifacts include general and security-specific specifications, data sheets,
       databases, and documents.
       Note 2: Design artifacts include configuration and procedures to ensure security mechanism
       behavior specified by system-level policy and enforced by configuration and procedures
       (Appendix C.3).
