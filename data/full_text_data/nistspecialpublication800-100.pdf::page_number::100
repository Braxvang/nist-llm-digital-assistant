CHAPTER 10                                                        Risk Management


   • Organizational policy;
   • Operational impact; and
   • Safety and reliability.
    Agencies should consult NIST SP 800-53 for further guidance on the development
of control recommendations.

10.1.6 Step 6 – Results Documentation
    The risk assessment report is the mechanism used to formally report the results
of all risk assessment activities. The intended function of this report is to describe
and document the risk posture of the system while it is operating in its stated
environment (as described in the system characterization) and to provide
organization managers with sufficient information so that they can make sound, risk-
based decisions, such as resources that must be allocated to the risk mitigation
phase. Lastly, the agency should ensure that the results of the risk assessment are
appropriately reflected in the system’s Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) and
System Security Plan.
   At a minimum, the risk assessment report should describe the following:
   •   Scope of the assessment based on the system characterization;
   •   Methodology used to conduct the risk assessment;
   •   Individual observations resulting from conducting the risk assessment; and
   •   Estimation of the overall risk posture of the system.
