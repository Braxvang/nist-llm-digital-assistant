                                                                                         GUIDE TO SECURE WEB SERVICES



3.5.6    Use of Specialized Security Metadata for Access Control

If the Web service handles personally identifiable information (PII), proprietary, or other sensitive data, it
may need to label or otherwise mark output from the application. For labeling of Web pages, one
approach is to use metatags to store the label information directly in the HTML source of the page, to be
displayed as part of the page in the user’s browser. If the Web page is printed from the browser, this label
will be included in the printed output.

Some government agencies have defined XML-based markup syntax and schema for implementing
security labels in data. The Intelligence Community (IC) Metadata Standards Working Group (MSWG)
develops standards for affixing security labels to online XML and HTML content and downloadable
electronic documents posted on the IC’s Intelink World Wide Web-like intranet. While these standards
are developed specifically for the IC, they can serve as a basis for any organization’s metadata standards.
In addition, any organization that interacts with the IC may improve communications efficiency by
embracing these standards.

The IC security metadata standards are intended to be consistent with the key XML security standards
(XML-Signature, XML-Encryption and XKMS). The relevant IC standards are:

 IC Metadata Standard for Publication (IC MSP)
 IC Metadata Standard for Information Security Markings (IC ISM)
 IC Standard for Core Metadata (IC Core).
Within DoD, a similar effort has been put forth called the DoD Discovery Metadata Standard (DDMS).
DDMS does not directly support embedding metadata tags within XML documents. Instead, it focuses on
creating metadata registries that can be accessed in conjunction with DoD resources. As with the IC
standards, use of DDMS may improve efficiency in communications for organizations that interact
closely with DoD.

The DoD and the IC are working on harmonization of security labels based on the labeling specifications
defined by the IC’s Controlled Access Program Coordination Office (CAPCO) and those based on DoD
Directive 5200.1, DoD Information Security Program (13 December 1996). 43

In the private sector, a number of organizations are developing metadata specifications to address
regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. The Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Structured Product Labeling (SPL) specification from
Health Level Seven (HL7) as a mechanism for exchanging medication information. SPL Release 2 44
provides confidentiality codes that can be used to specify whether a particular entity can view the
information in the document.

The objective of these standards is to describe XML metadata tags and their possible values. These tags
and values can be embedded in XML content to indicate the classification or sensitivity level associated
with the tagged data. In addition, the standards describe one or more DTDs or XML Schemas specifying
the rules for parsing the metadata security tags.
