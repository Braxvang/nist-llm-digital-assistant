to future directions for NIST and the NCCoE’s work in this important space. With the release
of EO 14028, the Cybersecurity for IoT Program was engaged in the requirements to develop
cybersecurity criteria for consumer IoT as a part of the greater NIST EO response effort. Work
started before the EO with a white paper, "Establishing Confidence in IoT Device Security:
How do we get there?", which explored the various dimensions of confidence mechanisms that
could be applied and assessed available alternative approaches for providing confidence in the
cybersecurity of IoT devices. This helped define an available landscape of approaches to consider
in developing guidance for consumer IoT. These insights helped to inform EO 14028 response
efforts, leading up to the draft Baseline Security Criteria for Consumer IoT Devices, which was
published in August 2021 and discussed in a public workshop the following month.
To provide IoT cybersecurity guidance for federal agencies, NIST also published other public
review drafts early in FY 2021:
•   IoT Device Cybersecurity Guidance for the Federal Government: Establishing IoT Device
    Cybersecurity Requirements (draft NIST SP 800-213) and
•   Profile Using the IoT Core Baseline and Non-Technical Baseline for the Federal Government
    (draft NISTIR 8259D).
These drafts were released concurrently with the signing of the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement
Act of 2020. Work to refine the information from these drafts continued through FY 2021, using
many of the same stakeholder engagement activities that supported the development of NISTIR
8259B, and the program anticipates publishing final versions of its guidance for federal agencies
early in FY 2022.
Throughout this period, the Cybersecurity for IoT Program has remained engaged with international
activities. In particular, program representatives have been active in the progress of Cybersecurity
— IoT security and privacy — Device baseline requirements, ISO/IEC 27402.
Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL)
As systems become more complex and more cloud solutions are adopted, the responsibilities of
security practitioners and authorizing officials are increasingly difficult. They must employ multiple
sets of documents while leveraging a thorough understanding of systems’ interconnections and
dependencies, and how controls are inherited from other systems to better mitigate risks.
In July 2021, NIST released the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) 1.0.0, to
support interoperable and portable security automation. OSCAL applies security documentation as
code (i.e., documentation in machine-readable formats) for integration into security assessment,
auditing, and monitoring activities. Through this model, OSCAL provides traceability throughout
the risk management process, including automation of authorization to operate (ATO) tasks.
OSCAL, developed through a community-centric approach, is an open source set of formats.
NIST encourages all interested parties to join the community and support the improvement and
expansion of OSCAL. Adoption of OSCAL is expanding, including the NIST SP 800-53 security and
privacy controls SP 800-53A assessment procedures, and GSA FedRAMP’s SP 800-53 security
baselines. International adoptions include the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA)
use of OSCAL for the automation of their conformity assessment process for this program and the
ISO/IEC Subcommittee 27 (SC27) Working Group 1 (WG1) approval to release the 27002:2022
standard in OSCAL.
