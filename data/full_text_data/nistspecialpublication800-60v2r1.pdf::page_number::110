Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for disclosure of human resources development information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of human resource development
information depends mostly on the criticality of the information with respect to agency mission
capability, protection of agency assets, and safety of individuals. Although there can be serious
short-term effects for individuals, the effects of modifications or deletion of this information are
generally limited with respect to agency mission capabilities or assets.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
human resources development information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish human resources development information.
Human resources development information is generally tolerant of delay. Typically, disruption
of human resources development information can be expected to have only a limited adverse
effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended
human resources development information is low.

C.3.4 Supply Chain Management

Supply chain management involves the purchasing, tracking, and overall management of
goods and services.
C.3.4.1 Goods Acquisition Information Type

Goods acquisition involves the procurement of physical goods, products, and capital assets to be
used by the Federal government. The recommended security categorization for the goods
acquisition information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of goods acquisition
information on the ability of agencies to procure physical goods, products, and capital assets to
be used by the Federal government. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most goods
acquisition information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of
information associated with large procurements can result in fraud, waste, abuse, and/or legal
proceedings that can have a serious to severe effect on Federal government assets and operations.
Also, information associated with acquisition of many Federal government facilities can be
