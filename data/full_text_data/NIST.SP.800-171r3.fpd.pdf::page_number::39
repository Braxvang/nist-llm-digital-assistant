858           system for the purpose of initiating changes. Access restrictions include physical and logical
859           access controls, software libraries, workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (i.e.,
860           changes implemented into external interfaces rather than directly into the system), and change
861           windows (i.e., changes occur only during specified times).

865   3.4.6. Least Functionality
866           REQUIREMENT: 03.04.06
867           a. Configure the system to provide only mission-essential capabilities.
868           b. Prohibit or restrict use of the following functions, ports, protocols, connections, and services:
869              [Assignment: organization-defined functions, ports, protocols, connections, and services].
870           c.   Review the system periodically to identify unnecessary or nonsecure functions, ports,
871                protocols, connections, and services.
872           d. Disable or remove functions, ports, protocols, connections, and services that are
873              unnecessary or nonsecure.

874           DISCUSSION
875           Systems can provide a variety of functions and services. Some functions and services that are
876           routinely provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational missions,
877           functions, or operations. It may be convenient to provide multiple services from single system
878           components. However, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one
879           component. Where feasible, organizations limit functionality to a single function per component.
880           Organizations review the functions and services provided by the system or system components to
881           determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination. Organizations disable
882           unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent the unauthorized
883           connection of devices, transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations can employ network
884           scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and endpoint protection systems (e.g.,
885           firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems) to identify and prevent the use of prohibited
886           functions, ports, protocols, system connections, and services. Bluetooth, File Transfer Protocol,
887           and peer-to-peer networking are examples of the types of protocols that organizations consider
888           eliminating, restricting, or disabling.
