Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1        Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


•    Reconfirm the criticality/sensitivity of the information system and the information processed,
     stored, and/or transmitted by that system.
     The organization should reexamine the FIPS 199 impact level of the information system to
     confirm the criticality/sensitivity of the system in supporting its mission operations or
     business case. The resulting impact on organizational operations, organizational assets, or
     individuals may provide new insights as to the overall importance of the system in allowing
     the organization to fulfill its mission responsibilities.
•    Assess the current security state of the information system and reassess the current risk to
     organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals.
     The organization should investigate the information system vulnerability (or vulnerabilities)
     exploited by the threat source (or that are potentially exploitable by a threat source) and the
     security controls currently implemented within the system as described in the security plan.
     The exploitation of an information system vulnerability (or vulnerabilities) by a threat source
     may be traced to one or more factors including but not limited to: (i) the failure of currently
     implemented security controls; (ii) missing security controls; (iii) insufficient strength of
     security controls; and/or (iv) an increase in the sophistication or capability of the threat
     source. Using the results from the assessment of the current security state, the organization
     should reassess the risks to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals
     arising from use of the information system.
•    Plan for and initiate any necessary corrective actions.
     Based on the results of an updated risk assessment, the organization should determine what
     additional security controls and/or control enhancements may be necessary to address the
     vulnerability (or vulnerabilities) related to the event or what corrective actions may be needed
     to fix currently implemented controls deemed to be less than effective.
     The security plan for the information system should then be updated to reflect these
     corrective actions. A Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) should be developed for any
     deficiencies noted that are not immediately corrected and for the implementation of any
     security control upgrades or additional controls. After the security controls or control
     upgrades have been implemented and any other noted deficiencies corrected, the controls
     should be assessed for effectiveness. The assessment determines if the security controls are
     implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with
     respect to meeting the organization’s security policy.
•    Consider reaccrediting the information system.
     Depending on the severity of the event, the impact on organizational operations,
     organizational assets, or individuals, and the extent of the corrective actions required to fix
     the identified deficiencies in the information system, the organization may need to consider
     reaccrediting the information system in accordance with the provisions of NIST Special
     Publication 800-37. The authorizing official makes the final determination on the need to
     reaccredit the information system in consultation with the system and mission owners, the
     senior agency information security officer, and the chief information officer. The authorizing
     official may choose to conduct an abbreviated reaccreditation focusing only on the affected
     components of the information system and the associated security controls and/or control
     enhancements which have been changed during the update. Authorizing officials should have
     sufficient information from the security certification process to initiate, with an appropriate
     degree of confidence, the necessary corrective actions to adequately protect individuals and
     the organization’s operations and assets.
