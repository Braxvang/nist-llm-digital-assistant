Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of travel information on
the abilities of responsible agencies to plan, prepare, and monitor business related travel for the
organizationâ€™s employees. Generally, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of the
majority of travel information will result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of employee
identification information coupled with credit information (e.g., name, social security number,
credit card number) can result in moderate to serious consequences for individuals and local
organizations. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the
Personal Identity and Authentication information type.

Unauthorized disclosure of information concerning carrier/provider contract negotiations can
have significant financial or legal consequences and put an agency at a serious disadvantage.
Also, severe consequences may result from unauthorized disclosure of information regarding
leadership travel plans that might jeopardize personnel security or the confidentiality of sensitive
operations plans. In the most sensitive cases, the confidentiality impact level may be high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for travel information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of travel information partially depends
on the urgency with which the information is normally needed and the consequences of aborted
or modified travel.

In the case of travel planning information, the effects of such modifications are generally limited
with respect to agency mission capabilities or assets. There may be scenarios in which integrity
compromise of travel information may expose Federal leadership to harm or endanger a sensitive
or critical operation. However, most such scenarios are dealt with in the context of impacts to
mission operations information (Appendix D).

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
travel information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the travel information. The nature of
travel processes is usually tolerant of reasonable delays, at least on the agency mission scale.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
travel information is low.
