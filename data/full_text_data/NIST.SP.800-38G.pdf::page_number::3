This publication has been developed by NIST in accordance with its statutory responsibilities under the
Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, 44 U.S.C. § 3541 et seq., Public Law
(P.L.) 113-283. NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines,
including minimum requirements for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall
not apply to national security systems without the express approval of appropriate federal officials
exercising policy authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130.

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made mandatory
and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should
these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of
Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official. This publication may be used by
nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the United States.
Attribution would, however, be appreciated by NIST.

Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be identified in this document in order to describe an
experimental procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply recommendation or
endorsement by NIST, nor is it intended to imply that the entities, materials, or equipment are necessarily the best

There may be references in this publication to other publications currently under development by NIST in
accordance with its assigned statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication, including concepts and
methodologies, may be used by federal agencies even before the completion of such companion publications. Thus,
until each publication is completed, current requirements, guidelines, and procedures, where they exist, remain
operative. For planning and transition purposes, federal agencies may wish to closely follow the development of
these new publications by NIST

NOTE: August 4, 2016 – Although it was included in the draft of 800-38G posted for public comment on July 8,
2013, the following statement was unintentionally omitted when the final version was published in March 2016:

        “It is possible that implementation of modes included in this NIST Recommendation may involve an
        invention covered by patent rights. By publication of this Special Publication, no position is taken with
        respect to the validity, scope or enforceability of any claim(s) of any such patent rights in connection with
        such implementation. If a patent holder has filed with NIST a Letter of Assurance (LOA) with respect to
        any such patent rights, a copy of that LOA may be obtained from NIST.”
