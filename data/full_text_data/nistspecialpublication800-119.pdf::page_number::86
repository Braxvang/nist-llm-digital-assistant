The MN now computes the following and sends the BU:

   Kbm = SHA1(Home Keygen Token, Care-of Keygen Token)

   Binding Update Message Authentication Code (BU MAC) =
    First(96, HMAC-SHA1(Kbm, (Care-of Address | CN address | BU*)))

   BU = (Home Address Option, BU MAC, sequence number,
    Home Address Nonce Index, Care-of Address Nonce Index).
Figure 4-7 illustrates the BU and BUA path.
