 National Security System             Any information system (including any
 [44 U.S.C., Sec. 3542]               telecommunications system) used or operated by an
                                      agency or by a contractor of an agency, or other
                                      organization on behalf of an agency (i) the function,
                                      operation, or use of which involves intelligence activities;
                                      involves cryptologic activities related to national security;
                                      involves command and control of military forces;
                                      involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or
                                      weapons system; or is critical to the direct fulfillment of
                                      military or intelligence missions (excluding a system that
                                      is to be used for routine administrative and business
                                      applications, for example, payroll, finance, logistics, and
                                      personnel management applications); or (ii) is protected
                                      at all times by procedures established for information that
                                      have been specifically authorized under criteria
                                      established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress
                                      to be kept classified in the interest of national defense or
                                      foreign policy.
 Operational Controls                 The security controls (i.e., safeguards or
 [FIPS 200]                           countermeasures) for an information system that are
                                      primarily implemented and executed by people (as
                                      opposed to systems).
 Organization                         An entity of any size, complexity, or positioning within
 [FIPS 200, Adapted]                  an organizational structure (e.g., a federal agency or, as
                                      appropriate, any of its operational elements). See
                                      Enterprise.
 Plan of Action and                   A document that identifies tasks needing to be
 Milestones                           accomplished. It details resources required to accomplish
 [OMB Memorandum 02-01]               the elements of the plan, any milestones in meeting the
                                      tasks, and scheduled completion dates for the milestones.
 Reciprocity                          Mutual agreement among participating organizations to
                                      accept each other’s security assessments in order to reuse
                                      information system resources and/or to accept each
                                      other’s assessed security posture in order to share
                                      information.

 Risk                                 A measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened
 [CNSSI 4009]                         by a potential circumstance or event, and typically a
                                      function of: (i) the adverse impacts that would arise if the
                                      circumstance or event occurs; and (ii) the likelihood of
                                      occurrence.
                                      [Note: Information system-related security risks are those risks that
                                      arise from the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of
                                      information or information systems and reflect the potential adverse
                                      impacts to organizational operations (including mission, functions,
                                      image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other
                                      organizations, and the Nation.]
