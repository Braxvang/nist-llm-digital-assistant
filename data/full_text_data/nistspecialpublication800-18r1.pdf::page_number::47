                 Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


Technical         The security controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) for an
Controls          information system that are primarily implemented and executed by
[NIST SP 800-     the information system through mechanisms contained in the
18]               hardware, software, or firmware components of the system.
Threat           Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact
[CNSS Inst.      agency operations (including mission, functions, image, or
4009, Adapted]   reputation), agency assets, or individuals through an information
                 system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification
                 of information, and/or denial of service.
Threat           Either: (i) intent and method targeted at the intentional exploitation of
Agent/Source     a vulnerability; or (ii) a situation and method that may accidentally
[NIST SP 800-    trigger a vulnerability.

Threat           Formal description and evaluation of threat to an information system.
Assessment
[CNSS Inst.
4009]
Trusted Path     A mechanism by which a user (through an input device) can
                 communicate directly with the security functions of the information
                 system with the necessary confidence to support the system security
                 policy. This mechanism can only be activated by the user or the
                 security functions of the information system and cannot be imitated
                 by untrusted software.
User             Individual or (system) process authorized to access an information
[CNSS Inst.      system.
4009]
Vulnerability    Weakness in an information system, system security procedures,
[CNSS Inst.      internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or
4009, Adapted]   triggered by a threat source.
Vulnerability    Formal description and evaluation of the vulnerabilities in an
Assessment       information system.
