NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                            Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                   Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


   The internal state for the DRBG, including the working_state and administrative information
   (see Sections 8.3 and 10 for definitions of the working_state and administrative information).
Instantiate Process:
                                             Comment: Check the validity of the input
                                             parameters.
   1. If requested_instantiation_security_strength > highest_supported_security_strength, then
      return (ERROR_FLAG, Invalid).
   2. If prediction_resistance_flag is set, and prediction resistance is not supported, then return
      (ERROR_FLAG, Invalid).
   3. If the length of the personalization_string > max_personalization_string_length, return
      (ERROR_FLAG, Invalid).
   4. Set security_strength to the lowest security strength greater than or equal to
      requested_instantiation_security_strength from the set {112, 128, 192, 256}.
   5. Null step.                             Comment: This null step replaces a step from the
                                             original version of SP 800-90 without changing the
                                             step numbers.
                                             Comment: Obtain the entropy input.
   6.   (status, entropy_input) = Get_entropy_input (security_strength, min_length,
        max_length, prediction_resistance_request).
                                             Comment: status indications other than SUCCESS
                                             could be ERROR_FLAG or
                                             CATASTROPHIC_ERROR_FLAG, in which
                                             case, the status is returned to the consuming
                                             application to handle. The Get_entropy_input call
                                             could return a status of ERROR_FLAG to indicate
                                             that entropy is currently unavailable, and could
                                             return CATASTROPHIC_ERROR_FLAG to
                                             indicate that an entropy source failed.
   7. If (status â‰  SUCCESS), return (status, Invalid).
   8. Obtain a nonce.                        Comment: This step shall include any appropriate
                                             checks on the acceptability of the nonce. See
                                             Section 8.6.7.
                                             Comment: Call the appropriate instantiate algorithm
                                             in Section 10 to obtain values for the initial
                                             working_state.
   9. initial_working_state = Instantiate_algorithm (entropy_input, nonce,
      personalization_string, security_strength).
   10. Get a state_handle for a currently empty internal state. If an empty internal state cannot
       be found, return (ERROR_FLAG, Invalid).
