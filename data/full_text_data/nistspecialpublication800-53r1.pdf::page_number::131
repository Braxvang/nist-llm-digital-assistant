SC-5      DENIAL OF SERVICE PROTECTION

          Control: The information system protects against or limits the effects of the following types of
          denial of service attacks: [Assignment: organization-defined list of types of denial of service
          attacks or reference to source for current list].
          Supplemental Guidance: A variety of technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate the
          effects of denial of service attacks. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain
          types of packets to protect devices on an organizationâ€™s internal network from being directly
          affected by denial of service attacks. Information systems that are publicly accessible can be
          protected by employing increased capacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system restricts the ability of users to launch denial of service attacks against
                other information systems or networks.
          (2)   The information system manages excess capacity, bandwidth, or other redundancy to limit the
                effects of information flooding types of denial of service attacks.


           LOW SC-5                      MOD SC-5                     HIGH SC-5



SC-6      RESOURCE PRIORITY

          Control:   The information system limits the use of resources by priority.
          Supplemental Guidance: Priority protection helps prevent a lower-priority process from delaying or
          interfering with the information system servicing any higher-priority process.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW Not Selected              MOD Not Selected             HIGH Not Selected
