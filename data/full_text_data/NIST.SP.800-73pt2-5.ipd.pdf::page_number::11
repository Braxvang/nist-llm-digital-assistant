      NIST SP 800-73pt2-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)           Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 2
      September 2023                                              PIV Card Application Card Command Interface



210       Introduction
211   Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) called for the adoption of a common
212   identification standard to govern the interoperable use of identity credentials to allow physical
213   and logical access to federally controlled facilities and information systems. In response, Federal
214   Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201 [FIPS201], Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of
215   Federal Employees and Contractors, was developed to define reliable, government-wide identity
216   credentials for use in applications such as access to federally controlled facilities and information
217   systems. FIPS 201 supports multiple types of authenticators, including authenticators on smart
218   cards (also known as PIV cards) and derived PIV credential authenticators in various other form
219   factors. This publication contains technical specifications to interface with PIV Cards to retrieve
220   and use identity credentials. Other specifications, such as NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-
221   157r1 (Revision 1), contain procedures and life cycle activities to issue, maintain, and use
222   derived PIV credentials.

223           Purpose
224   FIPS 201 defines processes for binding identities to authenticators, such as the PIV Card and
225   derived PIV credentials used in the federal PIV system. SP 800-73-5 contains the technical
226   specifications to interface with the PIV Card to retrieve and use the identity credentials. The
227   specifications reflect the design goals of interoperability and PIV Card functions. The goals are
228   addressed by specifying a PIV data model, card edge interface, and application programming
229   interface. Moreover, SP 800-73-5 enumerates requirements for the options and branches in
230   international integrated circuit card (ICC) standards [ISO7816]. The specifications go further by
231   constraining interpretations of the normative standards to ease implementation, facilitate
232   interoperability, and ensure performance in a manner tailored for PIV applications.

233           Scope
234   SP 800-73-5 specifies the PIV data model, application programming interface (API), and card
235   interface requirements necessary to comply with the use cases, as defined in Section 6 of FIPS
236   201 and further described in Appendix B of SP 800-73-5 Part 1. Interoperability is defined as the
237   use of PIV identity credentials such that client-application programs, compliant card
238   applications, and compliant ICCs CAN be used interchangeably by all information processing
239   systems across federal agencies. SP 800-73-5 defines the PIV data elements’ identifiers,
240   structure, and format, as well as the client API and card command interface for use with the PIV
241   Card.
242   This document — SP 800-73-5, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 2 – PIV Card
243   Application Card Command Interface — contains the technical specifications for the PIV Card
244   command interface to the PIV Card. The specifications define the set of commands surfaced by
245   the PIV Card Application at the card edge of the ICC.
