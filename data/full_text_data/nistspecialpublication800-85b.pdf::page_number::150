Special Publication 800-85B                                  PIV Data Model Testing Specification


Precondition            1.    A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                        2.    A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and
                              the contact reader.
                        3.    The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                        4.    A card authentication key and corresponding certificate are present
                              on the PIV card.
Test Steps              1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                        2. Set OID := <<Card Authentication Certificate
                           (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.5.0)>>
                        3. Call pivGetData w/
                           • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                        4. Extract the subjectPublicKeyInfo->subjectPublicKey
                           from the certificate.
                        5. Parse the exponent from the extracted public key
Expected Result(s)      The exponent of the RSA asymmetric key for card authentication is
                        greater than or equal to 65,537.
