                                                                          GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


routers and Network Protection Devices (NPDs). Testing is conducted by independent laboratories; the
laboratories are accredited to perform the testing by ISO-certified accreditors. Vendors declare products
that have qualified as USGv6-compliant through the use of a Supplier's Declaration of Conformity
(SDOC), which enables potential users of the product to identity the capabilities that were tested and the
laboratory that conducted the testing.

NIST SP 500-267 does not address several classes of security devices including security event/log
management, vulnerability/patch management, flow (NetFlow, SFlow), forensic tools, and authentication
systems. Many vendors are able to process IPv6 traffic but lack capabilities to present the information
effectively, require IPv4 enabled equipment for management, or are not as feature-rich. Organizations
will have to develop capability profiles for their security tools.

Organizations should accept the possibility that they may not achieve full parity in their IPv4 and IPv6
environments and take steps to mitigate associated risks.

6.2     Addressing Security

Administrators often see IP addressing as an operational issue. The numbering plan can also affect the
organization’s security posture. The addressing structure defines the fundamental organization and
function of a network. Consider the following components in the IPv6 addressing plan to reduce threats
to security and privacy:

          Numbering plan
          Hierarchical addressing to support security segmentation
          Security implications of EUI-64 addresses
          Address management
          Privacy extension.

These components are covered individually in the following sections.

  6.2.1      Numbering Plan

The numbering plan describes how the organization subnets its IPv6 allocation. Most organizations
would likely receive a /48 address block. This will allow the organization to support 65,000 subnets.
Most of the RFCs concerned with numbering plans focus on address allocations above the site level, but
the numbering plan designer should be familiar with the IETF’s intent and philosophy of IPv6 addressing.
Some RFCs of interest include:

          RFC 3056 – Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds
          RFC 3879 – Deprecating Site Local Addresses
          RFC 4007 – IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture
          RFC 4193 – Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses
          RFC 4291 – IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture.
