complete.

Log Viewing: Displaying log entries in a human-readable format.

Message Digest: A digital signature that uniquely identifies data and has the property that changing a
single bit in the data will cause a completely different message digest to be generated.

Normalization: See “Log Normalization”.

Rule-Based Event Correlation: Correlating events by matching multiple log entries from a single
source or multiple sources based on logged values, such as timestamps, IP addresses, and event types.

capabilities for a variety of log types.
