Control Enhancement: (1) (4) No OT Discussion for this control.
Rationale for adding PE-6 (4) to MOD baseline: Many of the OT components are in remote
geographical and dispersed locations. Other components may be in ceilings, floors, or
distribution closets. Furthermore, physical access controls are frequently used as compensating
controls when devices lack the ability to enforce logical access restrictions.
