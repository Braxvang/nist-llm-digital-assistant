3027   3.17.3. Supply Chain Requirements and Processes
3028             REQUIREMENT: 03.17.03

3029             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
3030             Determine if:
3031             A.03.17.03.ODP[01]: the security requirements to protect against supply chain risks to
3032             the system, system components, or system services and to limit the harm or
3033             consequences from supply chain-related events are defined.
3034             A.03.17.03.a: a process for identifying and addressing weaknesses or deficiencies in the supply
3035             chain elements and processes is established.
3036             A.03.17.03.b: the following security requirements are enforced to protect against supply chain
3037             risks to the system, system components, or system services and to limit the harm or
3038             consequences of supply chain-related events: <A.03.17.03.ODP[01]: security requirements>.
