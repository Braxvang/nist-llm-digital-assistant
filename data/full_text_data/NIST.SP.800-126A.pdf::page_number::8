                                                                                              Specification versioning is the process of denoting a revision to a specification by changing its
                                                                                              version number. For example, the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) specification
                                                                                              documents are updated from time to time, and these updates trigger an increase in the SCAP
                                                                                              version number (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, etc.) What makes specification versioning challenging is that there
                                                                                              is no standard convention or terminology for it; each specification imparts different meanings
                                                                                              into its version numbers. For example, moving from version 3.4 to version 3.5 might break

                                                                                              and simply correct an error in a third specification.
