on the public path. The full range of policies that an enterprise ZTA implemented via a service
mesh can enable is outlined in [2] and [3].
Implementing multi-tier policies by relaxing network-tier policies (e.g., by allowing
communication across a set of gateways) while introducing identity-tier policies with advanced
layer seven controls results in a better overall security posture than either a purely identity-tier or
purely network-tier approach.
