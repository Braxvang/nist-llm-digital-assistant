The RMF steps in Fig. 15, while shown sequentially, can be implemented in a different order to
be consistent with established management and system development life cycle processes.

4.3.1. Prepare
The purpose of the Prepare step is to carry out essential activities at the organizational, mission
and business process, and system levels to help the organization manage its security and privacy
risks using the RMF. The Prepare step leverages activities that are already being conducted
within cybersecurity programs to emphasize the importance of having organization-wide
governance and resources in place to support risk management. Table 6 provides details on
applying the Prepare step to OT.
