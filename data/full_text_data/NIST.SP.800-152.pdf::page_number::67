SP 800-152                                                  A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


                          A Federal CKMS shall enter sensitive metadata into
PR:6.51
                          cryptographic modules in accordance with the [FIPS 140]
                          requirements for the entry of sensitive security parameters.
                          A Federal CKMS operating at the Moderate or High impact-
PR:6.52
                          levels shall enter keys and/or sensitive metadata into
                          cryptographic modules by means of a trusted channel.

                          A Federal CKMS operating at the Low impact-level should
PA:6.14
                          enter keys and/or sensitive metadata into cryptographic
                          modules by means of a trusted channel that employs either
                          identity-based authentication or role-based authentication of
                          the sending and receiving entities.

6.4.20 Output a Key and Associated Metadata from a Cryptographic Module
The key-output function of a cryptographic module outputs one or more keys and their
associated metadata from the module. The output of keys and metadata could be needed in
order to store (outside the cryptographic module), transfer, back up, or archive them. A
cryptographic module that serves as a key-generation facility for other FCKMS modules
would output keys prior to distribution.

As with key entry, a trusted channel is either required or recommended for key and sensitive
data output, depending on the impact-level of the system.

FR:6.60 The CKMS design shall specify how, and the circumstances under which, keys and
metadata can be output from a cryptographic module and the form in which they are output.

FR: 6.61 The CKMS design shall specify how the confidentiality and integrity of the output
keys and metadata are protected while outside of a cryptographic module.

FR:6.62 If a private key, symmetric key, or confidential metadata is output from the
cryptographic module in plaintext form, the CKMS design shall specify if and how the
calling entity is authenticated before the key and metadata are provided.

                          A Federal CKMS shall output keys from cryptographic
PR:6.53
                          modules in accordance with the requirements in [FIPS 140]
                          and the impact-levels associated with the keys.
                          A Federal CKMS shall output sensitive metadata from
PR:6.54
                          cryptographic modules in accordance with the [FIPS 140]
                          requirements for the output of sensitive security parameters.
                          A Federal CKMS operating at the Moderate or High impact-
PR:6.55
                          levels shall output keys and/or sensitive metadata from
                          cryptographic modules by means of a trusted channel.
