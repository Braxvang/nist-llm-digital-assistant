cybersecurity team will be beneficial in identifying potential impact areas due to cyber
vulnerabilities. Their insight into OT design and safety considerations will also help in
formulating cyber mitigations.
While the control engineers will play a large role in securing OT, they will not be able to do so
without collaboration and support from both the IT department and management. IT often has
years of cybersecurity experience, much of which is applicable to OT. As the cultures of control
engineering and IT are often significantly different, their integration will be essential for the
development of a collaborative security design and operation.
Organizations come in various sizes, structures, geographical spreads, and complexities. These
factors and the strategies related to resources and budget constraints may drive organizations to
hire OT cybersecurity resources as employees or contractors or outsource the OT security
operation function as a managed security service. Irrespective of the security operation and
resource model used, the responsibility for OT cybersecurity management should be integrated
with IT cybersecurity and the corporate risk management function.
The responsibility and accountability for implementing and managing cybersecurity functions
typically falls under the IT and OT infrastructure organization, whereas cybersecurity operational
metrics and risks are reported to the risk management office. These two lines of reporting
structure need to collaborate in terms of funding and expectations of what can be achieved given
a funding and resource level. The risk executive function works with executive management to
decide the risk tolerance and residual risk.
As part of building a cybersecurity team, the following tasks should be included:
     •     Establish and maintain cybersecurity roles and responsibilities for building, operating,
           and improving an OT cybersecurity program.
     •     Establish cybersecurity roles and responsibilities for third-party providers, which can
           include service providers, contractors, and other organizations that provide OT system
           development and services and security operation and management.
Further guidance for establishing a cross-functional team can be found in Section 4 and
Appendix D. Additional information with specific examples for establishing a cross-functional
team are also provided in NIST IR 8183A, Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile
Low Impact Level Example Implementations Guide [IR8183A].

3.3.3. Define the OT Cybersecurity Strategy
An organization-wide risk management strategy is foundational to developing an OT
cybersecurity strategy. 4 The OT cybersecurity strategy leverages the organization-wide risk
management strategy – including organization-defined risk tolerance, threats, assumptions,
constraints, priorities, and trade-offs – to further tailor the strategy to apply to the OT
cybersecurity program.
