Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Some proposal development
information used by specific Federal agencies (e.g., homeland security, law enforcement,
defense, intelligence community) is very sensitive or classified national security information.
National security information is outside the scope of this guideline. The sensitivity level
recommended for the very sensitive information is high. If the proposal development
information is moved to the public domain, the confidentiality impact level becomes Not
Applicable (NA).

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: In order to accommodate event-driven consequences of
unauthorized disclosure of pre-release drafts, the provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for proposal development information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external publication of
proposed legislation (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) might adversely affect inter-agency
relationships, relations with Congress, or public confidence in the agency. However, damage to
the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
proposal development information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the proposal development information.
Proposal development processes are usually tolerant of delays.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Excessive recovery delays can result in
damage to agency reputation and to interests associated with specific legislation. This can result
in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
proposal development information is low.
C.2.7.4 Congressional Liaison Operations Information Type

Congressional Liaison Operations involves all activities associated with supporting the formal
relationship between a Federal Agency and the U.S. Congress. Subject to exception conditions
described below, the recommended security categorization for the Congressional liaison
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of Congressional liaison
information on the ability of responsible agencies to support their formal relationships with U.S.
