GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



In addition to identifying incidents and supporting incident response efforts, organizations have found
other uses for IDPSs, including the following:

 Identifying security policy problems. An IDPS can provide some degree of quality control for
  security policy implementation, such as duplicating firewall rulesets and alerting when it sees
  network traffic that should have been blocked by the firewall but was not because of a firewall
  configuration error.
 Documenting the existing threat to an organization. IDPSs log information about the threats that
  they detect. Understanding the frequency and characteristics of attacks against an organizationâ€™s
  computing resources is helpful in identifying the appropriate security measures for protecting the
  resources. The information can also be used to educate management about the threats that the
  organization faces.
 Deterring individuals from violating security policies. If individuals are aware that their actions
  are being monitored by IDPS technologies for security policy violations, they may be less likely to
  commit such violations because of the risk of detection.
Because of the increasing dependence on information systems and the prevalence and potential impact of
intrusions against those systems, IDPSs have become a necessary addition to the security infrastructure of
nearly every organization.

2.2   Key Functions of IDPS Technologies

There are many types of IDPS technologies, which are differentiated primarily by the types of events that
they can recognize and the methodologies that they use to identify incidents. In addition to monitoring
and analyzing events to identify undesirable activity, all types of IDPS technologies typically perform the
following functions:

 Recording information related to observed events. Information is usually recorded locally, and
  might also be sent to separate systems such as centralized logging servers, security information and
  event management (SIEM) solutions, and enterprise management systems.
 Notifying security administrators of important observed events. This notification, known as an
  alert, occurs through any of several methods, including the following: e-mails, pages, messages on
  the IDPS user interface, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) traps, syslog messages, and
  user-defined programs and scripts. A notification message typically includes only basic information
  regarding an event; administrators need to access the IDPS for additional information.
 Producing reports. Reports summarize the monitored events or provide details on particular events
  of interest.
Some IDPSs are also able to change their security profile when a new threat is detected. For example, an
IDPS might be able to collect more detailed information for a particular session after malicious activity is
detected within that session. An IDPS might also alter the settings for when certain alerts are triggered or
what priority should be assigned to subsequent alerts after a particular threat is detected.

IPS technologies are differentiated from IDS technologies by one characteristic: IPS technologies can
respond to a detected threat by attempting to prevent it from succeeding. They use several response
techniques, which can be divided into the following groups:

 The IPS stops the attack itself. Examples of how this could be done are as follows:
