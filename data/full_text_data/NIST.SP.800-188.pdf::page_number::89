matical impact of SDL procedures (e.g., sampling, recoding, suppression, rounding, and
noise addition) and computes the possible impact on various statistical measurements. A
growing body of evidence indicates the need for agencies to evaluate the accuracy of the
de-identifed data to verify that the accuracy is suffcient for the intended use.
For example:
    • Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard ap-
      plied k-anonymity de-identifcation to educational data collected by a massive open
      online course operated by MITx and HarvardX on the edX platform and found that
      de-identifcation resulted in meaningful biases that changed the meaning of some
      statistics. In one case, de-identifcation decreased the reported number of enrolled
      female students from 29 % to 26 % because of the need to suppress attributes for
      specifc microdata [39].
    • Researchers at the University of Wisconsin and the Marshfeld Clinic Research Foun-
      dation performed an experiment in which they created a machine learning statistical
      model for Warfarin dosing based on clinical data. They showed that while differen-
      tial privacy could prevent training data extraction (also known as “model inversion”)
      from a trained model, levels of noise that offered suffcient privacy protection also
      resulted in decreased statistical performance in their simulated clinical trials. Using
      their vintage-2013 differential privacy models, they found that “for privacy budgets
      effective at preventing attacks, patients would be exposed to increased risk of stroke,
      bleeding events, and mortality” [63].
Approaches for evaluating data accuracy include [91]:
    • Demonstrating that machine learning algorithms trained on the de-identifed data can
      accurately predict the original data and vice versa
    • Verifying that statistical distributions do not incur undue bias because of the de-
      identifcation procedure
    • Publishing suffcient information about the statistical properties of the disclosure lim-
      itation methods to permit the correction of inferences using those properties
Agencies can create or adopt standards regarding the accuracy of de-identifed data. If
data accuracy cannot be well-maintained along with data privacy goals, then the release of
data that are inaccurate for statistical analyses could potentially result in incorrect scientifc
conclusions and incorrect policy decisions.
