2.5.2   Object Naming Service (ONS)

Finding information about a tagged object in an open system is a challenge because the information could
be located in any one of a number of analytic systems. To solve this problem, EPCglobal created the
Object Naming Service (ONS), which is a global distributed database of EPC tag identifiers. Users query
the ONS with a particular EPC, and the ONS returns the address information from the EPCIS that
contains information associated with that EPC. The user then queries the EPCIS directly to obtain the
desired data. The ONS is a resolution mechanism that directs an EPC query to where information
associated with that EPC can be found on the network. In order to do that, the ONS utilizes two tiers of
resolution services coordinated with the segments on the EPC string: the Root ONS and the Local ONS.

 The Root ONS is a community service administered by EPCglobal that provides an authoritative
  lookup service indexing all EPC Managers with the addresses of their Local ONS.
