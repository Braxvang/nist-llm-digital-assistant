         Note: Assistance and consultation includes the provision or recommendation of sources for
         security-relevant training, security aspects of documentation, vulnerability resolution, security
         reporting, and other security-relevant support services that enable the effective and secure use
         of the product or service.
         OP-4.2 Record and monitor requests and subsequent actions for security support.
         OP-4.3 Determine the degree to which the security aspects of delivered products and services
                satisfy the needs of stakeholders.

H.13. Maintenance
The purpose of the Maintenance process is to sustain the capability of the system to provide a
product or service.

H.13.1.            Security Purpose
-   Establish the security aspects of requirements and constraints to securely sustain the
    capability of the system to provide a product or service.
    Note: Secure sustainment includes all maintenance and logistics activities for the packaging,
    handling, storage, and transportation of replacement system elements.

H.13.2.            Security Outcomes
-   Security aspects of maintenance and logistics constraints that influence system requirements,
    architecture, or design are identified.
-   Enabling systems or services needed for the security aspects of system maintenance and
    logistics are available.
-   Replacement, repaired, or modified system elements are securely made available.
-   The need for required security-relevant maintenance and logistics actions is reported.
-   Security-relevant failures and life cycle data, including associated costs, are determined.

H.13.3.            Security Activities and Tasks
MA-1 PREPARE FOR MAINTENANCE AND LOGISTICS
         MA-1.1 Define the security aspects of the maintenance strategy.
         Note: The maintenance strategy seeks to preserve the secure capability and performance of the
         delivered system. The security aspects of the maintenance strategy generally include:
         - The secure transition of the system and system elements into a secure maintenance mode
             or state, as well as the secure transition back to operation
