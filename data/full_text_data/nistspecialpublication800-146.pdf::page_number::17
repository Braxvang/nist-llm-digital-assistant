                                                            CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



 Service API Changes. Providers generally reserve the right to change or delete service Application
  Programming Interfaces (APIs) at any time.
3.3   Obligations

Generally, consumers must agree to three key obligations:

 Acceptable Use Polices. Consumers generally must agree to refrain from storing illegal content,
  such as child pornography, and from conducting illegal activities such as: (1) gambling, (2) sending
  spam, (3) conducting security attacks (e.g., denial of service or hacking), (4) distributing spyware, (5)
  intrusive monitoring, and (6) attempting to subvert cloud system infrastructures. Acceptable use
  policies vary among providers.
 Licensed Software. All providers state that third-party software running in their clouds must
  conform to the software’s license terms. In some cases, providers bundle such software and include
  monitoring to ensure that license restrictions are enforced.
 Timely Payments. Cloud service costs are generally incurred gradually over a billing period, with
  the fee due to the provider at the period’s end. Failure to pay, after a grace period, usually subjects a
  consumer to suspension or termination “for cause” which can result in loss of consumer data.
3.4   Recommendations

 Terminology. Consumers should pay close attention to the terms that are used in service agreements.
  Common terms may be redefined by a cloud provider in ways that are specific to that provider's
  offerings.
 Remedies. Unless a specific service agreement has been negotiated with a provider, remedies for any
  failures are likely to be extremely limited; consumers may wish to formulate and negotiate remedies
  that are commensurate with damage that might be sustained.
 Compliance. Consumers should carefully assess whether the service agreement specifies compliance
  with appropriate laws and regulations governing consumer data.
 Security, Criticality, and Backup. Consumers should carefully examine the service agreement for
  any disclaimers relating to security or critical processing, and should also search for any comment on
  whether the provider recommends independent backup of data stored in their cloud.
 Negotiated Service Agreement. If the terms of the default service agreement do not address all
  consumer needs, the consumer should discuss modifications of the service agreement with the
  provider prior to use.
 Service Agreement Changes. Be aware that, depending on the details of the service agreement, a
  provider may change the terms of service with a specified level of advance notice. Changes may
  affect both price and quality of service. It is prudent to develop a plan to migrate workloads to
  alternate cloud providers, or back on-premise, in the event that a change in service terms is
  unacceptable.
