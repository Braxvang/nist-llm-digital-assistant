                                                           CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



ÔÅÆ Although marketing literature may make broad claims about cloud system reliability, security, etc.,
  the terms of the service agreements define the actual (legal) obligations of providers. Section 3
  describes these terms in greater detail.
4.7   The Hybrid Cloud Scenario

As given by the cloud definition in Section 2, a hybrid cloud is composed of two or more private,
community, or public clouds. As presented in this section, both the private and the community
deployment models have two significant variations: on-site and outsourced. The variations are significant
because they have different performance, reliability, and security properties, among others. A hybrid
cloud, consequently, is a composition of clouds where each constituent cloud is one of the five variants.
There are many conceivable configurations of hybrid clouds and it is not realistic to enumerate them.
However, the space of possibilities and the potential challenges can be illustrated.

Figure 8 depicts a theoretical hybrid cloud composed of a number of constituent clouds representing all of
the deployment model variants. The figure depicts access points into the constituent clouds as well as the
network connectivity between them. Security policies governing the flow of information and access to
resources could be implemented in a wide variety of ways, e.g., based on policies applied by each
individual constituent cloud. Additionally, global issues such as identity management and shared
standards for authentication and information protection within the hybrid cloud are not shown. A further
complication not shown is that a hybrid cloud may change over time with constituent clouds joining and
leaving.
