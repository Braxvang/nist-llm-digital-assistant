NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                    Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
December 2023                                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers


   Identifier                                 Issuer Control                                                 Source

                       recognition of a name change, or any other mechanism permitted by
                       state law or regulation) (review, observe).
                  (ii) The card issuer notifies the respective adjudicative entity of the
                       name change to ensure that appropriate records are updated, if
                       required (review).
    MP-20       During a PIV Card activation reset, no more than 10 consecutive activation [FIPS201], Sec. 2.9.3 – PIV Card
    (NEW)       retries for each of the activation methods (i.e., PIN and OCC attempts) are Activation Reset
                permitted.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                  (i) The issuer does not permit more than 10 consecutive activation
                      retries when attempting to reset the PIN or OCC (review, observe).
    MP-21       When a PIN reset is performed at a supervised remote identity proofing           [FIPS201], Sec. 2.9.3 – PIV Card
    (NEW)       station, the issuer initiates a biometric verification to ensure that the        Activation Reset
                cardholder’s biometric characteristics captured at the station elicit a positive
                biometric verification decision when compared to biometric data records
                stored in the PIV enrollment record or when compared to the biometric data
                records on the PIV Card using the OCCAUTH authentication mechanism. If
                the biometric verification decision is negative or the cardholder’s biometric
                characteristics are not successfully acquired, the cardholder provides
                another primary identity source document via the scanners and sensors
                integrated into the station. The remote operator inspects the document and
                compares the video feed of the cardholder with the electronic facial image
                retrieved from the enrollment data record and the photograph printed on the
                PIV Card.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                   (i) All protections and requirements of [FIPS201], Sec. 2.7.1 are
                       observed during the procedure (review, observe).
                  (ii) The PIV Card PIN is only reset after a positive biometric verification
                       decision (review, observe).
                 (iii) If the biometric verification decision is negative, the cardholder
                       provides another primary identity source document via the scanners
                       and sensors integrated into the station. The remote operator
                       inspects the document and compares the video feed of the
                       cardholder with the electronic facial image retrieved from the
                       enrollment data record and the photograph printed on the PIV Card
                       (interview, observe).
    MP-22       When an OCC reset is performed in person at the issuing facility, the issuer [FIPS201], Sec. 2.9.3 – OCC Reset
    (NEW)       performs a biometric verification of the cardholder to the biometric data
                records in the PIV enrollment record before the reset. If the biometric
                verification decision is negative or no alternative biometric data records are
                available, the cardholder provides another primary identity source
                document, which is inspected and compared to the cardholder with the
                electronic facial image retrieved from the enrollment data record and the
                photograph printed on the PIV Card.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                   (i) Both fingerprints used for OCC are replaced during an OCC reset
                       (observe, test).
                  (ii) The reset PIV Card is only released to the cardholder after a
                       positive biometric verification decision (review, observe).
