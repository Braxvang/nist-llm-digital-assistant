  4.1.4    Cipher Suite

This document specifies two cipher suites (see Table 14) that may be used for key establishment and
secure messaging, one that provides 128 bits of channel strength and one that provides 192 bits of channel
strength. If the PIV Card Application supports the VCI and either the digital signature key ('9C'), the key
management key ('9D'), or one of the retired key management keys ('82' – '95') is an ECC (Curve P-384)
key, then PIV Card Application shall only support cipher suite CS7. Otherwise, the PIV Card Application
may support either CS2 or CS7.
