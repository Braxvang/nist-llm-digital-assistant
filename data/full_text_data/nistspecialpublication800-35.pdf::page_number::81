Appendix E—FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS


1. For whom is the guide intended?
   The Guide to Information Technology Security Services is intended for any IT security stakeholder
   who is responsible for initiating, managing, performing, or terminating an IT security service.
   Additionally, business managers will find utility in that the document provides a framework that an
   organization can assess the performance of a current service and service provider and establish
   whether alternatives will provide a greater return on investment.

2. Why was this guide written?
   The guide was written to provide IT security stakeholders with a life-cycle framework for initiating,
   managing, performing, and terminating IT security services. Organizations are increasingly trying to
   maximize the return on their investment in security and other IT investments. As organizations seek
   to find appropriate service providers as well as effective security services, a framework was needed to
   initiate, manage, perform, and terminate IT security services.

3. What are IT security services?

    IT security services can be categorized in a number of ways. In this document they are categorized as
    either management, operational or technical services. Management IT security services are services
    that focus on managing the IT security program and risk within the organization, such as security
    policy development or risk management. Operational security services focus on security controls
    implemented and executed by people (as opposed to systems), such as network testing or training and
    awareness. Finally, technical services are services focused on security controls executed by an IT
    system, such as firewalls and intrusion detection. This document provides a sampling of possible IT
    security services.

4. What is the IT security service life cycle?

    The IT security service life cycle is a six-phased approach to initiating, managing, performing, and
    terminating IT security services. The six phases are:

     Initiation
     Assessment
     Solution
     Implementation
     Operations
     Closeout
5. Who has a role in the IT security service life cycle?

    The list of participants who will select, assessment, implement and manage an IT security service will
    depend on the type and scope of the service, service arrangement, and type of organization. Key
    players can include the Chief Information Officer (CIO), contracting officer, contracting officer’s
    technical representative, IT investment board, IT security program manager, IT system security
    officer, program manager/procurement initiator, and privacy officer, among others.
