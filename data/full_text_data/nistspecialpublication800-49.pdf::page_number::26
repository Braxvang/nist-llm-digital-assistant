                              Federal S/MIME V3 Client Profile



              RSA (RFC2313): The RSA key exchange algorithm identified in [RFC2313]
                    MUST be supported as specified in Clause 2.1.1.1 of this profile.

              Diffie-Hellman: Implementations SHOULD support the Diffie-Hellman Key
                     Agreement method as defined in [RFC2631] as specified in Clause 2.1.1.2
                     of this profile.

              RSA (X9.44): The RSA Key Exchange Algorithm identified in [ANSIX9.44]
                    MAY be supported.

              Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (X9.63): The Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Key
                      Agreement Algorithm identified in X9.63 [ANSIX9.63] MAY be
                      supported.

       Note: Currently no standard methods are defined for using RSA (X9.44) or Elliptic
             Curve Diffie-Hellman (X9.63) with S/MIME.

A.5 Algorithm Suites
     Secure Hash Algorithms (Message Digest Algorithms), Symmetric Encryption
     Algorithms, Digital Signature Algorithms, and Key Management Algorithms are used
     together in algorithm suites to provide a full set of cryptographic security services for
     S/MIME. Each algorithm suite contains one of each of the cryptographic algorithm types
     to provide the cryptographic services. It is important that all of the components of each
     suite provide comparable protection against cryptographic attack. The following list of
     algorithm suites is identified for use within S/MIME V3:

              SHA-1 hash algorithm, RSA (RFC 2313) for digital signature, RSA (RFC 2313)
                    for key transport, Triple-DES [FIPS46-3] for content encryption.
                    Implementations of S/MIME V3 MUST support this suite of algorithms.
                    (See Clause 2.1.1.1.)

              SHA-1 hash algorithm, DSA for digital signature, RSA (RFC 2313) for key
                    transport, Triple-DES for content encryption. Implementations of
                    S/MIME V3 MUST support this suite of algorithms. (See Clause 2.1.1.1)

              SHA-1 hash algorithm, DSA for digital signature, Diffie-Hellman (RFC2631) for
                    key agreement, Triple-DES for content encryption. Implementations of
                    S/MIME V3 SHOULD support this suite of algorithms. (See Clause
                    2.1.1.2.)

              SHA-1 hash algorithm, rDSA for digital signature, RSA [ANSIX9.44] for key
                    transport, Triple-DES for content encryption. Implementations of
                    S/MIME V3 MAY support this suite of algorithms.
