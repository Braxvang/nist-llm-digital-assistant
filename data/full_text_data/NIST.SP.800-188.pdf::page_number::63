       scar or tattoo), an identifer may be “burned in” to the image area (e.g., an identi-
       fcation plate with a patient name is included in an X-Ray), or an identifer may be
       present in the fle metadata. The body part in the image itself may also be recognized
       using a biometric algorithm and dataset [66, p. 35].
    • Genetic sequences and other kinds of sequence information can be identifed by us-
      ing existing databanks that match sequences and identities. There is also evidence
      that genetic sequences from individuals who are not in datasets can be matched
      through genealogical triangulation – a process that uses genetic information and
      other information as quasi-identifers to single out a specifc identity [66, p. 36].
      At present, there is no known method to reliably de-identify genetic sequences.
      Specifc issues regarding the de-identifcation of genetic information is discussed
      in Sec. 4.3.6, “De-Identifying Genomic Information.”
In many cases, data are complex and contain multiple modalities. Such mixtures may
complicate risk determinations.

4.3.    De-Identifcation by Removing Identifers and Transforming Quasi-Identifers
De-identifcation based on removing identifers and transforming quasi-identifers is one of
the most common approaches currently in use. It has the advantage of being conceptually
straightforward, and there is a long institutional history of using this approach within both
federal statistical agencies and the healthcare industry. This approach has the disadvantage
of not being based on formal methods for ensuring privacy protection.
Below is a sample process for de-identifying data by removing identifers and transforming
quasi-identifers:30
   1. Determine the re-identifcation risk threshold. The organization determines accept-
      able risk for working with the dataset and possibly mitigating controls based on
      strong precedents and standards.31
   2. Determine the information in the dataset that could be used to identify the data sub-
      jects. Identifying information can include:
       Direct identifers, such as names, phone numbers, and other information that un-
            ambiguously identifes an individual.
       Quasi-identifers that could be used in a linkage attack. Typically, quasi-identifers
           identify multiple individuals and can be used to triangulate a specifc individual.
