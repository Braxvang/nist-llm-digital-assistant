                                     ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



4.    Security Framework for Robust Security Networks

The IEEE 802.11i amendment allows for enhanced security features beyond WEP and the simple IEEE
802.11 shared key challenge-response authentication. The amendment introduces the concepts of Robust
Security Networks (RSN) and Robust Security Network Associations (RSNA). This section explains
these terms and describes e security framework for RSN. It also discusses the reasons for creating RSNs.
It then explains what constitutes an RSN and an RSNA. The section discusses the cryptographic key
hierarchies that relate keys and introduce the alternatives for key distribution. Finally, it describes the two
RSN data confidentiality and integrity protocols defined in IEEE 802.11i—Temporal Key Integrity
Protocol (TKIP) and Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol
(CCMP)—and their security features.

This section contains considerable detail on the internal operations of IEEE 802.11 WLANs. It includes
detailed descriptions of encryption and decryption procedures, IEEE 802.11 network element message
flows, and various protocols. Readers without a need for this technical detail might wish to skim or skip
portions of this section, and then read the summary in Section 4.4 carefully.

4.1   Features of RSNs

With the addition of the IEEE 802.11i amendment in 2004, IEEE 802.11 offers two general classes of
security capabilities for IEEE 802.11 WLANs. The first class, pre-RSN security, includes the legacy
security capabilities developed in the original IEEE 802.11 specification: open system or shared key
authentication for validating the identity of a wireless station, and WEP for the confidentiality protection
of traffic. The second class of security capabilities includes a number of security mechanisms to create
RSNs. An RSN includes security enhancements to address all the known flaws of WEP and provide
robust protection for the wireless link, including data integrity and confidentiality. Figure 4-1 provides a
high-level taxonomy of the major pre-RSN and RSN security mechanisms.
