Special Publication 800-85B                                  PIV Data Model Testing Specification


Expected Result(s)      A KeyPurposeId asserting id-PIV-cardAuth exists in the extended key
                        usage extension.


11.4.2.4 Verify authority information access extension

Purpose                 Confirms the authority information access extension is populated with
                        the location to the OCSP Server that provides status information for this
                        certificate.
Reference(s)            1.    FIPS201, Section 5.4.2.1
                        2.    AS07.04.08
Precondition            1.    A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                        2.    A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and
                              the contact reader.
                        3.    The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                        4.    A card authentication key and corresponding certificate are present
                              on the PIV card.
Test Steps              1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                        2. Set OID := <<Card Authentication Certificate
                           (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.5.0)>>
                        3. Call pivGetData w/
                           • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                        4. Extract the AuthorityInfoAccess->accessMethod and
                              AuthorityInfoAccess->accessLocation extension fields
                              from the certificate
Expected Result(s)      An accessMethod containing id-ad-ocsp is present. The accessLocation
                        for this AccessMethod is of type uniformResourceIdentifier and that the
                        scheme is “http” (not “https”).


11.4.2.5 Verify interim status extension

Purpose                 Confirms that the piv-interim extension is present in the certificate.
Reference(s)            1.    FIPS201, Appendix D
                        2.    AS07.04.10
Precondition            1.    A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                        2.    A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and
                              the contact reader.
                        3.    The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                        4.    A card authentication key and corresponding certificate are present
                              on the PIV card.
