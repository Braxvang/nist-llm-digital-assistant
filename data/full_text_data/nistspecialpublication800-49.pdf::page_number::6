    Cryptographic Algorithm                 RSA for digital signature [RFC2313] with SHA-1
    Suite 1 (ALS1)                          hash algorithm [FIPS180-1], RSA for key transport
                                            [RFC2313], Triple-DES [FIPS46-3] for content
                                            encryption (RSA Key Sizes >= 1024 bits)

    Cryptographic Algorithm                 DSA for digital signature [FIPS186-2] with SHA-1
    Suite 2 (ALS2)                          hash algorithm [FIPS180-1], RSA [RFC2313] for key
                                            transport, Triple-DES [FIPS46-3] for content
                                            encryption (DSA Key Size =1024 bits) (RSA Key
                                            Size >= 1024 bits)

    Public Key Infrastructure               Senders/receivers require valid X.509 certificates
    (PKI)                                   (Conformance to Federal PKI X.509 Certificate and
                                            CRL Extensions Profile required)

Note that compliant implementations can generate “clear” signed messages using RSA or DSA
signature algorithms. (“Clear” signed messages can be read by non S/MIME-enabled clients,
although signatures cannot be automatically processed and verified by such clients.) S/MIME
signed messages may include the time that signatures were generated as well as the sender’s PKI
certificates. The sender’s PKI certificates (also known as X.509 certificates) can be used to
verify the sender’s identity and help to enable other security services.

 FIPS-140 defines four levels of security. The appropriate security level is determined by the sensitivity of the
data. Cryptographic module security levels are thus chosen on the basis of data sensitivity, and this selection is
beyond the scope of this profile. See Clause 1 of [FIPS 140-2] for a description of security levels.
