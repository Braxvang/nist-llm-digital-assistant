Information Technology Security Training Requirements




        INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING MATRIX                            — Cell 3.2E
 Training Area: System Life Cycle Security             — Development
 Functional Specialty: Review & Evaluate

 Definition    —        The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an IT system
                        from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                        model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                        Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                        ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                        needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                        The development phase is the series of steps followed to ensure that
                        security requirements are considered, resolved, and incorporated as
                        information systems and technologies are developed or changed.

 Behavioral Outcome         —   Individuals responsible for review and evaluation are able to
                                examine development efforts at specified milestones to ensure that
                                approved safeguards are in place and documented.

 Sample Learning Objectives —

 At the conclusion of this module, individuals will be able to:

 1.     Beginning   — Review IT system development documents        for inclusion of appropriate
        safeguards.


 2.     Intermediate   — Review and    evaluate IT system development documents to ensure that
        system safeguards, as a whole, result in an acceptable level of risk.


  3.    Advanced    — Evaluate   configuration controls, review development of security test plans
        and procedures, and ensure that security requirements are documented and comply with the
        formal design specification.
