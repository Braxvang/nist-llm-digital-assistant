•    Individuals with information system/security design, development and implementation
     responsibilities (e.g., program managers, enterprise architects, information security architects,
     information system/security engineers; information systems integrators); and
•    Individuals with information security assessment and monitoring responsibilities (e.g., system
     evaluators, penetration testers, security control assessors, independent verifiers/validators,
     inspectors general, auditors).

1.3 RELATED PUBLICATIONS
The risk management approach described in this publication is supported by a series of security
standards and guidelines necessary for managing information security risk. In particular, the
Special Publications developed by the Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative11 supporting the
unified information security framework for the federal government include:
•    Special Publication 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal
     Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach;
•    Special Publication 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information
     Systems and Organizations;
•    Special Publication 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal
     Information Systems and Organizations; and
•    Draft Special Publication 800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments.12

In addition to the Joint Task Force publications listed above, the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) publish standards
for risk management and information security including:
•    ISO/IEC 31000, Risk management – Principles and guidelines;
•    ISO/IEC 31010, Risk management – Risk assessment techniques;
•    ISO/IEC 27001, Information technology – Security techniques – Information security
     management systems – Requirements; and
•    ISO/IEC 27005, Information technology – Security techniques – Information security risk
     management systems.

NIST’s mission includes harmonization of international and national standards where appropriate.
The concepts and principles contained in this publication are intended to implement for federal
information systems and organizations, an information security management system and a risk
management process similar to those described in ISO/IEC standards. This reduces the burden on
organizations that must conform to both ISO/IEC standards and NIST standards and guidance.

  Special Publication 800-39 supersedes the original Special Publication 800-30 as the source for guidance on risk
management. Special Publication 800-30 is being revised to provide guidance on risk assessment as a supporting
document to Special Publication 800-39.
