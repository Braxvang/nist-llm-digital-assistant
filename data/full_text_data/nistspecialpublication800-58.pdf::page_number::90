      Integrity threats include any in which system functions or data may be corrupted,
      either accidentally or as a result of malicious actions. Misuse may involve
      legitimate users (i.e. insiders performing unauthorized operations) or intruders.

      A legitimate user may perform an incorrect, or unauthorized, operations function
      (e.g., by mistake or out of malice) and may cause deleterious modification,
      destruction, deletion, or disclosure of switch software and data. This threat may
      be caused by several factors including the possibility that the level of access
      permission granted to the user is higher than what the user needs to remain
      functional.

      Intrusion - An intruder may masquerade as a legitimate user and access an
      operations port of the switch. There are a number of serious intrusion threats. For
      example, the intruder may use the permission level of the legitimate user and
      perform damaging operations functions such as:

      •     disclosing confidential data
      •     causing service deterioration by modifying the switch software
      •     crashing the switch
      •     removing all traces of the intrusion (e.g., modifying the security log) so that it
            may not be readily detected

      Insecure state - At certain times the switch may be vulnerable due to the fact that
      it is not in a secure state. For example:

      •     After a system restart, the old security features may have been reset to
            insecure settings, and new features may not yet be activated. (For example, all
            old passwords may have reverted to the default system-password, even though
            new passwords are not yet assigned.) The same may happen at the time of a
            disaster recovery.

      •     At the time of installation the switch may be vulnerable until the default
            security features have been replaced.


DHCP Server Insertion Attack

          It is often possible to change the configuration of a target phone by exploiting
          the DHCP response race when the IP phone boots. As soon as the IP phone
          requests a DHCP response, a rogue DHCP server can initiate a response with
          data fields containing false information.

          This attack allows for possible man in the middle attacks on the IP-media
          gateway, and IP Phones. Many methods exist with the potential to reboot the
