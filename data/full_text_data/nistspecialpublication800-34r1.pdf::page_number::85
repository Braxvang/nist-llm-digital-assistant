                                                CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS




APPENDIX F DIAGRAMS (SYSTEM AND INPUT/OUTPUT)

NOTE: Information for this section should be available from the system’s System Security Plan (SSP) and
can be copied from the SSP, or reference the applicable section in the SSP and attach the latest version of
the SSP to this contingency plan. Include any system architecture, input/output, or other technical or
logical diagrams that may be useful in recovering the system. Diagrams may also identify information
about interconnection with other systems.

APPENDIX G HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE INVENTORY

Provide the hardware and software inventory for the system. Inventory information should include type
of server or hardware on which the system runs, processors and memory requirements, storage
requirements, and any other pertinent details. The software inventory should identify the operating
system (including service pack or version levels, and any other applications necessary to operate the
system, such as database software).

APPENDIX H INTERCONNECTIONS TABLE

NOTE: Information for this section should be available from the system’s System Security Plan (SSP) and
can be copied from the SSP, or reference the applicable section in the SSP and attach the latest version of
the SSP to this contingency plan. This appendix includes information on other systems that directly
interconnect or exchange information with the system. Interconnection information should include the
type of connection, information transferred, and contact person for that system.

If the system does not have any direct interconnections, then this appendix may be removed, or the
following statement may be used:

{System name} does not directly interconnect with any other systems.

APPENDIX I TEST AND MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE

All ISCPs should be reviewed and tested at the organization defined frequency (e.g. yearly) or whenever
there is a significant change to the system. Provide information and a schedule for the testing of the
system. For low-impact systems, a yearly tabletop exercise is sufficient. The tabletop exercise should
include all ISCP points of contact, and be conducted by an outside or impartial observer. A formal test
plan is developed prior to the tabletop, and an exercise and questions are developed to include key
sections of the ISCP, including a walk-through of the following:
   Notification procedures;
   System recovery on an alternate platform from backup media;
   Internal and external connectivity; and
   Reconstitution procedures.

Results of the test are documented in an After Action Report, and Lessons Learned are developed for
updating information in the ISCP.

The following is a sample of a yearly test and maintenance schedule for a low-impact system:
