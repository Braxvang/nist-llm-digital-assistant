FR:6.20 The CKMS design shall specify the underlying random number generators that
are used to generate symmetric and private keys.

6.4.2 Register Owner
The initial registration of a security entity (i.e., individual (person), organization, device
or process) and a cryptographic key with metadata is a fundamental requirement of every
CKMS. This requirement is difficult to fully automate while preserving security (i.e.,
protecting from an impersonation threat) and thus, it usually requires human interactions.
There typically exists a registration process in a CKMS that binds each entity’s initial set
of secret, public, or private keys with the entity’s identifier and perhaps other metadata.
The process of binding an owner’s identifiers and keys involves either an initial identity
proofing of the owners or relying on the pre-existing identity of the owner in the CKMS.

FR:6.21 The CKMS design shall specify all the processes involved in owner registration,
including the process for binding keys with the owner’s identifier.

6.4.3 Activate Key
The activation function provides for the transition of a cryptographic key from the pre-
activation state to the active state. This function may automatically activate the key
immediately after generation. Alternatively, this function may generate a date-time
metadata value that indicates when the key becomes active and can be used. A
deactivation date-time may also be established using this function.

FR:6.22 The CKMS design shall specify how each key type is activated and the
circumstances for activating the key.

FR:6.23 For each key type, the CKMS design shall specify requirements for the
notification of key activation, including which parties are notified, how they are notified,
what security services are applied to the notification, and the time-frames for
notification(s) 10.

6.4.4 Deactivate Key
This function transitions a key into the deactivated state. A cryptographic key is generally
given a deactivation date and time when it is created and distributed. In some instances,
deactivation may also be based on the number of uses or the amount of data protected.
This deactivation information may be associated with the key as metadata. The period of
time between activation and deactivation is generally considered the cryptoperiod of a
key. This time usually has a maximum value based, in part, on the sensitivity levels of the
data it is protecting and the threats that could be brought against the CKMS (see [SP 800-
57-part1] for further discussion). The cryptoperiod can be shortened, based on the
concerns of the cryptographic officer in charge of the key and data. The CKMS Security

  For example, notification could be once immediately before activation, or every n units of time
until activation, starting at some time in advance, or with increasing frequency as the activation
time approaches.
