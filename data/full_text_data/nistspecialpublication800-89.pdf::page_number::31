SP 800-89                                                                November 2006



   4. Owner obtains assurance from a TTP via the regeneration of key(s):
            a. Determine the appropriate value of d. For example, d may be selected in
               accordance with the assurance of possession model described in Section
               6.2, along with appropriate values of a, b and c.
               If the TTP will be responsible for assigning the assurance_time, then the
               value of d shall be made known to the TTP.
            b. The owner and/or the TTP shall determine a value for t1 that is trusted by
               the owner (see Sections 6.2 and 6.3.2.1).
            c. The owner shall provide the owner’s currently-held keys to the trusted
               party, along with any other necessary data.
            d. The TTP shall:
               •   Regenerate the owner’s entire key pair, or
               •   Regenerate one key of the owner’s key pair from the currently-held
                   value of the other key of that pair.
            e. The TTP shall compare the value(s) of the regenerated key(s) with the
               key(s) currently held by the owner.
            f. If the regenerated and currently-held keys match:
               •   The owner shall be notified of the successful comparison.
               •   The owner and/or the TTP shall determine a value for t2 that is trusted
                   by the owner (see Sections 6.2 and 6.3.2.1).
               •   Provided that t1 ≤ t2 ≤ t1+d, either the owner or the TTP shall assign
                   the assurance_time and the initial assurance level (see Sections 6.3.2.1
                   and 6.3.2.2).
                   The party who assigns the assurance_time must know the value of d,
                   as well as the values of t1 and t2; the party who assigns the initial
                   assurance level must also be aware of the method(s) used to determine
                   t1 and t2.
               •   The owner shall record the assurance_time and the initial level of
                   assurance.

6.5.2 Assurance Obtained by a Trusted Third Party from the Owner
A TTP – who will be required to provide assurance to others of the owner’s possession of
the private key – shall first explicitly obtain that assurance from the owner either by
verifying an assurance signature or by regeneration of the owner’s key(s). In the case of
regeneration, the TTP must be relied upon not to use knowledge of the owner’s key pair
to generate digital signatures. This trust must be shared by the owner of the key pair,
potential signature-verifiers, and any other parties relying on the validity of the owner’s
signatures. The use of assurance signatures is preferred.
