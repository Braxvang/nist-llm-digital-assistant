                                                              CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



Unfortunately, none of these considerations is decisive regarding cloud security and there are no obvious
answers when comparing cloud to non-cloud systems as to which is likely to be more secure in practice.
One aspect that is pervasive in cloud systems, however, is reliance on "logical separation", as opposed to
"physical separation" of user workloads, and the use of logical mechanisms to protect consumer
resources. Although more traditional systems employ logical separation also, they also employ physical
separation (e.g., physically separated networks or systems) and logical separation has not been shown to
be as reliable as physical separation; e.g. in the past, some virtualization systems have experienced
failures under stress testing [Orm07]. The following subsections briefly describe some security issues;
NIST SP 800-144 also discusses security issues for public clouds.

8.5.1   Risk of Unintended Data Disclosure

Unclassified government systems are often operated in a manner where a single system is used to process
PII, FOUO, or proprietary information, as well as to process non-sensitive, public information. In a
typical scenario, a user will store sensitive and nonsensitive information in separate directories on a
system or in separate mail messages on an email server. By doing so, sensitive information is expected to
be carefully managed to avoid unintended distribution. If a consumer wishes to use cloud computing for
non-sensitive computing, while retaining the security advantages of on premises resources for sensitive
computing, care must be taken to store sensitive data in encrypted form only.

8.5.2   Data Privacy

Privacy addresses the confidentiality of data for specific entities, such as consumers or others whose
information is processed in a system. Privacy carries legal and liability concerns, and should be viewed
not only as a technical challenge but also as a legal and ethical concern. Protecting privacy in any
computing system is a technical challenge; in a cloud setting this challenge is complicated by the
distributed nature of clouds and the possible lack of consumer awareness over where data is stored and
who has or can have access.

8.5.3   System Integrity

Clouds require protection against intentional subversion or sabotage of the functionality of a cloud.
Within a cloud there are stakeholders: consumers, providers, and a variety of administrators. The ability
to partition access rights to each of these groups, while keeping malicious attacks at bay, is a key attribute
of maintaining cloud integrity. In a cloud setting, any lack of visibility into a cloud's mechanisms makes
it more difficult for consumers to check the integrity of cloud-hosted applications.

8.5.4   Multi-tenancy

Cloud computing receives significant economic efficiencies from the sharing of resources on the
provider’s side. For IaaS clouds, different VMs may share hardware via a hypervisor; for PaaS, different
processes may share an operating system and supporting data and networking services; for SaaS, different
consumers may share the same application or database.

Because the sharing mechanisms employed at a provider’s facility depend on complex utilities to keep
consumer workloads isolated, the risk of isolation failure exists. Flaws in logical separation have been
documented in the past [Orm07].

Building confidence that logical separation is a suitable substitute for physical separation is a long-
standing research problem, but the issue can be somewhat mitigated by encrypting data before entering it
into a cloud. (Note that if the data is encrypted, it will need to be unencrypted to be processed.) For clouds
