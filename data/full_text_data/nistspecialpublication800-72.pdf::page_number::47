6.2.1   Investigative Methods

        Investigative methods are procedures the investigative team can apply, which require no
        forensic software or hardware tools. The most obvious methods are the following:

                     Ask the suspect – If a device is protected with password, PIN, token, or other
                     authentication mechanism involving knowledge-based authentication, the suspect can
                     be queried for this information during the initial interview.

                     Review seized material – Passwords are frequently written down on a slip of paper
                     and kept with or near the device, at a desktop computer used to synchronize with the
                     device, or on the suspect’s person, such as within a wallet, and may be recovered
                     through visual inspection.

                     Manually supply commonly used input – Users may weaken a mechanism by the
                     way in which it is used. For example, if a device requires a 4-digit PIN, an examiner
                     may wish to try the combination 1-2-3-4, as one of the three guesses allowed before
                     the device is completely locked down [Kni02].

6.2.2   Software-based Methods

        Software-based methods involve software techniques used to break or bypass authentication
        mechanisms. While some general-purpose software techniques and tools may apply to a class
        of PDA devices, most of the techniques are specialized for a specific model within a class.
        When a specialized technique is developed, it is normally programmed and tested on an
        identical test device. Software-based methods include the following:

                     Exploit known weaknesses in authentication – If an authentication mechanism is
                     weak, exploiting the weaknesses to defeat it may be possible. For example, early
                     password protection schemes on Palm OS PDAs obfuscated the password using a
                     reversible algorithm [Kin01], allowing it to be recovered easily from devices running
                     version 4.0 or earlier, using a utility. Similarly, early versions of the Pocket PC
                     Active Sync protocol allow unlimited authentication attempts to be made without
                     penalty, allowing a dictionary attack of commonly used passwords to be attempted.
                     In addition, some systems may have a reserve password or master password built into
                     the authentication mechanism, which allows unfettered access when entered [Kni02].

                     Gain access through a backdoor – Manufacturers often build in test facilities or
                     other backdoors that an examiner can exploit to obtain information. For example, the
                     bootloaders on some PDA devices support functions that among other things allow
                     device memory to be read and copied or transmitted. For instance, the iPAQ 3900
                     and other models in that product series support the parrot bootloader, an unadvertised
                     utility so named because of the bird that appears on the display [Log01]. When
                     triggered by a specific combination key chord and provided appropriate commands
