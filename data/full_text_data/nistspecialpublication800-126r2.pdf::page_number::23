                                                      Table 9 – cat:catalog

Element Name: cat:catalog
Element         A catalog element defined by the OASIS XML Catalog specification [XMLCAT]. Within an SCAP source
Definition      data stream this element SHALL contain one or more <cat:uri> and/or <cat:rewriteURI>
                elements, and it SHALL NOT contain any other elements or attributes. Refer to Section 7 of [XMLCAT]
                for information on determining which catalog entry to apply.

                                                    The @name attribute MUST contain a URI that matches a “referenced

                                                    is a URI entry defined within the model used within the data stream

                                                    SHALL be populated with a string that will replace the matched
                                                    @uriStartString value. The resulting URI MUST be used to resolve
                                                    the link. See [XMLCAT] for more details.
