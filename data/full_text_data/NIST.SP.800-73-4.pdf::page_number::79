Special Publication 800-73-4                                    Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification â€“ Part 2:
                                                                PIV Card Application Card Command Interface

2.3    Card Applications

Each command that appears on the card command interface shall be implemented by a card application
that is resident on the ICC. The card command enables operations on and with the data objects to which
the card application has access.

Each card application shall have a globally unique name called its Application Identifier (AID) [ISO7816,
Part 4]. Except for the default applications, access to the card commands and data objects of a card
application shall be gained by selecting the card application using its application identifier. 2 The PIX of
the AID shall contain an encoding of the version of the card application. The AID of the PIV Card
Application is defined in Part 1.

The card application whose commands are currently being used is called the currently selected
application.

  2.3.1     Default Selected Card Application

The card platform shall support a default selected card application. In other words, there shall be a
currently selected application immediately after a cold or warm reset. This card application is the default
selected card application. The default card application may be the PIV Card Application, or it may be
another card application.

2.4    Security Architecture

The security architecture of an ICC is the means by which the security policies governing access to each
data object stored on the card are represented within the card.

These security policy representations are applied to all PIV card commands thereby ensuring that the
prescribed data policies for the card applications are enforced.

The following subsections describe the security architecture of the PIV Card Application.

  2.4.1     Access Control Rule

An access control rule shall consist of an access mode and a security condition. The access mode is an
operation that can be performed on a data object. A security condition is a Boolean expression using
variables called security statuses that are defined below.

According to an access control rule, the action described by the access mode can be performed on the data
object if and only if the security condition evaluates to TRUE for the current values of the security
statuses. If there is no access control rule with an access mode describing a particular action, then that
action shall never be performed on the data object.

  2.4.2     Security Status

Associated with each authenticable entity shall be a set of one or more Boolean variables, each called a
security status indicator of the authenticable entity. Each security status indicator, in turn, is associated

2 Access to the default application, and its commands and objects, occurs immediately after a warm or cold card reset without an

explicit SELECT command.
