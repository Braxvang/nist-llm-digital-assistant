SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


                           A Federal CKMS shall provide metadata elements only to
PR:6.43
                           those entities authenticated and authorized for access to them.

6.4.14 Store Operational Key and Metadata Outside a Cryptographic Module
This function involves placing a key and/or metadata in storage outside of a cryptographic
module for use during the keyâ€™s cryptoperiod without retaining the original copy in the
cryptographic module (as opposed to a copy function, where the key resides in two
locations). Keys and metadata must be physically or cryptographically protected when stored
outside a cryptographic module (see the requirements specified in Section 6.1.2, Section
6.2.1, and [SP 800-57 Part 1]).

FR:6.46 For each key type, the CKMS design shall specify: the circumstances under which
keys of each type and their metadata are stored, where the keys and metadata are stored, and
how the keys and metadata are protected.

6.4.15 Backup of a Key and its Metadata
The backup of keys and metadata involves copying the keys and/or metadata to a separate
medium than is used for the operational storage of keys and from which the keys can be
recovered if the original (operational) copy is lost, modified, or otherwise becomes
unavailable. The FCKMS, the owner, or a trusted entity could back up keys and metadata.

FR:6.47 The CKMS design shall specify how, where, and the circumstances under which
keys and their metadata are backed up.

FR:6.48 The CKMS design shall specify the security policy for the protection of backed-up
keys/metadata.

FR:6.49 The CKMS design shall specify how the security policy is implemented during the
key and metadata back up, e.g., how the confidentiality and multiparty control requirements
are implemented during transport and storage of the backed-up keys and metadata.

                 CP-6      When keys and metadata are backed up, a medium that is
PR:6.44
                 CP-9      separate from that used for the operational storage of the keys
                           and metadata shall be used.
                SC-28      A Federal CKMS shall provide backed up keys and metadata
PR:6.45
                           with the same integrity and confidentiality protections as the
                           operational copies of the keys and metadata and at the same
                           or higher security strength.

6.4.16 Archive Key and/or Metadata
Key and/or metadata archiving involves placing a copy of a key and/or metadata in a safe
storage facility so that they can be recovered if and when needed. Key and/or metadata
archiving includes provisions for moving the key and/or metadata to a new storage medium
before the old medium is replaced or becomes unreadable.
