      AES in counter mode is the default algorithm, if encryption is desired. AES-f8
      mode is an option for UMTS applications. The pre-defined authentication
      transform is HMAC-SHA1. The default session authentication key-length is 160
      bits, the default authentication tag length is 80 bits. The key derivation function is
      AES in counter mode with a 128-bit master key from the key management.
      Interface for hardware-crypto support (e.g. IP phones). In comparison to the
      security options for RTP there are some advantages to using SRTP. The
      advantages over the RTP standard security and also over the H.235 security for
      media stream data are listed below.

      SRTP provides increased security, achieved by
        • Confidentiality for RTP as well as for RTCP by encryption of the
            respective payloads;
        • Integrity for the entire RTP and RTCP packets, together with replay
            protection;
        • The possibility to refresh the session keys periodically, which limits the
            amount of cipher text produced by a fixed key, available for an adversary
            to cryptanalyze;
        • An extensible framework that permits upgrading with new cryptographic
            algorithms;
        • A secure session key derivation with a pseudo-random function at both
            ends;
        • The usage of salting keys to protect against pre-computation attacks;
        • Security for unicast and multicast RTP applications.

      SRTP has improved performance attained by
        • Low computational cost asserted by pre-defined algorithms;
        • Low bandwidth cost and a high throughput by limited packet expansion
            and by a framework preserving RTP header compression efficiency;
        • Small footprint that is a small code size and data memory for keying
            information and replay lists.

      The following characteristics also argue for SRTP:
         • It is defined as a profile of RTP, so that it can be easily integrated into
             existing RTP stacks. For example SRTP may use RTP padding because
             the encrypted portion is the exact size of the plaintext for the pre-defined
             algorithms.
         • It provides independence from the underlying transport, network, and
             physical layers used by RTP, in particular high tolerance to packet loss
             and re-ordering, and robustness to transmission bit-errors in the encrypted
             payload.
         • It lightens the burden of the key management due to the fact that a single
             master key can provide keying material for confidentiality and integrity
             protection, both for the SRTP stream and the corresponding SRTCP
             stream. For special requirements a single master key can protect several
