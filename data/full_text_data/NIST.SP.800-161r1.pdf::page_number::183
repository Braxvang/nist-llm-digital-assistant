                                                                                               sold outside of the country. This new law was to take effect on June 1, 2019.

                                                                                               When the new law was announced, ABC Company’s current inventory of PCBs was about 10 %

                                                                                               Before June, ABC Company reached out to all five suppliers to order additional materials, but
                                                                                               there was quickly a shortage due to higher demand from many foreign customers of these

                                                                                               Between February and June of 2019, ABC Company considered partnerships with new suppliers,
                                                                                               but there were several issues identified. One in every 10 new suppliers that ABC Company
                                                                                               contacted required a lead time for ramping up to the desired demand of anywhere from 6 months
                                                                                               to 18 months. This would have necessitated additional work on ABC Company’s part, including
                                                                                               testing samples of the supplier PCBs, finalizing logistical details, and monitoring supplier-side
                                                                                               activities, such as the procurement of raw materials and the acquisition of additional personnel
                                                                                               and production space that were necessary to meet the new demand.

                                                                                               The second issue was that the current contracts with all five suppliers in Southeast Asia involved
                                                                                               meeting minimum demand requirements, meaning that ABC Company was committed to
                                                                                               purchasing a minimum of 100,000 PCBs per month for the duration of the contracts, which
                                                                                               ranged anywhere from 3 months to 24 months in length. This would mean that ABC Company
                                                                                               could not easily avoid the cost implications of the new tax. Could ABC Company absorb the cost
                                                                                               of the PCBs? With a 20 % cost increase, this eroded the margins of a PC from 13.5 % down to
                                                                                               4.5 % on average. For some of the lower-margin ABC Company offerings, it would likely result
                                                                                               in discontinuing the line and using the more expensive PCBs on higher-end models that could
