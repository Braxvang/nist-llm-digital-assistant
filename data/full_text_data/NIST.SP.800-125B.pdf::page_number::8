                                                                                    FOR VM PROTECTION


1.        Introduction

A significant trend in the buildup of modern data centers is the increasing deployment of virtualized
hosts. A virtualized host is a physical host running a server virtualization product (i.e., the hypervisor),
making it capable of supporting multiple computing stacks, each with a different platform configuration
(e.g., operating system (OS), middleware). The individual computing stack inside a virtualized host (also
called a hypervisor host) is encapsulated in an entity called a virtual machine (VM). Since it is a compute
engine, a VM has resources assigned to it, such as processors, memory, and storage, and these are called
virtual resources. A VM computing stack consists of an OS (called the guest OS), middleware (optional),
and one or more application programs. The application programs loaded into a VM are server programs
(e.g., web server, database management system (DBMS)), so the whole process of deploying a virtualized
host with one or more VMs running inside it is called server virtualization.

A data center with virtualized hosts is said to have a virtualized infrastructure. The hypervisor inside each
virtualized host can define a network that links its VMs with each other and to the outside (physical)
enterprise network. This network is called a virtual network since it is entirely software-defined. The core
components of this virtual network are one or more virtual network interface cards (vNICs) inside each
VM, and virtual switches defined to operate inside the hypervisor kernel. The virtual switches, in turn, are
connected to the physical network interface cards (pNICs) of the virtualized host. This provides a
communication path for applications and guest OS instances running inside VMs to interact with
computing and storage elements on the data center’s physical network. The network traffic flowing inside
a virtual network can broadly be classified as follows:

      •    Management traffic (commands for hypervisor administration)
      •    Infrastructure traffic (e.g., traffic due to VM migration)
      •    Inter-VM traffic (traffic from applications running in VMs)

The configuration options discussed in this document are applicable for protection of all three types of
virtual network traffic listed above, though the focus is on securing inter-VM traffic to protect the VMs
and the applications hosted on them.

1.1       Purpose and Scope

As the communication pathway for VMs, each virtual network and its associated configuration
parameters play a critical role in ensuring the security of the VMs and the mission-critical applications
running inside them. This document discusses four virtual network configuration areas that are of
particular interest in terms of security: network segmentation, network path redundancy, traffic control
using firewalls, and VM traffic monitoring. Various configuration options in each of these areas have
distinct advantages and disadvantages. The purpose of this document is to analyze these advantages and
disadvantages from a security viewpoint and provide recommendations to organizations for using the
configuration options.

This document only addresses network-level protections for VMs. Two other areas that organizations
need to address for ensuring the overall security of the VM and the applications hosted on them are host-
level protection and VM data protection. These areas are outside the scope of this document. Most of the
host-level protection measures needed for a VM, such as robust authentication and support for secure
access protocols (e.g., Secure Shell (SSH)), are no different than the ones needed for physical servers.
There are only a few host-level operations specific to VMs that need secure practices (e.g., restarting
VMs from snapshots). VM data, generally stored under well-established storage networking technologies
(e.g., iSCSI, Fiber Channel), requires protection measures such as encryption, access control and backup
schemes and these are outside the scope of this document as well.
