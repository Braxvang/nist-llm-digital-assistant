                                                                                              to be mitigated prior to authorization. Decisions on the most appropriate course of action for responding
                                                                                              to risk may include some form of prioritization. Some risks may be of greater concern to organizations
                                                                                              than other risks. In that case, more resources may need to be directed at addressing higher-priority risks
                                                                                              versus lower-priority risks. Prioritizing risk response does not necessarily mean that the lower-priority

                                                                                              risks, or that the lower-priority risks are addressed later. A key part of the risk-based decision process is
                                                                                              the recognition that regardless of the risk response, there remains a degree of residual risk. Organizations
