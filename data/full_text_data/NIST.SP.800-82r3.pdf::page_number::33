Figure 5 shows an example SCADA system implementation that consists of a primary control
center and three field sites. A second backup control center provides redundancy in the event of a
primary control center malfunction. Point-to-point connections are used for all communications
between the control center and field site, and two connections use radio telemetry. The third field
site is local to the control center and uses the WAN for communications. A regional control
center resides above the primary control center for a higher level of supervisory control. The
corporate enterprise network has access to all control centers through the WAN, and field sites
can be accessed remotely for troubleshooting and maintenance operations. The primary control
center polls field devices for data at defined intervals (e.g., 5 seconds, 60 seconds) and can send
new set points to field devices as required. In addition to polling and issuing high-level
commands, the control server also watches for priority interrupts from field site alarm systems.
