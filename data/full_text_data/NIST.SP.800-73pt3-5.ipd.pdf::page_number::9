      NIST SP 800-73pt3-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)           Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 3
      September 2023                                                                               PIV Client API



139        Introduction
140   Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) called for the adoption of a common
141   identification standard to govern the interoperable use of identity credentials to allow physical
142   and logical access to federally controlled facilities and information systems. In response, Federal
143   Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201 [FIPS201], Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of
144   Federal Employees and Contractors, was developed to define reliable, government-wide identity
145   credentials for use in applications such as access to federally controlled facilities and information
146   systems. FIPS 201 supports multiple types of authenticators, including authenticators on smart
147   cards (also known as PIV Cards) and derived PIV credential authenticators in various other form
148   factors. This publication contains technical specifications to interface with PIV Cards to retrieve
149   and use identity credentials. Other specifications, such as NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-
150   157r1 (Revision 1), contain procedures and life cycle activities to issue, maintain, and use
151   derived PIV credentials.

152           Purpose
153   FIPS 201 defines processes for binding identities to authenticators, such as the PIV Card and
154   derived PIV credentials used in the federal PIV system. SP 800-73-5 contains the technical
155   specifications to interface with the PIV Card to retrieve and use the identity credentials. The
156   specifications reflect the design goals of interoperability and PIV Card functions. The goals are
157   addressed by specifying a PIV data model, card edge interface, and application programming
158   interface. Moreover, this document enumerates requirements for the options and branches in
159   international integrated circuit card (ICC) standards [ISO7816]. The specifications go further by
160   constraining interpretations of the normative standards to ease implementation, facilitate
161   interoperability, and ensure performance in a manner tailored for PIV applications.

162           Scope
163   SP 800-73-5 specifies the PIV data model, application programming interface (API), and card
164   interface requirements necessary to comply with the use cases, as defined in Section 6 of FIPS
165   201 and further described in Appendix B of SP 800-73-5 Part 1. Interoperability is defined as the
166   use of PIV identity credentials such that client-application programs, compliant card
167   applications, and compliant ICCs CAN be used interchangeably by all information processing
168   systems across federal agencies. SP 800-73-5 defines the PIV data elements’ identifiers,
169   structure, and format, as well as the client API and card command interface for use with the PIV
170   Card.
171   This document — SP 800-73-5, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 3 – PIV Client
172   Application Programming Interface — contains technical specifications for the PIV client
173   application programming interface to the PIV Card.

174           Audience and Assumptions
175   This document is intended for federal agencies and implementers of PIV systems. Readers are
176   assumed to have a working knowledge of smart card standards and applications.
