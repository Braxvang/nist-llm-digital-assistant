      October 2023                                                                              Planning Guide

221           Note for Federal Agencies
222   This document does not introduce any new requirements for federal agencies. Federal agencies
223   seeking the latest requirements should consult Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
224   Memoranda, including M-21-31, Improving the Federal Government’s Investigative and
225   Remediation Capabilities Related to Cybersecurity Incidents [OMB21-31], and M-22-09,
226   Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles [OMB22-09].
227   The guidance in this document helps inform and is informed by several other NIST publications
228   and projects, including:
229       •   NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and
230           Organizations [SP800-53r5], particularly the Audit and Accountability (AU) family of
231           security controls
232       •   NIST SP 800-61, Rev. 2, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide [SP800-61r2], in
233           terms of generating logs that are subsequently used to find and investigate cybersecurity
234           incidents
235       •   NIST SP 800-207, Zero Trust Architecture [SP800-207] and the NCCoE’s Zero Trust
236           Architecture project, from the perspective of supporting data analytics for zero trust
237           purposes
238       •   NIST SP 800-218, Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) Version 1.1:
239           Recommendations for Mitigating the Risk of Software Vulnerabilities [SP800-218] and
240           the NCCoE’s Software Supply Chain and DevOps Security Practices project, especially
241           in terms of generating and storing artifacts from secure software development practices
242       •   Cybersecurity Framework, particularly within the Protect and Detect Functions

243           Publication Structure
244   The remainder of this document is organized into the following sections and appendices:
245      •    Section 2 discusses how this publication could be used.
246      •    Section 3 specifies plays for characterizing the current state of cybersecurity logging by
247           updating several logging-related inventories.
248      •    Section 4 contains plays for defining the target state for an organization’s cybersecurity
249           logging.
250      •    Section 5 defines plays for assessing and documenting gaps between the current state and
251           target state, as well as the root causes of those gaps.
252      •    Section 6 provides plays for developing a plan to fill the gaps.
253      •    The References section lists all references used throughout the document.
254      •    Appendix A contains a glossary of key terms.
255      •    Appendix B provides a crosswalk between the log management planning plays and
256           selected NIST guidance documents and frameworks.
