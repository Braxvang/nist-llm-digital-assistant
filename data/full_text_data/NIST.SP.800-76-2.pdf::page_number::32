6.      Iris recognition specifications

6.1     Scope
This Section standardizes specifications for use of iris images as allowed by [FIPS]. The Section includes specifications
―     for iris images stored on and off PIV Cards,
―     for iris capture devices, and
―     for components involved in automated recognition of PIV iris imagery.
The specifications extend the format requirements of ISO/IEC 19794-6:2011 with image quality related properties. The
capture device specifications concern imaging properties of the iris camera, and software interfaces around it. The
recognition component is specified in terms of minimum authentication accuracy and processing speed.
This document makes no mention of an iris template. In iris recognition, templates are proprietary non-standardized
                         16
mathematical encodings of information extracted from the formally standardized images that are defined in this
document. Templates are not interoperable. Interoperability is achieved with standardized images. Agencies electing
to retain only templates are vulnerable to supplier lock-in, and an inability to benefit from technology updates.

6.2     Background
Iris recognition affords highly accurate recognition of individuals. It has been used both for 1:1 verification and 1:N
identification [UKIRIS, IREX-III] and has proven stable [NEXUS, IREX-VI] for over a decade. Moreover, iris images can
be compressed to achieve small sizes [IREX-I, IREX-IV] affording rapid transmission across band-limited networks and
storage on identity credentials. This aspect is leveraged below.
Digital representations of rectilinear images of the human iris have been formally standardized as ISO/IEC 19794-6:2011
[IRISSTD]. This standard, which replaces earlier editions, is a necessary component in an interoperable marketplace
of iris cameras and iris recognition algorithms. The standard is used because it includes specialized image formats
                                17
that support compact storage on ISO/IEC 7816 Integrated Circuit cards. The PIV formats are shown in Figure 5.

Properties Parent image, typically the output of a camera of size        Cropped, masked and centered iris conformant to Image
             640x480 pixels, not necessarily centered, but conformant Type 7 of [IRISSTD]. Images of this kind can be compressed
             to Image Type 2 of [IRISSTD]. Images of this kind are not to a few kilobytes. For PIV, the recommended size is 3KB.

  Some (commercial) template representations are actually larger than the specialized ISO/IEC 19794-6:2011 Image Type 7 PIV Card
 images specified in this document.

  First generation iris image standards included a polar-coordinate encoding. This supported compact sizes but was removed from
 second generation standards because interoperability is sensitive to correct determination of the iris and pupil centers. A
 replacement format (Figure 5B) has been shown to offer accurate recognition [IREX-IV] and broad industry support [IREX-I]. It
 requires localization of the boundaries and the iris center. These tasks are non-trivial and are supported by quantitative tests.
