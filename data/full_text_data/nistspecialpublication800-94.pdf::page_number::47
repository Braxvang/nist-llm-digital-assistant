                                                     GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



           attack traffic has to be monitored and analyzed, the attack detected, and the packets sent across
           networks to the endpoints. Also, since this technique is only applicable to TCP, it cannot be used
           for attacks carried in other types of packets, including UDP and ICMP. Session sniping is not
           widely used any more because other, newer prevention capabilities are more effective.
 Inline Only

      –    Performing Inline Firewalling. Most inline IDPS sensors offer firewall capabilities that can be
           used to drop or reject suspicious network activity.

      –    Throttling Bandwidth Usage. If a particular protocol is being used inappropriately, such as for
           a DoS attack, malware distribution, or peer-to-peer file sharing, some inline IDPS sensors can
           limit the percentage of network bandwidth that the protocol can use. This prevents the activity
           from negatively impacting bandwidth usage for other resources.

      –    Altering Malicious Content. As described in Section 2.2, some inline IDPS sensors can sanitize
           part of a packet, which means that malicious content is replaced with benign content and the
           sanitized packet sent to its destination. A sensor that acts as a proxy might perform automatic
           normalization of all traffic, such as repackaging application payloads in new packets. This has
           the effect of sanitizing some attacks involving packet headers and some application headers,
           whether or not the IDPS has detected an attack. Some sensors can also strip infected attachments
           from e-mails and remove other discrete pieces of malicious content from network traffic.
 Both Passive and Inline

      –    Reconfiguring Other Network Security Devices. Many IDPS sensors can instruct network
           security devices such as firewalls, routers, and switches to reconfigure themselves to block
           certain types of activity or route it elsewhere. This can be helpful in several situations, such as
           keeping an external attacker out of a network and quarantining an internal host that has been
           compromised (e.g., moving it to a quarantine VLAN). This prevention technique is useful only
           for network traffic that can be differentiated by packet header characteristics typically recognized
           by network security devices, such as IP addresses and port numbers.

      –    Running a Third-Party Program or Script. Some IDPS sensors can run an administrator-
           specified script or program when certain malicious activity is detected. This could trigger any
           prevention action desired by the administrator, such as reconfiguring other security devices to
           block the malicious activity. Third-party programs or scripts are most commonly used when the
           IDPS does not support the prevention actions that administrators want to have performed.
Most IDPS sensors allow administrators to specify the prevention capability configuration for each type
of alert. This usually includes enabling or disabling prevention, as well as specifying which prevention
capability should be used. Some IDPS sensors have a learning or simulation mode that suppresses all
prevention actions, and instead indicates when a prevention action would have been performed. This
allows administrators to monitor and fine-tune the prevention capabilities’ configuration before enabling
them, which reduces the risk of inadvertently blocking benign activity.

4.4       Management

Most network-based IDPS products offer similar management capabilities. This section discusses major
aspects of management—implementation, operation, and maintenance—and provides recommendations
for performing them effectively and efficiently.
