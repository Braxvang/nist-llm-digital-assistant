7.3.2 X.509 Certificate for Digital Signature

[SP800-157] does not specify any requirements on the digital signature key and certificate. The
requirements listed herein follow those specified in [FIPS201] for digital signature certificates
that are not issued by legacy PKIs, 8 and thus do not actually apply to the X.509 Certificate for
Digital Signature stored within a Derived PIV Application, with the exception that certificates
that assert the id-fpki-common-policy, id-fpki-common-hardware, or id-fpki-common-High
certificate policy OID are required by the corresponding certificate policy to conform to [PROF].
