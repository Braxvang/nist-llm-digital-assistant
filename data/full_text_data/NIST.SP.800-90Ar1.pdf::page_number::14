                          source of ideal random bitstrings of the same length (see ideal
                          random sequence).
Hash Function             A (mathematical) function that maps values from a large
                          (possibly very large) domain into a smaller range. The
                          function satisfies the following properties:
                             1. (One-way) It is computationally infeasible to find any
                                input that maps to any pre-specified output;
                             2. (Collision free) It is computationally infeasible to find
                                any two distinct inputs that map to the same output.

Health Testing            Testing within an implementation immediately prior to or
                          during normal operation to determine that the implementation
                          continues to perform as implemented and as validated.

Ideal Random Sequence     Each bit of an ideal random sequence is unpredictable and
                          unbiased, with a value that is independent of the values of the
                          other bits in the sequence. Prior to the observation of the
                          sequence, the value of each bit is equally likely to be 0 or 1,
                          and the probability that a particular bit will have a particular
                          value is unaffected by knowledge of the values of any or all of
                          the other bits. An ideal random sequence of n bits contains n
                          bits of entropy.

Implementation            An implementation of an RBG is a cryptographic device or
                          portion of a cryptographic device that is the physical
                          embodiment of the RBG design, for example, some code
                          running on a computing platform.

Implementation Testing    Testing by an independent and accredited party to ensure that
for Validation            an implementation of this Recommendation conforms to the
                          specifications of this Recommendation.
Instantiation of an RBG   An instantiation of an RBG is a specific, logically
                          independent, initialized RBG. One instantiation is
                          distinguished from another by a “handle” (e.g., an identifying
                          number).

Internal State            The collection of stored information about a DRBG
                          instantiation. This can include both secret and non-secret
                          information. Compare to working state.

Live Entropy Source       An approved entropy source (see [SP 800-90B]) that can
                          provide an RBG with bits having a specified amount of
