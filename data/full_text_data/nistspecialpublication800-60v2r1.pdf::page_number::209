D.16.4 Leadership Protection Information Type

Leadership protection involves all activities performed to protect the health and well being of the
president, vice-president, their families, and other high-level government officials. Some
leadership protection information may be classified. All classified information is treated under
separate rules established for national security information and is outside the scope of this
guideline. The recommended provisional categorization for unclassified leadership protection
information follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of leadership protection
information on the abilities of responsible agencies to protect the health and well being of the
president, vice-president, their families, and other high-level government officials. The
consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most leadership protection information are not
directly life-threatening but can have serious consequences.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: For the unauthorized disclosure of
information that can facilitate efforts to assassinate Federal leadership, the consequences not
only pose a threat to human life, but can also have a disruptive effect on the continuity of Federal
government operations. In such cases, the confidentiality impact level is high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Given the nature of most leadership protection
information, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for the information is
moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. That is, the
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of leadership protection information
may be determined by the specific operation(s) supported by the information. In addition, the
consequences may depend on the urgency with which the intelligence information is needed.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In the case of Secret Service operations,
unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting leadership protection
information may adversely affect mission operations in a manner that results in loss of human
life and disruption of government operations. In such cases, the integrity impact level is high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most leadership protection information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to leadership protection information.
