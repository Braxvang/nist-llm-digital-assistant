NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                   Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

       Note: A decision management strategy includes the identification of security-relevant roles,
       responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities. It also includes the identification of security-
       specific decision categories and a prioritization scheme. Security-relevant decisions often arise
       because of a security effectiveness assessment, a technical trade-off, a security-relevant
       problem that needs to be solved, a response to a security risk that exceeds the acceptable
       threshold, or a new opportunity.
       DM-1.2 Identify the security aspects of the circumstances and the need for a decision.
       DM-1.3 Identify stakeholders with relevant security expertise to support decision-making
              efforts.

DM-2 ANALYZE THE DECISION INFORMATION
       DM-2.1 Select and declare the security aspects of the decision management strategy for each
              decision.
       Note: This includes the security-relevant level of rigor and the data and system analysis needed.
       DM-2.2 Determine the desired security outcomes and the measurable security attributes of
              selection criteria.
       Note: The desired value for all quantifiable security criteria and the threshold value(s) beyond
       which the attribute will be unsatisfactory are determined.
       DM-2.3 Identify the security aspects of the trade space and alternatives.
       Note: If many alternatives exist, security aspects are to qualitatively screen to reduce
       alternatives to a manageable number for further detailed system analysis.
       DM-2.4 Evaluate each alternative against the security criteria.

DM-3 MAKE AND MANAGE DECISIONS
       DM-3.1 Determine the preferred alternative for each security-informed and security-based
              decision.
       DM-3.2 Record the security-informed or security-based resolution, decision rationale, and
              assumptions.
       DM-3.3 Record, track, evaluate, and report the security aspects of security-informed and
              security-based decisions.
       Note: Security aspects of problems or opportunities and the alternative courses of action that
       will resolve their outcomes – including those with security impacts – are recorded, categorized,
       and reported.

I.4.    Risk Management
The purpose of the Risk Management process is to identify, analyze, treat, and monitor the risks
continually.
