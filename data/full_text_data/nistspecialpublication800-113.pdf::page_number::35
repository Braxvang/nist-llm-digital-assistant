                                                                                                      GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



FIPS 140-2. This means that to be run in FIPS-compliant mode, an SSL VPN gateway must only allow
cipher suites that are allowed by FIPS 140-2.

NIST SP 800-52 10 lists the TLS cipher suites that satisfied FIPS requirements as of its publication date
(June 2005); additional cipher suites meeting FIPS requirements may become available in the future. All
of the cipher suites listed in SP 800-52 will become disallowed after the end of 2010. Therefore, Federal
agencies who want to provide SSL VPN services after 2010 must ensure that their systems are
upgradeable to the new FIPS-compliant cipher suites before the end of 2010, and that their SSL VPN
vendors guarantee that such upgrades will be available early enough for testing and deployment in the
field. Further, those systems must be able to be configured to only use cipher suites with FIPS-compliant
hash functions. Otherwise, a client that is offering a cipher suite with non-compliant cryptographic
functions might negotiate an SSL session that does not rely on FIPS-compliant technologies.

4.2.1    Versions of SSL

Because of the way that SSL was designed, SSL versions 3.0 and earlier do not conform to the
requirements of FIPS 140-2. Therefore, SSL VPNs that are to be used in applications that must be FIPS-
compliant must use TLS 1.0 (SSL 3.1) or later for their SSL VPN systems. Further, those systems must
be able to be configured to only use TLS 1.0 or later; otherwise, a client that is using SSL 3.0 or earlier
might use the SSL negotiation to cause the SSL VPN gateway to create an SSL session that is
inappropriate for the security level of the organization. A client that only uses SSL 3.0 or earlier should
not be permitted to establish an SSL VPN connection; nevertheless, few SSL VPNs have the capability to
enforce this restriction.

4.2.2    Key Establishment Used by SSL

NIST SP 800-56A 11 , Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key Establishment Schemes Using Discrete
Logarithm Cryptography, defines the types of key establishment algorithms that can be used in FIPS-
compliant systems that use cryptography such as Diffie-Hellman key exchange. As described in NIST SP
800-52, the method for key establishment in SSL version 3.1 and later that is preferred by NIST is
ephemeral Diffie-Hellman.

The ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key establishment used by TLS version 1.0 and later does not meet the
requirements of NIST SP 800-56A. NIST has granted a special exception from this requirement for
systems using SSL until the end of 2010; see Implementation Guidance for FIPS PUB 140-2 and the
Cryptographic Module Validation Program 12 . Subject to the results of further analysis, the date may be
extended. SSLâ€™s RSA key establishment method, which is not covered by the restrictions in NIST SP
800-56A, is acceptable now and beyond 2010.

Therefore, purchasers of SSL VPNs who need to be FIPS-compliant after the end of 2010 must ensure
that their SSL VPN systems can be configured to require RSA key establishment at that time. Until that
time, SSL VPN systems can also use the NIST-preferred method of ephemeral Diffie-Hellman.
