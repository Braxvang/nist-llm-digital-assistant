                                                                                   GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



by the owner. In cases where a host’s file permissions and access controls are unavailable, the best
resolution is to remove the user passwords from the configuration files.

Another area to address is the actual communication between the mail client and mail server. As
mentioned in Section 2, all network communication with the default configurations of SMTP, POP, and
IMAP occurs unencrypted. This makes usernames, passwords, and message content subject to
interception and alteration by malicious entities. To increase client to server security, this communication
can be encrypted using SSL/TLS. Most commonly used mail clients support SSL/TLS; it should be used
if it is available. TLS version 1 is preferred for use; at a minimum, SSL version 3 should be used. 48

The selection of email addresses and user account names also affects authentication. Using account
names in email addresses should be avoided, so that an attacker cannot easily determine a person’s
account name from the person’s email address. Organizations that allow users to select their own email
account names should put controls in place to ensure that account names and email addresses are distinct
and unrelated. Organizations might also want to place additional restrictions on email addresses, such as
having different naming conventions for certain types of users (e.g., contractors, foreign nationals) to
allow the user type to be easily recognized. Examples of such naming conventions are
firstname.lastname.countrycode@domain.gov for a foreign national’s address, and
firstname.lastname.ctr@domain.gov for a contractor’s address.

8.1.4    Securing the Client Host’s Operating System

Many host operating systems provide a number of configuration settings and other measures for
increasing the security of the mail client either directly or indirectly. The host operating system is a key
component of the overall security of a client host. The following should be done to secure the host
operating system:

 Keep it updated to the most secure patch level.
 Configure it to allow only the appropriate user(s) to access locally stored messages and mail client
  configuration files.
 Configure (Windows hosts only) the Windows Script Host (WSH) [Pits01]:

     –   Remove WSH or allow only the administrator to access

     –   Change the default action of the following file extensions from execute to edit: 49

         –    JS (JavaScript)

         –    JSE (JavaScript Encoded File)

         –    VBE (VBScript Encoded File)

         –    VBS (Visual Basic Script)

         –    WS (Windows Script File)

     Some email clients may execute files with these extensions, even though the operating system is configured not to execute
     them.
