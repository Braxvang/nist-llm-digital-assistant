                                                       CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



         Users who employ desktop and portable systems to perform their assigned job functions; and
         Other personnel responsible for designing, managing, operating, maintaining, or using
          information systems.

1.4        Document Structure

This document is designed to logically lead the reader through the contingency plan development process.
The process includes designing a contingency planning program, evaluating the organization’s needs
against contingency strategy options based on the system impact levels, security controls, and technical
considerations, and documenting the contingency strategy into a contingency plan, testing the plan, and
maintaining it. The resulting contingency plan serves as a “user’s manual” for executing the strategy in
the event of a disruption. Where possible, examples or hypothetical situations are included to provide
greater understanding.

The remaining chapters of this document address the following areas of contingency planning:

         Chapter 2, Background, provides background information about contingency planning, including
          the purpose of various security and emergency management-related plans, their relationships to
          ISCPs, and how the plans are integrated into an organization’s overall resilience strategy by
          implementing the six steps of the Risk Management Framework (RMF). 5 In addition, the way in
          which the FIPS 199 impact levels and NIST SP 800-53 contingency planning controls must be
          considered during the contingency planning process is also explained.
         Chapter 3, Information System Contingency Planning Process, details the fundamental planning
          principles necessary for developing an effective contingency capability. The principles outlined
          in this section are applicable to all information systems. The section presents contingency
          planning guidelines for all elements of the planning cycle, including business impact analysis,
          alternate site selection, and recovery strategies. The section also discusses the development of
          contingency plan teams and the roles and responsibilities commonly assigned to personnel during
          plan activation.
         Chapter 4, Information System Contingency Plan Development, breaks down the activities
          necessary to document the contingency strategy and develop the ISCP. Maintaining, testing,
          training, and exercising the contingency plan are also discussed in this section.
         Chapter 5, Technical Contingency Planning Considerations, describes contingency planning
          concerns specific to the three common platform types listed in Section 1.3, Scope. This section
          helps contingency planners identify, select, and implement the appropriate technical contingency
          measures for their given systems.

This document includes nine appendices. Appendix A provides three sample ISCP templates, based on
the FIPS 199 impact levels. Appendix B presents a sample BIA template. Appendix C contains a list of
Frequently Asked Questions about information system contingency planning. Problems relevant to
planning for personnel considerations are discussed in Appendix D. Appendix E provides a summary of
NIST SP 800-53 contingency planning controls and control enhancements. Appendix F explains the
integration of contingency planning into an organization’s SDLC. Appendices G and H contain a
glossary of terms and acronyms, respectively. Appendix I provides suggested resources and references.
