Special Publication 800-79-2                            Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                         and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



Assessment Result— Partially Satisfied
Assessment Findings— There is operational evidence that a 1:1 biometric match is carried out
before the card is released to the applicant.
Assessment Deficiency and Potential Impact— The requirement to carry out this task is not
documented clearly enough in the operations plan. Although personnel are knowledgeable about
this requirement, and the task was observed to be performed correctly during card issuance, the
lack of documentation could be a problem if there is turnover in staff. Alternate processes when
fingerprints are unavailable are not in place.
Recommendation— Update the issuance process description within the operations plan to
include a clear description of this task in the process and develop alternate processes for issuance
when fingerprints are not available.
