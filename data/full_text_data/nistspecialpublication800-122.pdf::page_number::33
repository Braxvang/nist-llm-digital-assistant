exercises to simulate an incident and test whether the response plan is effective and whether the staff
members understand and are able to perform their roles effectively. Training programs should also
inform employees of the consequences of their actions for inappropriate use and handling of PII.

The organization should determine if existing processes are adequate, and if not, establish a new incident
reporting method for employees to report suspected or known incidents involving PII. The method could
be a phone hotline, email, online form, or a management reporting structure in which employees know to
contact a specific person within the management chain. Employees should be able to report any breach
involving PII immediately on any day, at any time. Additionally, employees should be provided with a
clear definition of what constitutes a breach involving PII and what information needs to be reported. The
following information is helpful to obtain from employees who are reporting a known or suspected breach
involving PII.72

 Person reporting the incident
 Person who discovered the incident
 Date and time the incident was discovered
 Nature of the incident
 Name of system and possible interconnectivity with other systems
 Description of the information lost or compromised
 Storage medium from which information was lost or compromised
 Controls in place to prevent unauthorized use of the lost or compromised information
 Number of individuals potentially affected
 Whether law enforcement was contacted.
Federal agencies are required to report all known or suspected breaches involving PII, in any format, to
US-CERT within one hour.73 To meet this obligation, organizations should proactively plan their breach
notification response. A breach involving PII may require notification to persons external to the
organization, such as law enforcement, financial institutions, affected individuals, the media, and the
public.74 Organizations should plan in advance how, when, and to whom notifications should be made.
Organizations should conduct training sessions on interacting with the media regarding incidents.
Additionally, OMB M-07-16 requires federal agencies to include the following elements in their plans for
handling breach notification:

 Whether breach notification to affected individuals is required75
 Timeliness of the notification
 Source of the notification
 Contents of the notification
