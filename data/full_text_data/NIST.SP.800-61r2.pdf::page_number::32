Incident Analysis Resources:
 Port lists, including commonly used ports and Trojan horse ports
 Documentation for OSs, applications, protocols, and intrusion detection and antivirus products
 Network diagrams and lists of critical assets, such as database servers
 Current baselines of expected network, system, and application activity
 Cryptographic hashes of critical files22 to speed incident analysis, verification, and eradication
Incident Mitigation Software:
 Access to images of clean OS and application installations for restoration and recovery purposes
Many incident response teams create a jump kit, which is a portable case that contains materials that may
be needed during an investigation. The jump kit should be ready to go at all times. Jump kits contain
many of the same items listed in the bulleted lists above. For example, each jump kit typically includes a
laptop, loaded with appropriate software (e.g., packet sniffers, digital forensics). Other important
materials include backup devices, blank media, and basic networking equipment and cables. Because the
purpose of having a jump kit is to facilitate faster responses, the team should avoid borrowing items from
the jump kit.

Each incident handler should have access to at least two computing devices (e.g., laptops). One, such as
the one from the jump kit, should be used to perform packet sniffing, malware analysis, and all other
actions that risk contaminating the laptop that performs them. This laptop should be scrubbed and all
software reinstalled before it is used for another incident. Note that because this laptop is special purpose,
it is likely to use software other than the standard enterprise tools and configurations, and whenever
possible the incident handlers should be allowed to specify basic technical requirements for these special-
purpose investigative laptops. In addition to an investigative laptop, each incident handler should also
have a standard laptop, smart phone, or other computing device for writing reports, reading email, and
performing other duties unrelated to the hands-on incident analysis.

Exercises involving simulated incidents can also be very useful for preparing staff for incident handling;
see NIST SP 800-84 for more information on exercises23 and Appendix A for sample exercise scenarios.

3.1.2    Preventing Incidents

Keeping the number of incidents reasonably low is very important to protect the business processes of the
organization. If security controls are insufficient, higher volumes of incidents may occur, overwhelming
the incident response team. This can lead to slow and incomplete responses, which translate to a larger
negative business impact (e.g., more extensive damage, longer periods of service and data unavailability).

It is outside the scope of this document to provide specific advice on securing networks, systems, and
applications. Although incident response teams are generally not responsible for securing resources, they
can be advocates of sound security practices. An incident response team may be able to identify problems
that the organization is otherwise not aware of; the team can play a key role in risk assessment and
training by identifying gaps. Other documents already provide advice on general security concepts and
