437   associated with that PIV identity account and details about the authentication event, as
438   discussed in Sec. 6.2. The IdP can also make PIV identity account attributes available
439   through a protected identity API alongside the assertion, as discussed in Sec. 6.5.
440   The home IdP (see Sec. 2.2.1) is the IdP operated by or on behalf of the issuer of a
441   PIV identity account, which is typically expected to be the agency employing a federal
442   employee or contractor. As a consequence, the home IdP has a direct view of the
443   management of the PIV identity account and PIV credentials associated with the account,
444   including PKI-based and non-PKI-based authenticators. Because there may be multiple
445   IdPs capable of issuing assertions for a PIV cardholder, some of whom may not be
446   directly linked to the PIV identity account, each issuer will need to identify the home
447   IdP for the cardholders they serve, as discussed in Sec 3.5.
448   A PIV IdP is the IdP trusted by an RP to issue assertions for a given PIV identity account.
449   From the perspective of the RP, all PIV federation transactions involve a PIV IdP. A PIV
450   IdP is trusted by the RP to issue accurate and timely assertions regarding a PIV identity
451   account. When the PIV IdP is not the home IdP, the account status can be ascertained by
452   other means, such as querying the PIV identity account issuer or inferring account status
453   from the status of the PKI-based PIV credential used to authenticate to the PIV IdP.
454   The Federation Assurance Level (FAL) of a federation transaction places requirements
455   on the parties of the transaction, as defined in [SP800-63C]. At FAL2 and FAL3, the PIV
456   IdP trusted by the RP has to be the home IdP for the PIV identity account in question, as
457   discussed in Sec. 4. Additional requirements for the home IdP are discussed in Sec. 3.5.
458   At FAL1, the IdP could be operated or controlled by an entity other than the agency
459   responsible for the PIV identity account. Some forms of PIV credential (such as PKI-
460   based authenticators) can support such third-party operation of an IdP by allowing the
461   authenticator to be verified across domains, which enables a PIV IdP to exist apart from
462   the issuing agencyâ€™s identity management systems.

463   2.2.1. Home IdP
464   When an issuing agency officially endorses a specific PIV IdP for the PIV identity
465   accounts that the agency issues, that IdP is known as the home IdP for that population
466   of PIV identity accounts. The home IdP is often run by the issuing agency, but operations
467   can be outsourced to a third party through a variety of technical means.
468   As discussed in Sec. 3.5, a home IdP has direct access to the PIV identity account. This
469   tight coupling allows the home IdP be a highly trusted authority for the PIV identity
470   account in question.
471   Not all use cases require a home IdP, but RPs can discover the home IdP for a given
472   agency through the published home IdP record, as discussed in Sec. 3.5.
