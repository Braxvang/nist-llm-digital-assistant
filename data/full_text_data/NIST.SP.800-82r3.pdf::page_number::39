2.3.5. Building Automation Systems
A building automation system (BAS) is a type of OT used to control the many systems used in a
building, including heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC); fire; electrical; lighting;
physical access control; physical security; and other utility systems. Most modern buildings
contain some form of a BAS when they are constructed. However, older buildings and
equipment may have to be retrofitted to take advantage of the benefits that a BAS provides.
Some of the most common functions of a BAS include maintaining environmental conditions for
occupant comfort, reducing energy consumption, reducing operating and maintenance costs,
increasing security, recording historical data (e.g., temperature, humidity), and performing
general equipment monitoring (e.g., provide alerts to building personnel of device failure or an
alarm condition).
An example of a BAS is shown in Fig. 9. A BAS may communicate over wired or wireless paths
to controllers or gateways. For example, environmental control sensors can provide the
temperature and humidity to a building controller. If the sensor values are outside of the set
points, the controller can signal a variable air volume (VAV) box to increase or decrease airflow
and bring the temperature to the desired state. Similarly, a building occupant scanning their
identification badge at a badge reader can result in the credentials being sent to the access control
controller and application control server to determine whether access should be granted.
While this guide contains recommendations that are applicable and could be used as a reference
to protect a BAS against cybersecurity threats, readers are encouraged to perform a risk-based
assessment on their systems and tailor the recommended guidelines and solutions to meet their
specific security, business, and operational requirements.
