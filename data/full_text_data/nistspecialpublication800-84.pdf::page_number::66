GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



Portions of the Inject Tracking Form are developed by the functional exercise team during the Development Phase, and additional information is
filled in by Controllers during the Conduct Phase. In the sample below, BOLDED text would have been created during the Development Phase
and ITALICIZED text would have added to the form by Controllers during the Conduct Phase. The purpose of the form is to provide Controllers
with a “play book” that states which injects are provided to participants at each given time. The form is then used by Controllers to document the
time at which an Inject is introduced and a summary of activities taken by participants in response to the Inject.
