being used. In all other cases, mediated access can be used to prevent access to and use of the unneeded
functions.
An example of when it may not be possible or practical to avoid unnecessary functions is the use of
commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. COTS components typically contain functions beyond
those required to fulfill their intended purpose. In such cases, the components should be configured to
enable only the functions that are required to fulfill their purpose and prohibit or restrict functions that are
not required to fulfill their purpose.

E.15. Least Persistence
Principle: System elements and other resources are available, accessible, and able to fulfill their
design intent only for the time for which they are needed.
Note: Least persistence reduces susceptibility. It limits the extent to which functions, resources, data, and
information remain present, accessible, and usable when not required, thereby reducing the opportunity
for their inadvertent or unauthorized use, modification, or activation.
The broadest interpretation of least persistence is to not install, instantiate, or apply power to system
elements and resources until needed and to completely remove system elements or power from system
elements and resources when they are no longer required. When it is not possible or practical to do so,
those system elements and resources should be fully disabled, disarmed, or put into safe mode to prevent
their ability to function or be used. Finally, when it is not possible to disable, disarm or put into safe
mode, access to those elements and resources should be mediated to constrain the time and duration of
their use (Mediated Access).
Three conditions must be satisfied for an active system element or resource to be usable, and two of these
conditions apply to non-active elements or resources:
-   Presence (active and non-active): The system element or resource must be installed, loaded, residing
    in memory (software), and configured.
-   Accessible (active and non-active): The system element or resource must be invoked, interacted with,
    or operated on.
-   Able to Function (active): The system element or resource must be able to execute (i.e., powered on,
    enabled, or armed) to deliver a service or perform a function.
Least persistence is reflected in concepts such as sanitizing, erasing, and clearing memory and/or storage
locations; disabling, removing, and disconnecting network ports, system interfaces, and the services
provided by system interfaces; powering off and unplugging hardware when not needed; and instantiating
software just before need and de-instantiating after it is no longer needed. Least persistence has added
benefits that include simplifying the processes of:
-   Cleansing the system element to remove corrupted aspects or side effects
-   Re-establishing the system element to a known state (i.e., a refresh)
-   Minimizing the time in which system elements are exposed to the environment, to attack, and to
    erroneous behavior
Where system elements or resources are removed and then restored as needed, there must be a trusted
representation of the system element and a trusted ability to instantiate that system element within the
time constraints for its use.
