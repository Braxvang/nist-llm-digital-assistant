5.3.2. Integration of EMM into the Enterprise Service Infrastructure
Both large and small enterprises may connect their EMM system to existing enterprise
infrastructure services to improve the security management of mobile devices. Such services
support authentication, identification, and access control to enterprise networks and resources.
The Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a standard network authentication
service protocol that provides authentication of access credentials followed by policy-based
network resource assignments (e.g., Internet Protocol [IP] address, permitted network connection
time). Directory services, such as Microsoftâ€™s Active Directory, map network resources (e.g.,
volumes, printers, users, devices) to network addresses. Enterprise systems use the Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to communicate with directory services. Another set of
services enables remote connectivity via a VPN to enterprise systems.
By integrating an EMM with enterprise backend infrastructure services such as RADIUS or
directory services, an organization can enable finer-grained management of mobile device access
to mission-critical enterprise resources. System administrators can set policy-based
configurations for mobile devices to constrain access to sensitive resources, depending on mobile
device conditions (e.g., connection from a public WiFi network or user-managed device running
a corporate application). When enterprises deploy an EMM without integrating it with their
backend security infrastructure, mobile device connections to the enterprise network may be
