                                                                          Guidelines on PDA Forensics

       In order to preserve the integrity of the data, examiners should handle the original evidence as
       little as possible. Generally, it is recommended to create a “master” forensic copy of the
       device first, which is kept completely pristine. The master copy is then used to create
       additional mirror images needed for analysis and examination of evidence [Gas03]. A strong
       one-way cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA1) should be performed to ensure that the additional
       images created from the master copy are identical.

6.2   Obstructed Devices

       Obstructed devices typically refer to devices that are shut off (i.e., in the quiescent state) and
       require successful authentication using a password or some other means to gain access.
       Password protected devices normally require the expertise of a specially trained forensic
       specialist to gain access to the device contents, while maintaining integrity of the information
       and avoiding damage to the device. A number of ways exist to extract data from obstructed
       devices. They fall into three classes: investigative, software-based and hardware-based
       methods.

       Software and hardware-based methods are often developed specifically for a particular device
       or narrow class of device. In developing a method, the following actions should be considered
       for determining possible approaches:

               Contacting the device manufacturer for information on known backdoors and
               vulnerabilities that might be exploited.

               Reviewing manufacturer specifications and other documentation when formulating
               plausible exploits.

               Contacting commercial evidence recovery professionals that specialize in handheld
               devices.

               Searching Internet sites for developer, hacker, and security information.
