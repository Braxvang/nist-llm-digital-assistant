IA-1      IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION POLICY AND PROCEDURES

          Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a formal,
          documented, identification and authentication policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
          responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and
          compliance; and (ii) formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the
          identification and authentication policy and associated identification and authentication controls.
          Supplemental Guidance: The identification and authentication policy and procedures are consistent
          with: (i) FIPS 201 and Special Publications 800-73, 800-76, and 800-78; and (ii) other applicable
          laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The
          identification and authentication policy can be included as part of the general information security
          policy for the organization. Identification and authentication procedures can be developed for the
          security program in general, and for a particular information system, when required. NIST Special
          Publication 800-12 provides guidance on security policies and procedures. NIST Special
          Publication 800-63 provides guidance on remote electronic authentication.
          Control Enhancements: None.
