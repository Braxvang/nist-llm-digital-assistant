NIST SP 800-125A REV. 1                                                     SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
                                                                        SERVER-BASED HYPERVISOR PLATFORMS

Security Recommendation HY-SR-18: The access control solution for VM administration should have a
granular capability, both at the permission assignment level and the object level (i.e., the specification of
the target of the permission can be a single VM or any logical grouping of VMs based on function or
location). In addition, the ability to deny permission to some specific objects within a VM group (e.g.,
VMs running workloads of a particular sensitivity level) in spite of having access permission to the VM
group should exist.
