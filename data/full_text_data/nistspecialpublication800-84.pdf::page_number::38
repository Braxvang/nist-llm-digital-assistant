GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



6.2.5    Identify the Test Staff

The design team usually designates a test director, who is responsible for all aspects of the test, including
staffing, development, conduct, logistics, and oversight of the design team. The test director designates
one or more data collectors, who monitor and record the results of the test. The test director and data
collectors should meet before the event to discuss the details surrounding the test, including its scope and
objectives. At this time, the test director and data collectors review the results from previous exercises
and tests, if applicable, to heighten their awareness of potential issues before the event.

The design team also often includes one or more individuals that are subject matter experts in the areas
being tested. These individuals can help develop the test plan and identify the necessary testing tools.
Because they are aware of the details of the test, these individuals should not be participants in the test;
instead, they can be test observers, facilitators, data collectors, or controllers.

6.2.6    Coordinate the Logistics

The design team should begin to coordinate the logistical support far enough in advance to ensure the
successful completion of the test. The time required for coordination also depends on the scope, and
typically varies from a month in advance for component testing to several months for a comprehensive
test of components and systems for a large IT plan such as a disaster recovery plan or incident response
plan. The checklist in Table 6-1 contains examples of possible logistics actions that might need to be
performed. Although specific logistical elements are identified during the test design phase, it is
imperative that the required list of logistical components be updated frequently, especially after the test is
fully developed.

Select a date for conducting the test
Identify each individual component that will be tested
Identify participants
Invite core participants to an organizational meeting
Coordinate the development of the test plan and other required documentation
Reserve a conference room that accommodates all participants
Ensure conference room is available at least one day before the conference to
perform setup
Determine the need for audio/visual and recording equipment
Reserve audio/visual and recording equipment, if applicable
Arrange for refreshments, if appropriate
Create a supplies checklist to include required testing tools, measurement and
recording devices, and items such as nametags/nametag holders, clipboards,
and pens
Copy all test documents and files as a backup onto a CD-ROM, USB flash
drive, or other removable media
Validate the correct operation of testing equipment and ensure evaluators know
how to operate the test equipment
Conduct a dry-run/walk through of the test to be performed, if necessary
Review procedures to terminate the test, should operational issues necessitate it
