the intent and targeting aspects of a potential attack helps organizations narrow the set of threat
events that are most relevant to consider.

Threat shifting is the response of adversaries to perceived safeguards and/or countermeasures
(i.e., security controls), in which adversaries change some characteristic of their intent/targeting
in order to avoid and/or overcome those safeguards/countermeasures. Threat shifting can occur in
one or more domains including: (i) the time domain (e.g., a delay in an attack or illegal entry to
conduct additional surveillance); (ii) the target domain (e.g., selecting a different target that is not
as well protected); (iii) the resource domain (e.g., adding resources to the attack in order to reduce
uncertainty or overcome safeguards and/or countermeasures); or (iv) the attack planning/attack
method domain (e.g., changing the attack weapon or attack path). Threat shifting is a natural
consequence of a dynamic set of interactions between threat sources and types of organizational
assets targeted. With more sophisticated threat sources, it also tends to default to the path of least
resistance to exploit particular vulnerabilities, and the responses are not always predictable. In
addition to the safeguards and/or countermeasures implemented and the impact of a successful
exploit of an organizational vulnerability, another influence on threat shifting is the benefit to the
attacker. That perceived benefit on the attacker side can also influence how much and when threat
shifting occurs.

Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions
A vulnerability is a weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal
controls, or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source. 25 Most information system
vulnerabilities can be associated with security controls that either have not been applied (either
intentionally or unintentionally), or have been applied, but retain some weakness. However, it is
also important to allow for the possibility of emergent vulnerabilities that can arise naturally over
time as organizational missions/business functions evolve, environments of operation change,
new technologies proliferate, and new threats emerge. In the context of such change, existing
security controls may become inadequate and may need to be reassessed for effectiveness. The
tendency for security controls to potentially degrade in effectiveness over time reinforces the
need to maintain risk assessments during the entire system development life cycle and also the
importance of continuous monitoring programs to obtain ongoing situational awareness of the
organizational security posture.

Vulnerabilities are not identified only within information systems. Viewing information systems
in a broader context, vulnerabilities can be found in organizational governance structures (e.g.,
the lack of effective risk management strategies and adequate risk framing, poor intra-agency
communications, inconsistent decisions about relative priorities of missions/business functions, or
misalignment of enterprise architecture to support mission/business activities). Vulnerabilities can
also be found in external relationships (e.g., dependencies on particular energy sources, supply
chains, information technologies, and telecommunications providers), mission/business processes
(e.g., poorly defined processes or processes that are not risk-aware), and enterprise/information
security architectures (e.g., poor architectural decisions resulting in lack of diversity or resiliency
in organizational information systems). 26

   The severity of a vulnerability is an assessment of the relative importance of mitigating/remediating the vulnerability.
The severity can be determined by the extent of the potential adverse impact if such a vulnerability is exploited by a
threat source. Thus, the severity of vulnerabilities, in general, is context-dependent.

   NIST Special Publication 800-39 provides guidance on vulnerabilities at all three tiers in the risk management
hierarchy and the potential adverse impact that can occur if threats exploit such vulnerabilities.
