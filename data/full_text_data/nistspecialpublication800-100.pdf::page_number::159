Appendix B                                             Frequently Asked Questions



   â€¢ Section 10: Signatory Authority
   Please note this is an abbreviated description of each section. For more
   information on each of the sections, please refer to Section 4.12.

Q. What is the difference between ISA and MOU/MOA ?
A. An ISA is used to support an MOU/MOA that establishes the requirements for
   data exchange between two organizations. The MOU/MOA is used to document
   the business and legal requirements necessary to support the business relations
   between the two organizations. The MOU/MOA should not include technical
   details regarding how the interconnection is established; that is the function of
   the ISA. An ISA is a distinct security-related document that outlines the technical
   solution and security requirements for the interconnection. It does not replace an
   MOU/MOA. As older MOUs/MOAs are updated, they should be changed to refer to
   the appropriate ISA covering the connectivity addressed by the MOU/MOA. An
   ISA can be signed only by the two AOs/DAAs (or other authorizing management
   officials as designated by the organizations involved) whose names appear in
   Section 4 of the agreement. The ISA should be formally signed before the
   interconnection is declared operational.

Q. Is it acceptable to combine the MOU/MOA and the ISA?
A. Yes. Organizations may combine ISAs and MOUs/MOAs to simplify their
   management processes and reduce paperwork. When combining ISAs and
   MOUs/MOAs, organizations must ensure that the contents and the intent of these
   two documents remain intact.

Q. When does C&A need to occur?
A. Before interconnecting their information systems, each organization should
   ensure that its respective system is properly certified and accredited in
   accordance with federal C&A guidelines. The C&A process is applicable for both
   emerging systems and those already in production. It involves a series of
   security-related activities, including developing or updating a system security
   plan, conducting a risk assessment, preparing a contingency plan, and conducting
   a security review.
   Establishing an interconnection may represent a significant change to the
   connected systems. Each organization should perform an assessment to
   determine whether recertification of the new configuration is appropriate.

Q. How often should security reviews occur?
A. One or both organizations should review the security controls for the
   interconnection at least annually or whenever a significant change occurs to
   ensure that they are operating properly and are providing appropriate levels of
   protection.

Q. What criteria should the organizations use to establish a baseline of
   minimum-security controls that must be implemented on each of the
   interconnecting systems?
A. The security controls of the interconnected systems should be evaluated and
   meet the standards of the management, operational, and technical controls of
   the highest classification between the two in accordance with NIST SP 800-53,
   Revision 1, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems.
