2175   3.17.2. Acquisition Strategies, Tools, and Methods
2176             REQUIREMENT: 03.17.02
2177             Develop and implement acquisition strategies, contract tools, and procurement methods to
2178             identify, protect against, and mitigate supply chain risks.

2179             DISCUSSION
2180             The acquisition process provides an important vehicle for protecting the supply chain. There are
2181             many useful tools and techniques available, including obscuring the end use of a system or
2182             system component, using blind or filtered buys, requiring tamper-evident packaging, or using
2183             trusted or controlled distribution. The results from a supply chain risk assessment can inform
2184             the strategies, tools, and methods that are most applicable to the situation. Tools and techniques
2185             may provide protections against unauthorized production, theft, tampering, the insertion of
2186             counterfeits, the insertion of malicious software or backdoors, and poor development practices
2187             throughout the system life cycle.
2188             Organizations also consider providing incentives for suppliers to implement controls, promote
2189             transparency in their processes and security practices, provide contract language that addresses
2190             the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components, and restrict purchases from untrustworthy
2191             suppliers. Organizations consider providing training, education, and awareness programs for
2192             personnel regarding supply chain risk, available mitigation strategies, and when the programs
2193             should be employed. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, documentation,
2194             and evidence are commensurate with the security requirements of the organization. Contracts
2195             may specify documentation protection requirements.

2199   3.17.3. Supply Chain Requirements and Processes
2200             REQUIREMENT: 03.17.03
2201             a. Establish a process for identifying and addressing weaknesses or deficiencies in the supply
2202                chain elements and processes.
2203             b. Enforce the following security requirements to protect against supply chain risks to the
2204                system, system components, or system services and to limit the harm or consequences
2205                from supply chain-related events: [Assignment: organization-defined security requirements].

2206             DISCUSSION
2207             Supply chain elements include organizations, entities, or tools that are employed for the
2208             research, development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and
2209             maintenance, and disposal of systems and system components. Supply chain processes include
2210             hardware, software, firmware, and systems development processes; shipping and handling
2211             procedures; personnel and physical security programs; configuration management tools,
2212             techniques, and measures to maintain provenance; or other programs, processes, or procedures
2213             associated with the development, acquisition, maintenance, and disposal of systems and system
2214             components. Supply chain elements and processes may be provided by organizations, system
2215             integrators, or external providers. Weaknesses or deficiencies in supply chain elements or
