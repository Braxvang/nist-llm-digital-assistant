                      2. In steps 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14A, 14B, and 17 the command
                         returns status word '69 82' (security status is not satisfied).
                      3. In steps 3, 8, 13, 15, and 16, the command returns the requested
                         data object along with the status word '90 00' at the end.
                      4. In step 24, the command returns '6A 82' (data object not found).

C.1.2.4        Virtual Contact Interface
 Purpose               Validates the conformance of the GET DATA command through the
                       VCI. This test is applicable to the mandatory data objects required by
                       Table 2 of SP 800-73-4 Part 2, and the optional data objects when
                       supported by the card.
 Reference(s)          1. Table 2 of SP 800-73-4 Part 2
                       2. AS05.01, AS05.02, AS05.12, AS05.12A
 Precondition(s)       1. The IUT is placed within the reading range of the contactless
                          reader.
                       2. There exists a valid PC/SC connection between the test system
                          and the contactless reader.
                       3. No other contactless card is within the proximity of the reader.
                       4. There exists a valid VCI connection to the card.
 Test Scenario         1. Repeat step 1 from Test C.1.2.1 without secure messaging.
                      2. Repeat the steps 2-24 from the Test C.1.2.1 using the '0C'
                         CLA byte
 Expected Result(s)   The expected results are the same as those specified in Test C.1.2.1
                      for the contact interface.

C.2         Commands for Authentication

C.2.1        VERIFY Card Command

C.2.1.1        Contact Interface
 Purpose              Validates the following conditions associated with the VERIFY
                      command:
                      1. With an invalid key reference.
                      2. Successful execution of the command (with PIV Card Application
                         PIN and (if supported) Global PIN and OCC).
                      3. Execution of the command with a PIN not formatted per SP 800-
                         73-4.
                      4. Multiple execution of the command with an incorrect PIN
                         (formatted correctly) until the retry counter reaches zero.
                      5. Reset the security status.
