NIST SP 800-82r3                                                Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

protection tools should be configured to minimize their potential impact on the OT (e.g., employ
notification rather than quarantine). Example compensating controls include increased traffic
monitoring and auditing.

OT Discussion: The organization ensures that the use of monitoring tools and techniques does
not adversely impact the operational performance of the OT. Example compensating controls
include deploying sufficient network, process, and physical monitoring.
Control Enhancement: (2) OT Discussion: When the OT cannot support the use of automated
tools for near-real-time analysis of events, the organization employs compensating controls (e.g.,
providing an auditing capability on a separate system, nonautomated mechanisms or procedures)
in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.
Control Enhancement: (4) (10) (12) (14) (20) (22) No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (5) OT Discussion: Example compensating controls include manually
generating alerts.
