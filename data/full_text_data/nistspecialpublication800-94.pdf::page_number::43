                                                         GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



 Prevention action performed (if any).
Most network-based IDPSs can also perform packet captures. Typically this is done once an alert has
occurred, either to record subsequent activity in the connection or to record the entire connection if the
IDPS has been temporarily storing the previous packets.

4.3.3    Detection Capabilities

Network-based IDPSs typically offer extensive and broad detection capabilities. Most products use a
combination of signature-based detection, anomaly-based detection, and stateful protocol analysis
techniques to perform in-depth analysis of common protocols; organizations should use network-based
IDPS products that use such a combination of techniques. The detection methods are usually tightly
interwoven; for example, a stateful protocol analysis engine might parse activity into requests and
responses, each of which is examined for anomalies and compared to signatures of known bad activity.
Some products also use the same techniques and provide the same functionality as network behavior
analysis (NBA) software; see Section 6 for additional information.

This section discusses the following aspects of detection capabilities:

 Types of events detected
 Detection accuracy
 Tuning and customization
 Technology limitations.
4.3.3.1 Types of Events Detected

The types of events most commonly detected by network-based IDPS sensors include the following:

 Application layer reconnaissance and attacks (e.g., banner grabbing, buffer overflows, format
  string attacks, password guessing, malware transmission). Most network-based IDPSs analyze
  several dozen application protocols. Commonly analyzed ones include Dynamic Host Configuration
  Protocol (DHCP), DNS, Finger, FTP, HTTP, 22 Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), Internet
  Relay Chat (IRC), Network File System (NFS), Post Office Protocol (POP), rlogin/rsh, Remote
  Procedure Call (RPC), Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), Server Message Block (SMB), SMTP,
  SNMP, Telnet, and Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), as well as database protocols, instant
  messaging applications, and peer-to-peer file sharing software.
 Transport layer reconnaissance and attacks (e.g., port scanning, unusual packet fragmentation,
  SYN floods). The most frequently analyzed transport layer protocols are TCP and UDP.
 Network layer reconnaissance and attacks (e.g., spoofed IP addresses, illegal IP header values).
  The most frequently analyzed network layer protocols are IPv4, ICMP, and IGMP. Many products
  are also adding support for IPv6 analysis. The level of IPv6 analysis that network-based IDPSs can

     Although network-based IDPSs can analyze HTTP protocol activity, they usually cannot perform analysis on the use of Web
     services, such as Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and Extensible Markup Language (XML) messages carried over
     HTTP. Security technologies known as XML gateways or XML firewalls have been created specifically to analyze Web
     services activity. In addition to providing intrusion prevention functions, these technologies also perform firewalling,
     authentication and authorization services, access control, and audit logging. More information on XML gateways is
     available from NIST SP 800-95, Guide to Web Services Security (DRAFT), which is available at
     http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts.html.
