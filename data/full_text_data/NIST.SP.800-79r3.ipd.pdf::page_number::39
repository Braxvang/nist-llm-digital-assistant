       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                       Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                                              and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1197            personnel, and are in accordance with applicable policies, regulations, standards,
1198            technical guidelines, and organizational guidance
1199       •    Interview — A directed conversation with one or more issuer personnel in which both
1200            preestablished and follow-on questions are asked, responses documented, discussion
1201            encouraged, and conclusions reached
1202       •    Observe — A real-time viewing of PIV processes in operation, including all of the
1203            information system components of the issuer involved in the creation, issuance,
1204            maintenance, and termination of PIV Cards or derived PIV credentials
1205       •    Test — An evaluation of a component against a set of relevant PIV specifications using
1206            applicable test methods and metrics (as given in the associated assessment procedures in
1207            Appendices G.1 and G.2.)
1208   These methods are intended to provide the assessor with sufficient, precise, accurate, and
1209   relevant evidence regarding an IAT topic and its focus areas. One or more assessment methods
1210   may be required to determine whether the issuer has satisfactorily met the objective outlined for
1211   that assessment procedure. Assessment results are used by the assessor to determine the overall
1212   effectiveness of the issuer control.
1213   Table 4 shows the “Preparation and Maintenance of Documentation” authorization focus area
1214   under the “Organizational Preparedness” IAT. The “applicability” column identifies whether the
1215   issuer control needs to be met by a PKI-based AAL2 or AAL3 derived PIV credential issuer or a
1216   non-PKI AAL2 or AAL3 derived PIV credential issuer. If the “applicability” column states
1217   “DPCI,” then the issuer control is applicable to all derived PIV credential issuers, regardless of
1218   what type of derived PIV credential is issued by the issuer.

         DO(DC)-1     The organization develops and implements an issuer operations plan              DPCI        SP 800-79, Sec. 2.12
                      according to the template in Appendix D.2. The operations plan                              – Authorization
                      references other documents as needed.                                                       Package and

                              how the control is implemented, and (iv) whether the control is
                              organization or facility-specific (review).
                        (iii) Relevant operating procedures and associated documentation
                              are referenced accurately (review).

                              DAO within the organization (review, interview).
         DO(DC)-3     The organization has a written policy and procedures for initial                DPCI        [SP800-157], Sec. 2
