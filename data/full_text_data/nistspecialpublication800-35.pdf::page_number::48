5.2.1     Contingency Planning

The modern networked computing environment brings significant challenges to the development of
contingency plans. Networked computing has changed the scope and focus of what has traditionally been
a local issue. Contingency planning is designed to reduce the consequences of any loss of data or
infrastructure. Contingency planning enables organization personnel to restore critical IT functions and
connectivity rapidly, effectively, and safely. The contingency plan defines the procedures, resources,
tasking, and information required for performing recovery actions in response to a broad range of events.
A well-executed and tested contingency plan also gives confidence that critical resources will be available
when needed and facilitates an organization’s continuity of operations in an emergency situation. The
plan is a living document that must be updated regularly to reflect changes to the system’s configuration
and operations. Additional information on contingency planning is provided in NIST SP 800-34,
Contingency Planning Guide for Information Technology Systems. This guide discusses various
contingency plans that will help sustain and recover critical IT services following an emergency.

The contingency plan should address, at a minimum, the following five main components: supporting
information, notification/ activation, recovery, reconstitution, and supporting appendixes.

 Supporting Information—provides an introduction and concept of operations for the plan
 Notification / Activation—items such as notification procedures, damage assessment, and plan
  activation
 Recovery—items such as a sequence of recovery activities, and recovery procedures
 Reconstitution—items such as the sequence of recovery activities, testing of systems, and
  termination of operations
 Plan Appendixes—items such contact information, equipment lists, service agreements, and any
  other related contingency plans.
Contingency Planning Services

Service providers offer their services for various phases of the contingency planning life cycle. In
considering whether to contract out contingency planning services, the organization could conduct a cost-
benefit analysis for each breakdown of the service offering (e.g., develop, update and test, and execute the
contingency plan).

 Develop—service providers can develop the organization’s contingency plan. This service requires
  gathering information from many functional areas. The vendor’s first step should be to perform a
  business impact assessment (BIA) to determine the system’s internal and external dependencies,
  allowable outage times, and recovery priorities. The BIA provides a basis for developing the specific
  recovery strategy and procedures that comprise the heart of the contingency plan.
 Update and Test—updating the plan as needed is critical to its success because the contingency plan
  is a living document. It is very common to retain the same service provider that developed the plan to
  update and test it. Updates to the plan should be made when changes in personnel, procedures, assets,
  or other resources are incorporated into the system.
      Service providers may also ensure that the plan is tested before circumstances require its use. The
      test may be a walk-through or a simulated drill, or a full operational exercise that encompasses all
