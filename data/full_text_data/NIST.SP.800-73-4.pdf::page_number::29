4.      PIV Data Objects Representation

4.1     Data Objects Definition

A data object is an item of information seen on the card command interface for which is specified a
name, a description of logical content, a format, and a coding. Each data object has a globally unique
name called its object identifier (OID), as defined in ISO/IEC 8824-2:2002 [ISO8824].

A data object whose data content is encoded as a BER-TLV data structure as in ISO/IEC 8825-1:2002
[ISO8825] is called a BER-TLV data object.

4.1.1    Data Object Content

The content of a data object is the sequence of bytes that are said to be contained in or to be the value
of the data object. The number of bytes in this byte sequence is referred to as the length of the data
content and also as the size of the data object. The first byte in the sequence is regarded as being at
byte position or offset zero in the content of the data object.

The data content of a BER-TLV data object may consist of other BER-TLV data objects. In this case
the tag of the data object indicates that the data object is a constructed data object. A BER-TLV data
object that is not a constructed data object is called a primitive data object.

The PIV data objects are BER-TLV objects encoded as per [ISO8825], except that tag values of the
PIV data object’s inner tag assignments do not conform to BER-TLV requirements. 13 This is due to
the need to accommodate legacy tags inherited from [GSC-IS].

Before the card is issued, data objects that are created but not used shall be set to zero-length value.

4.2     OIDs and Tags of PIV Card Application Data Objects

Table 3 lists the ASN.1 object identifiers and BER-TLV tags of the thirty-six PIV Card Application
data objects. For the purpose of constructing PIV Card Application data object names in the
CardApplicationURL in the CCC of the PIV Card Application, the NIST RID ('A0 00 00 03 08') shall
be used and the card application type shall be set to '00'.

4.3     Object Identifiers

Each of the data objects in the PIV Card Application has been provided with a BER-TLV tag and an
ASN.1 OID from the NIST personal identity verification arc. These object identifier assignments are
given in Table 3.

A data object shall be identified on the PIV client-application programming interface using its OID.
An object identifier on the PIV client-application programming interface shall be a dot-delimited
string of the integer components of the OID. For example, the representation of the OID of the
CHUID on the PIV client-application programming interface is “2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.48.0.”


13 The exception does not apply to the BIT Group Template, the Discovery Object or the Application Property Template

(APT), since these objects use interindustry tags from ISO/IEC 7816-6.
