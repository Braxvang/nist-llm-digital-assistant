464         Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Testing Requirements
465    As noted in Section 4.2.2 of [FIPS201], the PIV Card shall be validated under [FIPS140] with an
466    overall validation of Level 2 and with Level 3 physical security. The scope of the Cryptographic
467    Module Validation Program (CMVP) validation shall include all cryptographic operations
468    performed over both the contact and contactless interfaces. Table 11 8 describes the
469    Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP) tests that are required for each supported
470    key and algorithm at the time of publication 9. If any changes are made to the CAVP validation
471    requirements, the changes and the deadlines for conformance with these requirements will be
472    posted on NISTâ€™s Personal Identity Verification Program (NPIVP) web page at
473    http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/npivp/index.html.

         TDEA has been removed from Table 11 since [SP 800-131A Revision 2] has deprecated its use through 2023 and disallowed its use after 2023.
       Consequently, on January 1, 2024, CMVP will move validated TDEA implementations to the FIPS 140-mode non-approved historical validation
       list.
