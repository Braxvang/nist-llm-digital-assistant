                                                            CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



    probably need to be taken offline for maintenance at various times and therefore two-way
    communication in advance among the community members is essential to achieving a clear
    understanding of the service levels that they offer to one another and require from one another.
 Consumers still need IT skills (on-site-community). In an on-site community cloud, there are
  potentially two classes of participant organizations: those who provide cloud services to the
  community, and those who only consume cloud resources. For the participant organizations that
  provide cloud resources, the IT skills required are similar to those required for the on-site private
  cloud scenario except that the overall cloud configuration may be more complex and hence require a
  higher skill level. If any participant organizations are consumers only, the IT skills required are
  similar to those of the general case except that if there are multiple participant organizations
  providing cloud services, the configuration from the consuming side may be more complex, e.g.,
  forcing clients to maintain multiple authentication credentials or to commit to an identity management
  framework.
    Identity and access control configurations among the participant organizations may be complex;
    organizations considering a community cloud should ensure that the IT staff from the participant
    organizations negotiate and clearly document the access policies that are planned within the
    community cloud.

 Workload locations are hidden from clients (on-site-community). As with the outsourced private
  cloud scenario, assuming that participant organizations faithfully implement their security perimeters
  and have policies to keep workloads onsite, workloads should remain within participant
  organizations. Variations on this scenario are possible, however. For example, a participant
  organization providing cloud services to the community cloud may wish to employ an outsourced
  private cloud as a part of its implementation strategy. An organization that is concerned with
  knowing workload locations should discuss potential outsourcing configurations prior to joining a
  community cloud, and should ensure that the outsourcing policies are clearly documented for the
  participant organizations.
 Risks from multi-tenancy (on-site-community). As with the on-site private scenario, the on-site
  community scenario mitigates some of the multi-tenancy risks by restricting the number of possible
  attackers. In the on-site community scenario, however, the cloud encompasses more organizations
  and hence may restrict the set of potential attackers less than in the case of the on-site private
  scenario.
 Data import/export, and performance limitations (on-site-community). The communication links
  between the various participant organizations in a community cloud can be provisioned to various
  levels of performance, security and reliability, based on the needs of the participant organizations.
  The network-based limitations are thus similar to those of the outsourced-private cloud scenario.
 Potentially strong security from external threats (on-site-community). The security of a
  community cloud from external threats depends on the security of all the security perimeters of the
  participant organizations and the strength of the communications links. These dependencies are
  essentially similar to those of the outsourced private cloud scenario, but with possibly more links and
  security perimeters and greater configuration complexity.
 Highly variable up-front costs to migrate into the cloud (on-site-community). The up-front costs
  of an on-site community cloud for a participant organization depend greatly on whether the
  organization plans to consume cloud services only or also to provide cloud services. For the
  consume-only scenario, the up-front costs appear to be similar to those for an outsourced private
  cloud (i.e., modest-to-significant). For a participant organization that intends to provide cloud
