capabilities, and executing simultaneous tests. Since the system hosting the VM supports two or more
operating systems at once, test systems running VMs require greater processing power and memory.

Testers should be knowledgeable, experienced, and comfortable using all operating systems found on the
test system because system modifications are frequently required to operate specific tools or system
capabilities successfully. For example, if the test team is using Red Hat Linux to conduct a wireless
security test, the team will need to be familiar with installing and configuring wireless network cards
because the steps for doing so may not be obvious to a Red Hat Linux novice.

Regardless of the system installation method used, organizations conducting security tests should develop
and maintain a baseline image from which to conduct their tests. An image provides a standardized
toolkit for the team to use, and enables rapid deployment of a team. The baseline image should consist of
the operating system, drivers, requisite system and security configurations, applications, and tools to
conduct testing, including mechanisms for automatically logging assessor actions (e.g., commands
issued). Full system images are often hardware-dependent, so installing an image on another system with
different hardware (e.g., video cards) requires the test team to modify the image—which involves specific
skills and is time-consuming. VM images are more versatile and do not carry the same hardware
restrictions as full system images, making them a more favorable option for test teams. Multifunction
teams—such as those with the skills to conduct wireless scans, application testing, vulnerability
assessments, and penetration tests—may have one image that contains the tools required to execute all
test types or multiple images for various techniques. Using one image is generally preferable, as retaining
multiple images requires additional maintenance.

The VM image should be updated periodically to ensure that only the latest tools and versions are being
used. During this update period, the team should confirm tool functionality and identify—with
documentation as appropriate—any changes in the functionality or use. Updating tools that discover
vulnerabilities (e.g., vulnerability scanners) before each test helps ensure that recently discovered
vulnerabilities are part of the testing. In addition to maintaining their existing toolset, the team should
periodically assess its toolkit to identify obsolete tools to be removed and new tools that should be added.

Before using test systems in a security test, the test team should apply the latest security patches and
enable only the services needed for connectivity and testing. This recommendation applies to all
operating systems that may be used for testing, including those in VMs. The organization’s security
group may validate that test systems are compliant with the organization’s security requirements and
approved for testing before connecting these systems to the network. Validation can be done via the same
systems used for technical tests such as vulnerability scans. Test systems may not meet all of the
organization’s security requirements because of the requirements of the tools used for testing—for
example, some security controls may interfere with tool operation because they attempt to stop scans or
attacks performed using those tools. In such cases, assessors may need to disable these security controls
when the tools are in use.

Traveling teams should maintain a flyaway kit that includes systems, images, additional tools, cables,
projectors, and other equipment that a team may need when performing testing at other locations. If an
organization uses an external test team, this team should not use the organization’s resources unless
required to do so. If the organization does not authorize external systems to be connected to its network,
the external test team will need to either install all required tools onto an approved client system or bring
a bootable system emulation capability such as a live CD. 27 Appendix A provides examples of two live

     A live CD is a fully functioning operating system environment that is contained on a bootable CD. This technology does not
     require the user to load anything (e.g., software, drivers, etc) onto the system.
