SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


         replace system code and hide processes and files, including the rootkit code itself,
         from anti-virus and anti-spyware software.

In order to be effective, malware protection should include verifying the identity of the
source of the received software upon receipt, and scanning the software for malware upon
initial receipt and periodically thereafter (e.g., upon reloading).

FR:8.8 The CKMS design shall specify the following malware protection capabilities for
CKMS devices:
   a) Anti-virus protection software, including the specified time periods and events that
      trigger anti-virus scans, software update, and virus signature database updates;
   b) Anti-spyware protection software, including the specified time periods and events
      that trigger anti-spyware scans, software update, and virus signature updates; and
   c) Rootkit detection and protection software, including the specified time periods and
      events that trigger rootkit detection, software update, and signature updates.

FR:8.9 The CKMS design shall specify the following software integrity check information
for operating system and CKMS application software:
   a) If software integrity is verified upon installation, indicate how the verification is
      performed; and
   b) If software integrity is verified periodically, indicate how often the verification is
      performed.

                             When untrusted software, software updates and software
PR:8.9
                             support may be introduced into the FCKMS, then the Federal
                             CKMS shall support the following malware protection
                             capabilities for itself and its devices:
                               a) Anti-virus protection software,
                               b) Anti-spyware protection software, and
                               c) Rootkit detection and protection software.
                             When a Federal CKMS receives untrusted software, software
PR:8.10
                             updates or software support, then the FCKMS shall perform
                             the following before installation:
                               a) Scan received data (including keys and metadata) when
                                  first received, and
                               b) Verify that the updated software/firmware contains no
                                  malware before running it.
                 RA-5        When a Federal CKMS is allowed to receive untrusted
PR:8.11
                 SI-4        software, software updates or software support, then the
                             FCKMS shall be configured to perform (at a minimum):
                               a) A weekly scan of installed software,
                               b) A scan of removable media when first introduced into
                                  the CKMS,
