NIST SP 800-58                                             Voice Over IP Security
    _________________________________________________________________________


       Jitter can also be controlled throughout the VOIP network by using routers,
       firewalls, and other network elements that support QoS. These elements process
       and pass along time urgent traffic like VOIP packets sooner than less urgent data
       packets. However, not all network components were designed with QoS in mind.
       An example of a network element that does not implement this QoS demand is a
       crypto-engine that ignores Type of Service (ToS) bits in an IP header and other
       indicators of packet urgency (see Section 8.6). Another method for reducing
       delay variation is to pattern network traffic to diminish jitter by making as
       efficient use of the bandwidth as possible. This constraint is at odds with some
       security measures in VOIP. Chief among these is IPsec, whose processing
       requirements may increase latency, thus limiting effective bandwidth and
       contributing to jitter. Effective bandwidth is compromised when packets are
       expanded with new headers. In normal IP traffic, this problem is negligible since
       the change in the size of the packet is very small compared with the packet size.
       Because VOIP uses very small packets, even a minimal increase is important
       because the increase accrues across all the packets, and VOIP sends a very high
       volume of these small packets.

       The window of delivery for a VOIP packet is very small, so it follows that the
       acceptable variation in packet delay is even smaller. Thus, although we are
       concerned with security, the utmost care must be given to assuring that delays in
       packet deliveries caused by security devices are kept uniform throughout the
       traffic stream. Implementing devices that support QoS and improving the
       efficiency of bandwidth with header compression allows for more uniform packet
       delay in a secured VOIP network.

 3.3   Packet Loss

       VOIP is exceptionally intolerant of packet loss. Packet loss can result from
       excess latency, where a group of packets arrives late and must be discarded in
       favor of newer ones. It can also be the result of jitter, that is, when a packet
       arrives after its surrounding packets have been flushed from the buffer, making
       the received packet useless. VOIP-specific packet loss issues exist in addition to
       the packet loss issues already associated with data networks; these are the cases
       where a packet is not delivered at all. Compounding the packet loss problem is
       VOIPâ€™s reliance on RTP, which uses the unreliable UDP for transport, and thus
       does not guarantee packet delivery. However, the time constraints do not allow
       for a reliable protocol such as TCP to be used to deliver media. By the time a
       packet could be reported missing, retransmitted, and received, the time constraints
       for QoS would be well exceeded. The good news is that VOIP packets are very
       small, containing a payload of only 10-50 bytes [8], which is approximately 12.5-
       62.5 ms, with most implementations tending toward the shorter range. The loss of
       such a minuscule amount of speech is not discernable or at least not worthy of
       complaint for a human VOIP user. The bad news is these packets are usually not
       lost in isolation. Bandwidth congestion and other such causes of packet loss tend
       to affect all the packets being delivered around the same time. So although the


                                                                                       21
