                                                                   Guidelines on PDA Forensics


Encryption – Any procedure used in cryptography to convert plain text into cipher text to
prevent anyone but the intended recipient from reading that data.

Examination – A technical review that makes the evidence visible and suitable for analysis;
tests performed on the evidence to determine the presence or absence of specific data.

Exculpatory Evidence – Evidence that tends to decrease the likelihood of fault or guilt.

eXecute in Place – A facility that allows code to be executed directly from flash memory
without loading the code into RAM.

File Name Anomaly – A mismatch between the internal file header and it external extension;
a file name inconsistent with the content of the file (e.g., renaming a graphics file with a non-
graphics extension).

File Slack – Space between the logical end of the file and the end of the last allocation unit for
that file.

Filesystem – A software mechanism that defines the way that files are named, stored,
organized, and accessed on logical volumes of partitioned memory.

Flash ROM – non-volatile memory that is writable.

Forensic Copy – An accurate bit-for-bit reproduction of the information contained on an
electronic device or associated media, whose validity and integrity has been verified using an
accepted algorithm.

Forensic Specialist – Locates, identifies, collects, analyzes and examines data while
preserving the integrity and maintaining a strict chain of custody of information discovered.

Global Positioning System – A system for determining position by comparing radio signals
from several satellites.

Hardware Driver – Applications responsible for establishing communication between
hardware and software programs.

Hashing – The process of using a mathematical algorithm against data to produce a numeric
value that is representative of that data.

Heap – A software data structure used for dynamic allocation of memory.

Image – An exact bit-stream copy of all electronic data on a device, performed in a manner
that ensures the information is not altered.

Inculpatory Evidence – Evidence that tends to increase the likelihood of fault or guilt.

Loop-Back Mode – An operating system facility that allows a device to be mounted via a
loopback address and viewed logically on the PC.
