                                                                              COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE



 What additional tools or resources are needed to detect, analyze, and mitigate future incidents?
Small incidents need limited post-incident analysis, with the exception of incidents performed through
new attack methods that are of widespread concern and interest. After serious attacks have occurred, it is
usually worthwhile to hold post-mortem meetings that cross team and organizational boundaries to
provide a mechanism for information sharing. The primary consideration in holding such meetings is
ensuring that the right people are involved. Not only is it important to invite people who have been
involved in the incident that is being analyzed, but also it is wise to consider who should be invited for the
purpose of facilitating future cooperation.

The success of such meetings also depends on the agenda. Collecting input about expectations and needs
(including suggested topics to cover) from participants before the meeting increases the likelihood that the
participants’ needs will be met. In addition, establishing rules of order before or during the start of a
meeting can minimize confusion and discord. Having one or more moderators who are skilled in group
facilitation can yield a high payoff. Finally, it is also important to document the major points of
agreement and action items and to communicate them to parties who could not attend the meeting.

Lessons learned meetings provide other benefits. Reports from these meetings are good material for
training new team members by showing them how more experienced team members respond to incidents.
Updating incident response policies and procedures is another important part of the lessons learned
process. Post-mortem analysis of the way an incident was handled will often reveal a missing step or an
inaccuracy in a procedure, providing impetus for change. Because of the changing nature of information
technology and changes in personnel, the incident response team should review all related documentation
and procedures for handling incidents at designated intervals.

Another important post-incident activity is creating a follow-up report for each incident, which can be
quite valuable for future use. The report provides a reference that can be used to assist in handling similar
incidents. Creating a formal chronology of events (including timestamped information such as log data
from systems) is important for legal reasons, as is creating a monetary estimate of the amount of damage
the incident caused. This estimate may become the basis for subsequent prosecution activity by entities
such as the U.S. Attorney General’s office. Follow-up reports should be kept for a period of time as
specified in record retention policies.45

3.4.2    Using Collected Incident Data

Lessons learned activities should produce a set of objective and subjective data regarding each incident.
Over time, the collected incident data should be useful in several capacities. The data, particularly the
total hours of involvement and the cost, may be used to justify additional funding of the incident response
team. A study of incident characteristics may indicate systemic security weaknesses and threats, as well
as changes in incident trends. This data can be put back into the risk assessment process, ultimately
leading to the selection and implementation of additional controls. Another good use of the data is
measuring the success of the incident response team. If incident data is collected and stored properly, it
should provide several measures of the success (or at least the activities) of the incident response team.
Incident data can also be collected to determine if a change to incident response capabilities causes a
corresponding change in the team’s performance (e.g., improvements in efficiency, reductions in costs).
Furthermore, organizations that are required to report incident information will need to collect the

     General Records Schedule (GRS) 24, Information Technology Operations and Management Records, specifies that
     “computer security incident handling, reporting and follow-up records” should be destroyed “3 years after all necessary
     follow-up actions have been completed.” GRS 24 is available from the National Archives and Records Administration at
