                                               TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



       The level of human interaction required. For instance, if assessors are to work in tandem with IT
        staff, this may serve as a form of training for the IT staff but will likely increase the time needed
        to complete the assessment when compared to the time needed by assessors and IT staff working
        independently.
6.3     Selecting and Customizing Techniques

There are many factors to consider when determining which technical testing and examination techniques
should be used for a particular assessment. An organization should first determine its assessment
objectives, such as focusing on verifying compliance with a particular mandate, verifying a system’s
security as part of certification and accreditation (C&A) activities, identifying exploitable vulnerabilities
in a group of systems, or evaluating intrusion detection system and incident handling procedure
performance. Next, the organization should select the classes of techniques (e.g., review, target
identification and analysis, target vulnerability validation) to be used to obtain information that supports
those objectives, and specific techniques within each selected class. For some testing techniques, the
organization must also determine the assessors’ viewpoint (e.g., internal versus external, covert versus
overt) and select corresponding techniques.

Since in most cases more than one technique can be used to meet an assessment objective, organizations
need to determine which techniques are best for each case. As discussed in Section 6.2, one important
consideration is resources—some techniques may cost substantially more than others to use because of
the types of tools required and the number of hours of staff time needed. Some techniques may also take
too long to perform—if there is a short timeframe for conducting an assessment, less extensive or
resource-intensive techniques may be needed, such as performing vulnerability scanning rather than a
penetration test. Skills are another important factor in technique selection—for example, an organization
may not have assessors on staff with the appropriate skill sets to use certain specialized techniques.

Organizations should also carefully consider risk when selecting testing techniques. Some techniques,
such as penetration testing, could lead to loss of system availability or exposure of sensitive data. In
some cases, organizations should consider whether testing should be performed on production systems or
similarly configured non-production systems, if such alternate systems are available, or restrict the use of
certain techniques to off-hours so as to minimize impact to operations. Factors to evaluate when making
such decisions include:

       The possible impact to the production systems. For example, if a particular test technique is
        likely to cause a denial of service, it should probably be used against a non-production system.
       The presence of sensitive personally identifiable information (PII). If testing could expose
        sensitive PII—such as Social Security numbers (SSN) or credit card information—to individuals
        who are not authorized to have access, organizations should consider performing their testing on
        a non-production system with a false version of the PII (e.g., test data instead of actual PII).
       How similarly the production and non-production systems can be configured. In practice, there
        are usually inconsistencies between the test and production environments, which can result in
        missed vulnerabilities if non-production systems are used.
Organizations often use a combination of techniques to achieve an in-depth security assessment while
maintaining an acceptable level of risk to systems and networks. As mentioned in Section 2, non-
technical techniques may be used instead of or in addition to technical techniques; many assessments use
a combination of non-technical and technical techniques.
