                                                                          Guidelines on PDA Forensics


        removed from the device to clear memory, or the device may be extremely low on battery
        power.

        In cases where devices are powered by alkaline batteries, fresh batteries should be inserted as
        soon as possible to lessen the chance of data loss before evidence can be acquired. Installing
        fresh batteries is a normal activity for PDAs, especially those that run alkaline-based devices.
        However, pulling the batteries out and installing replacement batteries changes the state of the
        device; therefore, the technician should take note of the current state of the device beforehand,
        along with any needed photographs.

        Devices powered by a lithium-ion battery source should either be plugged into a compatible
        cradle with a power source, or have a fully charged replacement battery inserted. If a cradle
        found at the scene is occupied with the device, the cradle should first be disconnected from any
        computer to which it is attached. During battery replacement, PDAs keep a small capacitance
        charge to the device to maintain volatile data for a short amount of time. Thus, batteries must
        be replaced quickly to prevent loss of data.

        To conserve power, PDAs are normally configured to shut themselves off after a short period
        of inactivity. Therefore, they are mostly likely to be powered off when found. If a PDA is
        powered on when found, maintaining a device in an active running mode causes it to consume
        more power than if it were powered off and inactive, making battery replacement and charging
        considerations even more important. Anecdotal evidence suggests that built-in user
        authentication and content encryption capabilities are not employed for the vast majority of
        PDAs seized. Therefore, if additional power cannot be supplied to a device, and it is turned off
        to conserve power and preserve memory contents, the risk of activating such security
        mechanisms when the device is turned on again should be low. Keeping a device in the active
        state is also troublesome. Moreover, authentication mechanisms, such as passwords, typically
        cannot be turned off without first satisfying the mechanism (e.g., supplying the correct
        password). For these reasons, procedures for some organizations may recommend turning off
        certain classes of PDAs or letting them turn off automatically, if found powered on.

5.4.1   Exacerbating Conditions

        Besides the battery level, other factors can influence the actions a technician takes in a given
        situation to preserve evidence when the device is found in the on state. For example, some
        devices can receive data through wireless networks that might provide new evidence, but
        might overwrite existing data. Therefore, a calculated decision must be made whether to
        prevent or allow further wireless communications [Cas04]. Other factors include whether the
        device is cradled, is synchronizing with or communicating through a host computer, or has a
        memory card inserted. Table 3 provides a list of common conditions and associated actions
        for the forensic technician to consider in meeting the identified goal.
