       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


1618   Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)-approved or NIST recommended. An
1619   algorithm or technique that is either 1) specified in a FIPS or NIST Recommendation, or
1620   2) adopted in a FIPS or NIST Recommendation.

1621   Assertion
1622   A statement from a verifier to an RP that contains information about a subscriber.
1623   Assertions may also contain verified attributes.

1624   Assertion Reference
1625   A data object, created in conjunction with an assertion, that identifies the verifier and
1626   includes a pointer to the full assertion held by the verifier.

1627   Asymmetric Keys
1628   Two related keys, comprised of a public key and a private key, that are used to perform
1629   complementary operations such as encryption and decryption or signature verification and
1630   generation.

1631   Attack
1632   An unauthorized entityâ€™s attempt to fool a verifier or RP into believing that the
1633   unauthorized individual in question is the subscriber.

1634   Attacker
1635   A party, including an insider, who acts with malicious intent to compromise a system.

1636   Attacker-in-the-Middle Attack (AitM)
1637   An attack in which an attacker is positioned between two communicating parties in order
1638   to intercept and/or alter data traveling between them. In the context of authentication, the
1639   attacker would be positioned between claimant and verifier, between registrant and CSP
1640   during enrollment, or between subscriber and CSP during authenticator binding.

1641   Attribute
1642   A quality or characteristic ascribed to someone or something.

1643   Attribute API
1644   An API that provides attribute values, derived attribute values, and related information
1645   about one or more subscribers. Access to these APIs are often granted to RPs in the
1646   context of an identity API (for a single subscriber) or a provisioning API (for multiple
1647   subscribers). This is distinct from an attribute verification API which is used to verify
1648   attribute values for a CSP during the identity proofing process.

1649   Attribute Bundle
