       100000
       000000
       001000              Since a5,5 = 1and row 3 contains a one in the 5th column (see H), row 3 is
I      000000              replaced by the exclusive-OR or row 3 and row 5.

       100000
       000000
       001000              Since a4,4 ≠ 1 and no other row has a one in column 4, the matrix is not altered.

       100000
       000000
       001000              Since a3,3 = 1, but no other row has a one in column 3, the matrix is not
K      000000              altered.
       000010
       000001

       100000
       000000
       001000              Since a2,2≠ 1 and no other row has a one in column 2, the matrix is not altered,
L      000000              and he process is complete.
       000010
       000001


Since the final form of the matrix has 4 non-zero rows, the rank of the matrix is 4.


F.2            Construction of Aperiodic Templates

For the purposes of executing the Non-overlapping Template Matching statistical test, all 2m m-bit binary
sequences that are aperiodic were pre-computed. These templates, or patterns, were stored in a file for m
= 2 to m = 21. The ANSI-C program utilized in finding these templates is provided below. By
modifying the parameter M, the template library corresponding to the template can be constructed. This
parameter value should not exceed B, since the dec2bin conversion routine will not operate correctly.
Conceivably, this source code can be easily modified to construct arbitrary 2m m-bit binary sequences for
larger m.
