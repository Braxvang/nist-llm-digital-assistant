                          The Computer Security Division (CSD), a component of the Information Technology Laboratory at the
                    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is responsible for developing standards, guidelines,
                    tests, and metrics for protection of non-national security federal information systems. NIST standards and
                    guidelines are developed in an open, transparent, and collaborative manner that enlists broad expertise
                    from around the world. While developed for federal agency use, these resources are voluntarily adopted by
                    other organizations because they are effective and accepted globally.
                          The need for cybersecurity standards and best practices that address interoperability, usability and
                     privacy continues to be critical for the Nation. CSD continues to align its resources to enable greater

                     development and application of practical, innovative security technologies and methodologies that
enhance our ability to address current and future computer and information security challenges. Our foundational research and
applied cybersecurity programs continue to advance in many areas including cryptography, roots of trust, identity and access
management, advanced security testing and measurement, cyber-physical systems, and public safety networks.
         Trust is crucial to the broad adoption of our standards and guidelines, including our cryptographic standards and
guidelines. To ensure that our cryptography resources have been developed according the highest standard of inclusiveness,
transparency and security, NIST initiated a formal review of our cryptographic standards development efforts in 2014. We
documented and solicited public comment on the principles and rigorous processes we use to engage stakeholders and experts
in industry, academia, and government to develop and revise these standards. We anticipate a final report in 2015 that will serve
as a basis for our future standards development and revision efforts.
         Increasing the trustworthiness and resilience of the IT infrastructure is a significant undertaking that requires a
substantial investment in the architectural design and development of our systems and networks. A disciplined and structured
set of systems security engineering processes that starts with and builds on well-established international standards provides an
important starting point. Draft Special Publication 800-160, Systems Security Engineering: An Integrated Approach to Building
Trustworthy Resilient Systems, issued in May 2014, helps organizations to develop a more defensible and survivable information
technology infrastructure. This resource, coupled with other NIST standards and guidelines, contributes to systems that are
more resilient in the face of cyber attacks and other threats.
         Strong partnerships with diverse stakeholders are vital to the success of our technical programs. In February 2014,
NIST issued the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity as directed in Executive Order 13636. The
Framework, created through collaboration between industry and government, consists of standards, guidelines, and practices
to promote the protection of critical infrastructure. Its approach helps owners and operators of critical infrastructure to manage
cybersecurity-related risk. Collaborations continue as NIST works with stakeholders from across the country and around
the world. Working closely with standards developing organizations, industry and interagency partners, we are evolving
and expanding security automation capabilities to help organizations manage and measure the security of systems and
technologies.
         Active engagement with diverse stakeholders continues to be critical to our success. In the federal space, this
interaction is most prominent in our strengthened collaborations with the Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community,
and the Committee on National Security Systems to establish a common foundation for information security across the federal
government. Our cybersecurity awareness, training, and education programs also exemplify the importance of engagements
with academic institutions, federal agencies, small and medium businesses and others to increase awareness and enhance the
overall cybersecurity posture of the Nation.
         For many years, CSD, in collaboration with our global partners across industry, academia, and government, has made
great contributions to help secure the nation’s critical information and infrastructure. We look forward to strengthening these
relationships as we lead the development and practical application of scalable and sustainable information security standards
and practices.
