management, assessment, and response to emerging security issues. Information collected
through the ISCM program supports ongoing authorization decisions. 4

ISCM, a critical step in an organization’s Risk Management Framework (RMF), gives
organizational officials access to security-related information on demand, enabling timely risk
management decisions, including authorization decisions. Frequent updates to security plans,
security assessment reports, plans of action and milestones, hardware and software inventories,
and other system information are also supported. ISCM is most effective when automated
mechanisms are employed where possible for data collection and reporting. Effectiveness is
further enhanced when the output is formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable,
actionable, relevant, and timely. While this document encourages the use of automation, it is
recognized that many aspects of ISCM programs are not easily automated.

1.1    BACKGROUND
The concept of monitoring information system security has long been recognized as sound
management practice. In 1997, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130,
Appendix III 5 required agencies to review their information systems’ security controls and to
ensure that system changes do not have a significant impact on security, that security plans
remain effective, and that security controls continue to perform as intended.

The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 further emphasized the
importance of continuously monitoring information system security by requiring agencies to
conduct assessments of security controls at a frequency appropriate to risk, but no less than
annually.

Most recently, OMB issued memorandum M-11-33, FY 2011 Reporting Instructions for the
Federal Information Security Management Act and Agency Privacy Management.6 The
memorandum provides instructions for annual FISMA reporting and emphasizes monitoring the
security state of information systems on an ongoing basis with a frequency sufficient to make
ongoing, risk-based decisions.

Tools supporting automated monitoring of some aspects of information systems have become an
effective means for both data capture and data analysis. Ease of use, accessibility, and broad
applicability across products and across vendors help to ensure that monitoring tools can be
readily deployed in support of near real-time, risk-based decision making.
