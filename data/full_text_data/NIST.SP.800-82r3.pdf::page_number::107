NIST SP 800-82r3                                         Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

   Applying the Cybersecurity Framework to OT
Many public and private-sector organizations have adopted the NIST Cybersecurity Framework
(CSF) [CSF] to guide cybersecurity activities and consider cybersecurity risks. The Framework
consists of five concurrent and continuous Functions – Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and
Recover – for presenting industry standards, guidelines, and practices in a manner that allows for
the communication of cybersecurity activities and outcomes across the organization. When
considered together, these Functions provide a high-level, strategic view for cybersecurity risk
management. The Framework further identifies underlying key Categories and Subcategories for
each Function and matches them with example Informative References, such as existing
standards, guidelines, and practices for each Subcategory.
The five Functions include 23 Categories of cybersecurity outcomes and Subcategories that
further divide the Categories into more specific technical or management activities. For this
section, each subsection references a CSF Function and Category and includes the CSF two-
letter abbreviations for reference.
                                            The CSF Functions guide the following actions:
                                            Identify (ID) – Develop an organizational
                                            understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to
                                            systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities.
                                            Protect (PR) – Develop and implement appropriate
                                            safeguards to ensure delivery of critical services.
                                            Detect (DE) – Develop and implement appropriate
                                            activities to identify the occurrence of the
                                            cybersecurity event.
                                            Respond (RS) – Develop and implement
                                            appropriate activities to take action regarding a
                                            detected cybersecurity incident.
                                            Recover (RC) – Develop and implement
                                            appropriate activities to maintain plans for
                                            resilience and to restore any capabilities or services
                                            that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident.

This section discusses all CSF Functions and selected CSF Categories and Subcategories.
Additionally, some Categories include additional OT-specific considerations that are not
included in the CSF.

       Identify (ID)
The Identify Function provides foundational activities to effectively use the CSF. The intended
outcome of the Identify Function is to develop an organizational understanding to manage
cybersecurity risks to systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities.
