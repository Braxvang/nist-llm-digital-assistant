Appendix E: Revision Changes
This revision updates cryptographic requirements for the protocols and applications in the
document so that the required security strengths as specified in [SP 800-131A] can be
achieved. This revision also adds the security-related updates from the protocols
addressed in the document. In addition, this revision adds a new section for Secure Shell
(SSH). Specific changes in this revision include the following.

Section 2:
   1) Additional clarification about the recommended algorithms and key sizes for
      digital signature and key establishment certificates has been added.
   2) 1024-bit RSA and DSA are no longer approved for generating digital signatures
      after 2013.
   3) For CA/RA Software and Hardware (Section 2.3.1), support for LDAP is now
      recommended (using “should”), not required (using “shall”) as in the original
      version.
   4) For Relying Party Software (Section 2.3.5), supporting either OCSP or CRLs for
      certificate status is required. In the first version of this publication, supporting
      CRLs was required.
   5) Removed required support for ““anyExtendedKeyUsage” feature.

Section 3:
   1) Information about VPN-cipher suites has been updated to include the Suite-B
      VPN cipher suites.
   2) Table 3-2 and the cryptographic algorithms recommendation have been revised.

Section 4:
   1) A revision of the TLS section will be in SP 800-52 revision 1 [SP 800-52] in the
       future.

Section 5:
   1) The discussion of the cipher suites (ALSs) has been updated. New requirements
      in using these cipher suites have been added to meet the security requirements
      specified in [SP 800-131A].
   2) In Section 5.3, item 3. The “should” was changed to “may”.

Section 6:
   1) A requirement for 112 bits of security after the year 2013 has been stated for
       public key authentication and key establishment.

   2) Support for using TLS for authentication and key establishment has been added.
