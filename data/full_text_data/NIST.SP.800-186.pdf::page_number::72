NIST SP 800-186                                                  Discrete Logarithm-based Cryptography:
February 2023                                                          Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters

Appendix H. Other Allowed Elliptic Curves

H.1.   Brainpool Curves
This standard also allows the curves specified in Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Brainpool
Standard Curves and Curve Generation [RFC_5639] for ECDSA signatures as well as EC key
establishment, which support a security strength of 112 bits or higher. In particular, this includes
brainpoolP224r1, brainpoolP256r1, brainpoolP320r1, brainpoolP384r1, and brainpoolP512r1.
These curves were pseudorandomly generated and are allowed to be used for interoperability
reasons.

H.2.   The Curve secp256k1
This standard also allows the curve secp256k1 specified in SEC 2: Recommended Elliptic Curve
Domain Parameters [SEC_2], which supports a security strength of 128 bits. This curve is a
Koblitz curve with coefficients selected for efficiency reasons. The curve secp256k1 is allowed
to be used for blockchain-related applications.
