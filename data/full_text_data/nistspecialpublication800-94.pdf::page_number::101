                                                  GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



 Can multiple sensors be deployed to monitor the same activity so that if one fails, another
  automatically assumes its responsibilities? How disruptive is the failover process (e.g., loss of state
  tracking, loss of event counts for thresholds)?
 If a sensor fails, how easily can its configuration be transferred to another sensor (e.g., transferring a
  sensor CD and configuration floppy from the first sensor to the second sensor, then rebooting the
  second sensor)?
9.4.1.2 Interoperability

Organizations should ensure that the IDPS products they select will interoperate effectively with the
desired systems. These systems could include the following:

 Data input sources, such as other IDPS products, log files, and vulnerability scanning results
 Log analysis and management software, such as syslog and other logging servers, SIEM software,
  and network management software
 Systems to be reconfigured by prevention actions, such as firewalls and routers.
9.4.1.3 Scalability

When evaluating IDPS products, organizations should consider not only their current needs, but also
possible future needs, so that they choose products that are sufficiently scalable. Possible considerations
for scalability include the following:

 The number of sensors or agents, management servers, consoles, and other IDPS components that can
  be part of a single logical implementation
 The number of sensors or agents that a single management server can support
 The range of appliances available for appliance-based IDPS components (e.g., appliance devices with
  varying capacities), and the ability to expand appliances (e.g., add more memory, network interface
  cards [NIC], or storage devices)
 How multiple sensors or agents can share monitoring functions for a network or system, including
  how load balancing can be performed with or without the use of separate load balancing devices
 How many networks a network-based, wireless, or NBA sensor can monitor simultaneously; how
  many network interfaces a host-based agent can monitor simultaneously
 How the IDPSâ€™s storage capabilities can be expanded and enhanced (e.g., automated archival of older
  data, use of separate storage devices)
 What levels of activity (e.g., network traffic, system calls, log entries) each of the IDPS components
  can support
 How well the IDPS solution integrates the management and monitoring of multiple sensors or agents,
  management servers, and other components
 The cost of and resources needed for each scalability option.
