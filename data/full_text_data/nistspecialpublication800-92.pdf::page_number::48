GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



       The security needs for the log data. For example, if log data needs to be encrypted when
        transmitted between systems, this could require more processing by the systems, as well as
        increased usage of network bandwidth.
       The time and resources needed for staff to analyze the logs.
4.5     Summary

To establish and maintain successful log management infrastructures, an organization should perform
significant planning and other preparatory actions for performing log management. This is important for
creating consistent, reliable, and efficient log management practices that meet the organization’s needs
and requirements and also provide additional value for the organization.

As part of the log management planning process, an organization should define the roles and
responsibilities of individuals and teams who are expected to be involved in log management. System
and network administrators are usually responsible for configuring logging on their systems and network
devices, analyzing those logs periodically, reporting on the results of log management activities, and
performing regular maintenance of the logs and logging software. Security administrators are usually
responsible for managing and monitoring the log management infrastructure, configuring logging on
security devices, reporting on the results of log management activities, and assisting others with log
management. Many others within an organization may also have log management roles, such as incident
handlers, application developers, auditors, and management. Assignment of roles and responsibilities
should take into account the benefits of performing analysis at the system level and the infrastructure
level. System-level administrators need to receive adequate support from the organization, such as
training, mechanisms for disseminating information, technical guidance, and log management tools.

An organization should define its requirements and goals for performing logging and monitoring logs.
Based on that determination, the organization should then develop policies that clearly define mandatory
requirements and suggested recommendations for several aspects of log management, including log
generation, transmission, storage, disposal, and analysis. The organization should also ensure that other
policies, guidelines, and procedures that have some relationship to logging incorporate and support these
log management requirements and recommendations, and also comply with functional and operational
requirements. The organization’s policies and procedures should also address legal issues related to
logging, such as the preservation of original log files that may be needed as evidence. Organizations
should perform periodic reviews of their logging-related policies and update them as needed.

Creating requirements and recommendations for logging needs to be done in conjunction with an analysis
of the technology and resources needed to implement and maintain them, their security implications and
value, and the regulations and laws to which the organization is subject. Generally, organizations should
only require logging and analyzing the data that is of greatest importance, and also have non-mandatory
recommendations for which other types of data should be logged and analyzed if time and resources
permit. In some cases, organizations choose to have all or nearly all log data generated and stored for at
least a short period of time in case it is needed; this approach favors security over usability and resource
usage.

After establishing an initial policy and identifying roles and responsibilities, an organization should next
design one or more log management infrastructures that effectively support the policy and roles. When
designing the infrastructures, organizations should consider the current and future needs of both the
infrastructures and the individual log sources throughout the organization. Major factors to consider in
the design include the volume of log data to be processed, network bandwidth, online and offline data
storage, the security needs for the data, and the time and resources needed for staff to analyze the logs.
