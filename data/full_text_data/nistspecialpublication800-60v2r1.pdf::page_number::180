Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Some water and sea transportation
functions are time-critical (e.g., distress signals, docking operations, collision avoidance,
warnings of hazardous weather or sea conditions). Unauthorized modification or destruction of
time-critical information necessary to these functions can result in large-scale property loss and
in loss of human lives. Such information would have a high integrity impact level.
Communications management (e.g., frequency management) information also needs to be
included in water transportation integrity impact considerations. There may be circumstances
when errors in frequency assignment information can result in an inability for Federal
government agencies to communicate with state or local government activities. The subsequent
loss of communications capabilities can result in life-threatening situations. Such information
would have a high integrity impact level.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
water transportation information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to water transportation information.
Most water transportation processes are tolerant of reasonable delays. In most cases,
disruption of access to water transportation information can be expected to have only a
limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Some water and sea transportation
functions are time-critical (e.g., distress signals, docking operations, collision avoidance,
warnings of hazardous weather or sea conditions). Loss of availability of time-critical
information necessary to these functions can result in large-scale property loss and in loss of
human lives. Such information would have a high integrity impact level.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
water transportation information is low.

D.11.3 Air Transportation Information Type

Air Transportation involves the activities related to the safe passage of passengers or goods
through the air. It also includes command and control activities related to the safe movement of
aircraft through all phases of flight for commercial and military operations. Note: The protection
of air transportation from deliberate attack is included in the Transportation Security information
type under the Homeland Security mission area. The general recommended security
categorization for the air transportation information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of air transportation
information on the ability of responsible agencies to ensure the safe passage of passengers and
goods through the air. The protection of air transportation from deliberate attack is included in
