GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



before the conduct date for large, complex exercises and at least one month in advance for less complex
exercises. Sections 4.2.1 through 4.2.6 describe the major steps in the event design process.

4.2.1     Determine the Topics

The design team should determine the exercise topic based on the focus of the plan being exercised.
General topics can include contingency planning and incident response; specific topics range from
sustaining essential functions to managing and reporting IT security incidents. For example, disaster
recovery plan exercise discussion topics would likely include the roles and responsibilities of personnel
with regard to the processes and procedures associated with restoring an organization’s information
systems. Incident response plan exercise discussion topics would likely include processes and procedures
for managing and reporting IT security incidents.

4.2.2     Determine the Scope

The scope of the tabletop exercise should be determined based on the target audience. All personnel with
responsibilities under the IT plan should participate in exercises; however, senior-level teams and
operational-level teams should participate in separate tabletop exercises initially because of their different
levels of responsibility. Once these two groups have been exercised individually, both groups should
participate in a combined exercise to validate coordination between the groups.

The exercise should apply to the roles and responsibilities of personnel within the IT plan being exercised
and focus on validating that the documented roles, responsibilities, and interdependencies are accurate
and current. The types of questions asked of the participants during the course of the exercise should be
tailored to the level of personnel exercised. Senior-level tabletop exercises typically range from two to
four hours, while operational-level tabletop exercises range from two to eight hours. To ensure that the
knowledge of the roles and responsibilities identified in the plan being exercised is current, it is often
effective to conduct a training session in conjunction with any tabletop exercise lasting more than four
hours.

4.2.3     Identify the Objectives

The objectives of any tabletop exercise should be validating the content of the IT plan and related policies
and procedures, validating participants’ roles and responsibilities as documented in the plan, and
validating the interdependencies documented in the plan. An additional objective for some exercises is
meeting regulatory and other such requirements associated with exercising plans, such as the requirement
in NIST SP 800-53 for Federal agencies to conduct exercises or tests for their systems’ contingency plans
at least annually.

4.2.4     Identify the Participants

Based on the topic, scope, and objectives of the exercise, the design team determines who should
participate in the event. 13 The participants should be comprised of the personnel with roles and
responsibilities identified in the plan to help ensure the exercise meets its stated objectives. For example,
senior-level personnel should be invited to participate if the primary exercise objective is to validate the
decision-making and oversight processes within the plan. If the primary objective is to validate
operational procedures, operational-level personnel should be invited to the exercise. If both groups have
participated in previous tabletop exercises separately, it is appropriate to conduct a combined session,
where senior-level and operational-level personnel discuss individual and team roles and responsibilities
13
     Depending on the requirements that the exercise is intended to fulfill, it may be necessary to make participation mandatory
     for designated personnel.
