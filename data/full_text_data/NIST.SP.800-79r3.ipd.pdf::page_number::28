      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                                Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                                                       and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

842   During the authorization decision process, the DAO evaluates the assessment findings for the
843   issuer and each issuing facility within the authorization boundary. If the issuer has outsourced
844   some of its services or functions, the DAO SHALL review all relevant assessments and
845   authorizations that have been granted to the external service provider and include them as part of
846   the overall evaluation of risk to the organization.
847   An authorization decision by a DAO SHALL always be granted for a specific issuer before the
848   commencement of operations, and there can only be one authorization decision for each issuer.
849   In issuing this decision, the DAO SHALL indicate the authorization boundary to which the
850   authorization applies. A DAO grants an authorization to an issuer and then specifies which
851   facilities (along with any exceptions or restrictions) are permitted to operate under that
852   authorization. This allows the issuer and any of its authorized issuing facilities to begin
853   operations while remaining facilities focus on addressing the deficiencies identified during the
854   assessment. At a later date, these facilities can be reassessed. After reviewing the new findings,
855   the DAO can reissue the authorization for the issuer and expand the authorization boundary by
856   including the newly assessed facilities.
857   The major input to the authorization decision is the assessment report. To ensure that the
858   assessment report is properly interpreted and the justification for the authorization decision
859   properly communicated, the DAO SHOULD meet with the assessor, the EIMO, and the issuing
860   facility managers prior to issuing an authorization decision to discuss the assessment findings
861   and the terms and conditions of the authorization.
862   There are three authorization alternatives that can be rendered by the DAO:
863           1. Authorization to operate,
864           2. Interim authorization to operate, or
865           3. Denial of authorization to operate.

866   2.10.1.                 Authorization to Operate (ATO)
867   An authorization to operate (ATO) may be issued 6 if — after reviewing the results of the
868   assessment phase — the DAO deems that the operations of the issuer and its facilities conform to
869   the control objectives of [FIPS201] to an acceptable degree and will continue to do so reliably
870   during the authorization validity period. The issuer and its issuing facilities are authorized to
871   perform services in compliance with all relevant policies, in conformance with all relevant
872   standards, and in accordance with the documented operations plan. The DAO SHALL indicate
873   exactly which issuing facilities are included in the ATO authorization decision. An ATO can
874   only be granted to an issuer if there are no limitations or restrictions imposed on any of its
875   issuing facilities that are included in the authorization boundary. The ATO is transmitted to the
876   EIMO.
877   After receiving an ATO that conforms to SP 800-79, reauthorization SHALL be performed (i)
878   within three years; (ii) when there is a significant change in personnel or operating procedures,
879   including the improvement or degradation of operations; or (iii) when additional issuing facilities
880   are being added to the issuer. There may also be cases in which one or more issuing facilities
881   cease operation. If this situation results in a PIV Card or derived PIV credential issuance-related
      6
          The issuer ATO can be affected by the underlying system authorization status (see Sec. 2.10.4).
