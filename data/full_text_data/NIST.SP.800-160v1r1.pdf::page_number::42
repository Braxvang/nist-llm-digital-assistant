                      Fig. 8. Relationship among Asset, Loss, and Consequence

To summarize, the following considerations impact the identification of protection needs:
•   Assets have different classes and types.
•   Assets are associated with stakeholders and the system.
    -   Some assets are associated with stakeholders (i.e., stakeholder assets) and have a purpose,
        use, and existence that is independent of the system being designed.
    -   Some assets are associated with the system, are dependent on characteristics of the
        system design and behavior, and are typically unknown to stakeholders.
•   Loss interpretation is dual-faceted.
    -   The effect on the asset of interest
    -   The effect on those who value the asset of interest
•   Loss interpretation is temporal and state-based.
    -   Spans a continuum within and across asset types and classes
    -   May change across the life cycle of the asset and the state in which the asset exists or is
        utilized
•   Asset-based judgments are subjective.
