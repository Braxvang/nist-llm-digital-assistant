                                                                  COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE



 Maintain a statement of the current status of the incident so that communications with the media are
  consistent and up-to-date.
 Remind all staff of the general procedures for handling media inquiries.
 Hold mock interviews and press conferences during incident handling exercises. The following are
  examples of questions to ask the media contact:

    – Who attacked you? Why?
    – When did it happen? How did it happen? Did this happen because you have poor security
        practices?

    – How widespread is this incident? What steps are you taking to determine what happened and to
        prevent future occurrences?

    – What is the impact of this incident? Was any personally identifiable information (PII) exposed?
        What is the estimated cost of this incident?
2.3.4.2 Law Enforcement

One reason that many security-related incidents do not result in convictions is that some organizations do
not properly contact law enforcement. Several levels of law enforcement are available to investigate
incidents: for example, within the United States, Federal investigatory agencies (e.g., the Federal Bureau
of Investigation [FBI] and the U.S. Secret Service), district attorney offices, state law enforcement, and
local (e.g., county) law enforcement. Law enforcement agencies in other countries may also be involved,
such as for attacks launched from or directed at locations outside the US. In addition, agencies have an
Office of Inspector General (OIG) for investigation of violation of the law within each agency. The
incident response team should become acquainted with its various law enforcement representatives before
an incident occurs to discuss conditions under which incidents should be reported to them, how the
reporting should be performed, what evidence should be collected, and how it should be collected.

Law enforcement should be contacted through designated individuals in a manner consistent with the
requirements of the law and the organization’s procedures. Many organizations prefer to appoint one
incident response team member as the primary POC with law enforcement. This person should be familiar
with the reporting procedures for all relevant law enforcement agencies and well prepared to recommend
which agency, if any, should be contacted. Note that the organization typically should not contact
multiple agencies because doing so might result in jurisdictional conflicts. The incident response team
should understand what the potential jurisdictional issues are (e.g., physical location—an organization
based in one state has a server located in a second state attacked from a system in a third state, being used
remotely by an attacker in a fourth state).

2.3.4.3 Incident Reporting Organizations

FISMA requires Federal agencies to report incidents to the United States Computer Emergency Readiness
Team (US-CERT),8 which is a governmentwide incident response organization that assists Federal
civilian agencies in their incident handling efforts. US-CERT does not replace existing agency response
teams; rather, it augments the efforts of Federal civilian agencies by serving as a focal point for dealing
with incidents. US-CERT analyzes the agency-provided information to identify trends and indicators of
attacks; these are easier to discern when reviewing data from many organizations than when reviewing
the data of a single organization.
