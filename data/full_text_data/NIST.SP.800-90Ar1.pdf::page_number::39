NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                                    Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                           Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


    2) prediction_resistance_request: Indicates whether or not prediction resistance is to be
       provided during the request (i.e., whether or not fresh entropy bits are required)5. Without
       the explicit prediction resistance request, the entropy input could be provided from either
       a DRBG with no access to an entropy source (i.e., fresh entropy would not be provided),
       or the entropy input could be provided by an entropy source or by an RBG with access to
       an entropy source (i.e., fresh entropy would be provided in these cases).
        DRBGs that are implemented to always support prediction resistance or to never support
        prediction resistance do not require this parameter. However, when prediction resistance
        is not supported, the user of a consuming application must determine whether or not
        prediction resistance may be required by the application before electing to use such a
        DRBG implementation.
        If prediction resistance is not supported, then the prediction_resistance_request input
        parameter and step 2 of the reseed process is omitted, and reseed process step 4 is
        modified to omit the prediction_resistance_request parameter.
        If prediction resistance is always performed, then the prediction_resistance_request input
        parameter and reseed process step 2 may be omitted, and reseed process step 4 is replaced
        by:
            (status, entropy_input) = Get_entropy_input (security_strength, min_length,
            max_length)
    3) additional_input: An optional input. The maximum length of the additional_input
        (max_additional_input_length) is implementation dependent, but shall be less than or
        equal to the maximum value specified for the given DRBG mechanism (see Section 10).
        If the input by a consuming application of additional_input is not supported, then the
        input parameter and step 2 of the reseed process are omitted, and step 5 of the reseed
        process is modified to remove the additional_input from the parameter list.
Required information not provided by the consuming application during reseeding (This
information shall not be provided by the consuming application as an input parameter during the
reseed request):
    1. entropy_input: Input bits containing entropy. This input shall not be provided by the
       DRBG instantiation being reseeded. The maximum length of the entropy_input is
       implementation dependent, but shall be less than or equal to the specified maximum
       length for the selected DRBG mechanism (see Section 10).
  2. Internal state values required by the DRBG for the working_state and administrative
      information, as appropriate.
Output to a consuming application after reseeding:
  1. status: The status returned from the function.



5 A DRBG may be reseeded by an entropy source or an NRBG, both of which provide fresh entropy. A DRBG
could also be reseeded by a DRBG that has access to an entropy source or NRBG. The request for prediction
resistance during reseeding rules out the use of a DRBG that does not have access to either an entropy source or
NRBG. See [SP 800-90C] for further discussion.
