    FOCUS AREA 2



      •   NIST has driven change and standardization through leadership positions in many
          key organizations. The NIST staff fills leadership positions in key organizations,
          including membership in the Privacy Engineering Advisory Board for the
          International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP), co-chairmanship of
          the Interagency Working Group (IWG) for Privacy at the U.S. Networking and
          Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD), and working group
          chairmanship at ISO Technical Committee ISO/PC 317, Consumer protection:
          privacy by design for consumer goods and services. Through these and many
          other programs, NIST provides leadership and direction and helps drive application
          standards for important risk management focus areas.
      •   NIST has fostered leadership and partnership through the Privacy Collaboration
          Space—an online venue open to the public where practitioners can discover,
          share, discuss, and improve upon open-source tools, solutions, and processes that
          support privacy engineering and risk management. Following the NIST tradition of
          open and transparent partnerships, the collaboration space was launched with an
          initial focus on:
          •   De-identification: a technique or process applied to a dataset with the goal of
              preventing or limiting certain types of privacy risks to individuals, protected
              groups, and establishments while still allowing for the production of aggregate
              statistics. This focus area includes a broad scope of de-identification to allow for
              noise-introducing techniques, such as differential privacy, data masking, and the
              creation of synthetic datasets that are based on privacy-preserving models.
          •   Privacy Risk Assessment: a process that helps organizations to analyze and
              assess privacy risks for individuals that arise from the processing of their data.
              This focus area includes risk models, risk assessment methodologies, and
              approaches to determining privacy risk factors. Through the new space, which
              is enabled by the Github repository, the community can contribute to privacy
              engineering in the form of tools, use cases, and feedback on existing entries.


    Advancing the Application of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework
    Having published the updated Cybersecurity Framework Version 1.1 in FY 2018,
    NIST continued to work with the risk management community to support outreach,
    application, and implementation. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework website has
    expanded to provide learning materials, success stories, and industry resources. Among
    those resources is NISTIR 8183, Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile [7]. Co-
    developed with NIST’s Engineering Laboratory (EL), this report applies the Cybersecurity
    Framework components to help describe specific cybersecurity activities and outcomes
    for the protection of the manufacturing system and its components, facility, and
    environment.
    Another advancement in the application of the Cybersecurity Framework is the
8   implementation of an online catalog of informative references. In FY 2019, NIST launched
