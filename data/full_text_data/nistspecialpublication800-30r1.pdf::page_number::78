  Values               Values

                                      The vulnerability is exposed and exploitable, and its exploitation could result in severe impacts.
   Very High      96-100       10     Relevant security control or other remediation is not implemented and not planned; or no security
                                      measure can be identified to remediate the vulnerability.
                                      The vulnerability is of high concern, based on the exposure of the vulnerability and ease of
                                      exploitation and/or on the severity of impacts that could result from its exploitation.
      High         80-95       8
                                      Relevant security control or other remediation is planned but not implemented; compensating
                                      controls are in place and at least minimally effective.
                                      The vulnerability is of moderate concern, based on the exposure of the vulnerability and ease of
   Moderate        21-79       5      exploitation and/or on the severity of impacts that could result from its exploitation.
                                      Relevant security control or other remediation is partially implemented and somewhat effective.
                                      The vulnerability is of minor concern, but effectiveness of remediation could be improved.
      Low          5-20        2
                                      Relevant security control or other remediation is fully implemented and somewhat effective.
                                      The vulnerability is not of concern.
   Very Low         0-4        0
                                      Relevant security control or other remediation is fully implemented, assessed, and effective.
