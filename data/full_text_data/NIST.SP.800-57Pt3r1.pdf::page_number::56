8 Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)
8.1 Description
The Domain Name System (DNS), as defined in [RFC 1034] and [RFC 1035], is the
global hierarchical distributed database system for mapping Internet addresses, Simple
Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) servers, and other information to a human-readable
name. Its main purpose is handling mappings between host domain names and Internet
addresses, but it can handle other forms of data as well, such as host system information,
the geographic location of servers, even encoded digital certificates. DNS data is stored
as individual Resource Records (RRs) each associates a piece of data (e.g., IP address,
mail server name) with a domain name and an identifying Resource Record type code
(RR type). All the RRs for a particular organization are stored in an administrative unit
called a zone. Multiple zones form a domain. A domain is hierarchical, in that one zone
may act as a delegating parent to one or more child-delegated zones. For example, most
federal agencies are child delegations under the “.gov” parent zone.
Zone information is maintained on authoritative servers, which are distributed all over
the Internet to answer queries according to the DNS network protocols. The DNS
infrastructure is comprised of a small group (or single server) known as a primary master
authoritative server that has a local zone database, and multiple secondary servers that
obtain their copies of the zone database from the primary authoritative master server.
Another set of components are caching recursive servers36, which query the authoritative
servers and cache any replies. On the end user’s client system, software components
known as resolvers make DNS queries to recursive caches and/or authoritative servers.
Figure 8-1 depicts the relationship between the DNS components.

  Caching Recursive Server is sometimes shortened to “caching server” or “recursive server.” However,
the role remains the same.
