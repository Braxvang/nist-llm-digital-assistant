6. Ensure that KMFs include backup and archive capabilities to support reconstitution of
   the KMF in the event of a disaster (e.g., fire, earthquake).


7.4 Recommendations for System Installers
The system installer is the individual(s) that installs an OTAR capability and performs
the initial configuration of the system components.

1. The KMF shall use and have strong physical and logical access control mechanisms
   to protect the cryptographic keys (e.g., physical locks, alarms or password token).

2. Backup KMFs shall be provided.

3. A TEK should not be used for multiple purposes. Reserved MAC keys should be
   used for message authentication and integrity protection.

4. Maximum cryptoperiods for each key type shall be determined at the KMF in
   accordance with the organization’s security policy and Section 7.2.2.

5. Radios shall be accounted for; in the case of a lost or stolen radio, an assessment of
   the effect of a loss of the keys contained in that radio shall be made. The use of any
   key contained in that radio shall be discontinued. Procedures shall be in place for
   replacing these keys if used by the KMF or by other radios.

6. Implementations shall be configured to use the AES or TDEA algorithms, and to
   disallow the use of DES.

7. If TDEA is provided and is to be used, the three-key version shall be used, and the
   one-key version shall not be used.

8. For implementations using TDEA in which the cryptoperiod of a key bundle is
   configurable, the cryptoperiod shall be set to a value less than 1 000 000 messages.


7.5 Recommendations for System Administrators
The System Administrator is the individual who manages the OTAR system or its
components on a day-to-day basis and interacts with the end users.

   1. System administrators shall ensure that the organization’s security policy is
      enforced.

   2. System administrators shall protect the keying material from disclosure and
      modification.

   3. Procedures shall be in place for replacing keys at the end of their cryptoperiod.
