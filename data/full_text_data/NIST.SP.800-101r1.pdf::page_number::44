extraction (i.e., Manual or Logical) on-scene followed immediately by a preliminary analysis
of the data extracted. Logical extraction tools are providing additional capabilities to use
keywords and specific known hashes alerting the on-scene examiner immediately to potential
issues that need to be addressed. Where possible, devices supporting encryption, such as
Android and iOS devices, should be triage processed at the scene if they are found in an
unlocked state, as the data may no longer be available to an investigator once the device’s
screen is locked, or if the battery exhausts. Deploying the use of field forensics tools to either
acquire the device, or establish a trusted relationship with the device, will ensure that the data
can be accessed at a later time, after the device has locked. [Zdz12].

On-Site Triage is especially useful in identifying:

       Media most likely to contain evidence

       Those investigations that require a more detailed and technical examination

       The investigations that could be subject of limited examination by qualified
        practitioners

       Material requiring urgent investigation

       Examinations suitable for outsourcing

       The extent of the assistance the unit will need to provide to an investigation [ACP11]

On-Site Triage processing benefits include:

       Reduced laboratory workload - Digital forensic laboratory submissions may be
        reduced when nothing of interest is found on-scene and the level of suspicion is low

       Exigency - On-scene examiners have actionable results immediately

       Better leveraging of existing resources - Intelligence resources are enhanced through
        the use of keywords/hash lists

       Reduced training costs - Triage tools are typically designed to require less training
        than deeper analysis tools and techniques

       Reduced unit cost – Triage tools are frequently more affordable than deeper analysis
        capable counterparts

       Live collection opportunity – Devices are often presented in an unlocked state
        affording the on-site examiner the potential to extract more data before the locking
        mechanism is activated

Organizations may wish to develop some sort of “scoring” method to aid with the
prioritization of on-site triage examinations. This should be developed on a per-organization
basis and should be reviewed and updated to accommodate changes.
