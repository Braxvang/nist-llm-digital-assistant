1915   8.   Threats and Security Considerations
1916   This section is informative.

1917   8.1. Authenticator Threats
1918   An attacker who can gain control of an authenticator will often be able to masquerade as
1919   the authenticator’s owner. Threats to authenticators can be categorized based on attacks
1920   on the types of authentication factors that comprise the authenticator:
1921        • Something you know may be disclosed to an attacker. The attacker might guess
1922          a memorized secret. Where the authenticator is a shared secret, the attacker
1923          could gain access to the CSP or verifier and obtain the secret value or perform a
1924          dictionary attack on a hash of that value. An attacker may observe the entry of
1925          a PIN or passcode, find a written record or journal entry of a PIN or passcode,
1926          or may install malicious software (e.g., a keyboard logger) to capture the secret.
1927          Additionally, an attacker may determine the secret through offline attacks on a
1928          password database maintained by the verifier.
1929        • Something you have may be lost, damaged, stolen from the owner, or cloned by an
1930          attacker. For example, an attacker who gains access to the owner’s computer might
1931          copy a software authenticator. A hardware authenticator might be stolen, tampered
1932          with, or duplicated. Out-of-band secrets may be intercepted by an attacker and used
1933          to authenticate their own session.
1934        • Something you are may be replicated. For example, an attacker may obtain a copy
1935          of the subscriber’s fingerprint and construct a replica.
1936   This document assumes that the subscriber is not colluding with an attacker who is
1937   attempting to falsely authenticate to the verifier. With this assumption in mind, the threats
1938   to the authenticators used for digital authentication are listed in Table 3, along with some
1939   examples.
