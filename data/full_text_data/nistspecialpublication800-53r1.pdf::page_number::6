                         FEDERAL INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT ACT
                                IMPLEMENTING SECURITY STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES
  FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems, is a
  mandatory, non-waiverable standard developed in response to the Federal Information Security
  Management Act of 2002. To comply with the federal standard, agencies must first determine the
  security category of their information system in accordance with the provisions of FIPS 199, Standards
  for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems, and then apply the
  appropriate set of baseline security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53, Recommended
  Security Controls for Federal Information Systems. Agencies have flexibility in applying the baseline
  security controls in accordance with the tailoring guidance provided in Special Publication 800-53.
  This allows agencies to adjust the security controls to more closely fit their mission requirements and
  operational environments.
  The combination of FIPS 200 and NIST Special Publication 800-53 requires a foundational level of
  security for all federal information and information systems (other than national security information
  and information systems). The agency's risk assessment validates the security control set by
  determining if any additional controls are needed to protect agency operations (including mission,
  functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, or individuals. The resulting set of security controls
  establishes a level of “security due diligence” for federal agencies and their contractors.
  In addition to the security requirements established by FISMA, there may also be specific security
  requirements in different business areas within agencies that are governed by other laws, Executive
  Orders, directives, policies, regulations, or associated governing documents, (e.g., the Health Insurance
  Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of
  1996, or OMB Circular A-127 on Financial Management Systems). These requirements may not be
  equivalent to the security requirements and implementing security controls required by FISMA or may
  enhance or further refine the security requirements and security controls. It is important that agency
  officials (including authorizing officials, chief information officers, senior agency information security
  officers, information system owners, information system security officers, and acquisition authorities)
  take steps to help ensure that: (i) all appropriate security requirements are addressed in agency
  acquisitions of information systems and information system services; and (ii) all necessary security
  controls are implemented in agency information systems when determining the tailored and
  supplemented control baselines described in this publication.
