     set of updates. After login, a user’s session is established in a virtual storage space so that all data
     stored during the session can be erased afterward. Desktop search tools are automatically disabled at
     login.
 Business partners do not need to run any firewall or antivirus software, and access is based on the
  client host’s IP address and the current time of day. Although users’ sessions are not put into the
  virtual storage space, all browser-related data is erased after the user logs out. Downloaded files or
  attachments are not erased. Desktop search tools are automatically disabled at login.
If an organization has an endpoint security policy, it should deploy SSL VPN devices that can support
those policies. This is especially important because endpoint security controls vary widely by device and
vendor. As with authentication, each organization should conduct testing during its evaluation process to
determine the endpoint security capabilities of each device being considered.

4.3.3    Select the Authentication Methods

After the organization determines how resources are to be accessed and how access control and endpoint
security are to be enforced, the next step is to decide on an authentication scheme for clients. The
organization should choose a scheme consistent with its security policy. For example, if two-factor
authentication is already required in the enterprise, then it should also be used for SSL VPN client
authentication 15 . The flexible nature of SSL VPNs, however, may require further elaboration in policy.
Authentication based on digital certificates requires each host to have a certificate installed, so the
organization will have to decide what type of access to permit from hosts that do not have certificates,
such as hosts owned by employees or public computers. An organization might not want to allow its
certificates to be installed or used on hosts that are not managed by the organization. In the case of public
computers, even certificates that are stored on an external device may not work, since many public
computers have their USB ports blocked to prevent the unauthorized installation of malware.

Existing external authentication infrastructures should also be leveraged if feasible. Many SSL VPN
products support LDAP, RADIUS, and Active Directory, so they can be configured to access
authentication servers using any of these options. The authentication server can provide group
information for authenticated users, such as whether a user belongs to the Sales or Executives group, so
the SSL VPN device can enforce the organization’s access control policy.

SSL VPN authentication methods may be applied on an individual or group basis. This feature enables
an organization to choose one form of authentication for one group, such as the Employees group, and
another form of authentication for another group, such as the Executives group. The organization may
also choose to base the authentication method on the specific resources, with some resources requiring
stronger authentication than others.

Table 4-2 illustrates sample authentication methods for the resources defined in the previous example.
Because access to the executive file share, sales database, and network infrastructure is considered to be
especially sensitive, it requires two-factor authentication where the user must also use a physical token to
be authenticated to the resource.

     For government agencies, OMB M-07-16 requires two-factor authentication for all remote access. It can be found at
