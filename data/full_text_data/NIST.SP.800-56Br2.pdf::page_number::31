                                                                                               the other entity. Then, using the intended receiverâ€™s public key, the sender encrypts that material
                                                                                               directly (see Section 9.2.3). The resulting ciphertext is transported to the receiver.
                                                                                               Prior to participating in a key-transport transaction, the receiver is required to have assurance of
                                                                                               the validity of its own key pair. This assurance may be renewed whenever desired. Upon (or

                                                                                               pair. Using its private key, the receiver takes the necessary steps (as specified in Section 9.2.3) to
                                                                                               decrypt the ciphertext and obtain the transported plaintext keying material.
