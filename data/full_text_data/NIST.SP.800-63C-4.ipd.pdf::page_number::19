446   Presentation
447      The assertion can be presented to the RP either on its own (as a bearer assertion) or in
448      concert with a bound authenticator presented by the subscriber.
449   Table 1 provides a non-normative summary of aspects for each FAL. Each successive
450   level subsumes and fulfills all requirements of lower levels (e.g., a federation process at
451   FAL3 can be accepted at FAL2 or FAL1 since FAL3 satisfies all the requirements of these
452   lower levels). Combinations not found in the Table 1 are possible but outside the scope of
453   this volume.

454   At all FALs, all assertions SHALL be used with a federation protocol as described in
455   Sec. 5. All assertions SHALL comply with the detailed requirements in Sec. 6. All
456   assertions SHALL be presented using one of the methods described in Sec. 7. Examples
457   of assertions used in federated protocols include the ID Token in OpenID Connect
458   [OIDC] and assertions written in the Security Assertion Markup Language [SAML].
459   At all FALs, the IdP SHALL employ appropriately tailored security controls (to include
460   control enhancements) from the moderate or high baseline of security controls defined in
461   [SP800-53] or equivalent federal (e.g., [FEDRAMP]) or industry standard.

462   4.1. Federation Assurance Level 1 (FAL1)
463   At FAL1, the assertion being generated by the IdP SHALL meet a core set of
464   requirements defined in Sec. 6, including protection against modification or construction
465   by an attacker by having the assertion contents signed by the IdP using approved
466   cryptography. An RP SHALL verify the origin and integrity of the assertion upon receipt,
467   as discussed in Sec. 6, ensuring that the assertion has originated from the expected source.
468   All assertions at FAL1 SHALL be audience-restricted to a specific RP or set of RPs, and
469   the RP SHALL validate that it is one of the targeted RPs for the given assertion. The
470   IdP SHALL ensure that any party holding the assertion, including the RP, is unable to
471   impersonate the IdP at a non-targeted RP by protecting the assertion with a signature
472   and key using approved cryptography. If the assertion is protected by a digital signature
