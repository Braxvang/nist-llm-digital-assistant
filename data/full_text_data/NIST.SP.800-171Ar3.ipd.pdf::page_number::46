1368             A.03.04.10.b[02]: the system component inventory is updated periodically.
1369             A.03.04.10.c[01]: the system component inventory is updated as part of component
1370             installations.
1371             A.03.04.10.c[02]: the system component inventory is updated as part of component removals.
1372             A.03.04.10.c[03]: the system component inventory is updated as part of system updates.
