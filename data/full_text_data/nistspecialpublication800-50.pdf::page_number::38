                                                                                 NIST Special Publication 800-50




                                Figure 4-1: Sample IT Security Training Matrix



Within each matrix, there are a number of cells that are used to build the course material. There are a
total of 46 cells, but only specific cells are used for each course. Some course matrices have as few as 2
cells, and the course matrix for an IT security officer/manager uses all 46 cells. Most matrices use 7 to 10
cells.

The matrix is organized by six role categories – or functional specialties – relative to three fundamental
training content categories – or training areas (i.e., laws and regulations, security program, and system life
cycle security). The six role categories or functional specialties are:

   Manage – This category is for individuals who manage IT-based functions in an organization.
   Acquire – This category is for those individuals who are involved in the acquisition of IT products
    and/or services (e.g., serve on a source selection board to evaluate vendor proposals for IT systems).
    This is especially important for those who serve as a contracting officer’s technical representative
    (COTR).
   Design and Develop – This category is for those individuals who design and develop systems and
    applications.
   Operate – This category is for those individuals who operate (administer) IT systems (e.g., web
    servers, e-mail servers, file servers, LANs, WANs, mainframes).
   Review and Evaluate – This category is for individuals who review and evaluate (audit) IT functions
    as part of an organization’s internal controls program, internal review, or an external audit program
    (e.g., inspector general).
