NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                                                   GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


 Appendix B—Interpreting Cipher Suite Names

TLS cipher suite names consist of a set of mnemonics separated by underscores (i.e., “_”). The
naming convention in TLS 1.3 differs from the convention shared in TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2.
Section B.1 provides guidance for interpreting the names of cipher suites that are recommended
in these guidelines for TLS versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. Section B.2 provides guidance for
interpreting the names of cipher suites for TLS 1.3. In all TLS cipher suites, the first mnemonic
is the protocol name (i.e., “TLS”).

B.1          Interpreting Cipher Suites Names in TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2

As shown in Section 3.3.1, these cipher suites have the following form:

                  TLS_KeyExchangeAlg_WITH_EncryptionAlg_MessageAuthenticationAlg

KeyExchangeAlg consists of one or two mnemonics.

      •   If there is only one mnemonic, it must be PSK based on the recommendations in these
          guidelines. The single mnemonic PSK indicates that the premaster secret is established
          using only symmetric algorithms with pre-shared keys as described in RFC 4279 [30].
          Pre-shared key cipher suites that are approved for use with TLS 1.2 are listed in
          Appendix C.
      •   If there are two mnemonics following the protocol name, the first key exchange
          mnemonic should be DH, ECDH, DHE, or ECDHE.
               o When the first key exchange mnemonic is DH or ECDH, it indicates that the
                 server’s public key in its certificate is for either DH or ECDH key exchange, and
                 the second mnemonic indicates the signature algorithm that was used by the
                 issuing CA to sign the server certificate.
               o When the first key exchange mnemonic is DHE or ECDHE, it indicates that
                 ephemeral DH or ECDH will be used for key exchange with the second
                 mnemonic indicating the server signature public key type that will be used to
                 authenticate the server’s ephemeral public key. 35

EncryptionAlg indicates the symmetric encryption algorithm and associated mode of operations.

MessageAuthenticationAlg is generally the hashing algorithm to be used for HMAC, if
applicable. 36 In cases where HMAC is not applicable (e.g., AES-GCM) or the cipher suite was
defined after the release of the TLS 1.2 RFC, this mnemonic represents the hashing algorithm
used with the PRF.




35 In this case, the signature algorithm used by the CA to sign the certificate is not articulated in the cipher suite.


36 HMAC is not applicable when the symmetric encryption mode of operation is authenticated encryption. Note that the CCM

      mode cipher suites do not specify the last mnemonic and require that SHA-256 be used for the PRF.
