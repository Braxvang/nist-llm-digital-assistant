                                                                                        Guidelines on PDA Forensics


       Pocket PC devices can have significantly different bootloader9 functionality. The device
       manufacturer determines the range of functionality with two exceptions – the bootloader must
       be able to load the OS and to upgrade it to a more recent version. Some early versions of
       Pocket PC devices provided documentation on specific key chord sequences (e.g.,
       simultaneously pressing buttons 2 and 4, the power button, and the reset button on iPaq 38xx
       models) that would boot into a specific mode known as “Parrot mode.” The device must be
       connected via the serial connector and a terminal emulator is used to establish communications
       with the bootloader and issue commands. Parrot mode has a rich command set that includes
       the ability to set register values, display memory contents, set memory contents, display the
       virtual address mapping table, backup memory to storage cards (CF/SD), and restore memory
       from storage.

2.4   Linux

       Linux, a popular open source operating system for servers and desktop computers, has also
       appeared on several PDA devices [Fae03]. Linux is a true multitasking, 32-bit operating
       system that supports multithreading. Besides commercial distributions that come preinstalled
       by PDA manufacturers, Linux distributions are also available for a range of Pocket PC and
       Palm OS devices. The success of Linux-based PDAs rests on the open source model and its
       ability to engage the software development community to produce useful applications.

       The most common Linux PDA in the U.S. is the Sharp Zaurus. The first Zaurus model, the
       SL-5500, was introduced in 2002. It uses Embedix10, an embedded Linux kernel from Lineo,
       and Qtopia desktop environment from Trolltech for the windowing and presentation
       technology. Embedix is based on a networked kernel with built-in support for WiFi,
       Bluetooth, and wireless modem technologies, as well as associated security and encryption
       modules. The device has a StrongARM processor, 16 MB of ROM, 64MB of RAM, and a
       3.5-inch 240x320-pixel color LCD. As with Palm OS and Pocket PC devices, the Zaurus’
       power source is a lithium-ion battery. Both Compact Flash (CF) and SD slots are present (the
       SD slot also accepts MMC). A small QWERTY-style keyboard is integrated into the device
       and becomes visible by sliding down the thumb pad and application button panel.

       Embedix Linux refers to a commercial distribution. While most Linux distributions include
       the same utilities, libraries, drivers, and windowing frameworks, differences occur in what
       patches, modules, and utilities are included, and how the installation, configuration, and
       upgrade are performed. A minimal embedded Linux system11 requires three crucial elements:
       a boot utility, the Linux micro-kernel, and an initialization process. User applications based
       upon personal use can be added for self-customization of the device.

       Linux distributions are also available for HP’s iPAQ, Dell’s Axim, and other PDAs but require
       the user to install over the existing OS. For example, iPAQ devices come preinstalled with
       Microsoft's Windows for Pocket PC. Linux can replace the Microsoft OS in the unit's flash
       ROM [Fae01, Hal01, Zwi02]. A popular Linux distribution for the iPAQ is the Familiar

           The bootloader is responsible for loading the run-time image into memory and jumping to the OS startup routine.
