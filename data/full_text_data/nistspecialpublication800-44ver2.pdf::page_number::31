                                                                                 GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



In many instances, most or all of the above-mentioned functionality is combined in a single device, which
is frequently referred to as a reverse proxy. 15

In organizations requiring complicated dynamic Web sites, the security appliance configuration may be
complex, which could cause configuration errors that reduce the effectiveness of the appliance. It is
important to practice defense-in-depth to ensure that any vulnerabilities present in the security appliance
or its configuration do not adversely affect the organization as a whole.

An additional challenge presented by appliance devices is that they often employ commonly used open-
source software. This is normally not a problem, but it can become one when a vulnerability is found in
the underlying software because it is frequently not possible to use the patch released by the open-source
software group. Common reasons for this inability to use the patch include possible violations of the
licensing or support agreements with the appliance manufacturer, and technical problems in applying
updates to the appliance (e.g., administrators often do not have OS-level access to appliances). Therefore,
appliances can be open to attack for a longer period of time than non-appliance systems because of the
additional delay involved in appliance manufacturers developing, testing, and releasing patches. Another
possible problem with appliances is that they usually do not allow the installation of additional software
for administration or for security, such as antivirus software or host-based intrusion detection agents.

The following are some issues to consider when contemplating the purchase of a Web appliance:

 What is the underlying OS and how has it fared in security testing?

 How has the appliance itself fared in security testing? (Note that the configuration options of Web
  appliances are necessarily limited, so a Web appliance will generally only be as secure as its default
  installation configuration.)

 How heterogeneous is the organization’s Web server infrastructure? (Different brands of appliances
  may not work well together.)

 Are the expansion options inherent in the appliance acceptable to the organization? (Organizations
  that are anticipating or experiencing rapid growth in Web traffic may not want to limit themselves to
  a single appliance or appliance vendor.)

 How difficult is it to configure the appliance? Is the appliance flexible enough to meet the
  organization’s needs?

 How quickly does the manufacturer respond to and provide patches for potential vulnerabilities?

 Is the underlying software used on the appliance proprietary, open source, or a combination of both?

 How long will the manufacturer support the appliance and what is the manufacturer’s history of
  support for legacy appliances?

3.6.3     Pre-Hardened Operating Systems and Web Servers

A growing number of pre-hardened OS and Web server packages are being distributed today. These
packages include an OS and Web server application that are modified and pre-configured to provide high
security. Some of these packages include the hardware platform, while others are software distributions

     This is not meant to imply that all reverse proxies are appliance-based; in fact, many are not.
