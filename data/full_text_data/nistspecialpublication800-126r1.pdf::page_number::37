               The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



example is to collect software inventory data on devices that are not directly connected to the enterprise
network, such as smart phones.

The SCAP source data stream components that MUST be included for inventory scanning are:

 XCCDF Benchmark: references the CPE Inventory and captures the results of the inventory. Each
  rule in the XCCDF Benchmark SHALL reference an OVAL inventory definition in the CPE
  Inventory component.
 CPE Inventory: contains the technical procedures for determining whether or not a specific target
  asset has a product or platform of interest. The CPE Inventory component SHALL have one or more
  OVAL definitions of class inventory and SHALL NOT have any other classes of OVAL definitions.

5.4   OVAL-Only Scanning

OVAL content can be used on its own, without XCCDF Benchmarks or other components, to perform
scanning. The only SCAP source data stream component that MUST be included is an OVAL component
that maps to the desired definition classes (e.g., compliance class for configuration setting checks,
inventory class for asset checks, patch class for patch presence checks, vulnerability class for software
flaw vulnerability presence checks). The mapping SHALL correspond to the mappings defined in Section
3.2.6.2.
