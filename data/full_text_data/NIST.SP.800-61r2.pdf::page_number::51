                                                                                 COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE



ï€¼ Cost. Original hardware (e.g., hard drives, compromised systems) that is stored as evidence, as well
  as hard drives and removable media that are used to hold disk images, are generally individually
  inexpensive. However, if an organization stores many such components for years, the cost can be
  substantial. The organization also must retain functional computers that can use the stored hardware
  and media.
3.5        Incident Handling Checklist

The checklist in Table 3-5 provides the major steps to be performed in the handling of an incident. Note
that the actual steps performed may vary based on the type of incident and the nature of individual
incidents. For example, if the handler knows exactly what has happened based on analysis of indicators
(Step 1.1), there may be no need to perform Steps 1.2 or 1.3 to further research the activity. The checklist
provides guidelines to handlers on the major steps that should be performed; it does not dictate the exact
sequence of steps that should always be followed.

                                          Table 3-5. Incident Handling Checklist

                                                        Action                                               Completed
                                                    Detection and Analysis
1.         Determine whether an incident has occurred
     1.1         Analyze the precursors and indicators
     1.2         Look for correlating information
     1.3         Perform research (e.g., search engines, knowledge base)
     1.4         As soon as the handler believes an incident has occurred, begin documenting
                 the investigation and gathering evidence
2.         Prioritize handling the incident based on the relevant factors (functional impact, information
           impact, recoverability effort, etc.)
3.         Report the incident to the appropriate internal personnel and external organizations
                                        Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
4.         Acquire, preserve, secure, and document evidence
5.         Contain the incident
6.         Eradicate the incident
     6.1         Identify and mitigate all vulnerabilities that were exploited
     6.2         Remove malware, inappropriate materials, and other components
     6.3         If more affected hosts are discovered (e.g., new malware infections), repeat
                 the Detection and Analysis steps (1.1, 1.2) to identify all other affected hosts, then
                 contain (5) and eradicate (6) the incident for them
7.         Recover from the incident
     7.1         Return affected systems to an operationally ready state
     7.2         Confirm that the affected systems are functioning normally
     7.3         If necessary, implement additional monitoring to look for future related activity
                                                    Post-Incident Activity
8.         Create a follow-up report
9.         Hold a lessons learned meeting (mandatory for major incidents, optional otherwise)
