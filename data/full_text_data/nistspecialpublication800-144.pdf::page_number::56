     ▪ Access/Participation. Access refers to an individual's ability to review data held about
     him or herself and to contest that data's accuracy and completeness. The process should
     be simple, timely and inexpensive to the consumer, and allow consumer objections to be
     incorporated and sent to data recipients.

     ▪ Integrity/Security. Integrity requires that data be accurate and secure. To ensure
     integrity, reasonable measures should be in force, such as cross-referencing data against
     multiple sources for accuracy. Security involves measures to protect against loss and the
     unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, and disclosure of data.

     ▪ Enforcement/Redress. Privacy protection can only be effective if there is a mechanism
     in place to enforce the core principles and remedy any undesirable or unfair situation with
     data that is collected. The data controller for whose benefit the processing of data is
     carried out should be accountable for meeting the core principles. Enforcement through
     industry self-regulation; legislation enabling private remedies for consumers; and
     regulatory schemes enforceable through civil and criminal sanctions are possibilities for
     redress.


   Assess Security and Privacy Risks.               While outsourcing relieves operational
    commitment on the part of the organization, the act of engaging public cloud services
    poses risks against which an organization needs to safeguard itself. The previous chapter
    stressed the importance of instituting a flexible and adaptable risk management program
    for the lifecycle of the system. The risk analysis carried out at this stage should include
    factors such as the service model involved, the purpose and scope of the service, the
    types and level of access needed by the provider and proposed for use between the
    organizational computing environment and provider services, the service duration and
    dependencies, and the strength of protection offered via the security controls available
    from the cloud provider [Len03]. Another consideration, if a non-negotiable service
    agreement applies, is whether the terms of service are subject to unilateral amendment by
    the cloud provider, which would increase the security and privacy risks involved
    [CIO10a]. Privacy controls should be assessed as part of the analysis, as well as
    operational risks due to the locations of the cloud provider’s facilities.

    An organization may require a Privacy Threshold Analysis (PTA) to be completed before
    the development or acquisition of a new information system and when a substantial
    change is made to an existing system [Mcc10]. PTAs are used to determine if a system
    contains PII, whether a PIA or a SORN is required, and whether other privacy
    requirements apply to the information system. As mentioned earlier, a PIA is normally
    conducted for all new or substantially changed technology that collects, maintains, or
    disseminates PII, and makes them publicly available.

    PII should be evaluated to determine the potential harm that could result to the subject
    individuals and/or the organization if PII were inappropriately accessed, used, or
    disclosed (i.e., its confidentiality impact level) [Mcc10]. An organization decides upon
    the factors it uses in determining PII confidentiality impact levels and then creates and
    implements the appropriate policy, procedures, and controls to protect the information.
    For example, some federal agencies have expressed legal obligations to protect certain
