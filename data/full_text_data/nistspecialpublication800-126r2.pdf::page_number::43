    9. Where applicable to the target system, each of the <xccdf:fact> elements in Table 20
       SHALL be provided. Previous versions of SCAP required additional facts; these have been
       incorporated into the use of the Asset Identification specification, as discussed in Section 4.4.2.

4.5.1   Assigning Identifiers to Rule Results
The <xccdf:rule-result> element provides data indicating the result of assessing a system using
the identified <xccdf:Rule> element. If the target <xccdf:Rule> identified by the
<xccdf:rule-result> element’s @idref attribute has one or more <xccdf:ident> elements
with a @system attribute value listed in Section 3.2.4.1, then each <xccdf:ident> element SHALL
also appear within the <xccdf:rule-result> element.
Here is an example for a CVE entry:
<xccdf:rule-result idref="java-upgrade-278" weight="10.0">
   <xccdf:result>pass</xccdf:result>
   …
   <xccdf:ident system="http://cve.mitre.org">CVE-2006-0614</xccdf:ident>
   …
</xccdf:rule-result>

If the <xccdf:ident> element is included, for tracking purposes it is important that produced XCCDF
results have specific meanings. If an <xccdf:ident> element is present and it identifies a CVE, CCE,
or CPE entry, then an <xccdf:rule-result> of “pass” SHALL indicate that the check content
evaluated within the rule complied with one of the following:
       For a CVE entry, the target platform satisfies all the conditions of the XCCDF rule and is
        unaffected by the vulnerability or exposure referenced by the CVE.
       For a CCE entry, the target platform complies with the configuration setting guidance expressed
        in the XCCDF rule.
       For a CPE entry, the target platform was identified on the system.
It is important that these interpretations of <xccdf:ident> elements be preserved. For example,
consider two policy recommendations. One is that a particular piece of software be installed, and the
second that another piece of software not be installed. Both rules for these policy recommendations could
use the same CPE entry in their <xccdf:ident> elements. However, because the interpretation of a
