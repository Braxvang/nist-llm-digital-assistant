how keys are generated, how they are protected in storage at each entity where they
reside and during delivery, and the types of entities to whom they are delivered.

Figure 3 illustrates how a CKMS Design can be shown to be compliant with this
Framework. For each Framework requirement FR:i.j, the appropriate Framework
response, fr:i.j, is provided by the CKMS designer to meet the requirement. The
complete set of pairs consisting of requirements and responses {FR:i.j, fr:i.j} form the
CKMS Design.

FR:2.4 The CKMS design shall specify a high-level overview of the CKMS system that
includes:
    a) The use of each key type,
    b) Where and how the keys are generated,
    c) The metadata elements that are used in a trusted association with each key type,
    d) How keys and/or metadata are protected in storage at each entity where they
       reside,
    e) How keys and/or metadata are protected during distribution, and
    f) The types of entities to which keys and/or metadata can be delivered (e.g., user,
       user device, network device).
