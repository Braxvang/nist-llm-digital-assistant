NIST SP 800-156                                                  REPRESENTATION OF PIV CHAIN-OF-TRUST
                                                                               FOR IMPORT AND EXPORT


          PersonalInformationType
          AdjudicationInformationType
          EnrollmentPackageType

The EnrollmentRecordType for an agency to service provider record exchange use case
would typically include the following types:

          PersonalInformationType
          AdjudicationInformationType
          EnrollmentPackageType
          PIVCardTopographyType

As indicated above, the PIVCardTopographyType data element is more likely to be
included in the service provider record exchange use case rather than the agency to
agency record exchange use case. This is because a client agency needs to provide
information about its agency and its new employees/contractors to be printed on the
surface of each card. For the agency to agency record exchange, topographic information
may not be needed as the receiving agency will use its own topographic elements when
printing on the PIV Card.

3.5       Complex Type PersonalInformationType

The following schema fragment defines the PersonalInformationType complex type:
<xs:complexType name="PersonalInformationType">
  <xs:sequence>
    <xs:element name="PrimaryIdentifier" type="xs:string" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="SecondaryIdentifier" type="xs:string" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="PrintedName" type="xs:string" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="SSN" type="xs:string" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="IsUSCitizen" type="xs:boolean" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="CitizenshipCountryCode" type="xs:string" minOccurs="1"
       maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
    <xs:element name="CardHolderUUID" type="xs:string" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="CardUUID" type="xs:string" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="CHUID" type="xs:string" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/>
  </xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>


The CardUUID and CHUID type data element generally is not included in the agency to
agency record exchange use case as the new agency will generate these values. For the
agency to servicer provider record exchange, however, the client agency may wish to
specify the CardUUID and CHUID for each PIV cardholder.

The PersonalInformationType complex type contains eight elements that describe the
subject of the chain-of-trust enrollment record. Those elements are:

      <PrimaryIdentifier>:
            This element contains the Primary Identifier of the subject of the chain-of-
            trust enrollment record. The Primary Identifier is defined in [FIPS201] as the
            surnames or family names of the PIV cardholder. The <PrimaryIdentifier>
            element is always included in the PersonalInformationType complex type
