and who is in charge of the situation. One person or team should be responsible for internal
communication. This person should have access to the organization’s senior leadership. In addition, the
organization should be prepared to use multiple communication methods such as voicemail, email, flyers,
Web site announcements, or social networking (if approved). 45 Clear and frequent communications from
senior executives to all personnel, interconnected POCs, and end users is necessary after a disruption to
assist calming internal anxiousness, worry, and answering general questions.

Like internal communication, organizations should pay deliberate attention to the message being
communicated to external parties. Again, an effective method is to designate a specific POC or team
from the organization to be responsible for press releases and media communication. The POC or team’s
procedures often involve input from Counsel in approving public statements. This ensures that there is a
single responsible message delivered stating the facts of the situation, as known, and what actions are
being taken. Personnel should be trained to refer all media requests to a single POC or public information
office without making any of their own comments on behalf of the organization. These procedures may
also be stated in the OEP or in public information office guidance.

Some federal departments have internal social networking tools. Governmentwide social networks are

     At the time of publication, social networking is an emerging communication tool. Federal government policies on the use of
     social networking are being established but do not yet exist across all departments. Social networking may prove to be an
     effective means to push crisis information out to personnel, but must be an approved method and have a way to ensure that the
     message is received and authenticated.
