                                       GUIDE TO MALWARE INCIDENT PREVENTION AND HANDLING FOR DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS


       Malicious Mobile Code. Malicious mobile code is software with malicious intent that is
        transmitted from a remote host to a local host and then executed on the local host, typically
        without the user’s explicit instruction. Popular languages for malicious mobile code include Java,
        ActiveX, JavaScript, and VBScript.
       Blended Attacks. A blended attack uses multiple infection or transmission methods. For
        example, a blended attack could combine the propagation methods of viruses and worms.
Many, if not most, instances of malware today are blended attacks. Current malware also relies heavily on
social engineering, which is a general term for attackers trying to trick people into revealing sensitive
information or performing certain actions, such as downloading and executing files that appear to be
benign but are actually malicious. Because so many instances of malware have a variety of malware
characteristics, the classic malware categories listed above (virus, worm, etc.) are considerably less useful
than they used to be for malware incident handling. At one time, there were largely different procedures
for handling incidents of each malware category; now there is largely one set of procedures for handling
all malware incidents, thus nullifying the primary need for having categories.

Another problem with the classic categories is that newer forms of malware do not neatly fit into them.
For example, in the growing trend of web-based malware, also known as drive-by-download, a user’s
web browsing is redirected to an infected website, often with little or no use of social engineering
techniques. The infected website then attempts to exploit vulnerabilities on the user’s host and ultimately
to install rootkits or other attacker tools onto the host, thus compromising the host. Although the website
is infected, its malware does not infect the user’s host; rather, it functions as an attacker tool and installs
other attacker tools on the host. Web-based malware is a blended attack of sorts, but its components do
not map to the other malware categories.

The classic malware categories do not include phishing, which refers to use of deceptive computer-based
means to trick individuals into disclosing sensitive personal information.3 To perform a phishing attack,
an attacker creates a website or email that looks as if it is from a well-known organization, such as an
online business, credit card company, or financial institution. The fraudulent emails and websites are
intended to deceive users into disclosing personal data, usually financial information. For example,
phishers might seek usernames and passwords for online banking sites, as well as bank account numbers.
Some phishing attacks overlap with web-based malware, because they install keystroke loggers or other
attacker tools onto hosts to gather additional personal information.

Organizations should avoid expending substantial time and resources in categorizing each malware
incident based on the types of categories expressed above.

2.2     Attacker Tools

Various types of attacker tools might be delivered to a host by malware. These tools allow attackers to
have unauthorized access to or use of infected hosts and their data, or to launch additional attacks.
Popular types of attacker tools are as follows:
       Backdoors. A backdoor is a malicious program that listens for commands on a certain TCP or
        UDP port. Most backdoors allow an attacker to perform a certain set of actions on a host, such as
        acquiring passwords or executing arbitrary commands. Types of backdoors include zombies
        (better known as bots), which are installed on a host to cause it to attack other hosts, and remote
