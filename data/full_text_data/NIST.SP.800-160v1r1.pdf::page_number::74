risk evaluation
Process of comparing the results of risk analysis with risk criteria to determine whether the risk and/or its magnitude
is/are acceptable or tolerable. [28]

risk identification
Process of finding, recognizing, and describing risks. [28]

risk management
Coordinated activities to direct and control an organization with regard to risk. [28]

risk tolerance
The organization or stakeholderâ€™s readiness to bear the risk after risk treatment in order to achieve its objectives.
[28]
         Note: Risk tolerance can be influenced by legal or regulatory requirements.

risk treatment
Process to modify risk. [28]

safety
Expectation that a system does not, under defined conditions, lead to a state in which human life, health, property, or
the environment is endangered. [86]

security
Freedom from those conditions that can cause the loss of assets with unacceptable consequences.

security architecture
A set of physical and logical security-relevant representations (i.e., views) of system architecture that conveys
information about how the system is partitioned into security domains and makes use of security-relevant elements
to enforce security policies within and between security domains based on how data and information must be
protected.
         Note: The security architecture reflects security domains, the placement of security-relevant elements
         within the security domains, the interconnections and trust relationships between the security-relevant
         elements, and the behavior and interactions between the security-relevant elements. The security
         architecture, like the system architecture, may be expressed at various levels of abstraction and with
         different scopes.

security design order of precedence
A design approach for minimizing the design basis for loss potential and using architectural features to provide
structure for implementing engineered security features and devices.

security domain
Set of assets and resources subject to a common security policy. [85]
         Note: A security domain is defined by rules (policy) for users, processes, systems, and services that apply
         to activities within the domain and activities with similar entities in other domains.

security function
The capability provided by the system or a system element. The capability may be expressed generally as a concept
or specified precisely in requirements.

security mechanism
A device or method for achieving a security-relevant purpose.

security policy
A set of rules that governs all aspects of security-relevant system and system element behavior.
         Note 1: System elements include technology, machine, and human elements.
