compromised a ZSK can use that key only during the KSK’s signature validity interval. An attacker that
has compromised a KSK can use that key for only as long as the signature interval of the RRSIG covering
the DS RR in the delegating parent. Therefore, it makes sense to keep these validity periods short, which
will require frequent re-signing.

To minimize the impact of a compromised ZSK, a zone administrator should set a signature validity
period of 1 week for RRSIGs covering the DNSKEY RRSet in the zone (the RRSet that contains the ZSK
and KSK for the zone). The DNSKEY RRSet can be re-signed without performing a ZSK rollover, but
scheduled ZSK rollover should still be performed at regular intervals.

To prevent the impact of a compromised KSK, a delegating parent should set the signature validity period
for RRSIGs covering DS RRs in the range of a few days to 1 week. This re-signing does not require
frequent rollover of the parent’s ZSK, but scheduled ZSK rollover should still be performed at regular
intervals.


Checklist item 24: The validity period for the RRSIGs covering a zone’s DNSKEY RRSet should be in
the range of 2 days to 1 week. This value helps reduce the vulnerability period resulting from a key
compromise.

Checklist item 25: A zone with delegated children should have a validity period of a few days to 1 week
for RRSIGs covering the DS RR for a delegated child. This value helps reduce the child zone’s
vulnerability period resulting from a KSK compromise and scheduled key rollovers.


Following checklist items 24 and 25 in a particular organization depends on the content management and
DNSSEC tools in place and local policy regarding content management. A DNS administrator may be
forced to choose one signature validity period for all of the content in a zone if the available tools do not
allow for fine grain control in zone signing.

In these cases it may be necessary for a DNS administrator to choose a single signature valididity period
for the entire zone. In these cases, the DNS administrator should choose a value that minimizes the risk
should a key compromise or emergency update be necessary.

10.4 Hashed Authenticated Denial of Existance

One of the side effects of the DNSSEC security extensions as they were first specified is the ability for a
user to “walk” a zone by sending a series of queries for NSEC RRs (See Section 9). In that section the
NSEC RR and its use in authenticated denial of existence is introduced. A client could send a query for
an NSEC RR in the zone, then “walk” the zone by sending a follow-up query for the NSEC RR at the
name indicated as the next name in the received NSEC RR. This would result in a client being able to
enumerate the entire contents of a zone. While this is not an attack by itself (all DNS data is considered
public), it would most likely be a prelude to an attack. An attacker would enumerate a zone to discover
the IP addresses of servers to attack directly.

There are several operational means to minimize the impact of zone enumeration and a protocol option in
DNSSEC [IEEE]. The operational options are to use split DNS or some other means of segregating
public servers from internal hosts. One way of doing that is described in Section 7.2.8 and Section 7.2.9.
