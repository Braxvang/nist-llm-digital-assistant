           security service provisioning systems.
     -     High-confidence, dedicated-purpose system: The engineering effort delivers a system that
           satisfies the need for real-time vehicular control, industrial or utility processes, weapons,
           nuclear power plants, and other special-purpose needs. Such systems may include
           multiple operational states or modes with varying forms of manual, semi-manual,
           automated, or autonomous modes. These systems have highly deterministic properties,
           strict timing constraints, functional interlocks, and severe or catastrophic consequences of
           failure.
•    Development of a system of systems
     The engineering effort occurs across a set of constituent systems, each with its own
     stakeholders, primary purpose, and planned evolution. The composition of the constituent
     systems into a system of systems as noted in [9] produces a capability that would otherwise
     be difficult or impractical to achieve. This effort can occur across a variety of system of
     systems from a relatively informal, unplanned system of systems concept and evolution that
     emerges over time via voluntary participation to a more formal execution with the most
     formal being a system of systems concept that is directed, structured, planned, and achieved
     via a centrally managed engineering effort. Any resulting emergent behavior often introduces
     opportunities and additional challenges for systems security engineering.

           Target Audience
This publication is intended for systems engineers, security engineers, and other engineering
professionals. The term systems security engineer is used to include systems engineers and
security professionals who apply the concepts and principles and perform the activities and tasks
described in this publication. 8 This publication can also be used by professionals who perform
other system life cycle activities or tasks, including:
•    Individuals with security governance, risk management, and oversight responsibilities
•    Individuals with security verification, validation, testing, evaluation, auditing, assessment,
     inspection, and monitoring responsibilities
•    Individuals with acquisition, budgeting, and project management responsibilities
•    Individuals with operations, maintenance, sustainment, logistics, and support responsibilities
•    Providers of technology-related products, systems, or services
•    Educators in academic institutions that offer systems engineering, computer engineering,
     computer science, software engineering, and computer security programs

  Systems security engineering activities and tasks can be applied to a mechanism, component, system element, system, system of systems,
processes, or organizations. Regardless of the size or complexity of the entity, a transdisciplinary systems engineering team is needed to deliver
systems that are trustworthy and that satisfy the protection needs and concerns of stakeholders. The processes are intended to be tailored to
facilitate effectiveness.
