                   Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


Information        A specific category of information (e.g., privacy, medical,
Type               proprietary, financial, investigative, contractor sensitive, security
[FIPS 199]         management) defined by an organization or in some instances, by a
                   specific law, executive order, directive, policy, or regulation.

Integrity          Guarding against improper information modification or destruction,
[44 U.S.C., Sec.   and includes ensuring information non-repudiation and authenticity.

Label              See Security Label.
Low-Impact         An information system in which all three security objectives (i.e.,
System             confidentiality, integrity, and availability) are assigned a FIPS 199
                   potential impact value of low.
Major              An application that requires special attention to security due to the
Application        risk and magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or
[OMB Circular      unauthorized access to or modification of the information in the
A-130,             application. Note: All federal applications require some level of
Appendix III]      protection. Certain applications, because of the information in them,
                   however, require special management oversight and should be treated
                   as major. Adequate security for other applications should be provided
                   by security of the systems in which they operate.
Major              An information system that requires special management attention
Information        because of its importance to an agency mission; its high development,
System             operating, or maintenance costs; or its significant role in the
[OMB Circular      administration of agency programs, finances, property, or other
A-130]             resources.
Management         The security controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) for an
Controls           information system that focus on the management of risk and the
[NIST SP 800-      management of information system security.

Media Access    A hardware address that uniquely identifies each component of an
Control Address IEEE 802-based network. On networks that do not conform to the
                IEEE 802 standards but do conform to the OSI Reference Model, the
                node address is called the Data Link Control (DLC) address.
Minor              An application, other than a major application, that requires attention
Application        to security due to the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from the
                   loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of the
                   information in the application. Minor applications are typically
                   included as part of a general support system.
Mobile Code        Software programs or parts of programs obtained from remote
                   information systems, transmitted across a network, and executed on a
                   local information system without explicit installation or execution by
                   the recipient.
