        –    All hosts, public or otherwise, must be running the latest version of Windows with critical
             security updates installed and an antivirus package with an up-to-date virus signature
             database. They must also have a firewall program installed and running. Any host not
             meeting these requirements is not permitted to login.
    4. List how the VPN should be used to access the resources. Resources are accessible in
       different ways:

        –    The organization’s internal resources are accessible by network extension because a broad
             number of them are hosted on multiple servers. Also, some Web-based applications do not
             function properly when proxying is used, so network extension must be used.

        –    When users login from public hosts that are not organization-managed, they can access a set
             of Web-based applications via proxy.

        –    The set of HR applications are accessible by network extension because some require many
             interlocking programs and cannot be accessed by other means.
Table 7-1 summarizes the organization’s access control policy.

7.2.2   Endpoint Security Policy

The organization designs an endpoint security policy to enforce access control. The policy is mainly
driven by a prelogin sequence executed by the SSL VPN appliance before a user logs in. This sequence
runs host integrity checks that require the host to download and run active content controls. These
controls or applets ensure that the host complies with the organization’s endpoint security policy.

The endpoint security policy is based on the access control policy and elaborates further:

     An organization-managed host is identified by a registry key indicating that the host is managed
      by the organization. The host integrity check only needs to find this key to verify the host’s
      identity. Organization-managed hosts use network extension to gain full access to the internal
      network. A packet filter is configured on the SSL VPN to prevent these hosts from accessing the
      restricted set of HR applications. If a user is permitted to use the restricted set of HR
      applications, a packet filter is configured on the SSL VPN to prevent the user from accessing any
      resource outside the HR applications. Users are permitted to keep all cookies, Web browser
      cache entries, and downloaded files and attachments.
