TION, AND MEASUREMENT
GROUP (STVMG)

MISSION STATEMENT:
Advance information security testing, measurement
science, and conformance.

OVERVIEW:
     Federal agencies, industry, and the public rely on
cryptography for the protection of the information and
communications used in electronic commerce, the critical
infrastructure, and other application areas. The STVMG
supports the testing and validation of the underlying
cryptographic modules and cryptographic algorithms
based upon established standards. These cryptographic
modules and algorithms enable products and systems to
provide security services, such as confidentiality, integrity
protection, and authentication. Although cryptography
provides security, poor designs or weak algorithms can
render a product insecure and place highly sensitive
information at risk. When protecting sensitive data, federal
agencies require assurance that cryptographic products
meet established security requirements and use only tested
and validated cryptographic modules.
     STVMG’s testing-focused activities include validating
cryptographic algorithm implementations, cryptographic
modules, and Security Content Automation Protocol
(SCAP)-enabled products; developing test suites and test
methods; providing implementation guidance and technical
support to industry forums; and conducting education,
training, and outreach programs.
    STVMG’s validation programs work together with
independent cryptographic and security testing laboratories
accredited by the NIST National Voluntary Laboratory
Accreditation Program (NVLAP). Based on the independent
laboratory test report and test evidence, the Validation
Program validates an implementation under test. NIST
publishes lists of awarded validations through public
websites.
