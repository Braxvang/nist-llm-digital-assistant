                                                                           Guidelines on PDA Forensics


               Testability – Has the scientific theory or technique been empirically tested?
               According to K. Popper (1989) in The Growth of Scientific Knowledge, "the criterion
               on the scientific status of a theory is its falsifiability, refutability, and testability."

               Acceptance – Has the scientific theory or technique been subjected to peer review
               and publication? This ensures that flaws in the methodology would have been
               detected and that the technique is finding its way into use via the literature.

               Error Rate – What is the known or potential error rate? Scientific measures
               generally have associated error rates, which can be estimated with a fair amount of
               precision. Known threats exist against the validity and reliability in any test
               (experimental and quasi-experimental) of a theory.

               Credibility – What is the expert's qualifications and stature in the scientific
               community? Does the technique rely upon the special skills and equipment of one
               expert, or can it be replicated by other experts elsewhere?

               Clarity – Can the technique and its results be explained with sufficient clarity and
               simplicity so that the court and the jury can understand its plain meaning? This
               criterion is assumed to be incorporated in Daubert implicitly.

       In general, even outside of law enforcement investigations, evidence should be collected in a
       manner that makes it likely the evidence could be admissible in court. It may not be obvious
       when an investigation is initiated, for example, when a computer security incident is first
       detected, that a court action will ensue. Important evidence might be overlooked, improperly
       handled, or accidentally destroyed before the seriousness of the incident is realized.

4.3   Procedural Models

       The Electronic Crime Scene Investigation – A Guide for First Responders, produced by the
       U.S. Department of Justice [DOJ01], offers the following suggestions when approaching a
       digital crime scene.

               Securing and Evaluating the Scene – Steps should be taken to ensure the safety of
               individuals and to identify and protect the integrity of potential evidence.

               Documenting the Scene – Create a permanent record of the scene, accurately
               recording both digital-related and conventional evidence.

               Evidence Collection – Collect traditional and digital evidence in a manner that
               preserves their evidentiary value.

               Packaging, Transportation, and Storage – Take adequate precautions when
               packaging, transporting, and storing evidence, maintaining chain of custody.

       Incident Response [Man01], an “Incident Response Methodology” proposes the following
       phases when encountering an incident or performing a digital investigation.

               Pre-incident preparation – Through training and education, gain an understanding
               on how to respond to an incident.
