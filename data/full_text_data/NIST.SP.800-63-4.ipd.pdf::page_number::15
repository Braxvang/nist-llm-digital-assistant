      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines

349   2.   Introduction
350   This section is informative.
351   As the line between the virtual world and physical world blurs, and as digital and
352   internet-enabled technologies continue to proliferate and connect, it is imperative that
353   developers and consumers alike understand this changing hybrid ecosystem - including its
354   associated opportunities and risks. Engagement across this ecosystem is often determined
355   by an individual’s ability and willingness to establish a digital identity - the unique
356   representation of a person engaged in an online transaction.
357   A digital identity is always unique in the context of a digital service but does not always
358   uniquely identify a person in all contexts. Further, while a digital identity may relay
359   unique and specific meaning within the context of a digital service, the real-life identity
360   of the individual behind the digital identity may not be known. For the purpose of this
361   publication, a “person” refers to natural persons only (i.e., not all legal persons.)
362   Establishing a digital identity is intended to demonstrate trust between the holder of
363   the digital identity and the person, organization, or system on the other side of the
364   digital transaction. However, this process can present challenges. As in relationships
365   and transactions in the physical world, there are multiple opportunities for mistakes,
366   miscommunication, impersonation, and other attacks that fraudulently claim another
367   person’s digital identity. Additionally, given the broad range of individual needs,
368   constraints, capacities, and preferences, digital services must be designed with equity
369   and flexibility in mind to ensure broad and enduring participation.
370   Risks associated with digital identity stretch beyond the potential impacts to enterprises
371   and should be incorporated into enterprise decision-making. This publication endeavors
372   to more robustly and explicitly account for risks to individuals, communities, and other
373   organizations. Specifically, while using this guidance, organizations should consider how
374   decisions related to digital identity that prioritize organizational cybersecurity objectives
375   might affect or need to accommodate other objectives, such as those related to privacy,
376   equity, usability, and other indicators of mission and business performance that center
377   the experiences of the individuals interacting with programs and services. By taking a
378   human-centered and continuously informed approach to mission delivery, organizations
379   have an opportunity to incrementally build trust with the variety of populations they serve,
380   improve customer satisfaction, identify issues more quickly, and provide individuals with
381   effective and culturally appropriate redress options.
382   These guidelines lay out a model for federal programs and other organizations to assess
383   and manage risks associated with digital identity systems, including the processes,
384   policies, data, people, and technologies that support digital identity management.
385   The model is supported by a series of processes: identity proofing, authentication,
386   and federation. The identity proofing process establishes that a subject is a specific
387   physical person. The digital authentication process determines the validity of one or

                                                   3
