CHAPTER ONE

INTRODUCTION
THE NEED FOR INTEGRATED ORGANIZATION-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT




I   nformation technology is widely recognized as the engine that drives the U.S. economy,
    giving industry a competitive advantage in global markets, enabling the federal government
    to provide better services to its citizens, and facilitating greater productivity as a nation.
Organizations5 in the public and private sectors depend on technology-intensive information
systems6 to successfully carry out their missions and business functions. Information systems can
include diverse entities ranging from high-end supercomputers, workstations, personal computers,
cellular telephones, and personal digital assistants to very specialized systems (e.g., weapons
systems, telecommunications systems, industrial/process control systems, and environmental
control systems). Information systems are subject to serious threats that can have adverse effects
on organizational operations (i.e., missions, functions, image, or reputation), organizational
assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation by exploiting both known and unknown
vulnerabilities to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information
being processed, stored, or transmitted by those systems. Threats to information and information
systems can include purposeful attacks, environmental disruptions, and human/machine errors
and result in great harm to the national and economic security interests of the United States.
Therefore, it is imperative that leaders and managers at all levels understand their responsibilities
and are held accountable for managing information security risk—that is, the risk associated with
the operation and use of information systems that support the missions and business functions of
their organizations.

Organizational risk can include many types of risk (e.g., program management risk, investment
risk, budgetary risk, legal liability risk, safety risk, inventory risk, supply chain risk, and security
risk). Security risk related to the operation and use of information systems is just one of many
components of organizational risk that senior leaders/executives address as part of their ongoing
risk management responsibilities. Effective risk management requires that organizations operate
in highly complex, interconnected environments using state-of-the-art and legacy information
systems—systems that organizations depend on to accomplish their missions and to conduct
important business-related functions. Leaders must recognize that explicit, well-informed risk-
based decisions are necessary in order to balance the benefits gained from the operation and use
of these information systems with the risk of the same systems being vehicles through which
purposeful attacks, environmental disruptions, or human errors cause mission or business failure.
Managing information security risk, like risk management in general, is not an exact science. It
brings together the best collective judgments of individuals and groups within organizations
responsible for strategic planning, oversight, management, and day-to-day operations—providing
both the necessary and sufficient risk response measures to adequately protect the missions and
business functions of those organizations.



5
 The term organization describes an entity of any size, complexity, or positioning within an organizational structure
(e.g., a federal agency or, as appropriate, any of its operational elements) that is charged with carrying out assigned
mission/business processes and that uses information systems in support of those processes.
6
 An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance,
use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. In the context of this publication, the definition includes the
environment in which the information system operates (i.e., people, processes, technologies, facilities, and cyberspace).
