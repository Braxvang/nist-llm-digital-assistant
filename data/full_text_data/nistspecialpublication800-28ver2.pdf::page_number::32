    application for reuse. ActiveX controls are included with Microsoft Internet Explorer to allow Web
    pages to be enhanced with formatting, special effects, or animation.
 ActiveX documents allow an ActiveX-enabled Web browser to open an application, with the
  application’s own toolbars and menus available, and serve as its container. This allows non-HTML
  native-formatted files, such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, or PDF files, to be opened and
  manipulated when encountered by the browser.
 ActiveX scripting refers to enhancements to VBScript and JavaScript to interact with ActiveX
  controls. ActiveX scripting can be used to integrate the behavior of several ActiveX controls or Java
  applications from the Web browser or server, extending their functionality.
The ActiveX security model is considerably different from the Java sandbox model [Ste02]. The Java
model is designed to restrict the permissions of applets to a set of safe actions based on the source or
author of the code via the Java security manager. Instead, ActiveX controls are digitally signed by their
author under a technology scheme called Authenticode. The digital signatures are verified using identity
certificates issued by a trusted certificate authority to an ActiveX software publisher. For an ActiveX
publisher's certificate to be granted, the software publisher must pledge that no harmful code will be
knowingly distributed under this scheme. The Authenticode security model is designed to ensure that
ActiveX controls cannot be distributed anonymously and that tampering with the controls can be detected,
but it imposes few restrictions on the actions controls can take once they are executing.

Recent versions of Internet Explorer allow the user to categorize ActiveX controls depending on whether
they are downloaded from a site on the Internet, a site on the local intranet, or a site identified as being
either trusted or untrusted by the user. These site categories are known as security zones. Each zone can
be configured to disable or enable the automatic loading of different classes of ActiveX controls (e.g.,
signed versus unsigned) from a site in the zone, or to prompt the user for a decision before downloading
them.

When prompting the user, the browser presents a dialog box warning that downloading the control may
not be safe. The user can choose to abort the transfer or, if the the source is believed to be trustworthy or
low-risk, continue it. Users may not be aware of the security implications of their decisions, which can
have serious repercussions. Even when the user is well informed, attackers may trick the user into
approving the transfer. In the past, attackers have exploited implementation flaws to cover the user
dialogue window with another that displays an unobtrusive message such as “Do you want to continue?”
while exposing the positive indication button needed to launch active content.

Like any other application that supports mobile code, ActiveX-enabled browsers provide a potential
vehicle for malicious code delivery. If a user decides to download an ActiveX control from a malicious
Web site, the control is automatically executed without the victim having to take any further action.
Instead of developing malicious controls to propagate, some attackers have successfully exploited flaws
in ActiveX controls that have been distributed by trusted publishers [Kei08]. This sort of attack may be
the most dangerous, since the user may assume that a control is safe due to its source and have no
concerns about security or privacy when it executes.

4.1.6   Desktop Application Macros

Developers of popular spreadsheet, word processing, and other desktop applications included macro
features to allow users to automate and customize repetitive tasks. A macro, in its simplest form, is a
series of menu selections, keystrokes, and commands recorded and assigned a name or key combination.
When the macro name is called or the macro key combination is pressed, the steps in the macro are
executed from beginning to end. Macros are used to shorten long menu sequences as well as to create
