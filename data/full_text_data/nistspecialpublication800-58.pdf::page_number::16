 1.3   Audience and Assumptions

       VOIP is a very large, complex, and rapidly evolving field. This document reviews
       VOIP technologies and solutions. Each section provides background information
       for the reader who is new to VOIP, but most sections also include details of
       standards and technologies that may be of interest to technical personnel only.
       The following list highlights how people with different backgrounds might use
       this document. The intended audience includes the following:

       Managers planning to employ VOIP telephony devices in their organizations
       (chief information officers, senior managers, etc).

       Systems engineers and architects when designing and implementing networks.

       System administrators when administering, patching, securing or upgrading
       networks that include VOIP components.

       Security consultants when performing security assessments to determine security
       postures of VOIP environments.

       Researchers and analysts interested in VOIP technologies.

       This document assumes that the readers have some minimal operating system,
       networking, and security expertise. Because of the rapidly changing nature of the
       telecommunications industry and the threats and vulnerabilities to these
       technologies, readers are strongly encouraged to take advantage of other resources
       (including those listed in this document) for more current and detailed
       information.

 1.4   Document Organization

       The document is divided into five sections followed by three appendices. This
       subsection is a roadmap describing the document structure.

       Section 1 is composed of an authority, purpose, scope, audience, assumptions, and
       document structure.

       Section 2 provides an overview of VOIP technology.

       Section 3 discusses performance and quality of service aspects of VOIP, and their
       effect on security options.

       Sections 4 and 5 describe the two most commonly used protocols for VOIP:
       H.323 and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).
