396   For example, the Privacy Act requires federal agencies to disclose much of the information about
397   individuals in their records when the individual requests it. However, if the organization’s cybersecurity
398   posture does not allow for the efficient sharing of information, individuals risk privacy violations because
399   they may experience problems or harms resulting from their inability to know what information is held
400   about them.
401   Providing the workforce with a general understanding of the different origins of cybersecurity and privacy
402   risks is important for enabling them to effectively address the risks they encounter in their daily activities.
403   For example, all members of the workforce will need training that helps them understand when a privacy
404   event has occurred, and incident response professionals will need training that helps them determine when
405   a cybersecurity incident may also be a privacy event, which often requires additional procedures when
406   responding (e.g., determining if an unsecured site resulted in an actual data breach of PII). Organizations
407   can benefit from taking a coordinated approach to developing CPLPs and have the flexibility to determine
408   how to effectively do so to meet the organization’s needs. 7
409   Once an organization understands the relationship between cybersecurity and privacy in its context, it can
410   determine its approach to developing both integrated and cybersecurity- or privacy-specific learning
411   activities based on the relevant topics and workforce roles in the environment. For example, the
412   organization can determine how to effectively:
413        •     Associate learning tracks with work roles and job performance
414        •     Describe its approach to managing cybersecurity and privacy risk in a way that aligns with
415              enterprise risk management capabilities
416        •     Incorporate lessons learned from cybersecurity and privacy risk, audit findings, incidents, or
417              events, or changes to governance documents (e.g., laws, regulations, policies, and standards) into
418              general and role-based training



      7 Role-based privacy training should address the full scope of privacy risks, as depicted in Fig. 1. For federal agencies, role-based privacy

      training addresses the types of information that may constitute personally identifiable information and the risks, considerations, and obligations
      associated with its processing. Such training also considers the authority to process personally identifiable information documented in privacy
      policies and notices, system of records notices, computer matching agreements and notices, privacy impact assessments, Privacy Act statements,
      contracts, information sharing agreements, memoranda of understanding, or other documentation.
