     â€¢     The evidence required to determine that the system security requirements have been
           satisfied 62

Due to the complexity of system security, system security requirements have several types and
purposes, including (1) structural security requirements that express the passive aspects of the
protection capability provided primarily by the system architecture and (2) functional security
requirements that express the active aspects of the protection capability provided by engineered
features and devices (e.g., security mechanisms, controls, safeguards, inhibits, overrides, and
countermeasures). Decomposition of the system security requirements is accomplished as part of
the system requirements decomposition and is consistent with the different levels of hierarchical
abstraction and forms of the system requirements.


                                       SYSTEM STATES, POLICY, AND REQUIREMENTS
          Systems operate in secure, insecure, and indeterminant states (Section 3.2). System
          security policy and system requirements account for these states and the state transitions,
          including those that reflect the design principles of Protective Failure and Protective
          Recovery. For example, requirements capture needs to (1) detect insecure system states;
          (2) detect a transition that will result in an insecure state; (3) transition to a secure halt
          state; (4) recover to a reconstituted, reconfigured, or alternative secure operational mode;
          and if necessary, (5) continue operating within insecure or indeterminant states when
          other needs override protection needs.




C.3.       Distinguishing Requirements, Policy, and Mechanisms
The terms requirements, policy, and mechanisms are often used in an abstract manner that allows
them to be considered as synonyms. However, when these terms are used in the context of
engineering trustworthy secure systems, they are distinct in their meaning and importance to
specifying, realizing, utilizing, and sustaining systems.

The security policy states the behavior that is necessary to achieve a secure condition, whereas a
security mechanism is a means to achieve the necessary behavior. The distinction between
security policy and security mechanism extends to differentiating security requirements from
security policy. Security requirements specify the capability, behavior, and quality attributes
exhibited and possessed by security mechanisms as well as the constraints on each. Security
policy specifies how the security mechanisms must behave in an operational context and the
constraints on those behaviors. From the system standpoint, a human is a system element and
may serve as a security mechanism. Therefore, the human is expected to behave as stated by
relevant security policy and security requirements.

Requirements, policies, and mechanisms have an important dependency relationship. System
security requirements specify the capabilities and behaviors that a security mechanism can

   Each system security requirement, like any system requirement, is expressed in a manner that makes verification possible via inspection,
analysis, demonstration, testing, or other defined and achievable means [31].
