SP 800-130                                                             August 2013



   h) The applications that may use the key (e.g., TLS, EFS, S/MIME, IPSec, PKINIT,
      SSH, etc.)
   i) The applications that are not permitted to use the key
   j) The key assurances
      i. Symmetric key assurances (e.g., format checks)
           • Who obtains the assurance
           • The circumstances under which it is obtained
           • How the assurance is obtained
      ii. Asymmetric key assurances (e.g., assurance of possession and validity)
           • Who obtains the assurances
           • The circumstances under which the assurance is obtained
           • How the assurance is obtained
      iii. Domain parameter validity checks
           • Who performs the validity check
           • The circumstances under which the checking is performed
           • How the assurance of domain parameter validity was obtained.

FR:6.14 The CKMS design shall specify all syntax, semantics, and formats of all key
types and their metadata that will be created, stored, transmitted, processed, and
otherwise managed by the CKMS.

6.3 Key Lifecycle States and Transitions
A key may pass through several states between its generation and its destruction. This
section is based on Section 7, Key States and Transitions, from [SP 800-57-part1].
Possible states of a key include: Pre-Activation, Active, Deactivated, Compromised,
Destroyed, Destroyed Compromised, and Revoked. Note that the CKMS designer selects
and defines the key states and transitions that are appropriate for the CKMS and its likely
applications.

FR:6.15 The CKMS design shall specify all the states that the CKMS keys can attain.

FR:6.16 The CKMS design shall specify all transitions between the CKMS key states
and the data (inputs and outputs) involved in making the transitions.

6.4 Key and Metadata Management Functions
The key and metadata management functions described in this section are performed by
the CKMS on keys or metadata for management purposes. The authentication and
authorization of the calling entities is performed by an Access Control System (ACS), as
described in Section 6.7.

A CKMS should provide for the creation, modification, replacement, and destruction of
keys and their metadata. Depending on the function, the input and/or output may have
integrity, source authentication, and/or confidentiality services applied to them.
