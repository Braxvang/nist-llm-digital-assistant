      NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                       Recommendation for RBG Constructions
      September 2022



324       Introduction and Purpose
325   Cryptography and security applications make extensive use of random bits. However, the
326   generation of random bits is challenging in many practical applications of cryptography.
327   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed the Special Publication
328   (SP) 800-90 series to support the generation of high-quality random bits for both cryptographic
329   and non-cryptographic purposes. The SP 800-90 series consists of three parts:
330       •   SP 800-90A, Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic
331           Random Bit Generators, specifies several approved deterministic random bit generator
332           (DRBG) mechanisms based on approved cryptographic algorithms that – once provided
333           with seed material that contains sufficient entropy – can be used to generate random bits
334           suitable for cryptographic applications.
335       •   SP 800-90B, Recommendation for the Entropy Sources Used for Random Bit Generation,
336           provides guidance for the development and validation of entropy sources − mechanisms
337           that generate entropy from physical or non-physical noise sources and that can be used to
338           generate the input for the seed material needed by a DRBG or for input to an RBG.
339       •   SP 800-90C, Recommendation for Random Bit Generator (RBG) Constructions, specifies
340           constructions for random bit generators (RBGs) using entropy sources that comply with
341           SP 800-90B and DRBGs that comply with SP 800-90A. Three classes of RBGs are
342           specified in this document (see Sections 5, 6, and 7). SP 800-90C also provides high-level
343           guidance for testing RBGs for conformance to this Recommendation.
344   The RBG constructions defined in this Recommendation consist of two main components: the
345   entropy sources that generate true random variables (variables that may be biased, i.e., each
346   possible outcome does not need to have the same chance of occurring) and the DRBGs that ensure
347   that the outputs of the RBG are indistinguishable from the ideal distribution to a computationally
348   bounded adversary.
349   Throughout this document, the phrase “this Recommendation” refers to the aggregate of SP 800-
350   90A, SP 800-90B, and SP 800-90C, while the phrase “this document” refers only to SP 800-90C.
351   SP 800-90C has been developed in coordination with NIST’s Cryptographic Algorithm Validation
352   Program (CAVP) and Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP). The document uses
353   “shall” and “must” to indicate requirements and uses “should” to indicate an important
354   recommendation. The term “shall” is used when a requirement is testable by a testing lab during
355   implementation validation using operational tests or a code review. The term “must” is used for
356   requirements that may not be testable by the CAVP or CMVP. An example of such a requirement
357   is one that demands certain actions and/or considerations from a system administrator. Meeting
358   these requirements can be verified by a CMVP review of the cryptographic module’s
359   documentation. If the requirement is determined to be testable at a later time (e.g., after SP 800-
360   90C is published and before it is revised), the CMVP will so indicate in the Implementation
361   Guidance for FIPS 140, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules.
