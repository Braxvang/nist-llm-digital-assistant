SP 800-130                                                                August 2013



may include physical protection and/or the generation of a new archive key for the same
or a stronger cryptographic algorithm, and re-encryption of the archived keys and/or
metadata under the new archive key.

Key and metadata archiving usually requires provisions for moving archived keys and/or
metadata to new storage media when the old media are no longer readable because of the
aging of, or technical changes to, the media and media readers. Archived keys and/or
metadata should be recovered from the old storage medium and stored on the new storage
medium; the keys should be destroyed on the old storage medium after the transfer.
When performing key and/or metadata archival or destruction, applicable laws and
regulations must be considered so that the keys and/or metadata are available for the
required period of time.

FR:6.50 The CKMS design shall specify how, where, and the circumstances under
which keys and/or their metadata are archived.

FR:6.51 The CKMS design shall specify the technique for the secure destruction of the
key and/or metadata or the secure destruction of the old storage medium after being
written onto a new storage medium.

FR:6.52 The CKMS design shall specify how keys and/or their metadata are protected
after the cryptoperiod of an archive key expires.

6.4.17 Recover Key and/or Metadata
Key and/or metadata recovery involves obtaining a copy of a key and/or its metadata that
has been previously backed-up, archived, or stored. The key and/or metadata can be
recovered by an authorized entity (e.g., its owner or by a trusted entity) after all the rules
for recovery have been fulfilled and verified. The CKMS Security Policy should state the
conditions under which a key and/or metadata may be recovered.

FR: 6.53 The CKMS design shall specify the CKMS recovery policy for keys and/or
metadata.

FR:6.54 The CKMS design shall specify the mechanisms used to implement and enforce
the recovery policy for keys and/or metadata.

FR:6.55 The CKMS design shall specify how, and the circumstances under which, keys
and/or metadata are recovered from each key database or metadata storage facility.

FR: 6.56 The CKMS design shall specify how keys and/or metadata are protected during
recovery.

6.4.18 Establish Key
Key establishment is the process by which a key is securely shared between two or more
entities. The key may be transported from one entity to another (key transport), or the key
