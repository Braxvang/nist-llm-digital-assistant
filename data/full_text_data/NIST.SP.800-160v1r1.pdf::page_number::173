RM-5      MONITOR RISK
          RM-5.1 Continually monitor all security-relevant risks and the security risk management
                 context.
          Note: Changes with security-relevant risks and their treatments may prompt reevaluation. The
          initial treatment plans for a security-relevant risk may include preplanned additional actions
          when risk increases or insufficiently decreases despite treatment.
          RM-5.2 Implement and monitor measures to evaluate the effectiveness of security-relevant
                 risk treatments.
          RM-5.3 Continually monitor for the emergence of new security-relevant risks and sources of
                 risk throughout the life cycle.
          Note: This includes monitoring known changes in adversities.
