              controls assigned to each subsystem component.

While the above considerations may be useful to agencies in determining information
system boundaries for purposes of security accreditation, they should not be viewed as
limiting the agency's flexibility in establishing boundaries that promote effective
information security within the available resources of the agency. Authorizing officials
and senior agency information security officers should consult with prospective
information system owners when establishing information system boundaries. The
process of establishing boundaries for agency information systems and the associated
security implications, is an agency-level activity that should include careful negotiation
among all key participants—taking into account the mission/business requirements of the
agency, the technical considerations with respect to information security, and the
programmatic costs to the agency.

FIPS 199 defines security categories for information systems based on potential impact
on organizations, assets, or individuals should there be a breach of security—that is, a
loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. FIPS 199 security categories can play an
important part in defining information system boundaries by partitioning the agency's
information systems according to the criticality or sensitivity of the information and
information systems and the importance of those systems in accomplishing the agency's
mission. This is particularly important when there are various FIPS 199 impact levels
contained in one information system. The FIPS 199 requirement to secure an information
