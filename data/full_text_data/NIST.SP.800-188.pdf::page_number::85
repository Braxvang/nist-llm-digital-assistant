study a priori, those who seek to disseminate the de-identifed data know how successful
the external intruder’s re-identifcation attempt was if both parties have access to the same
external internal data.
The conditional re-identifcation rate is identical to the metric of precision in the record
linkage and health science literature. It represents the ratio of true positives to the sum
of true positives and false positives. Data owners should not be alarmed if an external
organization reports a relatively high suspected re-identifcation rate as long as they know
that the conditional re-identifcation rate is low [59, 77, 139].
Confrmed re-identifcation rates are defned in Sec. 3.2.1 as re-identifcation probabilities.
On its own, a low confrmed re-identifcation probability does not indicate that an organiza-
tion should disseminate a de-identifed dataset. Even when a confrmed rate is low, a high
conditional rate should direct an organization to not disseminate the de-identifed micro-
data.
Re-identifcation studies may identify problems that can direct improvements to any or-
ganization’s disclosure avoidance methods. Re-identifcation studies are not designed to
replace legacy or modern provable privacy methods but to act as a quality control to vali-
date that the methods – old and new – protect as they were designed.
