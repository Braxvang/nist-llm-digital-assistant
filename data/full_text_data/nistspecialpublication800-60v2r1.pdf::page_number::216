D.17.1 Judicial Hearings Information Type

Judicial hearings include activities associated with conducting a hearing in a court of law to
settle a dispute. The general recommended security categorization for the judicial hearings
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of judicial hearings
information on the ability of responsible entities to conducting a hearing in a court of law to
settle a dispute. While much information associated with judicial hearings is public, some
information is sealed by the court and unauthorized disclosure is punishable by law, fine and/or
imprisonment. In the vast majority of cases, unauthorized disclosure of judicial hearings
information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where the life of a victim, witness, or
informant may be endangered by unauthorized disclosure, the confidentiality impact is high.
Also, where the consequences are likely to endanger public safety, the confidentiality impact is
high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Given the consequences of unauthorized disclosure,
the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for judicial hearings information is
moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Judicial
hearings activities are not typically time-critical. Modification or destruction of court records can
result in disruption or jeopardy to legal proceedings. In most cases, the adverse effects of
unauthorized modification or destruction of judicial hearings information on agency mission
functions and/or public confidence in the agency will be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
judicial hearings information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to judicial hearings information. Most
judicial hearings processes are tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of access to judicial
hearings information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on government
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: In exceptional cases (e.g., orders
associated with wiretap or search warrants), loss of availability of information can have a serious
or severe adverse effect. In such cases, the availability impact might be moderate or high.
