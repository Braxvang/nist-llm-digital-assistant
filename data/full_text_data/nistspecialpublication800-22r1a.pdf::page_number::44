A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



                    For block 10: 10 is placed in the “11” row of the table (i.e., T3), and sum = 5.169925002
                         + log2(10-6) = 5.169925002 + 2 = 7.169925002.

                    The states of the table are:
