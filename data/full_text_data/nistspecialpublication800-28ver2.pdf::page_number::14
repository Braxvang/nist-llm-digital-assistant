                                                               GUIDELINES ON ACTIVE CONTENT AND MOBILE CODE



available request methods a browser can issue. Typical usage mainly involves retrieving information
from the server or submitting form input by issuing GET and POST methods, respectively.

Once the request is issued, the browser expects a response from the server containing a status code, meta-
information about the resource, the content corresponding to the resource requested (e.g., the Web page
specified by the URL), and an indication of content encoding. Five general classes of response exist, as
indicated by the first digit of the status code. For example, most computer users have received a 400
series code, the 404 code, at one time or another when unsuccessfully attempting to reach a resource at
some site. Appendix B contains a brief summary of the classes of status code returned by a server.

The representation of a resource such as a Web page involves control codes, normally referred to as tags,
and data. Browsers interpret control codes within Web pages, which indicate the structure of the data
(e.g., beginning of item, end of item) and the way to render it (e.g., heading, subheading, paragraph, list,
embedded image). The codes may also embed URLs of additional information such as images, which
entail further requests to the server to retrieve the information and complete the Web page. The control
codes are the subject of intense standardization and include specifications for HTML [HTML4], Cascaded
Style Sheets (CSS) [CSS1, CSS2], and the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) [XML1]. Browsers are
designed to read such codes, interpret their meaning, and render the Web page accordingly.

Browsers inherently involve many different program components, both internal and external. Figure 2-1
illustrates common components found in most browsers [Gro05]. The component layering illustrated is
only for discussion purposes and not meant to imply any structural relationship. Essential core
components present in all browsers include a basic protocol machine for HTTP and other supported
protocols; a means to navigate forward and back, reload content, and maintain history; a parser for HTML
and style sheets; and a mechanism to layout and render content. The remaining components represent
mechanisms that handle other forms of content. To some extent, the specific choices depend on the
browser manufacturer. However, competition and market demand influence manufacturers to offer
components having comparable functionality with a high degree of compatibility and uniformity.
Interpreters for scripting languages (e.g., JavaScript, Visual Basic Script, and JScript) are a useful means
of processing instructions conveyed from the server by the browser. Similarly, environmental
components for Java, ActiveX, and Plug-in technology allow other types of code to be executed at the
browser. Further details about these technologies are given in Section 4.
