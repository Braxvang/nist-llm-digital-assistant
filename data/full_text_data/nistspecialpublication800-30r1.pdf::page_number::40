IDENTIFY THREAT EVENTS
TASK 2-2: Identify potential threat events, relevance of the events, and the threat sources that could initiate
the events.
Supplemental Guidance: Threat events are characterized by the threat sources that could initiate the events, and for
adversarial events, the TTPs used to carry out attacks. Organizations define these threat events with sufficient detail to
accomplish the purpose of the risk assessment. At Tier 1, threat events that could affect the organizational level are of
particular interest. At Tier 2, threat events that cross or span information system boundaries, exploit functional
dependencies or connectivity among systems, or affect mission/business owners, are of particular interest. At Tier 3,
threat events that can be described in terms of specific information systems, technologies, or environments of operation
are of particular interest. Multiple threat sources can initiate a single threat event. Conversely, a single threat source can
potentially initiate any of multiple threat events. Therefore, there can be a many-to-many relationship among threat
events and threat sources that can potentially increase the complexity of the risk assessment. To enable effective use
and communication of risk assessment results, organizations tailor the general descriptions of threat events in Tables E-
2 and E-3 to identify how each event could potentially harm organizational operations (including mission, functions,
image, or reputation) and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation. For each threat event identified,
organizations determine the relevance of the event. Table E-4 provides a range of values for relevance of threat events.
The values selected by organizations have a direct linkage to organizational risk tolerance. The more risk averse, the
greater the range of values considered. Organizations accepting greater risk or having a greater risk tolerance are more
likely to require substantive evidence before giving serious consideration to threat events. If a threat event is deemed to
be irrelevant, no further consideration is given. For relevant threat events, organizations identify all potential threat
sources that could initiate the events. For use in Task 2-4, organizations can identify each pairing of threat source and
threat event separately since the likelihood of threat initiation and success could be different for each pairing.
Alternatively, organizations can identify the set of all possible threat sources that could potentially initiate a threat
event.
Appendix E provides a set of exemplary tables for use in identifying threat events:
• Table E-1 provides a set of exemplary inputs to the threat event identification task;
• Table E-2 provides representative examples of adversarial threat events expressed as TTPs;
• Table E-3 provides representative examples of non-adversarial threat events;
• Table E-4 provides exemplary values for the relevance of threat events to organizations; and
• Table E-5 provides a template for summarizing and documenting the results of threat event identification.
The information produced in Task 2-2 provides threat event inputs to the risk tables in Appendix I.



                                     Summary of Key Activities – Task 2-2

       •      Identify threat event inputs (see Table E-1, as tailored by the organization).
       •      Identify threat events (see Table E-2 for adversarial threat events and Table E-3 for non-
              adversarial threat events, as tailored by the organization); create or update Table E-5.
       •      Identify threat sources that could initiate the threat events (see Table D-7 and Table D-8, as
              tailored by the organization); update Table E-5.
       •      Assess the relevance of threat events to the organization (see Table E-4, as tailored by the
              organization); update Table E-5.
       •      Update Columns 1-6 in Table I-5 for adversarial risk (see Table E-5 and Table D-7); or update
              Columns 1-4 in Table I-7 for non-adversarial risk (see Table E-5 and Table D-8).
