       NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                           Building a Cybersecurity and
       August 2023                                                                      Privacy Learning Program

1676   There are many techniques for disseminating cybersecurity and privacy awareness messages
1677   throughout an organization. Choosing those techniques depends on available resources and the
1678   complexity of the messages. Some techniques that are appropriate for a single message include
1679   posters, screensavers, warning banners, organization-wide emails, brown bag seminars, and
1680   awards programs. Techniques that can more easily include several messages or themes include
1681   “do and don’t” lists, email newsletters, web-based sessions, teleconferencing sessions, in-person
1682   instructor-led sessions, and email signature messaging. Examples of awareness material can be
1683   viewed on the Federal Information Security Educators (FISSEA) website 12 under Contests for
1684   Awareness and Training.
1685   Additional considerations when developing the All User Learning Program:
1686           •     What does the organization want all personnel to be aware of regarding cybersecurity and
1687                 privacy? Starting points may include a review of the latest top risks to the organization,
1688                 as reported by the information security or privacy office; common risks reported by
1689                 cybersecurity and privacy organizations; and new mission goals with cybersecurity or
1690                 privacy implications. Evaluating organizational policies, program reviews, internal
1691                 audits, internal controls program reviews, self-assessments, and spot-checks can also help
1692                 Learning Program Managers identify additional topics to address.
1693           •     Were constraints found in the Analysis? For example, does the organization have
1694                 particular issues with delivering a Learning Program to personnel? Will personnel be able
1695                 to access or attend training by a particular required date to achieve completion? Are some
1696                 personnel working remotely, traveling, located overseas, or require reasonable
1697                 accommodations? Consider what additional steps will be needed to ensure that all
1698                 personnel can participate in the All User Learning Program and fulfill their Learning
1699                 Program obligations.

1700   4.1.3. Developing a Privileged Users Learning Program
1701   The steps for this phase are similar to developing the All Users Learning Program. Create a
1702   Requirements Document that aligns learning goals for this audience with available funding as
1703   well as organizational requirements.
1704   Additional considerations for Developing the Privileged User Learning Program:
1705           •     What do we want privileged users to be aware of regarding cybersecurity and privacy?
1706           •     What procedures do personnel need to follow to adequately protect their privileged
1707                 accounts?
1708   Some starting points include understanding the rights and privileges allotted to this group,
1709   reviewing the risks related to privileged accounts or the systems or applications associated with
1710   privileged access, reviewing these issues with the CIO or CISO’s office, and aligning learning
1711   goals for these risks to the available budget for impacted personnel and departments. Evaluating
1712   organizational policies, program reviews, internal audits, internal controls program reviews, self-
1713   assessments, and spot-checks can also help Learning Program Managers identify additional
1714   topics to address.
