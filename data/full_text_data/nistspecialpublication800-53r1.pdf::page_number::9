Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1                 Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


•    Plans for providing adequate information security for networks, facilities, information
     systems, or groups of information systems, as appropriate;
•    Security awareness training to inform personnel (including contractors and other users of
     information systems that support the operations and assets of the organization) of the
     information security risks associated with their activities and their responsibilities in
     complying with organizational policies and procedures designed to reduce these risks;
•    Periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information security policies,
     procedures, practices, and security controls to be performed with a frequency depending on
     risk, but no less than annually;
•    A process for planning, implementing, evaluating, and documenting remedial actions to
     address any deficiencies in the information security policies, procedures, and practices of the
     organization;
•    Procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents; and
•    Plans and procedures for continuity of operations for information systems that support the
     operations and assets of the organization.

It is of paramount importance that responsible officials within the organization understand the
risks and other factors that could adversely affect organizational operations, organizational assets,
or individuals. Moreover, these officials must understand the current status of their security
programs and the security controls planned or in place to protect their information systems in
order to make informed judgments and investments that appropriately mitigate risks to an
acceptable level. The ultimate objective is to conduct the day-to-day operations of the
organization and to accomplish the organization’s stated mission(s) with what the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130 defines as adequate security, or security
commensurate with risk, including the magnitude of harm to individuals, the organization, or its
assets resulting from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or
destruction of information.

1.1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
The purpose of this publication is to provide guidelines for selecting and specifying security
controls for information systems supporting the executive agencies of the federal government.
The guidelines apply to all components 7 of an information system that process, store, or transmit
federal information. The guidelines have been developed to help achieve more secure
information systems within the federal government by:
•    Facilitating a more consistent, comparable, and repeatable approach for selecting and
     specifying security controls for information systems;
•    Providing a recommendation for minimum security controls for information systems
     categorized in accordance with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199,
     Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems;

 Information system components include, but are not limited to, mainframes, servers, workstations, network
components, operating systems, middleware, and applications. Network components can include, for example, such
devices as firewalls, sensors (local or remote), switches, guards, routers, gateways, wireless access points, and network
appliances. Servers can include, for example, database servers, authentication servers, electronic mail and web servers,
proxy servers, domain name servers, and network time servers. Information system components are either purchased
commercially off-the-shelf or are custom-developed and can be deployed in land-based, sea-based, airborne, and/or
space-based information systems.
