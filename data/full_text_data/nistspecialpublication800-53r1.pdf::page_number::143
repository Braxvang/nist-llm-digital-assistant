SI-7      SOFTWARE AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY

          Control: The information system detects and protects against unauthorized changes to software and
          information.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization employs integrity verification applications on the
          information system to look for evidence of information tampering, errors, and omissions. The
          organization employs good software engineering practices with regard to commercial off-the-shelf
          integrity mechanisms (e.g., parity checks, cyclical redundancy checks, cryptographic hashes) and
          uses tools to automatically monitor the integrity of the information system and the applications it
          hosts.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization reassesses the integrity of software and information by performing [Assignment:
                organization-defined frequency] integrity scans of the system.
          (2)   The organization employs automated tools that provide notification to appropriate individuals upon
                discovering discrepancies during integrity verification.
          (3)   The organization employs centrally managed integrity verification tools.

SI-8      SPAM PROTECTION

          Control: The information system implements spam protection.

          Supplemental Guidance: The organization employs spam protection mechanisms at critical
          information system entry points (e.g., firewalls, electronic mail servers, remote-access servers) and
          at workstations, servers, or mobile computing devices on the network. The organization uses the
          spam protection mechanisms to detect and take appropriate action on unsolicited messages
          transported by electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, Internet accesses, or other common
          means. Consideration is given to using spam protection software products from multiple vendors
          (e.g., using one vendor for boundary devices and servers and another vendor for workstations).
          NIST Special Publication 800-45 provides guidance on electronic mail security.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization centrally manages spam protection mechanisms.
          (2)   The information system automatically updates spam protection mechanisms.
