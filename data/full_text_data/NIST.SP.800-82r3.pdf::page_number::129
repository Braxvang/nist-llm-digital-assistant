NIST SP 800-82r3                                              Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

            (SDLC) approach to document, test, and approve changes before
            deploying them to the OT environment.
            Some organizations may maintain logbooks or other similar methods to
            document changes to OT components. Organizations should consider
            centralizing the tracking and documentation of changes to the OT
            environment to improve visibility and ensure proper testing and
            approvals for system changes. Such a process may help organizations to
            prevent accidental reconfiguration or identify the intentional
            reconfiguration of components to unapproved or untested versions.
            If the use of automated configuration management tools are deemed to
            be appropriate, processes should be in place to validate configurations
            prior to deployment. Many changes to OT can be made only during
            scheduled maintenance downtimes to minimize impacts. When
            considering automated configuration management tools, organizations
            should also consider potential impacts to the OT system. In some cases,
            these tools transfer numerous types and potentially large amounts of data
            over the manufacturing system network. Additionally, some tools may
            also have the potential to impact OT system operations by attempting to
            change device configurations or manipulating active files.

6.2.4.3.       Backups (PR.IP-4)
Conducting, maintaining, and testing backups is a critical outcome for the recovery process if a
cyber or reliability incident occurs.
Supplemental guidance for determining the priority and strategy for backups can be found in the
following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-34, Rev. 1, Contingency Planning Guide for Federal Information Systems
   •   NIST SP 800-209, Security Guidelines for Storage Infrastructure
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            A list of all maintained backups should be developed, including
            installation media, license keys, and configuration information.
            Additional measures should be taken to ensure that backups are readily
            available when needed, such as:
                   •   Verify the backups for reliability and integrity (if technically
                       possible).
                   •   Establish an on-site location for backups that is accessible to all
                       personnel who may need access during a recovery event.
                   •   Establish an alternate secondary storage location for additional
                       copies of backups to ensure that the same incident that disrupts
                       the primary data cannot modify or destroy the backup (e.g., store
                       PLC logic and configuration files at an off-site, geographically
