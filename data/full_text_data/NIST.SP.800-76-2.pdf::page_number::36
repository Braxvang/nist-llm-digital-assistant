NORMATIVE NOTE:
1. If any captured iris has diameter outside of the range [160,280] pixels, see Section 6.7.1.3.

6.5     Conformance of ISO/IEC 19794-6:2011 records
For the standard records of sections 6.3 and 6.4, implementers may wish to download the NIST-developed
conformance test suites [BIOCTS] which include provision for testing of the ISO/IEC 19794-6:2011 PIV records. The
source code for these CTSs is also available for download. The software for testing the syntactic correctness of these
records exists in two forms: One runs under a conformance testing architecture; the other can be compiled and run in
standalone applications. The former can test single-instances or been run in batch mode.

6.6     Iris image quality control
Agencies electing to store iris on PIV Cards should require PIV Applicants to:
1.    Remove eyeglasses, hard contact lenses, or patterned contact lenses during initial enrollment;
2.    Perform a one-to-one verification of a newly captured iris image with the image that is, or will be stored, on the
      Card. If this authentication fails, the client software shall recapture an image and repeat the matching procedure.
      The camera and associated software might collect several images and cross match them.
Additionally, agencies might train their operators in how to collect iris images: NIST has made available several
documentary materials to support proficient collection and review of iris enrollments [IREX-V]. In any case the
attending operator should:
―     Instruct the PIV Cardholder to open their eyes widely, remain still and look into the camera as designed;
―     Inspect captured images to verify that the eyes are open, not blurred, looking toward the camera, and that the
      iris is centered.
Automated quality control software is available also [IREX-II, IRISQUAL].

6.7     Performance specifications for PIV compliance
The core cross-provider interoperability specification is supported by establishing requirements on components
preparing and matching [IRISSTD] records as described in sub-sections 6.7.1 through 6.7.3.
