H.2.     Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition
The purpose of the Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition process is to define the
stakeholder requirements for a system that can provide the capabilities needed by users and other
stakeholders in a defined environment.

H.2.1. Security Purpose
-   Identify the protection needs associated with the stakeholder needs and requirements for a
    system that can protect the capabilities needed by users and other stakeholders in a defined
    environment.

H.2.2. Security Outcomes
-   Security-relevant stakeholders of the system are identified.
-   Security concerns of stakeholders are identified.
-   Required characteristics and context for the secure use of capabilities for system life cycle
    concepts in system life cycle stages are defined.
-   Stakeholder assets and asset classes are identified.
-   Adversities presented by the environment are characterized.
-   Asset protection priorities are determined.
-   Stakeholder protection needs are defined.
-   Security-driven and security-informed constraints on a system are identified.
-   Prioritized stakeholder protection needs are transformed into stakeholder requirements.
-   Security-oriented performance measures and quality characteristics are defined.
-   Stakeholder agreement that their protection needs and expectations are adequately reflected
    in the requirements is achieved.
-   Enabling systems or services needed for the security aspects of stakeholder needs and
    requirements definition are available.
-   Traceability of stakeholder requirements to stakeholders and their protection needs is
    established.

H.2.3. Security Activities and Tasks
