449   Privacy Learning Programs are most effective when they help the workforce understand both the
450   direct impacts that organizational activities can have on individuals and the resulting impacts that
451   privacy risks can have on the organization. For example, the program can address the types of
452   impacts that an individual may experience from the loss of personal information (e.g., identity
453   theft) and the resulting consequences to the organization (e.g., costs associated with a data
454   breach, such as providing credit monitoring to customers, loss of trust in the organization, or
455   decline in value of stock share price).

456          Coordinating Cybersecurity and Privacy Learning Efforts
457   An organizationâ€™s CPLP should coordinate with the cybersecurity and privacy program(s). As
458   discussed in Section 1.4, cybersecurity and privacy risk management practices may overlap with
459   learning needs. With limited resources, duplicating efforts will negatively affect one or both
460   programs. In cases with an integrated cybersecurity and privacy program, this is less likely to be
461   an issue.

463          Roles and Responsibility
464   While it is important to understand the policies that require agencies to develop and implement
465   CPLPs, it is also crucial that organizations understand who has responsibility for cybersecurity
466   and privacy learning. This section identifies and describes those within an organization who are
467   responsible for ensuring that the workforce has access to and completes their cybersecurity and
468   privacy learning.
469   It may be useful to refer to related NIST Special Publications for consistent references to the
470   crucial roles in an organization that have a vested interest in the implementation of a robust
471   CPLP. NIST SP 800-37 [7] identifies the typical roles associated with these programs. Since
472   terminology may vary by organization, it can be useful to refer to the NICE Framework as a
473   complementary tool for identifying those with responsibilities for managing the CPLP as well as
474   those who require additional training.
