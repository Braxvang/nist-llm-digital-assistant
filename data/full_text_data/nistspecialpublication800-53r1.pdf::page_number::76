AU-6      AUDIT MONITORING, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING

          Control: The organization regularly reviews/analyzes information system audit records for
          indications of inappropriate or unusual activity, investigates suspicious activity or suspected
          violations, reports findings to appropriate officials, and takes necessary actions.
          Supplemental Guidance: Organizations increase the level of audit monitoring and analysis activity
          within the information system whenever there is an indication of increased risk to organizational
          operations, organizational assets, or individuals based on law enforcement information,
          intelligence information, or other credible sources of information.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to integrate audit monitoring, analysis, and
                reporting into an overall process for investigation and response to suspicious activities.
          (2)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to alert security personnel of the following
                inappropriate or unusual activities with security implications: [Assignment: organization-defined
                list of inappropriate or unusual activities that are to result in alerts].


           LOW Not Selected              MOD AU-6 (2)                HIGH AU-6 (1) (2)



AU-7      AUDIT REDUCTION AND REPORT GENERATION

          Control: The information system provides an audit reduction and report generation capability.

          Supplemental Guidance: Audit reduction, review, and reporting tools support after-the-fact
          investigations of security incidents without altering original audit records.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system provides the capability to automatically process audit records for events
                of interest based upon selectable, event criteria.


           LOW Not Selected              MOD AU-7 (1)                HIGH AU-7 (1)



AU-8      TIME STAMPS

          Control: The information system provides time stamps for use in audit record generation.

          Supplemental Guidance: Time stamps (including date and time) of audit records are generated using
          internal system clocks.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization synchronizes internal information system clocks [Assignment: organization-
                defined frequency].


           LOW AU-8                      MOD AU-8 (1)                HIGH AU-8 (1)
