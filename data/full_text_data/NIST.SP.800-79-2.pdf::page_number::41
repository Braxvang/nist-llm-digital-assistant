Special Publication 800-79-2                             Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



                 Subtask 1.1: Confirm that the operations of the issuer have been fully described
                 and documented in their operations plan.
                 Responsibility: OIMO
                 Guidance: The operation plan includes, at a minimum, the sections defined in the
                 operations plan template in Appendices D.1 or D.2 depending on whether the
                 issuer is issuing PIV Cards or Derived PIV Credentials. An issuer of both PIV
                 Cards and Derived PIV Credentials may develop a single operations plan that
                 addresses both without repeating common elements. It is the OIMO’s
                 responsibility to ensure that the organization’s operations plan incorporates a
                 complete and accurate description of the issuer’s operations. If a process or
                 function is provided by an external service provider, their operating procedures
                 should be documented and incorporated by reference in the issuer’s operations
                 plan. In this case, the operations plan includes a pointer, guiding the reader to
                 additional documentation and information.

                 Subtask 1.2: Confirm that processes performed are conducted in accordance
                 with the policies and procedures specified in the issuer’s operations plan and are
                 documented in standard operating procedures.
                 Responsibility: OIMO, Issuing Facility Manager
                 Guidance: Even though an issuer may be following requirements from FIPS
                 201-2, their processes need to be consistent within their operations plan and
                 documented in standard operating procedures.

        Task 2: Resource Identification
The objectives of the resource identification task are to– (i) identify and document the resources
required for assisting with the assessment; (ii) identify the scope of the assessment and
authorization boundary; and (iii) prepare a plan of assessment activities indicating the proposed
schedule and key milestones.

                 Subtask 2.1: Identify the Senior Authorizing Official (SAO), Designated
                 Authorizing Official (DAO), Privacy Official (PO), Issuing Facility Managers,
                 Assessor, and other key personnel at the facility level who are performing
                 functions, such as identity proofing/registration, card production, and
                 activation/issuance. Maintenance personnel also should be contacted to provide
                 requested assessment information to the Assessor.
                 Responsibility: OIMO
                 Guidance: Notify these individuals of the upcoming assessment, and inform
                 them of the need for their participation during the process.

                 Subtask 2.2: Determine the authorization boundary for the issuer.
                 Responsibility: OIMO; DAO
                 Guidance: The authorization boundary determines the target of the assessment.
                 In preparation for the issuer assessment, the OIMO and DAO should identify
                 which issuing facilities and external service providers are to be included. This
