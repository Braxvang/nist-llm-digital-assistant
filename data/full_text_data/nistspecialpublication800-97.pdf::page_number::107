                                                     cryptography, which is expected to be the case in nearly all

                                                     PKI and may not be applicable in environments that use the
                                                     PKI services of a third party. 104
                                                     Two-factor authentication enhances the strength of the
                                                     authentication procedure, making it less likely that
                                                     adversaries will successfully exploit it. Two-factor
                                                     authentication could include use of biometrics or smart
                                                     cards, which could significantly increase the cost of the
                                                     WLAN solution. Organizations should weigh the costs and

                                                     devices whose credentials cannot be re-used require re-
                                                     authentication when roaming from one AP to another; this
                                                     makes this approach cumbersome and potentially unusable.
                                                     In cases in which two-factor authentication is determined to
                                                     be unnecessary for users, it should still be considered for
                                                     administrative connections to WLAN infrastructure.
