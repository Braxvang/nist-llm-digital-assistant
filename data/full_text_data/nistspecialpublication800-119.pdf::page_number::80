                                                                GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


The goals set by those specifying MIPv6 security have been to address the most serious security
vulnerabilities first, to use existing security methods where they fit and can be deployed easily, to avoid
introducing new vulnerabilities, and, as a last resort, to design new security methods where necessary.

Attacks clearly exist if someone can forge or modify any of the main MIPv6 messages:

   BU between MN and HA

   BU between MN and CN

   IPv6 Routing and Mobility Headers

   IPv6 Home Address and Alternate CoA options
The most serious new vulnerabilities introduced with MIPv6 involve BUs. Many of these can lead to
Denial of Service (DOS) of one type or another. It is possible to starve the MN or to flood another host.
Beyond DOS, attacks on these protocol messages may attempt connection hijacking, eavesdropping, or
other variations of man-in-the-middle or impersonation.

A forged BU between a MN and its HA may be sent by another legitimate MN or any other party. Such
an attack can be prevented if the MN is forced to show ―ownership‖ of its HoA, and this can usually be
arranged through the on-going relationship a MN has with its HA.

On the other hand, a bogus BU between a MN and CN presents a more challenging problem, because a
prior relationship between a MN and CN is less likely to exist, and in any case, protocol designers cannot
count on their having one. This attack can be used to redirect traffic between any pair of hosts. For
example, suppose Alice is communicating with Bob. Eve sends Bob a BU that Alice’s new CoA is Eve’s
address. Alice does not have to be mobile to make this work—Bob does not know. It may be possible to
play this attack ahead of time, so that it takes effect when Alice and Bob communicate later. Conversely,
this attack can be turned around into a DOS attack against Eve.

BUs, however, are not the only vulnerability in MIPv6. Attacks on prefix propagation and HA discovery
are possible. Spoofing an ICMPv6 Mobile Prefix Solicitation (MPS) or Mobile Prefix Advertisement
(MPA) can break HA-MN connectivity, and merely eavesdropping on these messages can reveal
addressing and topology information about the Home Link.

The ICMPv6 Home Agent Discovery is sent to the HA anycast address on the Home Link. Both this and
the ICMPv6 Home Agent Reply are unprotected.

Other attacks include many denial-of-service opportunities, for example:

   Inducing extra BUs with bogus CNs. Although no satisfactory defense exists, route optimization is
    optional, and the tradeoff is to risk suboptimal routing. A MN can be selective about route
    optimization.

   Preventing a legitimate BU from completing while sending a bogus BU to a CN (where the attacker is
    on the same link as the victim)

   Reflection attacks, whereby the victim’s address is forged as the source, so that the victim is flooded
    with replies

   Replaying old route optimization BUs, especially if sequence numbers are unreliable because of
    crashes or rollover
