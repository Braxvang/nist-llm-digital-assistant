                                          TABLE E-4: RELEVANCE OF THREAT EVENTS


   Value                                                                  Description

  Confirmed     The threat event or TTP has been seen by the organization.
   Expected     The threat event or TTP has been seen by the organization’s peers or partners.
  Anticipated   The threat event or TTP has been reported by a trusted source.
  Predicted     The threat event or TTP has been predicted by a trusted source.
   Possible     The threat event or TTP has been described by a somewhat credible source.
     N/A        The threat event or TTP is not currently applicable. For example, a threat event or TTP could assume specific technologies,
                architectures, or processes that are not present in the organization, mission/business process, EA segment, or information
                system; or predisposing conditions that are not present (e.g., location in a flood plain). Alternately, if the organization is using
                detailed or specific threat information, a threat event or TTP could be deemed inapplicable because information indicates that
                no adversary is expected to initiate the threat event or use the TTP.
