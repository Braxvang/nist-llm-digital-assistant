established for the program. Once the baseline requirements have been solidified, a feedback strategy can
be designed and implemented. Figure 6-2 shows various evaluation and feedback mechanisms that can be
used to update the awareness and training program plan.21

A feedback strategy needs to incorporate elements that will address quality, scope, deployment method
(e.g., web-based, onsite, offsite), level of difficulty, ease of use, duration of session, relevancy, currency,
and suggestions for modification.

Many methods can be applied to solicit feedback. The most common include:

    Evaluation Forms/Questionnaires – A variety of formats can be used. The best designs eliminate
     the need for a lot of writing on the part of the person completing them. The key is to design the forms
     to be as “user friendly” as possible. Work with the in-house experts who are familiar with the best
     techniques for designing these evaluation instruments or seek the assistance of outside experts.
    Focus Groups – Bring subjects of the training together in open forums to discuss their perspectives
     on the IT security training program effectiveness and solicit their ideas for improvement.
    Selective Interviews – This approach first identifies training target groups based on impact, priority,
     or other established criteria and identifies specific areas for feedback. Normally conducted using one-
     on-one interviews or in small homogeneous groupings (usually ten or less), this approach is more

     The awareness and training program plan represents the results of the design phase of the awareness and training program.
     The design phase is the first of the four major phases (i.e., design the program, develop material, implement the program,
     maintain the program) in the life cycle of an awareness and training program. Evaluation and feedback techniques can
     provide insights that should result in an update of the awareness and training program plan. As subsequent needs
     assessments are performed, it will be important to consider the insights gained from evaluation and feedback techniques, as
     a needs assessment helps an organization determine its awareness and training program plan.
