       December 2022                                                         Federation and Assertions


1286   assertion creates an authenticated session at the RP. After the IdP creates the assertion,
1287   the validity of the IdP’s session is independent of the validity of the assertion. If a request
1288   comes to the IdP for a repeated authentication while the session is still valid at the IdP,
1289   this results in a new and separate assertion being created with its own validity time
1290   window. Similarly, after the RP consumes the assertion, the validity of the RP’s session is
1291   independent of the validity of the assertion. Access granted to an identity API is likewise
1292   independent of the validity of the assertion or the lifetime of the authenticated session at
1293   the RP. See Sec. 5.3 for more information on session management.
1294   The assertion’s validity time window is the time between its issuance and its expiration.
1295   This window needs to be large enough to allow the RP to process the assertion and create
1296   a local application session for the subscriber, but should not be longer than necessary
1297   for such establishment. Long-lived assertions have a greater risk of being stolen or
1298   replayed; a short assertion validity time window mitigates this risk. Assertion validity
1299   time windows SHALL NOT be used to limit the session at the RP. See Sec. 5.3 for more
1300   information.

1301   6.1. Assertion Binding
1302   Assertion binding can be classified based on whether presentation by a claimant of an
1303   assertion is sufficient for binding to the party currently in session with the RP as the
1304   subscriber, or if the RP requires additional proof through the successful presentation of an
1305   authenticator bound to the subscriber.

1306   6.1.1. Bearer Assertions
1307   A bearer assertion can be presented by any party as proof of the bearer’s identity.
1308   Similarly, a bearer assertion reference can be presented by any party to the RP and used
1309   by the RP to fetch an assertion; the assertion in this instance is also considered a bearer
1310   assertion. If an attacker can capture or manufacture a valid assertion or assertion reference
1311   representing a subscriber and can successfully present that assertion or reference to the
1312   RP, then the attacker could be able to impersonate the subscriber at that RP.
1313   Note that mere possession of a bearer assertion or reference is not always enough to
1314   impersonate a subscriber. For example, if an assertion is presented in the back-channel
1315   federation model (described in Sec. 7.1), additional controls MAY be placed on the
1316   transaction (such as identification of the RP and assertion injection protections) that help
1317   further protect the RP from fraudulent activity.

1318   6.1.2. Bound Authenticators
1319   A bound authenticator is an authenticator presented to the RP by the subscriber alongside
1320   the assertion. In proving possession of the bound authenticator to the RP, the subscriber
1321   also proves with a certain degree of assurance that they are the rightful subject of the
1322   assertion. It is more difficult for an attacker to use a stolen assertion issued to a subscriber
