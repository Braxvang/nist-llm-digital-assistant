easier, the best remedy is to build a team of highly experienced and proficient staff members who can
analyze the precursors and indicators effectively and efficiently and take appropriate actions. Without a
well-trained and capable staff, incident detection and analysis will be conducted inefficiently, and costly
mistakes will be made.

The incident response team should work quickly to analyze and validate each incident, following a pre-
defined process and documenting each step taken. When the team believes that an incident has occurred,
the team should rapidly perform an initial analysis to determine the incident’s scope, such as which
networks, systems, or applications are affected; who or what originated the incident; and how the incident
is occurring (e.g., what tools or attack methods are being used, what vulnerabilities are being exploited).
The initial analysis should provide enough information for the team to prioritize subsequent activities,
such as containment of the incident and deeper analysis of the effects of the incident.

Performing the initial analysis and validation is challenging. The following are recommendations for
making incident analysis easier and more effective:

 Profile Networks and Systems. Profiling is measuring the characteristics of expected activity so that
  changes to it can be more easily identified. Examples of profiling are running file integrity checking
  software on hosts to derive checksums for critical files and monitoring network bandwidth usage to
  determine what the average and peak usage levels are on various days and times. In practice, it is
  difficult to detect incidents accurately using most profiling techniques; organizations should use
  profiling as one of several detection and analysis techniques.
 Understand Normal Behaviors. Incident response team members should study networks, systems,
  and applications to understand what their normal behavior is so that abnormal behavior can be
  recognized more easily. No incident handler will have a comprehensive knowledge of all behavior
  throughout the environment, but handlers should know which experts could fill in the gaps. One way
  to gain this knowledge is through reviewing log entries and security alerts. This may be tedious if
  filtering is not used to condense the logs to a reasonable size. As handlers become more familiar with
  the logs and alerts, they should be able to focus on unexplained entries, which are usually more
  important to investigate. Conducting frequent log reviews should keep the knowledge fresh, and the
  analyst should be able to notice trends and changes over time. The reviews also give the analyst an
  indication of the reliability of each source.
 Create a Log Retention Policy. Information regarding an incident may be recorded in several places,
  such as firewall, IDPS, and application logs. Creating and implementing a log retention policy that
  specifies how long log data should be maintained may be extremely helpful in analysis because older
  log entries may show reconnaissance activity or previous instances of similar attacks. Another reason
  for retaining logs is that incidents may not be discovered until days, weeks, or even months later. The
  length of time to maintain log data is dependent on several factors, including the organization’s data
  retention policies and the volume of data. See NIST SP 800-92, Guide to Computer Security Log
  Management for additional recommendations related to logging.34
 Perform Event Correlation. Evidence of an incident may be captured in several logs that each
  contain different types of data—a firewall log may have the source IP address that was used, whereas
  an application log may contain a username. A network IDPS may detect that an attack was launched
  against a particular host, but it may not know if the attack was successful. The analyst may need to
  examine the host’s logs to determine that information. Correlating events among multiple indicator
  sources can be invaluable in validating whether a particular incident occurred.
