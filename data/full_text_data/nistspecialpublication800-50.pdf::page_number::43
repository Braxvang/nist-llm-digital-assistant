program budget, or if their budgets will be impacted to cover their share of the expense of implementing
the program. It is essential that everyone involved in the implementation of the program understand their
roles and responsibilities. In addition, schedules and completion requirements must be communicated.

Communication of the plan can be mapped to the three implementation models discussed in Section 3.
Typical scenarios follow.

     Centralized Program Model Communication Scenario: In this model, the CIO and/or IT security
      program manager develop all agency IT security awareness and training policy, develop the strategy
      and program plan, and implement the program. Therefore, all necessary funding for material
      development and implementation is controlled and provided by the CIO and IT security program
      manager. By the time the program is to be implemented, they have conducted the needs assessment,
      developed the training plan, and developed the awareness and training material. The CIO and/or IT
      security program manager should brief the agency head and senior management on the
      implementation plan and get approval to communicate it throughout the agency. Once the
      implementation plan is approved, the CIO and/or IT security program manager should communicate
      the plan to organizational unit management, providing the schedule for awareness and training
      offerings, and allocating slots in each session, where applicable, for each unit. The organizational
      unit managers should then communicate the plan to their staff, identify the awareness and training
      required, schedule attendees, and submit their nominations for each offering to the CIO or IT security
      program manager as required.
     Partially Decentralized Program Model Communication Scenario: In this model, the CIO and/or
      the IT security program manager develop all agency IT security awareness and training policy and
      develop the strategy. They also conduct the needs assessment, from which the strategy is derived.
      Organizational unit managers are then given an awareness and training budget, develop training plans
      for their own unit, and implement the program. They should provide status reports to the CIO and/or
      IT security program manager as required.
     Decentralized Program Model Communication Scenario: In this model, the CIO and/or IT
      security program manager disseminate broad policy and expectations regarding the IT security
      awareness and training program. Execution of the remainder of the program is the responsibility of
      the organizational units. The organizational unit managers are expected to conduct a needs
      assessment, formulate a strategy, develop a training plan, develop awareness and training material,
      and implement the awareness and training program. They should provide status reports to the CIO
      and/or IT security program manager as required.
Once the plan for implementing the awareness and training program has been explained to (and accepted
by) agency management, the implementation can begin. There are a number of ways that awareness
material and messages can be presented and disseminated throughout an organization.

5.2     Techniques for Delivering Awareness Material

Many techniques exist to get an IT security awareness message, or a series of messages, disseminated
throughout an agency. The technique(s) chosen depend upon resources and the complexity of the
message(s).

Techniques an agency may consider include, but are not limited to:

     Messages on awareness tools (e.g., pens, key fobs, post-it notes, notepads, first aid kits, clean-up kits,
      diskettes with a message, bookmarks, Frisbees, clocks, “gotcha” cards)
