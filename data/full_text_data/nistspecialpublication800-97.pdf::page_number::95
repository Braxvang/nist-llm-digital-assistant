                                    ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



TLS-based methods such as EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, PEAP, and EAP-FAST provide more robust
alternatives that can satisfy these requirements. The primary distinction between them is the level of PKI
support required. EAP-TLS requires both STAs and ASs to possess valid certificates. EAP-TTLS and
PEAP can support configurations with AS certificates only. EAP-FAST can support EAP authentication
with certificates or, alternatively, with no certificates, instead using PACs, a type of pre-shared keys.
Before organizations select WLAN equipment, they should review their existing identity management
infrastructure, authentication requirements, and security policy to determine the EAP method or methods
that are most appropriate in their environment, then purchase systems that support the chosen EAP
methods.

Many EAP methods are currently defined only in IETF Internet-Drafts and thus are not yet official
standards. Organizations are encouraged to obtain the latest available information before making final
determinations on their IEEE 802.11 RSN authentication architecture and product procurement.
