NIST SP 800-125A REV. 1                                                      SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
                                                                         SERVER-BASED HYPERVISOR PLATFORMS

8. SECURITY RECOMMENDATION SUMMARY

 The hypervisor is a complex server class software that virtualizes hardware resources to enable the
 execution of multiple computing stacks (VMs) with heterogeneous OSs and multiple applications hosted
 within them. Secure configuration of the hypervisor, together with its physical host (i.e., hypervisor host
 or virtualized host), is collectively called the hypervisor platform and is needed to provide a safe platform
 for the execution of mission-critical applications.

 Since there are multiple ways by which an architecture of a hypervisor can be classified, the approach
 taken in this document is to identify the five baseline functions that a hypervisor performs, the tasks
 involved in each baseline function, the potential threats to secure execution of the task, and to express the
 countermeasures that provide assurance against exploitation of these threats in the form of security
 recommendations.

 Overall, twenty security recommendations are provided for secure deployment of hypervisors. All but two
 (HY-SR-1 and HY-SR-2) relate to the configuration of parameters of software modules in the hypervisor
 platform. These parameters include integrity metrics for software modules (e.g., device drivers and VM
 images), the setting of access controls (e.g., device access, VM image access, and VM administration),
 and the configuration of secure protocols (e.g., VM image server access and VM migration). The mapping
 of the security recommendations to a hypervisorâ€™s baseline functions is provided in Appendix B.

The trust model outlined in this document (refer to section 1.2) assumes that the hardware of the hypervisor
host is trusted. However, it must be mentioned that there have been reported case of attacks (e.g., side channel
attacks regarding some implicitly shared hardware resources such as CPU caches and Translation Lookaside
Buffers (TLB)). More recently published attacks concerning CPU-level performance optimizations (e.g.,
Spectre and Meltdown) also limit the assurance of trust on current hardware platforms used for hypervisor
deployment.
