GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



mail server services required and eliminate any known vulnerabilities through patches or upgrades. If the
installation program installs any unnecessary applications, services, or scripts, they should be removed
immediately after the installation process completes. Securing the mail server application would
generally include the following steps:

 Patch and upgrade the mail server application
 Remove or disable unnecessary services, applications, and sample content
 Configure mail server user authentication and access controls
 Configure mail server resource controls
 Test the security of the mail server application.
Organizations should consider the implementation of cryptographic technologies to protect user
authentication and email data.

Most standard email protocols default to unencrypted user authentication and send email data in the clear
(unencrypted). Sending this data in the clear may allow an attacker to easily compromise a user account
and/or intercept and alter unencrypted emails. At a minimum, most organizations should encrypt the user
authentication session even if they do not encrypt the email data itself. Encrypted user authentication is
now supported by most standard and proprietary mailbox protocols.

The issues involved with encrypted and signed email data are more complex. Encrypting and signing
email places a greater load on the organizationâ€™s network infrastructure, may complicate malware
scanning and email content filtering, and often requires significant administrative overhead. However, for
many organizations the benefits of email encryption and signatures will outweigh the costs.

Organizations should employ their network infrastructure to protect their mail server(s).

The network infrastructure (e.g., firewalls, routers, intrusion detection systems) that supports the mail
server plays a critical role in the security of the mail server. In most configurations, the network
infrastructure will be the first line of defense between the Internet and a mail server. Network design
alone, however, cannot protect a mail server. The frequency, sophistication, and variety of mail server
attacks perpetrated today support the idea that mail server security must be implemented through layered
and diverse protection mechanisms.

Organizations should ensure that the mail clients are deployed, configured, and used properly to
meet the security requirements of the organization.

In many respects, the client side of email represents a greater risk to security than the mail server.
Numerous issues need to be carefully considered and addressed to provide an appropriate level of security
for mail clients. Securely installing, configuring, and using mail client applications would generally
include the following steps:

 Patch and upgrade the mail client applications
 Configure mail client security features, such as disabling automatic opening of messages and enabling
  anti-spam and anti-phishing features
 Configure mailbox authentication and access
