4.3.6. Authorize
The Authorize step involves a management decision to authorize the operation of a system and
explicitly accept the risks to operations, assets, and individuals based on the implementation of
an agreed-upon set of controls. A new system is not placed into production or operation until the
system is authorized.
Table 11 provides additional details on applying the Authorize step to OT.
