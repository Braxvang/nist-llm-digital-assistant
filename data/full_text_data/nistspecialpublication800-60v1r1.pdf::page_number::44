Business Areas      “Business areas” separate government operations into high-level
                    categories relating to the purpose of government, the mechanisms the
                    government uses to achieve its purposes, the support functions necessary
                    to conduct government operations, and resource management functions
                    that support all areas of the government’s business. “Business areas” are
                    subdivided into “areas of operation” or “lines of business.” The
                    recommended information types provided in NIST SP 800-60 are
                    established from the “business areas” and “lines of business” from

Certification       A comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and
                    technical security controls in an information system, made in support of
                    security accreditation, to determine the extent to which the controls are
                    implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
                    outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the
                    system. [FIPS 200, NIST SP 800-37]
