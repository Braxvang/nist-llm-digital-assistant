       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                       Authentication and Lifecycle Management


1624   6.1.2. Post-Enrollment Binding
1625   6.1.2.1. Binding of an Additional Authenticator at Existing AAL
1626   With the exception of memorized secrets, CSPs and verifiers SHOULD encourage
1627   subscribers to maintain at least two valid authenticators of each factor that they will
1628   be using. For example, a subscriber who usually uses an OTP device as a physical
1629   authenticator MAY also be issued a number of look-up secret authenticators, or register
1630   a device for out-of-band authentication, in case the physical authenticator is lost, stolen,
1631   or damaged. See Sec. 6.1.2.3 for more information on replacement of memorized secret
1632   authenticators.
1633   Accordingly, CSPs SHOULD permit the binding of additional authenticators to a
1634   subscriber account. Before adding the new authenticator, the CSP SHALL first
1635   require the subscriber to authenticate at the AAL (or a higher AAL) at which the new
1636   authenticator will be used. A separate authentication using existing authenticators
1637    SHALL be performed following the request to bind a new authenticator, and SHALL
1638   be valid for 20 minutes. When an authenticator is added, the CSP SHOULD send a
1639   notification to the subscriber via a mechanism that is independent of the transaction
1640   binding the new authenticator (e.g., email to an address previously associated with the
1641   subscriber). The CSP MAY limit the number of authenticators that are bound in this
1642   manner.

1643   6.1.2.2. Adding an Additional Factor to a Single-Factor Subscriber Account
1644   If the subscriber account has only one authentication factor bound to it and an additional
1645   authenticator of a different authentication factor is to be added, the subscriber MAY
1646   request that the subscriber account be upgraded to AAL2.
1647   Before binding the new authenticator, the CSP SHALL require the subscriber to
1648   authenticate at AAL1. The CSP SHOULD send a notification of the event to the
1649   subscriber via a mechanism independent of the transaction binding the new authenticator
1650   (e.g., email to an address previously associated with the subscriber).

1651   6.1.2.3. Account Recovery
1652   The situation where a subscriber loses control of authenticators necessary to successfully
1653   authenticate is commonly referred to as account recovery.
1654   If a subscriber that has been identity proofed loses all authenticators necessary to
1655   complete authentication, that subscriber SHALL repeat the identity proofing process
1656   described in [SP800-63A]. If the CSP has retained information from the evidence used in
1657   the original identity proofing process (pursuant to a privacy risk assessment as described
1658   in [SP800-63A] Sec. 5.2.2) that is sufficient to perform verification of the subscriber and
1659   if that evidence is still valid, it MAY repeat only the verification portion of the identity
1660   proofing process as described in [SP800-63A].
