4.3.1   Design the Access Control Policy

After the organization determines what resources will be accessible and by whom, the next step is to
design the access control policy. The organization should base this policy on the organizational
requirements that were identified in the Identify Requirements phase. These requirements stipulate which
resources should be accessed by which groups or individuals. The access control policy could provide
additional requirements and make access to resources dependent on other characteristics such as the
authentication method used, computer type and location, and user identification.

The four major steps in designing an access control policy are as follows:

    1. List the resources that will be accessed through the SSL VPN. A resource is as specific as a
       single application on one server or as general as an enterprise-wide service such as email or all
       internal Web sites. Resources can be treated separately or grouped together. For example, one
       specific human resources application can be listed by itself or grouped with a collection of other
       human resources applications. A resource can be a member of more than one group, but grouping
       in this way should not be used extensively because security holes or other problems can be
       created. For example, if Application X is a member of Groups A and B, a user that is granted
       access to Group A but denied access to Group B may still have access to Application X.

    2. List the groups or users. An access control policy is much more manageable if users are
       assigned primarily to groups. A user can be a member of more than one group. For example, an
       executive is a member of the Executive and Employee groups, and a salesperson is a member of
       the Sales and Employee groups.

    3. List the conditions under which the resources should be accessible by the groups.
       Conditions are based on the ability of endpoint security controls to perform host integrity
       checking on the client hosts. Host integrity checking, which is discussed in more detail in Section
       4.3.2, involves performing checks on conditions, including the type of operating system on the
       client machine, the presence of a firewall or antivirus scanner, registry settings, authentication
       method used, and time of day. These conditions will help determine what resources are
       accessible by the user. For example, users logging in from an organization-managed host would
       have access to more resources than if they were to log in from a public system at an Internet caf√©.

    4. List how the VPN should be used to access the resources. As mentioned in Section 3.2, there
       are three main components to SSL VPNs: proxying, application translation, and network
       extension. Proxying is most often used to provide secure access to Web sites. Application
       translation uses proxying to translate an application into a format that is Web-enabled and
       accessible through a browser. Finally, network extension provides broad access to the internal
       network. The organization should decide how each resource should be accessed through the
       VPN. Proxying and application translation offer the most restrictive access because all
       communication takes place through the browser interface. Network extension is the easiest to use
       because users have full network access, but it should be used with discretion for this reason.

A limited type of network extension, port forwarding, is sometimes used instead of full network
extension. Port forwarding only creates tunnels for certain TCP or UDP ports instead of for all ports at
one time. For example, a port forwarding system might tunnel HTTP traffic but not DNS traffic, leaving
