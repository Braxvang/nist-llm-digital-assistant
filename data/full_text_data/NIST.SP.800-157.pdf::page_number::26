B.2       Derived PIV Application Token Command Interface

This appendix contains the technical specifications of the command interface to the Derived PIV
Application surfaced by the card edge of the Integrated Circuit Card (ICC) that represents the removable
hardware cryptographic token. The command interface for the Derived PIV Application shall implement
all of the card commands supported by the PIV Card Application as described in [SP800-73Part2] , which
include:

          SELECT

          GET DATA

          VERIFY

          CHANGE REFERENCE DATA

          RESET RETRY COUNTER

          GENERAL AUTHENTICATE

          PUT DATA

          GENERATE ASYMMETRIC KEY PAIR

The specifications for the token command interface shall be the same as the specifications for the
corresponding card edge commands for a PIV Card as described in [SP800-73Part2] , except for the
following deviations:

          References to “PIV Card Application” are replaced by “Derived PIV Application”

          References to the contactless interface are ignored

          References to “PIV Data Objects” are replaced by “Derived PIV Data Objects”

          References to “PIV Authentication Key” are replaced with “Derived PIV Authentication Key”

          The Derived PIV Application Password shall satisfy the criteria specified in Appendix B.2.1 of
           this document rather than Section 2.4.3 of [SP800-73Part2] .

          In Appendix A:

               o   References to “PIV Card Application Administrator” are replaced by “Derived PIV
                   Application Administrator”

               o   References to “Card Management Key” are replaced by “Derived PIV Token
                   Management Key”

The token platform shall support a default selected application. In other words, there shall be a currently
selected application immediately after a cold or warm reset. This application is the default selected
application. The default application may be the Derived PIV Application, or it may be another
application.
