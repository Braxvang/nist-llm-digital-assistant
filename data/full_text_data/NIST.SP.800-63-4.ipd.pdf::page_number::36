      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022


960   Organizations SHOULD adapt and modify this overall approach to meet organizational
961   processes, governance, and integration with enterprise risk management practices. At a
962   minimum, organizations SHALL ensure that each step is executed and the normative
963   mandates and outcomes of each step are completed and documented regardless of
964   operational approach and enabling tools.

965   5.1. Conduct Initial Impact Assessment
966   The purpose of the initial impact analysis is to identify the potential adverse impacts of
967   failures in identity proofing, authentication, and federation specific to an RP application
968   or service, yielding an initial set of assurance levels. Assessing these areas separately
969   allows organizations maximum flexibility in developing or acquiring a digital identity
970   service that best enables them to successfully deliver on mission objectives.
971   The impact assessment includes:
972       • Identifying impacted entities,
973       • Identifying a set of impact categories for which harms will be assessed,
974       • Identifying potential harms for each of the impact categories,
975       • Identifying the levels of impact those potential harms would inflict should failures
976         occur, and
977       • Assessing the impact of each type of failure (proofing, authentication, and
978         federation) and the resulting impact level to all affected entities.
979   The output of this assessment is a defined impact level — High, Moderate, or Low — for
980   each possible type of failure. This serves as the primary input to the initial assurance level
981   selection.

982   5.1.1. Identify Impacted Entities
983   When assessing impacts, an organization needs to determine the entities that will be
984   impacted by the application or transaction under consideration. As mentioned earlier
985   in this guideline, it is imperative to consider the impact on different entities resulting
986   from a failure of the digital identity system. Of particular importance is ensuring that the
987   potential impacts to individuals are considered alongside those of the enterprise.
988   Accordingly, impact assessments SHALL include individuals using the system or
989   application in addition to the organization itself. Additionally, organizations SHOULD
990   identify other entities, such as mission partners, communities, and those identified in
991   [SP800-30], that need to be specifically included based on mission and business needs.
992   At a minimum, agencies SHALL document all entities to which impacts will be assessed
993   when conducting their impact analysis.
994   The outcome of this activity is a list of entities subject to the application or transaction
995   under consideration for whom impacts will be assessed.
