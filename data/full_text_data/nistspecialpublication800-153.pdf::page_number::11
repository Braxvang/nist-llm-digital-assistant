                                             GUIDELINES FOR SECURING W IRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (WLANS)


As explained in Section 1.2, the recommendations presented in this section supplement those provided for
specific WLAN technologies by other NIST publications [SP800-48, SP800-97].

This section does not provide an exhaustive explanation of the entire security configuration lifecycle;
rather, it highlights a few topics of particular relevance to WLAN security. Section 2.1 discusses security
configuration design, while Section 2.2 focuses on security configuration implementation, evaluation, and
maintenance.

2.1     Configuration Design

Organizations should have standardized security configurations for their common WLAN components,
such as client devices and APs. A standardized configuration provides a base level of security, reducing
vulnerabilities and lessening the impact of successful attacks. Standardized configuration use improves
the consistency and predictability of security, in conjunction with user training and awareness activities
and other supporting security controls. Standardized configurations can also provide a large resource
savings by reducing the time needed to secure each WLAN device and to verify its configuration for
security assessments, audits, etc., particularly if the configuration can be deployed and verified through
automated means.

This section focuses on two noteworthy aspects of configuration design: gathering needs and designing
WLAN architectures.

2.1.1    Needs Gathering

Before designing a WLAN security architecture or WLAN component security configurations, an
organization should gather information on needs, particularly operational and security related ones. This
should include identifying relevant WLAN security requirements from applicable laws, policies,
regulations, etc. For Federal agencies, this often includes requirements from OMB, the Government
Accountability Office (GAO), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and other agencies. Another
part of needs gathering is identifying and reviewing recommended WLAN security practices from Federal
agencies (e.g., NIST Special Publications, DISA Security Technical Implementation Guides), WLAN
vendors, and other parties [NCP]. See Section 9 of [SP800-94] for examples of possible requirements to
include in needs gathering.

In addition to identifying these requirements and recommendations, organizations should also determine
what threats their WLAN security faces. Organizations should conduct risk assessments to identify the
threats against their WLANs and determine the effectiveness of existing security controls in counteracting
the threats; they then should perform risk mitigation to decide what additional measures (if any) should be
implemented, as discussed in [SP800-37]. Performing risk assessments and mitigation helps organizations
decide how their WLANs should be secured. See Section 3.1 for an overview of common WLAN threats.

2.1.2    WLAN Architecture

When planning WLAN security, configuration designers should consider the security not only of the
WLAN itself, but also how it may affect other networks that are accessible through it, such as internal
wired networks reachable from the WLAN. An important principle of WLAN security is to separate
WLANs with different security profiles. For example, there should be separate WLANs for external
(guest, etc.) and internal use. Devices on an organization’s external WLAN should not be able to connect
through that WLAN to devices on another of the organization’s WLANs. This helps to protect the
organization’s other networks and devices from external devices and users. Organizations often set up
external WLANs primarily to provide Internet access to visitors; such WLANs should be architected so
