2020   the processing (predictability). Other processing of attributes may carry different privacy
2021   risks that call for obtaining consent or allowing subscribers more control over the use
2022   or disclosure of specific attributes (manageability). Subscriber consent needs to be
2023   meaningful; therefore, as stated in Sec. 4.4, when CSPs use consent measures, acceptance
2024   by the subscriber of additional uses shall not be a condition of providing authentication
2025   services.
2026   Consult the agency SAOP if there are questions about whether the proposed processing
2027   falls outside the scope of the permitted processing or the appropriate privacy risk
2028   mitigation measures.

2029   9.4. Agency-SpeciÔ¨Åc Privacy Compliance
2030   Section 4.4 covers specific compliance obligations for federal CSPs. It is critical
2031   to involve the agency SAOP in the earliest stages of digital authentication system
2032   development in order to assess and mitigate privacy risks and advise the agency on
2033   compliance requirements, such as whether or not the collection of PII to issue or maintain
2034   authenticators triggers the Privacy Act of 1974 [PrivacyAct] or the E-Government Act
2035   of 2002 [E-Gov] requirement to conduct a PIA. For example, with respect to centralized
2036   maintenance of biometrics, it is likely that the Privacy Act requirements will be triggered
2037   and require coverage by either a new or existing Privacy Act system of records due to the
2038   collection and maintenance of PII and any other attributes necessary for authentication.
2039   The SAOP can similarly assist the agency in determining whether a PIA is required.
2040   These considerations should not be read as a requirement to develop a Privacy Act SORN
2041   or PIA for authentication alone. In many cases it will make the most sense to draft a
2042   PIA and SORN that encompasses the entire digital identity process or include the digital
2043   authentication process as part of a larger programmatic PIA that discusses the online
2044   service or benefit that the agency is establishing.
2045   Due to the many components of digital authentication, it is important for the SAOP to
2046   have an awareness and understanding of each individual component. For example, other
2047   privacy artifacts may be applicable to an agency offering or using federated CSP or RP
2048   services (e.g., Data Use Agreements, Computer Matching Agreements). The SAOP
2049   can assist the agency in determining what additional requirements apply. Moreover, a
2050   thorough understanding of the individual components of digital authentication will enable
2051   the SAOP to thoroughly assess and mitigate privacy risks either through compliance
2052   processes or by other means.
