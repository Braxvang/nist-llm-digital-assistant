NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                             Guidelines for Media Sanitization


                 sanitization operation may take as long as several hours depending on the media size.

   Destroy:      Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:        Following the Clear/Purge operation, manually navigate to multiple areas of the device (such as
                 browser history, files, photos, etc.) to verify that no personal information has been retained on the
                 device. Centralized management (BES) allows for device encryption.
                 Refer to the manufacturer for additional information on the proper sanitization procedure, and for
                 details about implementation differences between device versions and OS versions. Proper
                 initial configuration using guides such as the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)
                 Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) (http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/) helps ensure that
                 the level of data protection and sanitization assurance is as robust as possible. If the device
                 contains removable storage media, ensure that the media is sanitized using appropriate media-
                 dependent procedures.

   Devices running the Google Android OS              (connect to power before starting encryption)

   Clear:        Perform a factory reset through the device’s settings menu. For example, on Samsung
                 Galaxy S5 running Android 4.4.2, select settings, then, under User and Backup, select
                 Backup and reset, then select Factory data reset. For other versions of Android and other
                 mobile phone devices, refer to the user manual. Sanitization performed via a remote wipe
                 should be treated as a Clear operation, and it is not possible to verify the sanitization
                 results.

   Purge:        The capabilities of Android devices are determined by device manufacturers and service
                 providers. As such, the level of assurance provided by the factory data reset option may depend
                 on architectural and implementation details of a particular device. Devices seeking to use a
                 factory data reset to purge media should use the eMMC Secure Erase or Secure Trim
                 command, or some other equivalent method (which may depend on the device’s storage media).
                 Some versions of Android support encryption, and may support Cryptographic Erase.
                 Refer to the device manufacturer (or service provider, if applicable) to identify whether the
                 device has a Purge capability that applies media-dependent sanitization techniques or
                 Cryptographic Erase to ensure that data recovery is infeasible, and that the device does
                 not simply remove the file pointers.
   Destroy:      Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:        Proper initial configuration using guides such as the DISA STIGs (http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/) helps
                 ensure that the level of data protection and sanitization assurance is as robust as possible.
                 Following the Clear or (if applicable) Purge operation, manually navigate to multiple areas of the
                 device (such as browser history, files, photos, etc.) to verify that no personal information has
                 been retained on the device. When in doubt, check device manual or call tech support.
                 For both Clear and Purge, refer to the manufacturer for additional information on the proper
                 sanitization procedure.

   Windows Phone OS 7.1/8/8.x         (Centralized management may be needed for encryption)

   Clear:        Select the Settings option (little gear symbol) from the live tile or from the app list. On the
                 “Settings” page, scroll to the bottom of the page and select the “About” button. In the about page,
                 there will be a reset your phone button at the bottom of the page. Click on this button to
                 continue. Choose Yes when you see the warning messages. Please note that after the process
                 is completed, all your personal content will disappear. Sanitization performed via a remote
                 wipe should be treated as a Clear operation, and it is not possible to verify the sanitization
                 results.

   Purge:        The capabilities of Windows Phone devices are determined by device manufacturers and
                 service providers. As such, the level of assurance provided by the factory data reset
