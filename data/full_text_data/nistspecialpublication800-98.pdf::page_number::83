                                                                          SECTION 5: RFID SECURITY CONTROLS



Weaknesses: The drawback of reducing transmission power or the duty cycle is performance
degradation, especially with respect to back channel communication from a passive tag. For instance,
readers might fail to detect the presence of valid tags. Also, changes in the physical environment or the
introduction of new radio equipment can impact the power levels required for consistently successful
transactions. Consequently, the benefits of power adjustments based on a site survey can be negated by
changes to the environment.

5.3.2.6 Temporary Deactivation of Tags

Control: The RF interface on some proprietary tags can be turned off temporarily. Tag manufacturers
have different methods of turning their tags on and off. For example, some tags are designed so that the
tag is on or off depending upon which end is inserted into a mounting clip. Other tags have replaceable
batteries that can be removed to deactivate them.

If the control is implemented, tags would be turned on inside a designated area where the RF subsystem
operates. When the tags leave that area, they would be turned off. For example, in a supply chain
application, tags may be turned off to prevent unauthorized transactions during shipment. When the tags
arrive at their destination, they would be powered on again and managed. Conversely, tags used for in-
transit visibility may be turned on for their trip and turned off when they reach their destination.

Applicability: This control is most useful when communication between readers and a tag is infrequent
and predictable. For example, a warehouse might store items for an annual event, such as a holiday
celebration or parade. In this case, the RFID confers a benefit only for a short period each year, but could
remain vulnerable to rogue transactions if left operational for the rest of the year.

Benefits: Deactivating tags temporarily:

 Prevents unauthorized tag transactions during periods of inactivity, and
 Extends the battery life of active tags.
Weaknesses:

 If operators or system software fail to reactivate the tag when it is needed, then the missing
  transactions resulting from the tagâ€™s RF silence could adversely impact the supported business
  process.
 If turning a tag on or off requires human intervention, then this control would result in additional
  labor expense, which could be significant for systems that process large numbers of tags. The
  potential increased labor required to operate the system could negatively affect the business case for
  RFID relative to other AIDC technologies.
 Even if the activation and deactivation process is automated, it introduces a delay that might not be
  acceptable for many time-sensitive applications.
5.3.2.7 Tag Press-to-Activate Switch

Control: The tag remains deactivated by default unless a user or operator takes a positive action, such as
holding a press-to-activate switch on the tag to turn it on. When the switch is on, the tag is capable of RF
communication, but when pressure on the switch is released, the tag returns to its default deactivated
status so that tag transactions can no longer occur.
