2. Information Security Governance
    Federal agencies rely heavily on information technology (IT) to run their daily
operations and deliver products and services. With an increasing reliability on IT, a
growing complexity of federal government IT infrastructure, and a constantly
changing information security threat and risk environment, information security has
become a mission-essential function. This function must be managed and governed
to reduce the risks to federal government operations and to ensure the federal
governmentâ€™s ability to do business and serve the American public.
    The purpose of information security governance is to ensure that agencies are
proactively implementing appropriate information security controls to support their
mission in a cost-effective manner, while managing evolving information security
risks. As such, information security governance has its own set of requirements,
challenges, activities, and types of possible structures. Information security
governance also has a defining role in identifying key information security roles and
responsibilities, and it influences information security policy development and
oversight and ongoing monitoring activities.
   To ensure an appropriate level of support of agency missions and the proper
implementation of current and future information security requirements, each agency
should establish a formal information security governance structure.
   Information security governance can be defined as the process of establishing
   and maintaining a framework and supporting management structure and
   processes to provide assurance that information security strategies are aligned
   with and support business objectives, are consistent with applicable laws and
   regulations through adherence to policies and internal controls, and provide
   assignment of responsibility, all in an effort to manage risk.

2.1 Information Security Governance Requirements
    The United States (U.S.) Congress and the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) have instituted a number of laws, regulations, and directives that govern
establishment and implementation of federal information security practices. These
laws, regulations, and directives establish federal- and agency-level responsibilities
for information security, define key information security roles and responsibilities,
identify minimum information security controls, specify compliance reporting rules
and procedures, and provide other essential requirements and guidance. These laws
and regulations place responsibility and accountability for information security at all
levels within federal agencies, from the agency head to IT users. They also provide
an infrastructure for developing and promulgating detailed standards and
implementation guidance to federal agencies and overseeing implementation of
required practices through NIST and the Government Accountability Office (GAO),
respectively.
    These three entities, the U.S. Congress, OMB, and GAO, define and influence
federal agency governance and information security requirements. Congress creates
laws and oversight measures to establish objectives, present timely analyses to
establish overall governance standards across the federal government, and provide
aid in economic and budget decisions, including decisions about public IT assets and
