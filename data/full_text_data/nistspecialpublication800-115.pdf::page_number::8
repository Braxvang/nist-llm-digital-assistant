                                             TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



Executive Summary

An information security assessment is the process of determining how effectively an entity being assessed
(e.g., host, system, network, procedure, person—known as the assessment object) meets specific security
objectives. Three types of assessment methods can be used to accomplish this—testing, examination, and
interviewing. Testing is the process of exercising one or more assessment objects under specified
conditions to compare actual and expected behaviors. Examination is the process of checking, inspecting,
reviewing, observing, studying, or analyzing one or more assessment objects to facilitate understanding,
achieve clarification, or obtain evidence. Interviewing is the process of conducting discussions with
individuals or groups within an organization to facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or identify
the location of evidence. Assessment results are used to support the determination of security control
effectiveness over time.

This document is a guide to the basic technical aspects of conducting information security assessments. It
presents technical testing and examination methods and techniques that an organization might use as part
of an assessment, and offers insights to assessors on their execution and the potential impact they may
have on systems and networks. For an assessment to be successful and have a positive impact on the
security posture of a system (and ultimately the entire organization), elements beyond the execution of
testing and examination must support the technical process. Suggestions for these activities—including a
robust planning process, root cause analysis, and tailored reporting—are also presented in this guide.

The processes and technical guidance presented in this document enable organizations to:

     Develop information security assessment policy, methodology, and individual roles and
      responsibilities related to the technical aspects of assessment
     Accurately plan for a technical information security assessment by providing guidance on
      determining which systems to assess and the approach for assessment, addressing logistical
      considerations, developing an assessment plan, and ensuring legal and policy considerations are
      addressed
     Safely and effectively execute a technical information security assessment using the presented
      methods and techniques, and respond to any incidents that may occur during the assessment
     Appropriately handle technical data (collection, storage, transmission, and destruction)
      throughout the assessment process
     Conduct analysis and reporting to translate technical findings into risk mitigation actions that will
      improve the organization’s security posture.
The information presented in this publication is intended to be used for a variety of assessment purposes.
For example, some assessments focus on verifying that a particular security control (or controls) meets
requirements, while others are intended to identify, validate, and assess a system’s exploitable security
weaknesses. Assessments are also performed to increase an organization’s ability to maintain a proactive
computer network defense. Assessments are not meant to take the place of implementing security
controls and maintaining system security.

To accomplish technical security assessments and ensure that technical security testing and examinations
provide maximum value, NIST recommends that organizations:

     Establish an information security assessment policy. This identifies the organization’s
      requirements for executing assessments, and provides accountability for the appropriate
