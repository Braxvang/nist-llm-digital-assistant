2.1.3. Develop Technical Analysis Capability
The FCB may develop technical vulnerability analysis and remediation capabilities to triage the
importance of incoming source vulnerability reports, verify the existence of reported
vulnerabilities, and assist the VDPO closest to an affected system with analysis and remediation
efforts. They could be used, for example, to address severe vulnerabilities applicable to multiple
VDPOs and to assist smaller VDPOs that may not have sufficient resources to assess and
remediate vulnerabilities.

             Receive Source Vulnerability Report
An FCB member receives source vulnerability reports from reporters who are both internal and
external to the Government using the policies and capabilities developed in Section 2.1. If the
report is not within scope or cannot be verified, the FCB member should inform the reporter
and/or forward the report to an appropriate FCB member or EC. If the report is determined to be
within scope, a dialogue should be maintained between the FCB member and the reporter to
enable the exchange of additional and clarifying information. If the reporter intends to publicly
announce the vulnerability, the FCB can work with them to develop a disclosure schedule (e.g.,
coordinating public disclosure with patch distribution).
While the FCB receives source vulnerability reports for all government systems, a reporter may
choose to report directly to a vulnerable system’s VDPO. 4 In this case, the applicable VDPO will
coordinate with the FCB (as appropriate) to notify other impacted agencies, request technical
assistance, and produce advisories. VDPOs also provide a copy of all received reports to their
corresponding FCB member for entry into the FCB reporting database.

             Triage and Prioritize Source Vulnerability Report
FCB members should prioritize source vulnerability reports depending on the vulnerability’s
apparent:
        •    Ease of exploitation,
        •    Exposure of government systems to the vulnerability, and
        •    Technical severity of impact on the users of the affected software or services.
For calculating vulnerability severity and ease of exploitation, FCB members should use a
documented vulnerability scoring methodology (e.g., the Common Vulnerability Scoring System
[CVSS] 5). This score should be customized with the environmental factors of expected
government system exposure and user impact in order to calculate the priority of all received
reports.
Coordination with the VDPOs by the FCB may be required to determine the likely scope of
government resources impacted by the reported vulnerability. This prioritization optimizes
resource allocation and determines the urgency for addressing a report. A vulnerability in a
software library or other shared resource may affect multiple government systems with differing
