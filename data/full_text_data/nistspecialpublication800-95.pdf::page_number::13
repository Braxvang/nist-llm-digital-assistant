Conclusions

Web services are important drivers for the software industry. The primary goal of service-oriented
computing is to make a collection of software services accessible via standardized protocols whose
functionality can be automatically discovered and integrated into applications. While several standards
bodies (such as W3C and OASIS) are laying the foundation for Web services, several research problems
must be solved to make secure Web services a reality. Service description, automatic service discovery as
well as QoS are some of the important problems that need to be solved.

Web services are increasingly becoming an integral part of organizational information technology (IT)
infrastructuresâ€”even though there are still unmet security challenges. To this end, the development and
deployment of secure Web services is essential to many organizations' IT infrastructures. However, Web
service security standards do not provide all of the required properties to develop robust, secure, and
reliable Web services. To adequately support the needs of the Web services based applications, effective
risk management and appropriate deployment of alternate countermeasures are essential. Defense-in-
depth through security engineering, secure software development, and risk management can provide
much of the robustness and reliability required by these applications.
