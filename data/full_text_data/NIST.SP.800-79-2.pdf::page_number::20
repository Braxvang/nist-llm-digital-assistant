Special Publication 800-79-2                                              Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



2.6.4 Issuing Facility Manager
An Issuing Facility Manager manages the day-to-day operations of an issuing facility. The
Issuing Facility Manager is responsible for implementing all operating procedures for those
functions that have been designated for that facility by the issuer. The Manager must ensure that
all PIV processes adhere to the requirements of FIPS 201-2, and that all PIV services performed
at the issuing facility are carried out in a consistent and reliable manner in accordance with the
organization’s policies and procedures and the OIMO’s direction. In some cases (e.g. small
organizations), the OIMO may fulfill the role of the Issuing Facility Manager.

2.6.5 Assessor
The Assessor is responsible for performing a comprehensive and 3rd-party assessment of an
issuer. The Assessor (usually supported by an assessment team) verifies the issuer’s PIV
processes comply with control objectives of FIPS 201-2. The OIMO reviews the assessment
findings and prepares recommended corrective actions to reduce or eliminate any discrepancies
or shortcomings prior to submission to the DAO for an authorization decision. The Assessor is
also responsible for providing recommendations for reducing or eliminating deficiencies and
security weaknesses, describing the potential impact of those deficiencies if not corrected. An
Assessor shall not be assigned the DAO’s role and vice versa.

To preserve the impartial and unbiased nature of the assessment, the Assessor must be a 3rd party
that is independent of the office(s) and personnel directly responsible for the day-to-day
operation of the issuer. The Assessor shall also be independent of those individuals responsible
for correcting deficiencies and discrepancies identified during the assessment phase. The
independence of the Assessor is an important factor in maintaining the credibility of the
assessment results and ensuring that the DAO receives objective information in order to make an
informed authorization decision.

2.6.6 Applicant Representative (AR)
The Applicant Representative is an optional role and may be established and used at the
discretion of the organization. The AR represents the interests of current or prospective
employees and contractors who are applicants for PIV Cards or Derived PIV Credentials. ARs
are responsible for assisting an applicant who is denied a PIV Card or Derived PIV Credential
because of missing or incorrect information, and for ensuring that all applicants obtain useful
information and assistance when needed. This role may be assigned to someone in the
organization’s personnel or human resources.

2.6.7 Privacy Official (PO)
The responsibilities of the Privacy Official are defined in FIPS 201-2. The person filling this role
shall not assume any other operational role within the issuer organization. The PO issues policy
guidelines with respect to collection and handling of personally identifiable information from
applicants so as to ensure that the issuer is in compliance with all relevant directives of the
privacy laws. The PO’s role may be filled by an organization’s existing official for privacy (e.g.,
a Chief Privacy Officer).11
