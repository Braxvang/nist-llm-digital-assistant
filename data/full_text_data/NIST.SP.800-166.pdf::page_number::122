NIST SP 800-166                                                    DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                   DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

 Test Scenario            1. Send the SELECT command with
                                • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                          2. Send the GET DATA command with
                                • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                   ('5FC10A') of the X.509 Certificate for
                                   Digital Signature data object
                          3. Send the VERIFY command with
                                • P2, key reference value, is set to '80'
                                • Data field of the command will contain the
                                   correct Derived PIV Application Password,
                                   padded with 'FF' (if necessary) to complete
                                   the total length of the value to 8 bytes
                          4. Send the GENERAL AUTHENTICATE command
                                • CLA is set to:
                                    1. '00' if command chaining is not needed or
                                       '10' if command chaining is used. (The
                                       last chain of the command sets CLA to
                                       '00')
                                • P1, algorithm reference, is set to '07',
                                   '11', or '14'.
                                   P2, key reference, is set to '9C' indicating
                                   the digital signature key
                                • Data field in the command is to include '81'
                                   specifying a challenge, followed by a
                                   randomly generated challenge, and '82 00' in
                                   order to request a response
                          5. Verify the signature obtained in Step 4 using the
                             subject public key from the certificate obtained in
                             Step 2.
 Expected Result(s)       1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                             template with the status word '90 00'.
                          2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                             along with status word '90 00'.
                          3. From Step 3, the command returns status word '90 00'.
                          4. From Step 4, the command returns the signed challenge with
                             the status word '90 00'
                          5. From Step 5, the private key corresponds to the public key
                             contained in the certificate as the signature verification
                             succeeds.

9.3.2.8 cRLDistributionPoints Extension

 Test Assertion          TA-09.03.02.08
 Purpose                 Verifies that the cRLDistributionPoints extension in the digital
                         signature certificate contains at least one URI, either LDAP or
                         HTTP.
