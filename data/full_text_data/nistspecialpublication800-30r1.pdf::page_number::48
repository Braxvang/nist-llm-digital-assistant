such situations, monitoring only the security posture of information systems would likely not provide sufficient
information to determine the overall risk being incurred by organizations. Highly capable, well-resourced, and purpose-
driven threat sources can be expected to defeat commonly available protection mechanisms (e.g., by bypassing or
tampering with such mechanisms). Thus, process-level risk response measures such as reengineering mission/business
processes, wise use of information technology, or the use of alternate execution processes, in the event of compromised
information systems, can be major elements of organizational risk response plans.

UPDATE RISK ASSESSMENT
TASK 4-2: Update existing risk assessment using the results from ongoing monitoring of risk factors.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations determine the frequency and the circumstances under which risk assessments
are updated. Such determinations can include, for example, the current level of risk to and/or the importance of, core
organizational missions/business functions. If significant changes (as defined by organizational policies, direction, or
guidance) have occurred since the risk assessment was conducted, organizations can revisit the purpose, scope,
assumptions, and constraints of the assessment to determine whether all tasks in the risk assessment process need to be
repeated. Otherwise, the updates constitute subsequent risk assessments, identifying and assessing only how selected
risk factors have changed, for example: (i) the identification of new threat events, vulnerabilities, predisposing
conditions, undesirable consequences and/or affected assets; and (ii) the assessments of threat source characteristics
(e.g., capability, intent, targeting, range of effects), likelihoods, and impacts. Organizations communicate the results of
subsequent risk assessments to entities across all risk management tiers to ensure that responsible organizational
officials have access to critical information needed to make ongoing risk-based decisions.



                     Summary of Key Activities – Maintaining Risk Assessments

       •    Identify key risk factors that have been identified for ongoing monitoring.
       •    Identify the frequency of risk factor monitoring activities and the circumstances under which
            the risk assessment needs to be updated.
       •    Reconfirm the purpose, scope, and assumptions of the risk assessment.
       •    Conduct the appropriate risk assessment tasks, as needed.
       •    Communicate the subsequent risk assessment results to specified organizational personnel.
