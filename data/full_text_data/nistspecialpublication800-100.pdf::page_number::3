This document has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements,
and for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such
standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent
with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section
8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of
Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by federal agencies. It may also be used by
nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright regulations.
(Attribution would be appreciated by NIST.)

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made
mandatory and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory
authority. Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing
authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.




Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be identified in this document in order
to describe an experimental procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended
to imply recommendation or endorsement by NIST, nor is it intended to imply that the entities,
materials, or equipment are necessarily the best available for the purpose.
