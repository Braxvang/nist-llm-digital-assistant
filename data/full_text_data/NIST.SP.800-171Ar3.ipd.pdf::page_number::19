      NIST SP 800-171Ar3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                                       Assessing CUI Security Requirements
      November 2023

380   The application of an assessment procedure to a security requirement produces assessment
381   results or findings. The findings are compiled and used as evidence to determine whether the
382   security requirement has been satisfied or other than satisfied. A finding of satisfied indicates
383   that the assessment objective has been met, producing a fully acceptable result. A finding of
384   other than satisfied indicates that there are potential anomalies that may need to be addressed by
385   the organization. A finding of other than satisfied may also indicate that the assessor was unable
386   to obtain sufficient information to make the determination called for in the determination
387   statement.

388   For assessment findings that are other than satisfied, organizations may define subcategories of
389   findings to indicate the severity or criticality of the weaknesses or deficiencies discovered and
390   the potential adverse effects of those weaknesses or deficiencies on the missions and/or business
391   functions of the organization. Defining such subcategories can help to establish priorities for
392   needed risk mitigation actions.

393           Assurance Cases
394   Building an effective assurance case to determine compliance with security requirements is a
395   process that involves compiling evidence from a variety of sources and conducting different
396   types of activities during an assessment. An assurance case is a body of evidence organized into
397   an argument demonstrating that some claim about a system is true. For assessments conducted
398   using the procedures in this publication, that claim is compliance with the security requirements
399   in NIST SP 800-171. Assessors obtain evidence during security assessments to allow designated
400   officials 4 to make objective determinations about compliance with the security requirements. The
401   evidence needed to make such determinations can be obtained from various sources, including
402   independent, third-party assessments or other types of assessments, depending on the needs of
403   the organization establishing the requirements and the organization conducting the assessments.

404   For example, many technical security requirements are satisfied by security capabilities that are
405   built into commercial information technology products and systems. Product assessments are
406   typically conducted by independent, third-party testing organizations. 5 These assessments
407   examine the security functions of products and established configuration settings. Assessments
408   can also be conducted to demonstrate compliance with industry, national, or international
409   security standards as well as developer and vendor claims. Since many information technology
410   products are assessed by commercial testing organizations and then subsequently deployed in
411   hundreds of thousands of systems, these types of assessments can be carried out at a greater level
412   of depth and provide deeper insights into the security capabilities of the products.

413   The evidence needed to determine compliance comes from assessing the implementation of the
414   safeguards and countermeasure selected to satisfy the security requirements. Assessors can build
415   on previously developed materials that started with the specification of the information security

        A designated official is an official, either internal or external to a nonfederal organization, with the responsibility to determine organizational
      compliance with the security requirements.

        Examples of third-party testing organizations include Common Criteria Testing Laboratories that evaluate IT products in accordance with
      ISO/IEC 15408 [6] and Cryptographic Module Validation Program Testing Laboratories that evaluate cryptographic modules in accordance with
      Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140 [7].
