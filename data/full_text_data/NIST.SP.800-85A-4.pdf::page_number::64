NIST SP 800-85A-4                                              PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                        INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

VE05.37.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the format, encoding, and the parameters
of the PUT DATA command supported by the card.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.37.01: The tester shall validate that the card complies with the PUT DATA command as
defined in SP 800-73-4, Part 2.

A.5.3.2     GENERATE ASYMMETRIC KEY PAIR Card Command

AS05.38: The GENERATE ASYMMETRIC KEY PAIR card command initiates the
generation and storing in the card of the reference data of an asymmetric key pair, i.e., a
public key and a private key.

Required Vendor Information

VE05.38.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the cryptographic mechanism
identifiers (specified in Table 5, Part 1 of SP 800-73-4) that have been implemented on the card.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.38.01: The tester shall validate that the card implements the algorithms associated with
identifiers specified as part of VE05.38.01 requirement and that the public key returned is formatted
based on data object tags specified in Table 11, Part 2 of SP 800-73-4.

AS05.39: The public key of the generated key pair is returned as the response to the
command.

Note: This assertion is tested as part of AS05.38.

AS05.40: If there is reference data currently associated with the key reference, it is replaced in
full by the generated data.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.40.01: The tester shall validate that the initial key pair is replaced in full by the generated
data, by issuing a GENERAL AUTHENTICATE command following a GENERATE
ASYMMETRIC KEY PAIR command and verifying the cryptographic results using the public key
returned by the GENERATE ASYMMETRIC KEY PAIR command.

A.5.4       Secure Messaging (SM)

AS05.41-R4: When secure messaging is established, the PIV Card Application shall
authenticate to the relying system and a set of symmetric session keys will be established.
