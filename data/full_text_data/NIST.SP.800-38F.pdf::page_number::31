be verified without decrypting the ciphertext. 2 By contrast, for KW, KWP, and TKW, there are
no separate authentication tags: instead, the information that is necessary to verify the
authenticity of the data is embedded in all of the ciphertext bits. Consequently, for these three
algorithms, the authenticity of the data cannot be verified without invoking the authenticated-
decryption function.

  This statement applies to the internal MAC of GCM, but not to the internal MAC of CCM, which is generated on
the plaintext.
