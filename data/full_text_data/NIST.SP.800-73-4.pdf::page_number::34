code until the card expires. 18 The client application may then connect to the card and establish a
virtual contact interface with it whenever the card is within read-range of the client application’s
contactless card reader without needing to prompt the cardholder.

5.2     PIV Algorithm Identifier

A PIV algorithm identifier is a one-byte identifier of a cryptographic algorithm. The identifier
specifies a cryptographic algorithm and key size. For symmetric cryptographic operations, the
algorithm identifier also specifies a mode of operation (i.e., ECB). SP 800-78, Table 6-2 lists the PIV
algorithm identifiers for the cryptographic algorithms that may be recognized on the PIV interfaces.

5.3     Cryptographic Mechanism Identifiers

Cryptographic mechanism identifiers are defined in Table 5. These identifiers serve as inputs to the
GENERATE ASYMMETRIC KEY PAIR card command and the Part 3 pivGenerateKeyPair() client
API function call, which initiates the generation and storage of the asymmetric key pair.

                                    Table 5. Cryptographic Mechanism Identifiers

                                    '14'          ECC: Curve P-384                   None

All other cryptographic mechanism identifier values are reserved for future use.

5.4     Secure Messaging

A PIV Card Application may optionally support secure messaging (SM). When secure messaging is
established, the PIV Card Application is authenticated to the relying system and a set of symmetric
session keys are established, which are used to provide confidentiality and integrity protection for the
card commands that are sent to the card using secure messaging as well as for the responses from the
PIV Card.

If implemented, SM for non-card-management operations shall only be established using the PIV
Secure Messaging key specified in Table 4b and the SM protocol in accordance with the
specifications in Section 4 of Part 2.

5.5     Virtual Contact Interface

The term virtual contact interface (VCI) is used in this document as shorthand for a security
condition. As described in access control rules in this document and in Part 2, all non-card-
management operations that are allowed over contact interface may be carried out over the
contactless interface if the VCI security condition is satisfied. Support for the VCI is optional.

18 As noted in Section 5.5, the pairing code does not need to be submitted if the Bit 3 of the first byte of the PIN Usage

Policy is set to one.
