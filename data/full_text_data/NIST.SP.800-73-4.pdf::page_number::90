Special Publication 800-73-4                                      Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification â€“ Part 2:
                                                                  PIV Card Application Card Command Interface

word '6A 80'. If the authentication data in the command data field does not match the current value of the
reference data, but both the authentication data and the new reference data in the command data field of
the command satisfy the criteria in Section 2.4.3, the PIV Card Application shall return status word
'63 CX'. If status word '6A 80' is returned, the security status and retry counter associated with the key
reference shall remain unchanged. 9 If status word '63 CX' is returned, the security status of the key
reference shall be set to FALSE and the retry counter associated with the key reference shall be
decremented by one.

If the card command succeeds, then the security status of the key reference shall be set to TRUE and the
retry counter associated with the key reference shall be set to the reset retry value associated with the key
reference.

The initial value of the retry counter and the reset retry value associated with the key reference, i.e., the
number of successive failures (retries) before the retry counter associated with the key reference reaches
zero, are issuer dependent.

  3.2.3     RESET RETRY COUNTER Card Command

The RESET RETRY COUNTER card command resets the retry counter of the PIN to its initial value and
changes the reference data. The command enables recovery of the PIV Card Application PIN in the case
that the cardholder has forgotten the PIV Card Application PIN.


9 It is recommended that in this case the authentication data not be compared to the on-card reference data.
