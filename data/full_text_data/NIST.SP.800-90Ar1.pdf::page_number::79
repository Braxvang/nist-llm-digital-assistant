NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                             Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                    Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


This method produces random numbers (a0, a1, … , at-1) with no skew. A possible disadvantage
of this method, in general, is that the time needed to generate these numbers is not a fixed length
of time because of the conditional loop. The complex discard method may have better overall
performance than the simple discard method if many random numbers are needed.
The ratio rt/2m is a measure of the efficiency of the technique, and this ratio will always satisfy
0.5 < rt/2m ≤ 1. Hence, given r, it is recommended to choose t so that t is the smallest value such
that rt/2m is close to 1. For example, if r = 3, then choosing t = 3 means that m = 5 (as rt is 27)
and rt/m = 27/32 ≈ 0.84, and choosing t = 5 means that m = 8 (as rt is 243) and rt/m = 243/256 ≈
0.95. The complex discard method coincides with the simple discard method when t = 1.

A.5.3      The Simple Modular Method

Let m be the number of bits needed to represent the value (r–1), and let s be a security parameter.
The following method may be used to generate one random number a:
    1. Use the random bit generator to generate a sequence of m+s random bits, (b0, b1, …, bm+s-
       1).
                m+s−1
    2. Let c = ∑ 2i bi .
                 i=0

    3. Let a=c mod r.
The simple modular method can be coded to take constant time. This method produces a random
value with a negligible skew, that is, the probability that ai=w for any particular value of w (0 ≤
w ≤ r-1) is not exactly 1/r. However, for a large enough value of s, the difference between the
probability that ai=w for any particular value of w and 1/r is negligible. The value of s shall be
greater than or equal to 64.
