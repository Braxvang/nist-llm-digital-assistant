Appendix B—Sample Business Impact Analysis (BIA) and BIA Template

This sample template is designed to assist the user in performing a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) on an
information system. The template is meant only as a basic guide and may not apply equally to all
systems. The user may modify this template or the general BIA approach as required to best
accommodate the specific system. In this template, words in italics are for guidance only and should be
deleted from the final version. Regular (non-italic) text is intended to remain.

1.        Overview

This Business Impact Analysis (BIA) is developed as part of the contingency planning process for the
{system name}{system acronym}. It was prepared on {insert BIA completion date}.

1.1       Purpose

The purpose of the BIA is to identify and prioritize system components by correlating them to the
mission/business process(es) the system supports, and using this information to characterize the impact on
the process(es) if the system were unavailable.

The BIA is composed of the following three steps:

      1. Determine mission/business processes and recovery criticality. Mission/business processes
         supported by the system are identified and the impact of a system disruption to those processes is
         determined along with outage impacts and estimated downtime. The downtime should reflect the
         maximum that an organization can tolerate while still maintaining the mission.
      2. Identify resource requirements. Realistic recovery efforts require a thorough evaluation of the
         resources required to resume mission/business processes and related interdependencies as quickly
         as possible. Examples of resources that should be identified include facilities, personnel,
         equipment, software, data files, system components, and vital records.
      3. Identify recovery priorities for system resources. Based upon the results from the previous
         activities, system resources can more clearly be linked to critical mission/business processes.
         Priority levels can be established for sequencing recovery activities and resources.

This document is used to build the {system name} Information System Contingency Plan (ISCP) and is
included as a key component of the ISCP. It also may be used to support the development of other
contingency plans associated with the system, including, but not limited to, the Disaster Recovery Plan
(DRP) or Cyber Incident Response Plan.

2.        System Description

Provide a general description of system architecture and functionality. Indicate the operating
environment, physical location, general location of users, and partnerships with external
organizations/systems. Include information regarding any other technical considerations that are
important for recovery purposes, such as backup procedures. Provide a diagram of the architecture,
including inputs and outputs and telecommunications connections.
Note: Information for this section should be available from the system’s System Security Plan (SSP) and
can be copied from the SSP, or reference the applicable section in the SSP and attach the latest version of
the SSP to this contingency plan.
