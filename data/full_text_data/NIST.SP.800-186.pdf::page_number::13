    Introduction

       Background
Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) has uses in applications involving digital signatures (e.g.,
Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm [ECDSA]) and key agreement schemes (e.g., Elliptic
Curve Diffie-Hellman [ECDH]). Historically, elliptic curves have usually been expressed in
short Weierstrass format. However, curves that are expressed using a different format, such as
Montgomery curves and twisted Edwards curves, have gone from garnering academic interest to
being deployed in a number of applications. These curves can provide better performance and
increased side-channel resistance.
A number of standards-setting organizations besides NIST (e.g., ANSI X9F, ISO, SEC, and
IETF) have developed elliptic curve standards. In June 2015, NIST organized an ECC workshop
to discuss the design of alternate elliptic curves that are secure, efficient, and easy to use while
also being resilient to a wide range of implementation attacks. Subsequently, NIST solicited
public comments on the Digital Signature Standard FIPS 186-4, requesting specific feedback
regarding the digital signature schemes in FIPS 186 as well as possible new recommended
elliptic curves. This publication is the result of that input.

       Purpose and Scope
This Recommendation provides updated specifications of elliptic curves that are appropriate for
use by the U.S. Federal Government for digital signatures. It is intended for use in conjunction
with other NIST publications, such as NIST SP 800-56A, Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key-
Establishment Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm-Based Cryptography [SP_800-56A]; FIPS
186-5, Digital Signature Standard [FIPS_186-5]; and related specifications. The key pairs
specified here are used for digital signature generation and verification or key agreement only
and should not be used for any other purposes.
This Recommendation is intended to provide sufficient information for a vendor to implement
ECC using asymmetric algorithms in FIPS 140-3-validated modules.

       Document Organization
The remainder of this document includes the following sections and appendices:

    publication.
•   Appendix A: Details of Elliptic Curve Group Operations – This appendix discusses the
    group laws for each of the different curve models specified in this Recommendation.
