                                                   GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



      malware or other unwanted files from being transferred to a host, and can also stop sensitive files
      from being copied from the host to removable media.
 Audiovisual Device Monitoring. A few host-based IDPS products can detect when a host’s
  audiovisual devices, such as microphones, cameras, or IP-based phones are activated or used. This
  could indicate that the host has been compromised by an attacker.
 Host Hardening. Some host-based IDPSs can automatically harden hosts on an ongoing basis. For
  example, if an application is reconfigured, causing a particular security function to be disabled, the
  IDPS could detect this and enable the security function.
 Process Status Monitoring. Some products monitor the status of processes or services running on a
  host, and if they detect that one has stopped, they restart it automatically. Some products can also
  monitor the status of security programs such as antivirus software.
 Network Traffic Sanitization. Some agents, particularly those deployed on appliances, can sanitize
  the network traffic that they monitor. For example, an appliance-based agent could act as a proxy and
  rebuild each request and response that is directed through it. This can be effective at neutralizing
  certain unusual activity, particularly in packet headers and application protocol headers. Sanitization
  performed by an appliance can also reduce the amount of reconnaissance the attackers can perform on
  the host it is protecting. Examples include hiding the servers’ OS fingerprints and application error
  messages. Some products can also prevent sensitive information such as social security numbers and
  credit card numbers from being displayed on Web server pages.
7.3     Management

Most host-based IDPSs offer similar management capabilities. This section discusses major aspects of
management—implementation, operation, and maintenance—and provides recommendations for
performing them effectively and efficiently.

7.3.1     Implementation

Once a host-based IDPS product has been selected, the administrators need to design an architecture,
perform IDPS component testing, secure the IDPS components, and then deploy them. The following
items list additions to the material presented in Section 3.3.1:

 Component Testing and Deployment. After the host-based IDPS components have been evaluated
  in a test environment, organizations should implement a small pilot in the production environment.
  This allows administrators to perform tuning and customization activities on a small set of production
  hosts in preparation for a larger deployment. The prevention features should be disabled during the
  pilot and the subsequent production implementation until the agents have been sufficiently tuned and
  customized.
 Securing the Components. If the management servers or consoles must authenticate to each agent
  host to manage the agents or collect their data, organizations should ensure that the authentication
  mechanisms can be managed and secured properly. For example, if passwords are needed, there are
  security concerns with using a single password for all agent hosts; if a separate password is used for
  each agent host, the passwords can be difficult to track and maintain for hundreds or thousands of
  agents. If cryptographic keys are used for authentication, key management can present challenges in
  issuing and distributing keys.
