NIST SP 800-58                                              Voice Over IP Security

       common throughout the H.323 progression where one protocol negotiates the
       configuration of the next protocol used. In this case, it is necessary because
       H.245 has no standard port [10]. While H.225 simply negotiates the
       establishment of a connection, H.245 establishes the channels that will actually be
       used for media transfer. Once again, this is done over TCP. In a time-urgent
       situation, the H.245 message can be embedded within the H.225 message (H.245
       tunneling), but the speed of a call setup is usually a QoS issue that vendors and
       customers are willing to concede for better call quality. H.323 also offers Fast
       Connect. Here, a call may be setup using one roundtrip. The SETUP and the
       CONNECT messages piggyback the necessary H.245 signaling elements.

       H.245 must establish several properties of the VOIP call. These include the audio
       codecs that will be used and the logical channels for the transportation of media.
       The “OpenLogicalChannel” signal also brokers the RTP and RTCP ports.
       Overall, 4 connections must be established because the logical channels (RTP and
       RTCP) are only one direction. Each one-way pair must also be on adjacent ports
       as well. After H.245 has established all the properties of the VOIP call and the
       logical channels, the call may begin.

       The preceding described the complex VOIP setup process based on H.323.. The
       H.323 suite has different protocols associated with more complex forms of
       communication including H.332 (large conferences), H.450.1, H.450.2, and
       H.450.3 (supplementary services), H.235 (security), and H.246 (interoperability
       with circuit switched services) [18]. Authentication may also be performed at
       each point in the call setup process using symmetric keys or some prior shared
       secret [19]. The use of these extra protocols and/or security measures adds to the
       complexity of the H.323 setup process. We shall see that this complexity is
       paramount in the incompatibility of H.323 with firewalls and NATs. These issues
       are discussed at length in the next section.



 4.2   H.235 Security Profiles

       With the establishment of the H.235 version 2 standard in November 2000 the
       ITU-T took a step towards interoperability by defining different security profiles.
       This was necessary because the standard itself does not mandate particular
       features. The defined profiles provide different levels of security and describe a
       subset of possible security mechanisms offered by H.235. They comprise different
       options for the protection of communications, e.g., by using different options of
       H.235, which results in different implementation impact. The following
       subsections provide a short overview of the profiles provided by different
       organizations.
