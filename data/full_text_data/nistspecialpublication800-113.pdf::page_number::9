                                                                                       GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



Information Processing Standard (FIPS)-compliant cryptographic algorithms and modules. Many of the
cryptographic algorithms used in some SSL cipher suites are not FIPS-approved, and therefore are not
allowed for use in SSL VPNs that are to be used in applications that must conform to FIPS 140-2. This
means that to be run in FIPS-compliant mode, an SSL VPN gateway must only allow cipher suites that
are allowed by FIPS 140-2.

Some of the cryptographic requirements, including allowable hash functions and certificate key lengths,
will change at the end of 2010. Therefore, Federal agencies who want to provide SSL VPN services after
2010 must ensure that their systems are upgradeable to the new FIPS-compliant cipher suites and key
lengths before the end of 2010, and that their SSL VPN vendors guarantee that such upgrades will be
available early enough for testing and deployment in the field.

Organizations planning SSL VPN deployments should identify and define requirements, and
evaluate several products to determine their fit into the organization.

SSL VPN products vary in functionality, including protocol and application support. They also vary in
breadth, depth, and completeness of features and security services. Some recommendations and
considerations include the following:

 SSL VPN manageability features such as status reporting, logging, and auditing should provide
  adequate capabilities for the organization to effectively operate and manage the SSL VPN and to
  extract detailed usage information.
 The SSL VPN high availability and scalability features should support the organization’s
  requirements for failover, load balancing and throughput. State and information sharing is
  recommended to keep the failover process transparent to the user.
 SSL VPN portal customization should allow the organization to control the look and feel of the portal
  and to customize the portal to support various devices such as personal digital assistants (PDA) and
  smart phones.
 SSL VPN authentication should provide the necessary support for the organization’s current and
  future authentication methods and leverage existing authentication databases. SSL VPN
  authentication should also be tested to ensure interoperability with existing authentication methods.
 The strongest possible cryptographic algorithms and key lengths that are considered secure for current
  practice should be used for encryption and integrity protection unless they are incompatible with
  interoperability, performance and export constraints.
 SSL VPNs should be evaluated to ensure they provide the level of granularity needed for access
  controls. Access controls should be capable of applying permissions to users, groups, and resources,
  as well as integrating with endpoint security controls.
 Implementation of endpoint security controls is often the most diverse service amongst SSL VPN
  products. Endpoint security should be evaluated to ensure it provides the necessary host integrity
  checking and security protection mechanisms required for the organization.
 Not all SSL VPNs have integrated intrusion prevention capabilities. Those that do should be
  evaluated to ensure they do not introduce an unacceptable amount of latency into the network traffic.
