present in free text narratives or in photographs (e.g., a photograph that shows a calendar
or a picture of a computer screen with date information).
Several strategies have been developed for de-identifying dates:
    • Under the Safe Harbor method of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, dates must be general-
      ized to no greater specifcity than the year (e.g., July 4, 1776, becomes 1776) [132,
      §164.514 (b)(2)].
    • Dates within a single person’s record can be systematically adjusted by a random
      amount. For example, the dates of a hospital admission and discharge might be
      systematically moved the same number of days – a date of admission and discharge
      of July 4, 1776, and July 9, 1776, become Sept. 10, 1777, and Sept. 15, 1777,
      respectively [118]. However, this does not eliminate the risk that a data intruder will
      make inferences based on the interval between dates.
    • In addition to a systematic shift, the intervals between dates can be perturbed to
      protect against re-identifcation attacks that involve identifable intervals while still
      maintaining the order of events.
    • Some dates cannot be arbitrarily changed without compromising data accuracy. For
      example, it may be necessary to preserve the day of the week, whether a day is a
      workday or a holiday, or a relationship to a holiday or event.
    • Some ages can be randomly adjusted without impacting data accuracy while others
      cannot. For example, in many cases, the age of an individual can be randomly ad-
      justed ±2 years if the person is over the age of 25 but not if their age is between
      one and three. However, individuals become eligible for specifc benefts at specifc
      ages, such as Social Security retirement at age 62, so changes to ages around these
      milestones may also result in data accuracy problems.

4.3.5.   De-Identifying Geographical Locations and Geolocation Data
Geographical data can exist in many ways in a dataset. Geographical locations may be
indicated by map coordinates (e.g., 39.1351966, -77.2164013), a street address (e.g., 100
Bureau Drive), or a postal code (e.g., 20899). Geographical locations can also be embedded
in textual narratives.
Some geographical locations are less likely to be identifying (e.g., a crowded train station),
while others may be highly identifying (e.g., a house in which a single person lives). Other
locations may be identifying at some times of day and not others or during some months
or some years. The amount of noise required to de-identify geographical locations signif-
cantly depends on the availability of external data, including geographical surveys. Identity
may be shielded in an urban environment by adding ±100 m, whereas a rural environment
may require ±5 km or more to introduce suffcient ambiguity.
