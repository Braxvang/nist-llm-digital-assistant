TRUST MODELS
APPROACHES TO ESTABLISHING TRUST RELATIONSIPS




T       he following trust models describe ways in which organizations can obtain the levels of
        trust needed to form partnerships, collaborate with other organizations, share information,
        or receive information system/security services. No single trust model is inherently better
than any other model. Rather, each model provides organizations with certain advantages and
disadvantages based on their circumstances (e.g., governance structure, risk tolerance, and
criticality/sensitivity of organizational missions and business processes).

Validated Trust
In the validated trust model, one organization obtains a body of evidence regarding the actions of
another organization (e.g., the organization’s information security policies, activities, and risk-
related decisions) and uses that evidence to establish a level of trust with the other organization.
An example of validated trust is where one organization develops an application or information
system and provides evidence (e.g., security plan, assessment results) to a second organization
that supports the claims by the first organization that the application/system meets certain security
requirements and/or addresses the appropriate security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-
53. Validated trust may not be sufficient—that is, the evidence offered by the first organization to
the second organization may not fully satisfy the second organization’s trust requirements or trust
expectations. The more evidence provided between organizations as well as the quality of such
evidence, the greater the degree of trust that can be achieved. Trust is linked to the degree of
transparency between the two organizations with regard to risk and information security-related
activities and decisions.

Direct Historical Trust
In the direct historical trust model, the track record exhibited by an organization in the past,
particularly in its risk and information security-related activities and decisions, can contribute to
and help establish a level of trust with other organizations. While validated trust models assume
that an organization provides the required level of evidence needed to establish trust, obtaining
such evidence may not always be possible. In such instances, trust may be based on other
deciding factors, including the organization’s historical relationship with the other organization or
its recent experience in working with the other organization. For example, if one organization has
worked with a second organization for years doing some activity and has not had any negative
experiences, the first organization may be willing to trust the second organization in working on
another activity, even though the organizations do not share any common experience for that
particular activity. Direct historical trust tends to build up over time with the more positive
experiences contributing to increased levels of trust between organizations. Conversely, negative
experiences may cause trust levels to decrease among organizations.

Mediated Trust
In the mediated trust model, an organization establishes a level of trust with another organization
based on assurances provided by some mutually trusted third party. There are several types of
mediated trust models that can be employed. For example, two organizations attempting to
establish a trust relationship may not have a direct trust history between the two organizations,
but do have a trust relationship with a third organization. The third party that is trusted by both
