Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
pollution prevention and control information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to pollution prevention and control
information. Except for cases of emergency bulletins necessary to correct existing threats to
public safety, pollution prevention and control processes are usually tolerant of delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for

the management and control of the domestic economy and the money supply, and the protection

D.9.1 Business and Industry Development Information Type

Business and industry development supports activities related to the creation of economic and
business opportunities and stimulus, and the promotion of financial and economic stability for
corporations and citizens involved in different types of business. The recommended provisional
categorization of the business and industry development information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of business and industry
development information on the ability of responsible agencies to create economic and business
opportunities and stimulus, and promote financial and economic stability for corporations and
citizens involved in different types of business. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of
most business and industry development information would have, at most, a limited adverse
effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: There may be some cases for which
moderate confidentiality impact is associated with unauthorized disclosure of business/industry
development. For example, unauthorized disclosure of private information concerning
individuals or businesses can result in legal expense and serious effects on public confidence in
the agency. Similarly, unauthorized disclosure of details of current agency business and industry
development activities and plans can serve to focus opposition and/or give an unfair advantage to
