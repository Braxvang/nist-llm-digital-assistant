1502           Examine
1503           [SELECT FROM: identification and authentication policy and procedures; system design
1504           documentation; list of system accounts; system configuration settings; system audit records;
1505           system security plan; other relevant documents or records]
1506           Interview
1507           [SELECT FROM: personnel with system operations responsibilities; personnel with account
1508           management responsibilities; personnel with information security responsibilities; system
1509           developers; system administrators]
1510           Test
1511           [SELECT FROM: mechanisms for supporting and/or implementing a multi-factor authentication
1512           capability]

1516           REQUIREMENT: 03.05.04

1517           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
1518           Determine if:
1519           A.03.05.04: replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for access to system accounts are
1520           implemented.

1521           ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
1522           Examine
1523           [SELECT FROM: identification and authentication policy and procedures; system design
1524           documentation; system audit records; system configuration settings; list of privileged system
1525           accounts; system security plan; other relevant documents or records]
1526           Interview
