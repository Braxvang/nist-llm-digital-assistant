In this example, the system BIOS is given control of the host CPU at system reset. All SPI flash sectors
are unlocked at system reset. The system BIOS, prior to allowing execution of untrusted code (e.g.,
Option ROMs, bootloaders) locks host-side write access to the system flash sectors containing the system
BIOS. This locking is done via interaction with the logic to “lock until reset” the sectors containing the
BIOS image. When the lock is set, the access to this lock register becomes read-only so that the “lock
until reset” setting itself cannot be modified. Write access to the BIOS flash sectors remains available to
the SP.

When conducting a BIOS update, system management software on the host can interact with the SP to
send a candidate update image to the SP. Alternatively, the BIOS update image can arrive at the SP
through out of band communication via the SP Ethernet. The SP, as an RTU for the system BIOS, verifies
the BIOS update image using the digital signature verification algorithm and key store on the SP. If the
image is authenticated, then the SP, which continues to have write access to the BIOS flash memory even
after host OS boot, can perform the flash update via interaction with the SPI controller of the BIOS flash
memory.
