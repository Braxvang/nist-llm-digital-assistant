NOTE 2          The iris false match rate is considerably lower because iris is readily capable of achieving this lower
more secure value without appreciable increases in false non-match rates [IREX-III]

10.4      Conformance to accuracy specifications
The false match rate (FMR) requirements shall be assured by submitting biometric comparison algorithms to the test
and calibration programs given in Table 17. Those programs shall provide the algorithm developer with a tabulation
of false match rate vs. threshold calibration.

The test measurements are typically obtained by running algorithms on commodity PC hardware.
Thereafter, the algorithm provider or integrator shall provide documented attestation that:
―      All components of the recognition software (including template generation and comparison algorithms) are
       functionally identical to those submitted to the recognized test and calibration program. The use of recognition
       algorithms on other platforms, such as wall mounted embedded processors, is allowed. The algorithm provider
       shall submit the same software to the test program wherever it is ultimately installed.
―      All instances of the fielded comparison algorithms are configured with an operating decision threshold that is at
       least as strong as that established in FMR vs. threshold calibration.
Agencies might require inspection of source code and institute appropriate controls to ensure that the source code is
indeed that installed in deployed equipment.
Additionally, Agencies could elect to conduct a biometric performance test to confirm the hypothesis that the FMR is
conformant to the specification of Section 10.3.

10.4.1         Use of multiple samples with fixed thresholds
The thresholds are set to target particular false match rates between single fingers, irises or faces of different
individuals. However, if agency policy is to allow two fingers or eyes to be used in an authentication attempt, then
false acceptance rates will typically be twice the calibrated value. However, if a system is configured to always or
conditionally require multiple instances (e.g., two fingers or two eyes), then a threshold can be adopted (using
different decision or fusion logic) to target a lower false accept rate. Similarly if multiple captures (e.g., of face) are
allowed, false acceptance is also increased.

10.5      Agency consideration of false rejection performance
An authentication transaction may involve several core comparisons each of which will be expected to have failure
rates given by false match rates (FMR, for impostors) and false non-match rates (FNMR, for genuine comparisons).
These are matching error rates defined over outcomes of sample comparisons. Operational authentication
performance is quantified in terms of both the false reject rate (FRR) and the false accept rate (FAR) which are
                                        28
defined over outcomes of transactions : In PIV, FRR is the proportion of legitimate cardholders incorrectly denied
access; FAR would be the proportion of impostors incorrectly allowed access. The error rates depend on a number of
factors including: the environment, the number of attempts (e.g., finger placements on the sensor), the sensor itself,
the quality of the PIV Card templates' parent images, the number of fingerprints or irises invoked, and the familiarity

     A transaction might include several comparisons from repeated presentations of multiple fingers or irises.
