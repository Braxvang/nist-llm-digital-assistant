is generally considered a good idea to keep the cryptoperiods of the symmetric key
wrapping, key transport, and key agreement keys to the minimum practical period of
time.

If a key derivation key or master key is compromised, then any key derived from the key
derivation or master key could also be compromised. Therefore, key derivation and
master keys should also be changed on a periodic basis.

FR: 6.102 The CKMS design shall specify the range of acceptable cryptoperiods or
usage limits of each type of key used by the system.

FR:6.103 For each key, a CKMS design shall specify the other key types that depend on
the key for their security and how those dependent keys are to be replaced in the event of
a compromise of the initial key.

FR: 6.104 The CKMS design shall specify the means by which other compromised keys
can be identified when a key is compromised. For example, when a key derivation key is
compromised, how are the derived keys determined?

6.8.2 Metadata Compromise
Depending on the metadata element and how it is used, the compromise of a metadata
element could result in the compromise of a key or the data protected by a key. For
example, a metadata element of a symmetric encryption/decryption key could be a list of
identities corresponding to the legitimate users of the key. The Access Control System
verifies the authenticated identity of the user against the metadata element to determine
whether the user is permitted to exercise the decrypt function and thus obtain plaintext
data. If the metadata element could be modified to add an unauthorized user to the list of
authorized users, then the encrypted data could be compromised. If different keys have
common metadata elements, then the compromise of one metadata element could
compromise the data protected by each of the keys. Metadata elements that are sensitive
to unauthorized modification should be cryptographically bound to their associated keys
so that the integrity of the metadata can be easily verified.

FR: 6.105 For each key type employed, the CKMS design shall specify which metadata
elements are sensitive to compromise (confidentiality, integrity, or source).

FR: 6.106 The CKMS design shall specify the potential security consequences, given the
compromise (confidentiality, integrity or source) of each sensitive metadata element of a
key.

FR: 6.107 The CKMS design shall specify how each sensitive metadata element
compromise can be remedied.
