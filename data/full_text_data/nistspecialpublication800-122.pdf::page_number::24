                                  GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



4.       PII Confidentiality Safeguards

PII should be protected through a combination of measures, including operational safeguards, privacy-
specific safeguards, and security controls. Many of these measures also correspond to several of the Fair
Information Practices. Organizations should use a risk-based approach for protecting the confidentiality
of PII. The PII safeguards provided in this section are complementary to other safeguards for data and
may be used as one part of an organization‘s comprehensive approach to protecting the confidentiality of
PII and implementing the Fair Information Practices.

4.1      Operational Safeguards

This section describes two types of operational safeguards for PII protection: policy and procedure
creation; and education, training, and awareness. Organizations can choose whether these policy,
education, and awareness activities are combined with related security controls (e.g., AT-1, AT-2) or are
separated as part of a privacy program.

As agencies work to establish a variety of safeguards to protect the confidentiality of PII, they must also
ensure that mechanisms are in place to make certain that individuals are held accountable for
implementing these controls adequately and that the controls are functioning as intended. Accountability
is also an important Fair Information Practice. In this context, agencies may already have some pre-
established processes for providing oversight and accountability for the implementation of key controls,
such as those related to information system assessment and authorization, Privacy Impact Assessments,
and Privacy Act compliance. However, some additional oversight mechanisms or amendments to pre-
existing procedures could be necessary to ensure that all measures for protecting PII are being considered
and properly implemented.

4.1.1      Policy and Procedure Creation

Organizations should develop comprehensive policies and procedures for handling PII at the organization
level, the program or component level, and where appropriate, at the system level. 43 Some types of
policies include foundational privacy principles, privacy rules of behavior, policies that implement laws
and other mandates, and system-level policies. The foundational privacy principles reflect the
organization‘s privacy objectives. Foundational privacy principles may also be used as a guide against
which to develop additional policies and procedures. Privacy rules of behavior policies provide guidance
on the proper handling of PII, as well as the consequences for failure to comply with the policy. Some
policies provide guidance on implementing laws and OMB guidance in an organization‘s environment
based upon the organization‘s authorized business purposes and mission. Organizations should consider
developing privacy policies and associated procedures for the following topics:
 Access rules for PII within a system
 PII retention schedules and procedures
 PII incident response and data breach notification


43
      There are laws and OMB guidance that provide agency requirements for policy development. For example, OMB
      Memorandum 05-08 requires that a ―senior agency official must…have a central policy-making role in the agency‘s
      development and evaluation of legislative, regulatory and other policy proposals which implicate information privacy
      issues….‖ Additionally, the Privacy Act requires agencies to ―establish rules of conduct for persons involved in the design,
      development, operation, or maintenance of any system of records, or in maintaining any record, and instruct each such
      person with respect to such rules and the requirements of…‖ the Privacy Act ―including any other rules and procedures
      adopted…and the penalties for noncompliance.‖ 5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(9).
