OECD Privacy Guidelines and was developed to encourage electronic commerce among the member
states and to build trust with the international community. The Privacy Framework includes the
following Privacy Principles:
 Preventing Harm—Recognizing the interests of the individual to legitimate expectations of privacy,
  personal information protection should be designed to prevent the misuse of such information.
  Further, acknowledging the risk that harm may result from such misuse of personal information,
  specific obligations should take account of such risk, and remedial measures should be proportionate
  to the likelihood and severity of the harm threatened by the collection, use and transfer of personal
  information.
 Notice—Personal information controllers should provide clear and easily accessible statements about
  their practices and policies with respect to personal information.
 Collection Limitation—The collection of personal information should be limited to information that
  is relevant to the purposes of collection and any such information should be obtained by lawful and
  fair means, and where appropriate, with notice to, or consent of, the individual concerned.
 Uses of Personal Information—Personal information collected should be used only to fulfill the
  purposes of the collection and other compatible related purposes, except with the consent of the
  individual, when necessary to provide a product or service requested by the individual, or by authority
  of law.
 Choice—Where appropriate, individuals should be provided with clear, prominent, easily
  understandable, accessible and affordable mechanisms to exercise choice in relation to the collection,
  use and disclosure of their personal information. It may not be appropriate for personal information
  controllers to provide these mechanisms when collecting publicly available information.
 Integrity of Personal Information—Personal information should be accurate, complete and kept up-
  to-date to the extent necessary for the purposes of use.
 Security Safeguards—Personal information controllers should protect personal information that they
