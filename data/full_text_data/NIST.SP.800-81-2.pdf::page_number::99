11.       Guidelines for DNS Security Administration Operations

Section 9 deals with operations for deployment and usage of DNSSEC features for protection of DNS
query/response transactions. This section deals with periodic security administration operations (and
associated checklists) in a DNSSEC-aware enterprise-level zone and how to perform those operations
securely.

11.1 Organizational Key Management Practices

The DNS is an intrical part of an enterprise’s infrastructure and DNSSEC operations dealing with key
management should be in line with policies covering other data authentication keys maintained by the
enterprise. These policies would address such where keys are stored, designated personnel tasked with
key management operations, etc. Such an overall security policy is out of scope for this document and
depends on the enterprise’s current infrastructure and any pre-existing security policies already in place.

NIST Special Publication 800-57 Part 1 and Part 3 [800-57P1], [800-57P3] has general guidance on key
management and more specific guidance for specific applications. In these two Special Publications,
DNSSEC keys fall under “data authentication” keys because they are used to provide authentication and
integrity protection to DNS data.

11.2 Scheduled Key Rollovers (Key Lifetimes)

The keys used for zone signing (ZSK) and key signing (KSK) have to be changed because the keys
become vulnerable (liable to be cracked) with enough effort. The compromise of a private key means that
any site can spoof the zone by signing a bogus RRSet with the private key, thus defeating the purpose of
signing the zone file. Key rollover can take place as a scheduled event (scheduled rollover), or it may take
place as a result of an emergency (emergency rollover). Emergency rollover occurs for one of the
following reasons:

      •    The private key of the zone has been compromised.

      •    The private key of the zone has been lost, and the zone is to be updated before the RRSIGs
           expire.
In scheduled key rollover, the time period (or frequency of change) after which the keys must be changed
is determined by several factors.

      •    The amount of effort needed to rollover the key, and the potential disruption to the zone or current
           operation.

      •    Information security policy within the organization.

      •    The smaller the size of the private key, the easier it is to crack.
Based on these factors, each zone arrives at a desired frequency for key rollovers for ZSKs and KSK.
Recall that the KSK (KSK-private) is used for signing only the DNSKEY RRSet, whereas the ZSK (ZSK-
private) is used for signing the entire zone file. Apart from the volume of data, the ZSK also is used much
more frequently, as in the following situations:
