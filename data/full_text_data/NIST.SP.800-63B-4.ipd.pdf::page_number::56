       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                        Authentication and Lifecycle Management


1661   The CSP SHALL require the claimant to authenticate using an authenticator of
1662   the remaining factor, if any, to confirm binding to the existing subscriber account.
1663   Reestablishment of authentication factors at IAL3 SHALL be done in person or through a
1664   supervised remote process as described in [SP800-63A] Sec. 5.6.8, and SHALL perform
1665   a successful biometric comparison against the biometric characteristic collected during
1666   the original identity proofing process.
1667   The CSP SHOULD send a notification of the event to the subscriber. This MAY be the
1668   same notice that is required as part of the identity proofing process.
1669   Subscriber accounts that have not been identity proofed (i.e., without IAL) cannot be
1670   recovered because there is no reliable means for reassociating the subscriber with that
1671   account. Such accounts SHALL be treated as abandoned and a new subscriber account
1672    SHALL be established.

1673   Replacement of a lost (i.e., forgotten) memorized secret is problematic because it is very
1674   common. Additional “backup” memorized secrets do not mitigate this because they are
1675   just as likely to also have been forgotten. If a biometric is bound to the subscriber account,
1676   the biometric characteristic and associated physical authenticator SHOULD be used to
1677   establish a new memorized secret.
1678   As an alternative to the above re-proofing process when there is no biometric bound to
1679   the subscriber account, the CSP MAY bind a new memorized secret with authentication
1680   using two physical authenticators, along with a confirmation code that has been sent to
1681   one of the subscriber’s addresses of record. The confirmation code SHALL consist of at
1682   least 6 random alphanumeric characters generated by an approved random bit generator
1683   [SP800-90Ar1]. Confirmation codes SHALL be valid for at most:
1684       • 21 days, when sent to a postal address of record within the contiguous United
1685         States;
1686       • 30 days, when sent to a postal address of record outside the contiguous United
1687         States;
1688       • 10 minutes, when sent to a telephone of record (SMS or voice); or
1689       • 24 hours, when sent to an email address of record.

1690   6.1.2.4. External Authenticator Binding
1691   External authenticator binding refers to the process of binding an authenticator to
1692   a subscriber account when it is not connected to (or embedded in) the authenticated
1693   endpoint. This process is typically used when adding authenticators that are embedded in
1694   a new endpoint, or when connectivity limitations prevent the newly bound authenticator
1695   from being connected to an authenticated endpoint.
1696   The binding process MAY begin with a request from an endpoint that has authenticated to
1697   the CSP obtaining a binding code from the CSP that is input into the endpoint associated
