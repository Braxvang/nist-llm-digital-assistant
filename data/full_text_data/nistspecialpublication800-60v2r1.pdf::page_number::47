C.2.3.6 Workforce Planning Information Type

Workforce Planning involves the processes for identifying the workforce competencies required
to meet the agency’s strategic goals and for developing the strategies to meet these requirements.
The recommended security categorization for workforce planning information is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of workforce planning
information on the ability of responsible agencies to identify workforce competencies required to
meet the agency’s strategic goals and for developing the strategies to meet these requirements.
Unauthorized disclosure of most workforce planning information will have only a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some
background information that supports development of Federal workforce plans can reveal
sensitive vulnerabilities, tables of organization, capabilities, or methods of anti-terrorism, law
enforcement, or national security activities. Depending on the information in question, the
confidentiality impact can be moderate, high, or involve national security information (outside
the scope of this guideline).

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for workforce planning information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Therefore,
consequences of undetected unauthorized modification or destruction of workforce planning
information may compromise the effectiveness of compliance enforcement actions (e.g., by
providing violators with a basis for claiming investigative or enforcement irregularities).

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
workforce planning information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the workforce planning information.
The workforce planning processes are generally tolerant of reasonable delays. In most cases,
disruption of access to workforce planning information can be expected to have only a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
workforce planning information is low.
C.2.3.7 Management Improvement Information Type

Management Improvement includes all efforts to gauge the ongoing efficiency of business
processes and identify opportunities for reengineering or restructuring. The recommended
