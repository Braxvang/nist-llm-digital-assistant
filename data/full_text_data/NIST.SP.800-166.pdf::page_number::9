provide conformance tests for any other software, such as the back-end access control software,
issuance software, or any specialized service provider software used for logical access.

1.3       Document Overview

The document is organized as follows:

      +    Section 2 provides a conceptual overview of the test architecture, the test setup and
           components, and the types of tests (Derived PIV Application and Data Model of the
           Derived PIV Application) covered within this document.

      +    Section 3 describes the structure of the test guidelines and explains Derived test
           requirements (DTR) and test assertions (TA) construction.

      +    Section 4 details the conformance criteria for each type of test.

      +    Section 5 explains the documentation necessary to conduct testing.

      +    Section 6 includes DTRs that apply to the Derived PIV Application based on
           specifications in [SP800-157].

      +    Section 7 includes DTRs that apply to the Data Model of the Derived PIV Application
           based on specifications in [SP800-157].

      +    Section 8 provides test assertions that are used to test the DTRs of the Derived PIV
           Application listed in Section 6.

      +    Section 9 provides test assertions that are used to test the DTRs of the Derived PIV
           Application data model listed in Section 7.

      +    Appendix A contains guidelines for functional and data model testing of Derived PIV
           Credentials on embedded (non-removable) tokens.

      +    Appendix B contains a list of acronyms used in the document.

      +    Appendix C contains a glossary of terms used in the document.

      +    Appendix D contains the list of documents used as references by this document.
