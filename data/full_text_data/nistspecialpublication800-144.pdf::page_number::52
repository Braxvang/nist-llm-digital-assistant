In accordance with OMB policy, federal agencies are required to follow certain specific NIST
Special Publications. However, there is flexibility in how agencies apply the guidance. Federal
agencies should apply the security concepts and principles articulated in the NIST Special
Publications in accordance with and in the context of the agencyâ€™s missions, business functions,
and environment of operation. Consequently, the application of NIST guidance by federal
agencies can result in different security solutions that are equally acceptable, compliant with the
guidance, and meet the OMB definition of adequate security for federal information systems.

organizational policies and that data privacy is maintained. Planning activities include the
