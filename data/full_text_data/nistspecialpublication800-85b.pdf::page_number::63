Precondition(s)         1. A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                        2. A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and
                           the contact reader.
                        3. The test application is currently connected to the card application
                            which is accessible through card handle.
                        4. A valid Card Holder Fingerprints object is present on the PIV card.
                        5. Security conditions to read the object are met.
Test Scenario           1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                        2. Set OID := <<Card Holder Fingerprints
                           (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.96.16)>>
                        3. Call pivGetData w/
                            • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                        4. Extract the FASC-N field of CBEFF Header.
                        5. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                        6. Set OID := <<Card Holder Unique Identifier
                           (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.48.0)>>
                        7. Call pivGetData w/
                            • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                        8. Extract the value field for tag 0xBC, extract the first
                           88 bytes (CBEFF Header) and read the FASC-N field (based
                           on its position) in CBEFF Header.
Expected Result(s) The FASC-N field in CBEFF header is the same as the one extracted from
                   the CHUID.

9.1.2.12 Reserved Field Value
Purpose                 Validates that the “Reserved for Future Use” field is equal to 0x00000000.
