2696   common passwords that might be guessed in an online attack before throttling restrictions
2697   take effect. An excessively large blocklist is likely to frustrate users that attempt to choose
2698   a memorable password.
2699   Highly complex memorized secrets introduce a new potential vulnerability: they are less
2700   likely to be memorable, and it is more likely that they will be written down or stored
2701   electronically in an unsafe manner. While these practices are not necessarily vulnerable,
2702   statistically some methods of recording such secrets will be. This is an additional
2703   motivation not to require excessively long or complex memorized secrets.

2704   A.4. Central vs. Local Veriﬁcation
2705   While passwords that are used as a separate authentication factor are generally verified
2706   centrally by the CSP’s verifier, those that are used as an activation factor for a multi-
2707   factor authenticator are either verified locally or are used to derive the authenticator
2708   output, which will be incorrect if the wrong activation factor is used. Both of these
2709   situations are referred to as “local verification”.
2710   The attack surface and vulnerabilities for central and local verification are very different
2711   from each other. Accordingly, the requirements for memorized secrets verified centrally
2712   is different from those verified locally. Centrally verified secrets require the verifier,
2713   which is an online resource, to store salted and iteratively hashed verification secrets
2714   for all subscribers’ passwords. Although the salting and hashing process increases the
2715   computational effort to determine the passwords from the hashes, the verifier is an
2716   attractive target for attackers, particularly those who are interested in compromising an
2717   arbitrary subscriber rather than a specific one.
2718   Local verifiers do not have the same concerns with attacks at scale on a central online
2719   verifier, but depend to a greater extent on the physical security of the authenticator and
2720   the integrity of its associated endpoint. To the extent that the authenticator stores the
2721   activation factor, that factor must be protected against physical and side-channel (e.g.,
2722   power and timing analysis) attacks on the authenticator. When the activation factor is
2723   entered through the associated endpoint, the endpoint needs to be free of malware, such
2724   as key-logging software, if the password is to be protected. Since these threats are less
2725   dependant on the length and complexity of the password, those requirements are relaxed
2726   for local verification.
2727   Online password-guessing attacks are a similar threat for centrally and locally verified
2728   passwords. Throttling, which is the primary defense against online attacks, can be
2729   particularly challenging for local verifiers because of the limited ability of some
2730   authenticators to securely store information about unsuccessful attempts. Throttling
2731   can be performed by either keeping a count of invalid attempts in the authenticator, or
2732   by generating an authenticator output that is rejected by the CSP verifier, which does
2733   the throttling. In this case it is important that the invalid outputs not be obvious to the
2734   attacker, who could otherwise make offline attempts until a valid-looking output appears.
