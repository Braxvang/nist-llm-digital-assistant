NIST SP 800-85A-4                                               PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                         INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

TE05.34.03: The tester shall validate that the GENERAL AUTHENTICATE command is
implemented to mutually authenticate the card to the client application and the client application to
the card (Pertains to AS05.34-(1)).

TE05.34.04: The tester shall validate that the GENERAL AUTHENTICATE command is
implemented to realize signing functionality (Pertains to AS05.34-(2)).

TE05.34.05: The tester shall validate that the GENERAL AUTHENTICATE command is
implemented to support the RSA key transport or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement
primitives specified in SP 800-78-4 (Pertains to AS05.34-(3)).

TE05.34.06: If the '04' key is implemented, the tester shall validate that the GENERAL
AUTHENTICATE command is implemented to support only cryptographic algorithm identifiers '27'
and/or '2E' to establish session keys for secure messaging. The tester shall validate that if key
reference '04' is specified in P2 and an algorithm identifier other than '27' or '2E' is specified in P1
then the card returns the status word '6A 86' (Pertains to AS05.34-(4)).

AS05.35: The GENERAL AUTHENTICATE command shall be implemented to realize the
signing functionality on the PIV client application programming interface.

Note: This assertion is tested as part of AS05.34.

AS05.36: If an invalid value of algorithm reference (P1) and/or key reference (P2) is sent to
the card, the PIV Card Application shall return the status word '6A 86'.

Required Vendor Information

VE05.36.01: The vendor shall state in its documentation that the card supports the assertion made in
AS05.36.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.36.01: The tester shall review the vendorâ€™s documentation and validate that it contains the
information required in VE05.36.01 and the card returns status word '6A 86' when an invalid value
of algorithm reference (P1) or key reference (P2) is sent to the card.

AS05.36A: If an invalid value is sent in the data field, the PIV Card Application shall return
the status word '6A 80'.

Required Vendor Information

VE05.36A.01: The vendor shall state in its documentation that the card supports the assertion made
in AS05.36A.
