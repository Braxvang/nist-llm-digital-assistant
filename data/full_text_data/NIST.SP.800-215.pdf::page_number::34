NIST SP 800-215                                                            Guide to a Secure Enterprise
November 2022                                                                      Network Landscape

An architecture has emerged for managing enterprise networks that are connected to multiple
CSPs. A portion of the industry calls the collection of appliances in this architecture a cloud
network platform. The requirements for this multi-cloud networking platform are [41]:
   •   It should deliver common operational visibility and control across native network access
       provided by multiple cloud providers. The primary challenge is that public cloud
       providers have different proprietary architectures using their own “constructs”. In order
       to provide a networking architecture that can “cross clouds”, one needs to leverage the
       cloud-native functionality (especially native cloud networking constructs) of each cloud;
       abstract that functionality with APIs; add advanced data plane features for high-
       availability, security, and operational visibility/control; and provide the tools to manage
       these features dynamically or automatically [42].
   •   It should deliver a common ingress and egress security policy for application
       environments (e.g., VPCs, VNETs, VCNs) across clouds.
   •   It should enable end-to-end encryption inside of the cloud as well as high-performance
       encryption from the data center to the cloud.
   •   It should support automation for deployment and configuration.
Based on the above requirements, multi-cloud networking platform offerings have emerged with
the following architectural elements:
   •   An abstraction layer sits on top of the native network access offered by individual CSPs
       to their services. This layer enables the enterprise to manage the entire enterprise network
       – consisting of connectivity to multiple clouds, intra-cloud connections, and the on-
       premises data center network fabrics – as one unit. To enable this, complete visibility into
       the entire enterprise network landscape is needed. Hence, this layer needs input from
       sophisticated observability and monitoring tools to carry out its functions.
   •   A virtual network configuration that sits on the top of the network provided by each CSP
       for hosting CSC applications. The capability to define this virtual network configuration
       can be automated by a class of tools called IaC tools, which have features with network
       configuration definitions of major CSPs built in as plug-ins. These tools facilitate initial
       network resource provisioning and configuration and subsequent re-provisioning and re-
       configuration as application access requirements change.
There are four industry trends [43] that may have security implications with regard to SD-WAN
[44]:
   1. SD-WAN access is acquired as a cloud-based service under the umbrella of network as a
      service (NaaS), just like IaaS and SaaS.
   2. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based algorithms are used for monitoring networks for
      security-related conditions; for resiliency-improving measures, such as throttling for
      certain destinations; and for dynamic routing decisions to maintain QoS parameters, such
      as latency and bandwidth.
   3. Wireless networks are used for last mile connectivity using a 5G radio access network
      (RAN).
