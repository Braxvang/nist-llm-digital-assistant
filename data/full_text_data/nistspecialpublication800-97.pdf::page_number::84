ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I




                                  Figure 6-1. Illustration of EAP-TLS Environment



Several WLAN vendors support EAP-TLS in their STA software. Microsoft also supports a version of
EAP-TLS in its Windows XP operating system.

6.1.3.2 EAP-TTLS

EAP-TTLS extends EAP-TLS to allow for one-way TLS authentication in addition to mutual TLS
authentication. When one-way authentication is used, the AS is authenticated to the STA in a TLS
handshake, which also creates an encrypted tunnel between the STA and AS. The tunnel is then used to
protect a second authentication transaction in which the STA is authenticated to the AS. In EAP-TTLS,
this second transaction is called an inner authentication method and occurs in what are termed
InnerApplication messages. These messages consist of a series of attribute-value pairs (AVP) that
describe the inner application and specify the standard protocols and algorithms that support it. The AVP
format is compatible with RADIUS, thereby enabling easy integration with existing authentication
protocols that RADIUS supports. The AVP format is extensible, allowing new inner applications and
corresponding AVPs to be defined as needed. Currently supported inner applications include EAP
methods, CHAP, 78 and PAP. When the inner application is another EAP method, it is referred to as the
inner EAP method.

The use of EAP-TTLS is similar to Web sites that establish a protected channel, and then prompt for a
username and password. The client computer first uses TLS to validate the Web server’s certificate and
establish an encrypted session with the server. At that point, passwords sent to the Web server are
encrypted and therefore protected from eavesdropping. EAP-TTLS operates in a similar manner; the
STA validates the AS’s certificate and uses the resulting TLS session to transfer user credentials securely.

Figure 6-2 shows a hypothetical WLAN that uses the EAP-TTLS method for authentication. The
configuration is identical to the EAP-TLS example in Figure 6-1, but in this case a certificate is present
on the AS only.

78
     EAP-TTLS also supports the Microsoft variants of CHAP, namely MS-CHAP and MS-CHAPv2. CHAP and MS-CHAP are
     considered insecure, but MS-CHAPv2 provides adequate security for medium assurance applications. It also supports PAP,
     which is not secure if used on its own. However, in combination with the outer TLS tunnel, it may be adequate with
     substantial network engineering devoted to its security.
