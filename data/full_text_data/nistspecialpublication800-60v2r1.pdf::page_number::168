disclosure of trade secrets. Trade secrets will generally be assigned a moderate confidentiality
impact level.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for business/industry development information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of business and industry development
information may depend on the urgency with which the information is typically needed.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications
(e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the
agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most business and industry development information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to business and industry development
information. Missions supported by business and industry development information are
generally tolerant of delay.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
business and industry development information is low.

D.9.2 Intellectual Property Protection Information Type

Intellectual property protection involves law enforcement activities involving the enforcement of
intellectual property including inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names,
images, and designs used in commerce. Note that intellectual property protection is an exception
to the often-close relationship between impacts to law enforcement information and information
systems and the security of critical infrastructures and key national assets. The following security
categorization is recommended for the intellectual property protection information type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of intellectual property
protection information on the abilities of responsible agencies to enforce intellectual property
including inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, images, and designs used
in commerce. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of the majority of intellectual
property protection information will result in, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.
