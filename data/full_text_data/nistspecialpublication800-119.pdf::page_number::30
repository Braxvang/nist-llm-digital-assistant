                                                                  GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


widespread use of Network Address Translation (NAT) to share globally routable addresses (with certain
limits placed on the hosts using so-called RFC 1918 addresses). IPv6 has no such shortage, so the use of
NAT is unnecessary; nevertheless, the usefulness of addresses with limited scope was identified and
maintained in IPv6. IPv6 addresses with different scopes were defined. In the original design for IPv6,
link local, site local, and global addresses were defined; later, it was realized that site local addresses were
not well enough defined to be useful. Site local addresses were abandoned and replaced with unique local
addresses. Older implementations of IPv6 may still use site local addresses, so IPv6 firewalls need to
recognize and handle site local addresses correctly.

The IPv6 standards define several scopes for meaningful IPv6 addresses:

        Interface-local. This applies only to a single interface; the loopback address has this scope.

        Link-local. This applies to a particular LAN (Local Area Network) or network link; every
         IPv6 interface on a LAN must have an address with this scope. Link-local addresses start with
         FE80::/10. Packets with link-local destination addresses are not routable and must not be
         forwarded off the local link.

    Link-local address:

         10 bits            54 bits                         64 bits

         1111 1110 10       0000………………0000                  Interface ID

         FE80/10            0000………………0000                  Interface ID


    Link-local addresses are used for administrative purposes such as neighbor and router discovery.

        Site-local. This scope was intended to apply to all IPv6 networks or a single logical entity
         such as the network within an organization. Addresses with this scope start with FEC0::/10.
         They were intended not to be globally routable but potentially routed between subnets within
         an organization. Site local addresses have been deprecated and replaced with unique local
         addresses.

        Unique local unicast. This scope is meant for a site, campus, or enterprise’s internal
         addressing. It replaces the deprecated site-local concept. Unique local addresses (ULAs) may
         be routable within an enterprise. Use of unique local addresses is not yet widespread; see RFC
         4193, Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses, for more information.

        Global. The global scope applies to the entire Internet. These are globally unique addresses
         that are routable across all publicly connected networks.

        Embedded IPv4 Unicast. The IPv6 specification has the ability to leverage existing IPv4
         addressing schemes. The transition to IPv6 will be gradual, so two special types of addresses
         have been defined for backward compatibility with IPv4: IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses
         (rarely used and deprecated in RFC 4291) and IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses. Both allow the
         protocol to derive addresses by embedding IPv4 addresses in the body of an IPv6 address. An
         IPv4-mapped IPv6 address is used to represent the addresses of IPv4-only nodes as an IPv6
         address, which allows an IPv6 node to use this address to send a packet to an IPv4-only node.
