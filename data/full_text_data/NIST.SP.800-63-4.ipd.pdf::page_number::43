       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


1179   5.2.1. Assurance Levels
1180   An organization RP SHALL select, based on cybersecurity risk and mission needs, the
1181   following individual initial assurance levels:
1182       • IAL: The robustness of the identity proofing process to confidently determine the
1183         identity of an individual. IAL is selected to mitigate potential identity proofing
1184         failures.
1185       • AAL: The robustness of the authentication process itself, and the binding between
1186         an authenticator and a specific individual’s identifier. AAL is selected to mitigate
1187         potential authentication failures.
1188       • FAL: The robustness of the federation process used to communicate authentication
1189         and attribute information (if applicable) to an RP from an IdP. FAL is optional as
1190         not all digital systems will leverage federated identity architectures. FAL is selected
1191         to mitigate potential federation failures.

1192   5.2.2. xAL Descriptions
1193   A summary of each of the identity, authenticator, and federation assurance levels is
1194   provided below.
1195   When described generically or bundled, these guidelines will refer to IAL, AAL, and FAL
1196   as xAL.

1197   5.2.2.1. Identity Assurance Level
1198   IAL1: IAL1 requires validation of identifying attributes against authoritative or credible
1199   sources and use of basic processes to verify the claimed identity of the applicant.
1200   IAL2: IAL2 requires identifying attributes to be supported by strong evidence and
1201   validated against authoritative or credible sources and use of processes to verify the
1202   claimed identity of the applicant.
1203   IAL3: IAL3 requires identifying attributes to be verified by an authorized CSP
1204   representative through examination of physical documentation using an interactive
1205   process with a CSP representative.

1206   5.2.2.2. Authentication Assurance Level
1207   AAL1: AAL1 provides some assurance that the claimant controls an authenticator
1208   registered to the subscriber. AAL1 requires single-factor authentication using a wide
1209   range of available authentication technologies. Successful authentication requires that the
1210   claimant prove possession and control of the authenticator through a secure authentication
1211   protocol.
1212   AAL2: AAL2 provides high confidence that the claimant controls authenticator registered
1213   to the subscriber. Proof of possession and control of two different authentication factors is

                                                    31
