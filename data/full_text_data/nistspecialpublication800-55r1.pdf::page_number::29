4. LEGISLATIVE AND STRATEGIC DRIVERS

This section explains the relationship between overall agency performance measures reporting
and information security performance measures reporting, and provides agencies with guidelines
on how to link these two activities to ensure that their information security program contributes
to overall accomplishment of the agency mission, goals, and objectives. Sections 4.1 and 4.2
provide an overview of the Government Performance Results Act (GPRA), the Federal
Information Security Management Act (FISMA), and the Federal Enterprise Architecture from a
performance measurement point of view and describe their associated performance management
requirements, while Section 4.3 discusses the linkage between enterprise strategic planning and
information security.

4.1       Legislative Considerations

Legislation such as GPRA and FISMA, along with executive regulations, is driving an increased
emphasis on managing, quantifying, and reporting agency performance. The purpose of these
efforts is to facilitate the streamlining of U.S. government operations, improve efficiencies in
delivering services, and demonstrate the value of these services to the public. Agencies are
required to strategically plan their initiatives and make these plans and corresponding
performance measures available to the public. The Executive Branch also develops initiatives
that may require organizations to collect and report performance measures.

4.1.1     Government Performance Results Act

GPRA focuses on improving program effectiveness and efficiency by adequately articulating
program goals and providing information on program performance. To structure and facilitate
program improvement, it requires agencies to develop multiyear strategic plans and annually
report their performance against these plans.

The purpose of GPRA is to:

      •   Improve the confidence of the American people in the capability of the federal
          government by systematically holding federal agencies accountable for achieving
          program results;
      •   Initiate program performance reform with a series of pilot projects in setting program
          goals, measuring program performance against those goals, and reporting publicly on
          their progress;
      •   Improve federal program effectiveness and public accountability by promoting a new
          focus on results, service quality, and customer satisfaction;
      •   Help federal managers improve service delivery by requiring that they plan for meeting
          program objectives, and by providing them with information about program results and
          service quality;
