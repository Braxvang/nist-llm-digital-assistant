     FOCUS AREA 9



     Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL). OSCAL is a set of formats expressed in
     eXtensible Markup Language (XML), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and YAML Ain’t
     Markup Language (YAML). These formats provide machine-readable representations
     of control catalogs, control baselines, system security plans, assessment plans, and
     results. In FY 2019, NIST continued to develop approaches for security planning and
     measurement through the application of the Cybersecurity Framework for assessments
     and assessment results.


     Cyber Risk Analytics
     This project promotes technical solutions that enable organizations to bridge diverse,
     new, and existing data sets to advance the analysis of cyber risks and enhance the ability
     to report trends. The goal is to enable information sharing among risk owners about
     historical, current, and future cyber risk conditions. NIST is leveraging their past and
     present efforts such as a data repository for cyber incident analysis, predictive analytics
     and strategic analysis on threat coverage, and prioritization and gap identification. In FY
     2019, the program developed methodologies and tools that could be used for developing
     a Collaborative Cyber Incident Data and Analysis Repository (CIDAR)11 that will combine
     data from multiple databases and showcase opportunities for visualizing patterns and
     trends in cyber-related incidents. The methodologies developed also included the
     automation of new data ingestion and predictive functions to match cyber incident
     entries between data sets.


     Computer Forensic Tool Testing (CFTT)
     The Computer Forensics Tool Testing Program (CFTT) is a project of ITL’s Software
     and Systems Division (SSD) and is supported by the Special Programs Office and DHS.
     In FY 2019, several key advances were made to help address a critical need in the law
     enforcement community to ensure the reliability of computer forensic tools.
          •   Specifications and Testing – A new test specification for mobile devices was
              developed: Mobile Device Forensic Tool Specification, Test Assertion, and Test
              Cases. The CFTT project partnered with DHS to test numerous digital forensic
              tools for disk imaging, write-blocking, string searching, windows registry, and
              mobile device acquisition, resulting in 23 published reports.
          •   Federated Testing – Federated testing was developed to enable third parties to
              use the NIST testing methodology in their own labs and produce standardized test
              reports. In FY 2019, Federated Testing v4 was updated to provide modules for disk
              imaging tools, forensic string search tools, hardware write blockers, and mobile
              forensic tools.
