4.1.2    Filesystems

Before media can be used to store files, the media must usually be partitioned and formatted into logical
volumes. Partitioning is the act of logically dividing a media into portions that function as physically
separate units. A logical volume is a partition or a collection of partitions acting as a single entity that has
been formatted with a filesystem. Some media types, such as floppy disks, can contain at most one
partition (and consequently, one logical volume). The format of the logical volumes is determined by the
selected filesystem.

A filesystem defines the way that files are named, stored, organized, and accessed on logical volumes.
Many different filesystems exist, each providing unique features and data structures. However, all
filesystems share some common traits. First, they use the concepts of directories and files to organize and
store data. Directories are organizational structures that are used to group files together. In addition to
files, directories may contain other directories called subdirectories. Second, filesystems use some data
structure to point to the location of files on media. In addition, they store each data file written to media
in one or more file allocation units. These are referred to as clusters by some filesystems (e.g., File
Allocation Table [FAT], NT File System [NTFS]) and as blocks by other filesystems (e.g., UNIX and
Linux). A file allocation unit is simply a group of sectors, which are the smallest units that can be
accessed on media.

Some commonly used filesystems are as follows:

     ! FAT12.17 FAT12 is used only on floppy disks and FAT volumes smaller than 16 MB. FAT12
       uses a 12-bit file allocation table entry to address an entry in the filesystem.
     ! FAT16. MS-DOS, Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP, Windows Server 2003, and some UNIX OSs
       support FAT16 natively. FAT16 is also commonly used for multimedia devices such as digital
       cameras and audio players. FAT16 uses a 16-bit file allocation table entry to address an entry in
       the filesystem. FAT16 volumes are limited to a maximum size of 2 GB in MS-DOS and
       Windows 95/98. Windows NT and newer OSs increase the maximum volume size for FAT16 to
       4 GB.
     ! FAT32.18 Windows 95 Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Service Release 2 (OSR2),
       Windows 98/2000/XP, and Windows Server 2003 support FAT32 natively, as do some
       multimedia devices. FAT32 uses a 32-bit file allocation table entry to address an entry in the
       filesystem. The maximum FAT32 volume size is 2 terabytes (TB).
     ! NTFS. Windows NT/2000/XP and Windows Server 2003 support NTFS natively. NTFS is a
       recoverable filesystem, which means that it can automatically restore the consistency of the
       filesystem when errors occur. In addition, NTFS supports data compression and encryption, and
       allows user and group-level access permissions to be defined for data files and directories.19 The
       maximum NTFS volume size is 2 TB.
     ! High-Performance File System (HPFS). HPFS is supported natively by OS/2 and can be read
       by Windows NT 3.1, 3.5, and 3.51. HPFS builds on the directory organization of FAT by
       providing automatic sorting of directories. In addition, HPFS reduces the amount of lost disk
       space by utilizing smaller units of allocation. The maximum HPFS volume size is 64 GB.
