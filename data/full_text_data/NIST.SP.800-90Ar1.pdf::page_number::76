NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                                Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                       Generation Using Deterministic RBGs

                            Conversion and Auxiliary Routines

A.1 Bitstring to an Integer

Bitstring_to_integer (b1, b2,…, bn):
   Input:
       1. b1, b2,…, bn        The bitstring to be converted.
   Output:
       1. x                   The requested integer representation of the bitstring.
   Process:
       1. Let (b1, b2,…, bn) be the bits of a bitstring from leftmost to rightmost (i.e., most
          significant to least significant).
                 n
       2. x = ∑ 2( n−i)bi .
                i=1

       3.      Return (x).
In this Recommendation, the binary length of an integer x is defined as the smallest integer n
 €
satisfying x < 2n.

A.2 Integer to a Bitstring

Integer_to_bitstring (x):
   Input:
       1. x                   The non-negative integer to be converted.
   Output:
       1. b1, b2, ..., bn     The bitstring representation of the integer x.
   Process:
       1. Let (b1, b2, ..., bn) represent the bitstring, where b1 = 0 or 1, and b1 is the most
          significant bit, while bn is the least significant bit.
       2. For any integer n that satisfies x < 2n, the bits bi shall satisfy:
                      n
                x = ∑ 2( n−i)bi .
                      i=1

       3. Return (b1, b2, ..., bn).
In this Recommendation, the binary length of the integer x is defined as the smallest integer n
      €
that satisfies x < 2n.
