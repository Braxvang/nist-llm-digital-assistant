       NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                        Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
       November 2023

1086           reduces the susceptibility to authenticator compromises. Long passwords and passphrases can be
1087           used to increase the complexity of passwords.

1096   3.5.11. Authentication Feedback
1097             REQUIREMENT: 03.05.11
1098             Obscure feedback of authentication information during the authentication process.

1099             DISCUSSION
1100             The feedback from systems does not provide information that would allow unauthorized
1101             individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For example, for desktop or notebook
1102             computers with relatively large monitors, the threat may be significant (often referred to as
1103             shoulder surfing). For mobile devices with small displays, this threat may be less significant and
1104             is balanced against the increased likelihood of input errors due to small keyboards. Therefore,
1105             the means for obscuring the authenticator feedback is selected accordingly. Obscuring feedback
1106             includes displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input devices or displaying
1107             feedback for a limited time before fully obscuring it.

1111   3.5.12. Authenticator Management
1112             REQUIREMENT: 03.05.12
1113             a. Verify the identity of the individual, group, role, service, or device receiving the authenticator
1114                as part of the initial authenticator distribution.
1115             b. Establish initial authenticator content for any authenticators issued by the organization.
1116             c.   Establish and implement administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, for
1117                  lost, compromised, or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators.
1118             d. Change default authenticators at first use.
