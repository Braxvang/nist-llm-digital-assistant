SP 800-152                                               A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


FR:10.8 The CKMS design shall specify what self-tests are used by each cryptographic
module to detect errors and verify the integrity of the module.

FR:10.9 The CKMS design shall specify how each cryptographic module responds to
detected errors.

FR:10.10 The CKMS design shall specify its strategy for the repair or replacement of
failed cryptographic modules.

                           A Federal CKMS could automatically switch FCKMS
PF:10.7
                           processing to a backup cryptographic module upon detection
                           or suspicion of a cryptographic module failure.

10.7 Corruption and Loss of Keys and Metadata

Cryptographic keys and metadata can be corrupted or lost during transmission or in
storage. If a lost key, a corrupted key, or a key with corrupted metadata, has been used to
protect data, the security consequences should be evaluated, since a loss or compromise
of sensitive data could result.

Lost keys must be revoked, but may be recovered from reliable storage if used only for
processing already-protected information, and the risk of doing so is acceptable. Users
must be aware that the key may have been compromised, and the protected data is
suspect.

Corrupted keys and metadata should be either replaced or recovered from reliable storage
(e.g., backup) as soon as the corruption is detected if needed for continued operation.

FR:10.11 The CKMS design shall specify its procedures for backing-up and archiving
cryptographic keys and their metadata.

FR:10.1210.5 The CKMS design shall specify its procedures for restoring or replacing
corrupted keys and metadata that have been stored or transmitted.

                           A Federal CKMS shall support:
PR:10.25
                             a) Periodically checking for lost or corrupted keys and/or
                                metadata,
                             b) Reporting lost or corrupted keys and/or metadata to the
                                FCKMS management and affected entities,
                             c) Preventing the use of lost or corrupted keys and/or
                                metadata for applying cryptographic protection, and
                             d) Replacing lost or corrupted keys and/or metadata.
                           A Federal CKMS shall revoke lost keys as soon as detected
PR:10.26
                           or suspected.
