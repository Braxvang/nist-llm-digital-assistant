                                                                                               SECTION 2: RFID TECHNOLOGY



2.3.3.2 Singulation

Singulation is the process by which a reader identifies a particular tag. This capability is critical
whenever multiple tags are in close proximity. For instance, when a reader issues a command to modify a
tag’s memory, neighboring tags should not accidentally execute the same command. Similarly, when a
reader sends a query to a tag, the reader should not receive a response from multiple tags.

In the EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 standard, the singulation protocol requires the reader to broadcast
commands to all tags within its operating range. By issuing additional commands, the reader may limit
interrogation to tags with specific memory contents. Tags respond with a random number. Once the
reader acknowledges this number, verifying that no tag collision has occurred, the tag will transmit its
unique ID to the reader. The reader may then request another random number that it uses to address the
tag in subsequent communication. The random number has significantly fewer bits than the tag’s
identifier, which simplifies the processing of later transactions and prevents transmission of the unique
identifier by the reader.

Some RFID technologies do not support singulation. For example, ISO 11784/11785 animal tracking
tags have no collision detection or avoidance mechanism because multiple tags are not usually read in
close proximity for this type of application.

2.3.3.3 Signal Propagation Distance

The communications link between a tag and a reader typically is bi-directional. The reader transmits a
signal to a tag over the forward channel. The tag responds on the back channel, which is also called the
reverse channel or backscatter channel. When RFID systems use passive tags, signals on the forward
channel typically are much more powerful than those on the back channel. Therefore, signals on the
forward channel can be detected or properly received over longer distances. This difference has
important implications for RFID communications security, including both the vulnerability of RF
subsystem traffic and the mechanisms used to protect it. Some relevant operational ranges related to
various communications objectives are: 15

 Nominal operating range, which is the distance, often specified by standard, over which authorized
  transactions are expected to occur;
 Back channel eavesdropping range, which is the distance over which a rogue receiver can reliably
  interpret a tag’s response to a legitimate reader;
 Rogue skimming (or scanning) range, which is the distance over which a rogue reader operating
  above regulated power limits can reliably communicate with a tag;
 Rogue command range, which is the distance over which a rogue reader can execute a tag command
  that does not require the reader to successfully receive information from the tag;
 Forward channel eavesdropping range, which is the distance over which a rogue receiver can
  reliably listen to the transmissions of an authorized reader; and
 Forward channel traffic analysis range, which is the distance over which a rogue receiver can
  detect the presence of a reader’s signal without having to reliably interpret its content.
