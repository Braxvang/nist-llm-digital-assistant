                    Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


1. Introduction
Today's rapidly changing technical environment requires federal agencies to adopt a
minimum set of security controls to protect their information and information systems.
Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 200, Minimum Security Requirements
for Federal Information and Information Systems, specifies the minimum security
requirements for federal information and information systems in seventeen security-
related areas. Federal agencies must meet the minimum security requirements defined in
FIPS 200 through the use of the security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53,
Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems. NIST SP 800-53
contains the management, operational, and technical safeguards or countermeasures
prescribed for an information system. The controls selected or planned must be
documented in a system security plan. This document provides guidance for federal
agencies for developing system security plans for federal information systems.


1.1 Background
Title III of the E-Government Act, entitled the Federal Information Security Management
Act (FISMA), requires each federal agency to develop, document, and implement an
agency-wide information security program to provide information security for the
information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency,
including those provided or managed by another agency, contractor, or other source.
System security planning is an important activity that supports the system development
life cycle (SDLC) and should be updated as system events trigger the need for revision in
order to accurately reflect the most current state of the system. The system security plan
provides a summary of the security requirements for the information system and
describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements. The
plan also may reference other key security-related documents for the information system
such as a risk assessment, plan of action and milestones, accreditation decision letter,
privacy impact assessment, contingency plan, configuration management plan, security
configuration checklists, and system interconnection agreements as appropriate.


1.2 Target Audience
Program managers, system owners, and security personnel in the organization must
understand the system security planning process. In addition, users of the information
system and those responsible for defining system requirements should be familiar with
the system security planning process. Those responsible for implementing and managing
information systems must participate in addressing security controls to be applied to their
systems. This guidance provides basic information on how to prepare a system security
plan and is designed to be adaptable in a variety of organizational structures and used as
reference by those having assigned responsibility for activity related to security planning.
