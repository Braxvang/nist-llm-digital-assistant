NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                              Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems

         Note 2: Rules can be stated at high levels of abstraction (e.g., an organizational policy that defines the
         acceptable behavior of employees in performing their mission and business functions) or at low levels of
         abstraction (e.g., an operating system policy that defines the acceptable behavior of executing processes
         and the use of resources by those processes).

security relevance
The functions or constraints that are relied upon to directly or indirectly meet protection needs.
         Note: The term security relevance has been used to differentiate the role of system functions that singularly
         or in combination exhibit behavior, produce an outcome, or provide a capability to enforce authorized and
         intended system behavior or outcomes.

security requirement
A requirement that has security relevance.

security risk
The effect of uncertainty on objectives pertaining to asset loss and the associated consequences. [28]
         Note: [28] defines risk as the effect of uncertainty on objectives. Furthermore, risk can be either positive or
         negative.

security service
A security capability or function provided by an entity.

security specification
The requirements for the security-relevant portion of the system.
         Note: The security specification may be provided as a separate document or may be captured with a
         broader specification.

self-protection
The protection provided by an entity to ensure its own correct behavior and function despite adversity.
         Note: While an entity would ideally be able to provide all the self-protection necessary, in practice entities
         are limited in the extent that they can provide for their own protection without depending on one or more
         other entities.

service
Performance of activities, work, or duties. [4]
         Note 1: A service is self-contained, coherent, discrete, and can be composed of other services.
         Note 2: A service is generally an intangible product.

situational awareness
Perception of elements in the system and/or environment and a comprehension of their meaning, which could
include a projection of the future status of perceived elements and the uncertainty associated with that status. [87]

specification
An information item that identifies, in a complete, precise, verifiable manner, the requirements, design, behavior, or
other expected characteristics of a system, service, or process. [128]
See security specification.

stage
Period within the life cycle of an entity that relates to the state of its description or realization. [4]
         Note 1: As used in this document, stages relate to major progress and achievement milestones of the entity
         throughout its life cycle.
         Note 2: Stages often overlap.
