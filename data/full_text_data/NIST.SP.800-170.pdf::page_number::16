 infrastructure, the President issued Executive Order (EO)
 13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, in
 February 2013. This Executive Order directed NIST to work
 with stakeholders to develop a voluntary framework – based
 on existing standards, guidelines, and practices − for reducing
 cybersecurity risks to critical infrastructure.
    The Cybersecurity Framework will provide a prioritized,
 flexible, repeatable, performance-based, and cost-effective
 approach, including information security measures and controls
 to help owners and operators of critical infrastructure and other
 interested entities to identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity-
 related risk while protecting business confidentiality, individual
 privacy, and civil liberties. To enable technical innovation
 and account for organizational differences, the Cybersecurity
 Framework will not prescribe particular technological solutions
 or specifications.
   In FY 2013, NIST worked with a diverse stakeholder
 community to develop the Framework through an open public
 process. This process included:
      Issuing a Request for Information (RFI) in the Federal
        Register in February 2013

      Conducting five open workshops to provide the public
        with additional opportunities to provide input. These
        workshops were hosted at the Department of Commerce
        in Washington, D.C. (April 2013), Carnegie Mellon
        University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (May 2013), the
