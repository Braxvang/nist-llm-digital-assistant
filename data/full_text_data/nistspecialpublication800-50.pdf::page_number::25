                      Figure 3-2: Model 2 - Partially Decentralized Program Management

This partially decentralized program management model is often deployed by agencies that:

   Are relatively large or have a fairly decentralized structure with clear responsibilities assigned to both
    the headquarters (central) and unit levels;
   Have functions that are spread over a wide geographical area; or
   Have organizational units with diverse missions, so that awareness and training programs may differ
    significantly, based on unit-specific needs.
Model 3: Fully Decentralized Program Management Model (Centralized Policy; Distributed
Strategy and Implementation)

In this model, the central security awareness and training authority (CIO/IT security program manager)
disseminates broad policy and expectations regarding security awareness and training requirements, but
gives responsibility for executing the entire program to other organizational units. This model normally
uses a series of distributed authority directives, driven from the central authority. This normally means
creation of a subsystem of CIOs and IT security program managers subordinate to the central CIO and IT
security officer.
