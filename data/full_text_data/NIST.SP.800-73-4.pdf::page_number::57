B.1.4 Authentication Using OCC (OCC-AUTH)

The OCC-AUTH authentication mechanism is implemented by performing on-card biometric
comparison (OCC) over secure messaging. The PIV Application authenticates the PIV Card as part of
the process of establishing secure messaging. When the live-scan fingerprint biometric is supplied to
the card for OCC over secure messaging, both the request and the response are protected using
message authentication codes (MAC), allowing the PIV Application on the local system to verify that
the response has not been altered and that it was created by the PIV Card that was authenticated
during the establishment of secure messaging.

The OCC-AUTH authentication mechanism is performed by establishing secure messaging as
described in Section 4 of Part 2 and then performing the VERIFY command, as illustrated in Figure
B-6.
