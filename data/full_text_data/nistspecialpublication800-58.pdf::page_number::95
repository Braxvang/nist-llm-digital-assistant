NIST SP 800-58                                             Voice Over IP Security
    _________________________________________________________________________

   5. Can I use my existing network equipment (routers, hubs, etc.) for a VOIP
      network?

          No, except possibly for home use. VOIP demands high performance because
          voice communications must be in real time. A few seconds delay in data
          transmission is accepted and common, but a similar delay in a telephone
          conversation would make the system unacceptable to users. VOIP network
          equipment uses special protocols to over come the performance problems
          involved in transmitting voice over the Internet. Existing local area network
          cabling can be used.

   6. Does VOIP require additional phone lines or new phone numbers.
         No, VOIP systems can be tied in to existing connections,

   7. Can I use VOIP like a normal telephone?

          Yes, if the right hardware and software is installed. Some basic VOIP
          services are available from messaging programs such as AIM and Microsoft
          Netmeeting, but these programs cannot be used to dial telephone numbers.
          VOIP systems, coupled with a VOIP service provider, enable users to enter
          ordinary telephone numbers to make calls across the Internet.

   8. Do both parties to a call need to have VOIP?

          No, VOIP service providers translate VOIP calls to and from a form that is
          carried on the conventional telephone network using IP/TDM gateways, so
          either party may use VOIP or conventional equipment.

   9. How does the sound quality of VOIP compare with traditional systems?

          More recent VOIP systems have sound quality equivalent to conventional
          phones, especially if standalone VOIP phones are used. A “softphone” may
          have packet delay or other quality of service issues if used on a heavily loaded
          PC.

   10. What is a VOIP “softphone”?

          The term softphone refers to a telephone capability implemented on an
          ordinary PC, using only special software and a microphone/headset that plugs
          into the PC’s audio ports. As noted in the body of this publication, though,
          softphones should not be used where security or privacy are a concern because
          of the ease with which they can be attacked. These systems are also more
          vulnerable to denial of service attacks from worms and viruses.
