GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



add a legal disclaimer to all incoming and outgoing messages, ensuring recipients understand the legal
weight (or lack thereof) of the emails received from or through the organization.

Appropriate legal, privacy, personnel, and human resources authorities should be consulted when forming
the policy. Inevitably, this means having the policy reviewed by experts to ensure that it is legally correct
and does not infringe upon the rights of employees. Additionally, it is important to investigate all areas of
an organization to determine how workers go about their work and what level of security is most
appropriate. Completely restricting access to Internet resources might solve most security issues at a
stroke, but this is usually an unacceptable tradeoff. This is where email filtering tools can help, enabling
security policies to be more easily converted from theory into practice.

As previously mentioned, personal email accounts are problematic, especially those accessed via a Web
browser that tend to bypass the email content filtering controls. In particular, if a user is using an SSL-
encrypted Web page for personal email access and the organization does not decrypt and analyze SSL-
encrypted HTTPS traffic, the content may be allowed out or in even though it would not be if it went
through normal channels. Many organizations also allow encrypted protocols outbound (e.g., from their
internal network to the Internet) such as SSH or IPsec that can also be used to tunnel traffic in or out of
the organization without the restrictions of filtering.

If an organization allows mail protocols, such as SMTP, outbound to the Internet for all internal users,
content filtering may be bypassed by users setting up their own mail servers. Organizations should be
aware that certain products and applications use SMTP email for communications. It is not uncommon in
large organizations for a significant percentage of the outbound email traffic to be generated by servers
other than the centralized enterprise mail servers. Often these emails are generated from electronic
commerce applications communicating with customers or business partners. One way to address the
problem is to set up a mail gateway or application proxy at the perimeter that does content filtering on all
email, even those messages generated by or destined to servers other than the centralized enterprise mail
servers. Section 7 provides additional information on network architectures and mail gateway
placements.

6.2.3   User Awareness

In addition to using anti-virus software and/or other malware scanning tools, as well as content filtering
software, organizations should educate users about the dangers posed by email-borne malware and
effective ways of avoiding threats, including the following actions:

 Never open attachments from unknown senders.
 Never open attachments with suspicious or potentially harmful names or file extensions (e.g.,
  attachment.txt.vbs, attachment.exe) from known or unknown senders.
 Be suspicious of emails from known senders in which the subject line or content appears to be
  inappropriate for the existing relationship (e.g., an email with the subject “I love you” from a
  professional colleague) or generic subjects (e.g., “Look at this, it’s interesting”).
 Scan all attachments with malware scanning software before opening, preferably by configuring the
  scanning software to automatically perform this task.
 Update the signature database of the malware scanning software at least on a daily basis or when
  there is a malware outbreak.
 Warn users about malware outbreaks and how to identify emails that might contain malware.
