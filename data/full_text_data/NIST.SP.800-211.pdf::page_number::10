    The year marked a decade of progress by the NIST-managed National Initiative
    for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), to help the world address the human element
    of cybersecurity from the classroom to the workplace. Tackling the shortage of
    cybersecurity talent has become an even more urgent priority for NIST and its
    collaborators, with FY 2019 being an especially productive year.
    We kept our promise to pick up the pace, and we are excited to see what Fiscal Year
    2020 has in store. We invite you to learn more about these programs and to join us as we
    continue to build a better future on these foundations!
