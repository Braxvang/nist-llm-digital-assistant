                                                                  GUIDELINES ON FIREWALLS AND FIREWALL POLICY


Identify all requirements that should be considered when determining which firewall to implement.

There are many considerations that organizations should include in their firewall selection and planning
processes. Organizations need to determine which network areas need to be protected, and which types of
firewall technologies will be most effective for the types of traffic that require protection. Several
important performance considerations also exist, as well as concerns regarding the integration of the
firewall into existing network and security infrastructures. Additionally, firewall solution design involves
requirements relating to physical environment and personnel as well as consideration of possible future
needs, such as plans to adopt new IPv6 technologies or virtual private networks (VPN).

Create rulesets that implement the organization’s firewall policy while supporting firewall
performance.

Firewall rulesets should be as specific as possible with regards to the network traffic they control. To
create a ruleset involves determining what types of traffic are required, including protocols the firewall
may need to use for management purposes. The details of creating rulesets vary widely by type of firewall
and specific products, but many firewalls can have their performance improved by optimizing firewall
rulesets. For example, some firewalls check traffic against rules in a sequential manner until a match is
found; for these firewalls, rules that have the highest chance of matching traffic patterns should be placed
at the top of the list wherever possible.

Manage firewall architectures, policies, software, and other components throughout the life of the
firewall solutions.

There are many aspects to firewall management. For example, choosing the type or types of firewalls to
deploy and their positions within the network can significantly affect the security policies that the
firewalls can enforce. Policy rules may need to be updated as the organization’s requirements change,
such as when new applications or hosts are implemented within the network. Firewall component
performance also needs to be monitored to enable potential resource issues to be identified and addressed
before components become overwhelmed. Logs and alerts should also be continuously monitored to
identify threats—both successful and unsuccessful. Firewall rulesets and policies should be managed by a
formal change management control process because of their potential to impact security and business
operations, with ruleset reviews or tests performed periodically to ensure continued compliance with the
organization’s policies. Firewall software should be patched as vendors provide updates to address
vulnerabilities.
