NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                           Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems

system life cycle
Period that begins when a system is conceived and ends when the system is no longer available for use. [24]
See life cycle stages.

system security requirement
System requirement that has security relevance. System security requirements define the protection capabilities
provided by the system, the performance and behavioral characteristics exhibited by the system, and the evidence
used to determine that the system security requirements have been satisfied.
         Note 1: Due to the complexity of system security, system security requirements have several types and
         purposes, including (1) structural security requirements that express the passive aspects of the protection
         capability provided by the system architecture and (2) functional security requirements that express the
         active aspects of the protection capability provided by the engineered features and devices (e.g., security
         mechanisms, inhibits, controls, safeguards, overrides, and countermeasures).
         Note 2: Each system security requirement is expressed in a manner that makes verification possible via
         analysis, observation, test, inspection, measurement, or other defined and achievable means.

systems engineering
A transdisciplinary and integrative approach to enable the successful realization, use, and retirement of engineered
systems, using systems principles and concepts, and scientific, technological, and management methods. [3]
Interdisciplinary approach governing the total technical and managerial effort required to transform a set of
stakeholder needs, expectations, and constraints into a solution and to support that solution throughout its life. [24]

systems security engineer
Individual who practices the discipline of systems security engineering, regardless of their formal title. Additionally,
the term systems security engineer refers to multiple individuals who operate on the same team or cooperating
teams.

systems security engineering
A transdisciplinary and integrative approach to enable the successful secure realization, use, and retirement of
engineered systems using systems, security, and other principles and concepts, as well as scientific, technological,
and management methods. Systems security engineering is a subdiscipline of systems engineering.

tampering
An intentional but unauthorized act resulting in the modification of a system, components of systems, its intended
behavior, or data. [89]

task
Required, recommended, or permissible action intended to contribute to the achievement of one or more outcomes
of a process. [4]

threat
Potential cause of unacceptable asset loss and the undesirable consequences or impact of such a loss.
         Note: The specific causes of asset loss can arise from a variety of conditions and events related to adversity,
         typically referred to as disruptions, hazards, or threats. Regardless of the specific term used, the basis of
         asset loss constitutes all forms of intentional, unintentional, accidental, incidental, misuse, abuse, error,
         weakness, defect, fault, and/or failure events and associated conditions.

traceability
Discernible association among two or more logical entities, such as requirements, system elements, verifications, or
tasks. [90]
