      February 2023                                                                         Reference Architecture

654   forensic investigator to overcome the challenge, as illustrated in questions Q2-c and Q2-d. If the
655   answer to this question is “no,” then no further analysis is required. If the answer to question Q2-
656   c or Q2-d is “yes,” then the analysis will continue to determine: “If the challenge were overcome,
657   would that make it easier to conduct a cloud forensic investigation on the functional capability?”
658   Using this methodology, it is possible to determine in a well-defined, structured fashion whether
659   it would be easier to conduct a cloud forensic investigation on a functional capability if the
660   forensic challenge were overcome. As a result, the flowchart will help cloud designers, forensic
661   investigators, and other interested parties focus specifically on those functional capabilities that
662   are affected by a specific cloud forensic challenge.
663   The process of traversing the flowchart involves asking questions about the particular challenge
664   and capability pair that is being analyzed. Starting at the top right of the flowchart (labeled “Q2-
665   a”), each box asks a question about the challenge or the capability. The answer to each question
666   – YES or NO – then leads to either another box with a question or to one of the circles shown in
667   Table 1.

                               the challenge DOES affect the capability.

                               questions, if the final answer is a NO marked with a purple circle, then the
                               challenge DOES NOT affect the capability for reasons explained in
                               NOTE 1 and NOTE 2, below.

671   To determine whether the forensic challenge affects the functional capability, three fundamental
672   types of questions are asked:
673       1. Question 1 (Q1) – If the challenge were overcome, would that make it easier to conduct a
674          cloud forensic investigation on the functional capability? Note that the term “cloud
675          forensic investigation” means the identification, acquisition, preservation, examination,
676          interpretation, and reporting of potential digital evidence in the cloud. When analyzing
677          Question 1, it is narrowly considered only with regard to the particular functional
678          capability, ignoring all other capabilities as if they do not exist. So, the question really
679          asked is: If the challenge were overcome, would that make it easier to conduct a cloud
680          forensic investigation on this functional capability only while ignoring other capabilities?
681       2. Question 2 (Q2-a, Q2-b, Q2-c, and Q2-d) – These questions relate only to the challenges
682          and not capabilities. The purpose of these questions is to determine whether the challenge
683          deals with technical or non-technical issues and if either technical solutions or non-
684          technical solutions significantly amplify the ability to overcome the challenge.
