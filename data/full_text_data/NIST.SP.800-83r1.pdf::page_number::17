                                        GUIDE TO MALWARE INCIDENT PREVENTION AND HANDLING FOR DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS


3.      Malware Incident Prevention

This section presents recommendations for preventing malware incidents within an organization. The
main elements of prevention are policy, awareness, vulnerability mitigation, threat mitigation, and
defensive architecture. Ensuring that policies address malware prevention provides a basis for
implementing preventive controls. Establishing and maintaining general malware awareness programs for
all users, as well as specific awareness training for the IT staff directly involved in malware prevention–
related activities, are critical to reducing the number of incidents that occur through human error.
Expending effort on vulnerability mitigation can eliminate some possible attack vectors. Implementing a
combination of threat mitigation techniques and tools, such as antivirus software and firewalls, can
prevent threats from successfully attacking hosts and networks. Also, using defensive architectures such
as sandboxing, browser separation, and segregation through virtualization can reduce the impact of
compromises. Sections 3.1 through 3.5 address each of these areas in detail and explain that organizations
should implement guidance from each category of recommendations to create an effective layered
defense against malware.

When planning an approach to malware prevention, organizations should be mindful of the attack vectors
that are most likely to be used currently and in the near future.4 They should also consider how well-
controlled their hosts are (e.g., managed environment, non-managed environment); this has significant
bearing on the effectiveness of various preventive approaches. In addition, organizations should
incorporate existing capabilities, such as antivirus software deployments and patch management
programs, into their malware prevention efforts. However, organizations should be aware that no matter
how much effort they put into malware incident prevention, incidents will still occur (e.g., previously
unknown types of threats, human error). For this reason, as described in Section 4, organizations should
have robust malware incident handling capabilities to limit the damage that malware can cause and
restore data and services efficiently.

3.1     Policy

Organizations should ensure that their policies address prevention of malware incidents. These policy
statements should be used as the basis for additional malware prevention efforts, such as user and IT staff
awareness, vulnerability mitigation, threat mitigation, and defensive architecture (described in Sections
3.2 through 3.5, respectively). If an organization does not state malware prevention considerations clearly
in its policies, it is unlikely to perform malware prevention activities consistently and effectively
throughout the organization. Malware prevention–related policy should be as general as possible to
provide flexibility in policy implementation and to reduce the need for frequent policy updates, but also
specific enough to make the intent and scope of the policy clear. Although some organizations have
separate malware policies, many malware prevention considerations belong in other policies, such as
acceptable use policies, so a separate malware policy might duplicate some of the content of other
policies. 5 Malware prevention–related policy should include provisions related to remote workers—both
those using hosts controlled by the organization and those using hosts outside of the organization’s
control (e.g., contractor computers, employees’ home computers, business partners’ computers, mobile
devices).

      product vendors, incident response organizations, Information Sharing and Analysis Centers)

      For example, many acceptable use policies state that the organization’s computing resources should be used only in support
      of the organization. Personal use of computing resources is a common source of malware incidents; however, because there
      are several other reasons why an organization might want to restrict personal use of computing resources, this policy
      consideration is more appropriately addressed in the organization’s acceptable use policy than a malware policy.
