                                                               GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


to the Internet is a common use for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). BGP version 4 with multi-protocol
extensions supports both IPv4 and IPv6. Each BGP update contains only changes to the network
topology. BGP is efficient and flexible. Multi-protocol BGP is standardized in RFC 4760.


  3.6.2   Security for Routing Protocols

Routing protocols can be subject to threats such as unauthorized updates for either IPv4 or IPv6 routes.
Security capabilities have been designed for routing protocols to mitigate unauthorized update threats.
Some IPv6 routing protocols rely on similar mechanisms to those in IPv4 for protection, while others
have incorporated IPsec for protection. These security mechanisms do not provide end-to-end security
for routing protocols across multiple hops, because while they provide integrity assurance for routing
protocol messages between nodes, they do not verify the integrity of messages received from other nodes
that are not part of a security association. This is a major security concern for EGPs and a somewhat
lesser one for IGPs.

RIPng

RIP for IPv4 uses an MD5-based integrity mechanism; this was removed from RIPng. RIPng offers no
integrity assurance features. Per RFC 2080, RIPng leverages IPsec for security. It should be noted that
hardware vendors have not incorporated IPsec features as a configuration option, instead relying on native
IPv6 IPsec support from the operating platform for protection. RIPng is suitable only for small, private
networks where the threat of routing attacks is substantially reduced.

OSPFv3

Securing OSPFv2 in a dual stack environment will protect neither the OSPFv3 protocol nor the OSPFv3
routing table. OSPFv2 allows null, password-based, or cryptographic authentication using MD5-based
integrity for routing updates. The authentication fields found in OSPFv2 have been removed from the
OSPFv3 packet for IPv6, so MD5 is not an authentication option. OSPFv3 offers no integrity assurance
features itself and relies on IPsec AH or ESP for authentication, integrity, and confidentiality. Note that
OSPFv3 uses unicast and multicast, and IKE does not work with multicast, so the default method is to use
manual keying. Since replay protection cannot be provided using manual keying, OSPFv3 messages are
vulnerable to replay attacks, which can lead to DoS attacks, Central Processing Unit (CPU) overload, and
localized routing loops. IPsec for OSPFv3 is detailed in RFC 4552.

With routing protocols, routing integrity is usually a greater concern than confidentiality. The ESP
parameter NULL indicating no encryption is generally regarded to be an acceptable choice for OSPF
security.

IS-IS and EIGRP

Both IS-IS and EIGRP support simple MD5-based integrity for protecting IPv6 routing updates, similar to
protecting routing updates for IS-IS and EIGRP for IPv4.

BGP

The use of BGP as an inter-AS routing protocol means that it can be subject to serious threats. Three
mechanisms exist to mitigate threats to BGP. The first is the use of MD5-based integrity to protect
routing updates. The second mechanism to mitigate threats to BGP is GTSM (RFC 5082). GTSM is a
simple security mechanism for rejecting spoofed BGP messages based on their IP TTL or Hop Limit.
