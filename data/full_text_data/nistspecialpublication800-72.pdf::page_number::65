Appendix B. Glossary

     Acquisition – A process by which digital evidence is duplicated, copied, or imaged.

     Analysis – The examination of acquired data for its significance and probative value to the
     case.

     Authentication Mechanism – Hardware or software-based mechanisms that force users to
     prove their identity before accessing data on a device.

     Bluetooth – A wireless protocol that allows two Bluetooth enabled devices to communicate
     with each other within a short distance (e.g., 30 ft.).

     Brute Force Password Attack – A method of accessing an obstructed device through
     attempting multiple combinations of numeric/alphanumeric passwords.

     Buffer Overflow Attack – A method of overloading a predefined amount of space in a buffer,
     which can potentially overwrite and corrupt memory in data.

     Chain of Custody – A process that tracks the movement of evidence through its collection,
     safeguarding, and analysis lifecycle by documenting each person who handled the evidence,
     the date/time it was collected or transferred, and the purpose for the transfer.

     Compressed File – A file reduced in size through the application of a compression algorithm,
     commonly performed to save disk space. The act of compressing a file will make it
     unreadable to most programs until the file is uncompressed. Most common compression
     utilities are PKZIP and WinZip with an extension of .zip.

     Cradle – A docking station, which creates an interface between a user’s PC and PDA, and
     enables communication and battery recharging.

     Cyclical Redundancy Check – A method to ensure data has not been altered after being sent
     through a communication channel.

     Deleted File – A file that has been logically, but not necessarily physically, erased from the
     operating system, perhaps to eliminate potentially incriminating evidence. Deleting files does
     not always necessarily eliminate the possibility of recovering all or part of the original data.

     Digital Evidence – Electronic information stored or transmitted in binary form.

     Duplicate Digital Evidence – A duplicate is an accurate digital reproduction of all data
     objects contained on the original physical item and associated media (e.g., flash memory,
     RAM, ROM).

     Electromagnetic Interference – An electromagnetic disturbance that interrupts, obstructs, or
     otherwise degrades or limits the effective performance of electronics/electrical equipment.

     Electronic Evidence – Information and data of investigative value that is stored on or
     transmitted by an electronic device.
