   4. The modulus is composite, but not a power of a prime
   5. The modulus has no factors smaller than 752. Testing for additional factors is
      allowed.
It is possible for an adversary to maliciously construct an invalid candidate RSA public
key that passes all the above specified plausibility tests. However, a system error that
results in an invalid candidate RSA public key is likely to be detected. The plausibility
tests detect some invalid candidate RSA public keys that are easily broken (e.g., where
the public exponent is one, or where the modulus is very easily factored).
The following is an example of a method that includes all the specified tests:
   a) Length of the modulus: Check that the length of the modulus n (nlen) is a length
      specified in FIPS 186-3. If the desired security strength is known, then the length
      shall be appropriate for that security strength.

   b) Size of the public exponent e: Check that the value of the public key e lies in the
      range specified in FIPS 186-3. If the desired security strength is known, then the
      range shall be appropriate for that security strength.
   c) Oddness: Check that n and e are odd.
   d) Compositeness: Check that n fails an Approved primality test. Approved
      primality tests are provided in FIPS 186-3. If n is valid, the test will indicate that n
      is a composite number, as the Approved probable prime tests prove
      compositeness when they fail to indicate that the number is a probable prime.

   e) Not a power of a prime: Check that n is not a power of a prime, i.e., there are no
      integers b ≥ 2, c ≥ 2 such that n = bc. This can be done by obtaining an output of
      COMPOSITE AND NOT A POWER OF A PRIME using the enhanced
      Miller-Rabin primality test in FIPS 186-3.
   f) No very small factors: Check that GCD (n, r) = 1 where r is (in decimal).

       Note that the value of r is the product of the 132 smallest odd primes, from 3 to
       751. This value is used to determine that the factors of n (i.e., p and q) are not less
       than 751. More potential small factors greater than 751 may also be tested in a
       similar fashion, if desired.

6 Assurance of Private Key Possession
The owner of a digital signature key pair is the entity authorized to use the private key of
that key pair when acting as a signatory, generating digital signatures that can be verified
with the public key. Authorization to use the private key to generate signatures does not
