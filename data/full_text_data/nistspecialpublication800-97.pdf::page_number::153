                                    ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



11.   Future Directions

As the IEEE 802.11 protocol is used in increasingly diverse and demanding environments, additional
requirements appear that necessitate extensions to the IEEE 802.11i security measures. Timelines for
these, and other 802.11 standards, can be found at
http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/11/Reports/802.11_Timelines.htm. Currently, there are two IEEE
802.11 Working Groups that are addressing security-related standards.

11.1 IEEE 802.11r: Fast Roaming/Fast BSS Transition

When an IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN is used to support the connection to a voice terminal, each time a
wireless device moves enough to require a transition from one AP to another, this necessitates a new
authentication exchange as well as another 4-Way Handshake. These exchanges can result in latency
severe enough to cause a call to be dropped or at the very least to appear unresponsive. Even the use of
Pre-Authentication and PMKSA caching are not enough to solve this problem. IEEE 802.11 Task Group
R was formed to define a secure mechanism that will enable more rapid transitions. Completion of the
IEEE 802.11r standard is targeted for March 2007.

11.2 IEEE 802.11w: Protected Management Frames

IEEE 802.11i added effective security protections to IEEE 802.11 wireless communications. However,
those protections are only provided for data frames exchanged by a STA and an AP. This leaves another
category of communications, management frames, vulnerable to attack and manipulation by unauthorized
parties. Those management frames that are exchanged before authentication and key establishment take
place cannot be protected, since the requisite security mechanisms have not yet been put into place. Other
management frames (e.g., deauthentication and disassociation) could make use of the IEEE 802.11 RSNA
for protection. Without this protection, an adversary could inject these management frames, causing a
STA to be unwillingly removed from the wireless network. Defining the mechanisms to provide this
protection is the motivation behind the formation of IEEE 802.11 Task Group W. 802.11w has gone to
letter ballot, the first major milestone in becoming a standard; completion of the IEEE 802.11w standard
is targeted for March 2008.
