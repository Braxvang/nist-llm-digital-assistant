SP 800-130                                                              August 2013



Current cryptographic algorithms should be implemented so that they can be augmented
or replaced when needed. [SP 800-57-part1] and [SP 800-131A] specify NIST-
recommended lifetimes of government-approved cryptographic algorithms. A CKMS
should only use algorithms whose security lifetime will cover the anticipated lifetime of
the CKMS and the information that it protects. If the CKMS is intended to remain in
service beyond the security lifetimes of its cryptographic algorithms and key lengths,
then there should be a transition strategy for migration to stronger algorithms and key
lengths in the future.

When transitioning from one cryptographic algorithm to another, a smooth transition
often requires the capability to support the use of at least two algorithms (perhaps with
different key lengths) simultaneously so that interoperability can be maintained until all
participants have the capability to operate with the new algorithm. In this case, the
cryptographic protocols should be designed to identify and negotiate which algorithm
will be used in a particular key establishment transaction. It should also be noted that the
security of data protected by different algorithms at different times is no greater than the
weakest algorithm. Therefore, it may be best to transition as quickly as feasible.

FR:7.1 The CKMS design shall specify how interoperability requirements across device
interfaces are to be satisfied.

FR:7.2 The CKMS design shall specify the standards, protocols, interfaces, supporting
services, commands and data formats required to interoperate with the applications it is
intended to support.

FR:7.3 The CKMS design shall specify the standards, protocols, interfaces, supporting
services, commands and data formats required to interoperate with other CKMS for
which interoperability is intended.

FR:7.4 The CKMS design shall specify all external interfaces to applications and other
CKMS.

FR:7.5 The CKMS design shall specify all provisions for transitions to new,
interoperable, peer devices.

FR:7.6 The CKMS design shall specify any provisions provided for upgrading or
replacing its cryptographic algorithms.

FR:7.7 The CKMS design shall specify how interoperability will be supported during
cryptographic algorithm transition periods.

FR:7.8 The CKMS design shall specify its protocols for negotiating the use of
cryptographic algorithms and key lengths.
