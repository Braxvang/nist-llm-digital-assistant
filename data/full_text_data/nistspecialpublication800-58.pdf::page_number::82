      organization’s technology infrastructure. There is no easy “one size fits all”
      solution to the issues discussed in these chapters. The use of VPNs, vs. ALG-like
      solutions and the choice of SIP or H.323 are decisions that must be made based on
      the specific nature of the current network and the VOIP network to be installed.

      VOIP can be done securely, but the path is not smooth. It will likely be several
      years before standards issues are settled and VOIP systems become a mainstream
      commodity. Until then, organizations must proceed cautiously, and not assume
      that VOIP components are just more peripherals for the local network. Above all,
      it is important to keep in mind the unique requirements of VOIP, acquiring the
      right hardware and software to meet the challenges of VOIP security.
