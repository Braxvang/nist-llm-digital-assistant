458   A PIV Card Application MAY use a subset of the cryptographic algorithms defined in SP 800-
459   78. Tag 0xAC encodes the cryptographic algorithms supported by the PIV Card Application. The
460   encoding of tag 0xAC SHALL be as specified in Table 5. Each instance of tag 0x80 SHALL
461   encapsulate one algorithm. The presence of algorithm identifier '27' or '2E' indicates that the
462   corresponding cipher suite is supported by the PIV Card Application for secure messaging and
463   that the PIV Card Application possesses a PIV Secure Messaging key of the appropriate size for
464   the specified cipher suite. Tag 0xAC SHALL be present and indicate algorithm identifier 0x27 or
465   0x2E (but not both) when the PIV Card Application supports secure messaging.
