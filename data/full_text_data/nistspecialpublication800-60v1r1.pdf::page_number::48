Lines of Business   “Lines of business” or “areas of operation” describe the purpose of
                    government in functional terms or describe the support functions that the
                    government must conduct in order to effectively deliver services to
                    citizens. Lines of business relating to the purpose of government and the
                    mechanisms the government uses to achieve its purposes tend to be
                    mission-based. Lines of business relating to support functions and
                    resource management functions that are necessary to conduct
                    government operations tend to be common to most agencies. The
                    recommended information types provided in NIST SP 800-60 are
