                                                                           GUIDELINES ON ACTIVE CONTENT AND MOBILE CODE



4.     Technology Related Risks

Risk is a measure of the likelihood and the consequence of events or acts that could cause a system
compromise, including the unauthorized disclosure, destruction, removal, modification, or interruption of
system assets [NIST02]. Many computer technologies involve risk, since they can introduce some degree
of vulnerability to a system due to flaws or weaknesses in the technologies’ design, implementation, or
configuration. More generally, a security vulnerability is the absence of or weakness in the security
controls for a system that could result in a violation of the system’s security policy. While technology-
related vulnerabilities are often subtle and do not affect either the overall functionality or performance of
a product, they may be discovered and exploited by an attacker. The impact of a vulnerability on an
individual or organization is the subject of a risk analysis and can vary widely, depending on such factors
as the value of the resource affected or the perceived harm to one’s reputation. 6

To better explain the range of risks associated with active content, some popular active content
technologies and their vulnerabilities are described in the remainder of this section. The motivation
behind these technologies is to improve functionality and gain flexibility for the user. In a Web
application, improvements often involve moving code processing away from the Web server onto the
client’s Web browser. As pointed out in the previous sections, allowing remote systems to run arbitrary
code on a local system poses serious security risks. While most of the technologies to be discussed
provide a useful capability, many of them can also be exploited by an attacker.


         Privacy Risks: Security does not necessarily imply privacy. One may securely transmit
         personal or credit card information to a company, but information about who within or outside
         the company has access to the information is generally unknown. Although privacy breaches
         directly affect individuals, they can also affect the organizations for which the affected
         individuals work. For example, the inkling, unsubstantiated or not, that a company’s CEO is
         suffering from a serious illness can cause its stock value to plummet.

         Some organizations link records from different sources to target marketing efforts and to
         assess risks. When taken collectively, such information constitutes an electronic dossier on an
         individual, which in the wrong hands can cause harm, even if it is not completely accurate. No
         one can learn the full extent of the information kept on them by various organizations, much
         less verify accuracy or control access. Much of the information collected over the Internet
         occurs in the background, without the individual's knowledge or consent. For example, many
         organizations have distributed free plug-ins or other software containing spyware –
         functionality that, once installed, periodically sends reports back to the company about its use
         and its environment.

         Besides spyware, Web site developers have a myriad of tools at their disposal to collect
         personal information. They include tracking site use by storing persistent information known
         as cookies via a user’s browser; embedding invisible single-pixel images within HTML called
         Web bugs that serve as a signal of page access; and invoking the communication capabilities
         of downloaded scripts and program components.
