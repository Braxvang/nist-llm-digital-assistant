                                  ENGINEERING-DRIVEN SOLUTIONS
          The effectiveness of any engineering discipline first requires a thorough
          understanding of the problem and consideration of all feasible solutions before
          acting to solve the identified problem. To maximize the effectiveness of systems
          security engineering, the security requirements for the protection against asset loss
          must be driven by business, mission, and all other stakeholder asset loss concerns.
          The security requirements are defined and managed as a well-defined set of
          engineering requirements and cannot be addressed independently or after the fact.
          In the context of systems security engineering, the term protection has a broad
          scope and is primarily focused on the concept of assets and asset loss resulting in
          unacceptable consequences. The protection capability provided by a system goes
          beyond prevention and aims to control the events, conditions, and consequences
          that constitute asset loss. It is achieved in the form of the specific capability and
          constraints on system architecture, design, function, implementation, construction,
          selection of technology, methods, and tools and must be “engineered in” as part of
          the system life cycle process.
          Understanding stakeholder asset protection needs (including assets that they own
          and assets that they do not own but must protect) and expressing those needs
          through a set of well-defined security requirements is an investment in the
          organization’s mission and business success in the modern age of global commerce,
          powerful computing systems, and network connectivity.
