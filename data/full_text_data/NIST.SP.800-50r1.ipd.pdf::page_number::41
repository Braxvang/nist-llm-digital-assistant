       NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                           Building a Cybersecurity and

1145   Elements of the CPLP communications should include:
1146      •   An overview of the CPLP strategy and ownership
1147      •   Goals, objectives, and assessment processes
1148      •   A list of key roles and their respective responsibilities, including:
1149              o Senior leadership and executives
1150              o Managers and supervisors
1151              o Human Resources (HR), Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO),
1152                and labor relations
1153              o Office of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) or budget analyst
1154              o Chief Learning Officer (CLO) (agency or organization level)
1155              o Learning Program Managers and team members
1156              o Subject-matter experts
1157      •   Budget overview
1158      •   Key deliverables and high-level schedule
1159      •   Measurements and metrics
1160      •   Reporting methods and frequency
1161   It is essential for everyone involved in the implementation of the program to understand their
1162   roles and responsibilities. Most organizations may find it helpful to tailor their messaging based
1163   on the audience. A few examples of audiences and their roles include:
1164      •   Senior leadership and executives (e.g., CIO, CISO, SAISO, SAOP, and CPO) –
1165          Communications may include a high-level summary of the CPLP strategic plan,
1166          including the goals for and phases of the yearlong program. The senior leadership needs a
1167          good sense of the overall program so that they can support the allocation of budget and
1168          personnel. Ensure that senior leaders are provided with appropriate messaging so that
1169          they can avoid harmful language, such as “users are the weakest link.”
1170      •   Managers and supervisors – Communications should emphasize the benefit of building
1171          a positive cybersecurity and privacy culture and help the manager or supervisor recognize
1172          their crucial role in supporting that culture. An objective for their buy-in is to encourage
1173          positive associations with allocating time for employee learning.
1174      •   Human Resources, human capital officers, and labor relations officers – Those
1175          involved in Human Resources or human capital are responsible for any required
1176          communications regarding the implementation of CPLP requirements into the onboarding
1177          and training of union members throughout the year. If appropriate, the labor relations
1178          officers will also be key stakeholders in assisting with any updates to the plan and
1179          receiving reports on learning outcomes and other metrics for their union-represented
1180          personnel. Human capital is also a crucial stakeholder to provide input about personnel
1181          disciplinary actions and to initiate labor relations and union negotiations with regard to
1182          the mandatory training or learning activities outlined in the agency process.
