Special Publication 800-85B                                   PIV Data Model Testing Specification


Test Steps            1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                      2. Set OID := <<CHUID (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.48.0)>>
                      3. Call pivGetData w/
                          • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                      4. Extract the signerInfo->sid field contents from the
                         asymmetric signature of the CHUID
                      5. Extract the certificates field contents from the
                         asymmetric signature of the CHUID
                      6. Extract the issuer and serialNumber fields from the
                         certificate obtained in the previous step

Expected              The sid in the SignerInfo uses the issuerAndSerialNumber choice and it
Result(s)             corresponds to the issuer and serialNumber fields found in the X.509
                      certificate of the signer.


10.1.1.8 Verify Digest Algorithm in SignerInfo

Purpose               Confirm that the digestAlgorithm field of the SignerInfo is in accordance
                      with Table 3-3 of SP80078.
Reference(s)          1.      SP80078, Section 3.2.1
                      2.      AS06.01.11
Precondition          1.      A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                      2.      A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and the
                              contact reader.
                      3.      The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                      4.      A valid CHUID is present on the PIV card.
