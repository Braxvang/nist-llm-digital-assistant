SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



    â€¢   Minimum TTL. The minimum TTL value is the default value used as the TTL of zone RRsets as
        well as in negative caching. The minTTL value depends on how often the information changes in
        the zone. If a zone is static, the value could be large; if the zone is dynamic, the value should be
        small. A minimum value of 5 minutes is advised, with a recommended range of 30 minutes to 5
        days.


Checklist item 18: The refresh value in the zone SOA RR should be chosen with the frequency of
updates in mind. If the zone is signed, the refresh value should be less than the RRSIG validity period.

Checklist item 19: The retry value in a zone SOA RR should be 1/10th of the refresh value.

Checklist item 20: The expire value in the zone SOA RR should be 2 to 4 weeks.

Checklist item 21: The minimum TTL value should be between 30 minutes and 5 days.


10.2 Information Leakage from Informational RRTypes

There are several types of RRs in the DNS that are meant to convey information to humans and
applications about the network, hosts, or services. These RRs include the Responsible Person (RP) record,
the Host Information (HINFO) record, the Location (LOC) record, and the catch-all text string resource
record (TXT) [RFC1035]. Although these record types are meant to provide information to users in good
faith, they also allow attackers to gain knowledge about network hosts before attempting to exploit them.
For example, an attacker may query for HINFO records, looking for hosts that list an OS or platform
known to have exploits. Therefore, great care should be taken before including these record types in a
zone. In fact, they are best left out altogether.

More careful consideration should be taken with the TXT resource record type. A DNS administrator will
have to decide if the data contained in a TXT RR constitutes an information leak or is a necessary piece of
information. For example, several authenticated email technologies use TXT RR's to store email sender
policy information such as valid email senders for a domain. These judgments will have to be made on a
case-by-case basis.


Checklist item 22: A DNS administrator should take care when including HINFO, RP, LOC, or other RR
types that could divulge information that would be useful to an attacker, or the external view of a zone if
using split DNS. These RR types should be avoided if possible and only used if necessary to support
operational policy.

Checklist item 23: A DNS administrator should review the data contained in any TXT RR for possible
information leakage before adding it to the zone file.


10.3 Using RRSIG Validity Periods to Minimize Key Compromise

The best way for a zone administrator to minimize the impact of a key compromise is by limiting the
validity period of RRSIGs in the zone and in the parent zone. This strategy limits the time during which
an attacker can take advantage of a compromised key to forge responses. An attacker that has
