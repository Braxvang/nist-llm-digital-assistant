6.      Security Assessment Planning

Proper planning is critical to a successful security assessment. This section provides guidance on creating
an assessment policy, prioritizing and scheduling assessments, selecting the appropriate assessment
approach, and addressing logistical considerations. It also provides recommendations for developing an
assessment plan and outlines assessment-related legal considerations that organizations may need to
address.

6.1     Developing a Security Assessment Policy

Organizations should develop an information security assessment policy to provide direction and
guidance for their security assessments. This policy should identify security assessment requirements,
and hold accountable those individuals responsible for ensuring that assessments comply with the
requirements. It should address:

       Organizational requirements with which assessments must comply
       Appropriate roles and responsibilities (at a minimum, for those individuals approving and
        executing assessments)
       Adherence to established methodology
       Assessment frequency
       Documentation requirements, such as assessment plans and assessment results.
Once developed and approved by the appropriate senior officials, the policy should be disseminated to the
appropriate staff—which might include the offices of the Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief
Information Security Officer (CISO), and Chief Technology Officer (CTO). Leadership should also
communicate the policy to any third parties who are to conduct assessments.

It is recommended that organizations review their assessment policy at least annually, and whenever there
are new assessment-related requirements. These reviews will determine the policy’s continued
applicability, address any necessary modifications, and provide opportunities for incorporating lessons
learned.

6.2     Prioritizing and Scheduling Assessments

As part of planning, organizations should decide which systems should undergo technical security
assessments and how often these assessments should be done. This prioritization is based on system
categorization, expected benefits, scheduling requirements, and applicable regulations where assessment
is a requirement. A good starting point is to evaluate system categorization and associated requirements
for security assessment. Here, an evaluation of the system’s impact rating (e.g., low, moderate, high) 21
and security assessment status (e.g., when was an assessment last conducted) is necessary to determine a
schedule for moving forward. For instance, organizations should generally assess a high-impact system
before a moderate-impact system—but a moderate-impact system that is overdue may need to be
evaluated before a high-impact system whose last security assessment is still within the acceptable

      FIPS PUB 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems, provides standards
      for determining the security category of an organization’s information systems which can be helpful in developing a priority
      ranking of those systems for testing purposes. FIPS PUB 199 is available for download from
      http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html.
