                                 GUIDE TO MALWARE INCIDENT PREVENTION AND HANDLING FOR DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS


restricting which types of mobile code (such as unsigned ActiveX) may or may not be used from various
sources (e.g., internal servers, external servers).

Organizations should also block undesired web browser popup windows, as a form of content filtering.
Some popup windows are crafted to look like legitimate system message boxes or websites, and can trick
users into going to phony websites, including sites used for phishing, or authorizing changes to their
hosts, among other malicious actions. Most web browsers can block popup windows, and third-party
popup blockers are also available.

Both email and web content filtering should use real-time blacklists, reputation services, and other similar
mechanisms whenever feasible to avoid accepting content from known or likely malicious hosts and
domains. These mechanisms use a variety of techniques to identify certain IP addresses, domain names,
or URIs as being probably malicious or probably benign. Real-time blacklists tend to be based on
observed malware activity, while reputation services may be based on user opinions or on automated
analysis of websites, emails, etc. without necessarily detecting malware. Because the fidelity and
accuracy of these mechanisms varies widely from one implementation to another, organizations should
carefully evaluate any real-time blacklists, reputation services, or other similar mechanisms before
deploying them into production environments to minimize disruption to operations.

3.4.5    Application Whitelisting

Application whitelisting technologies, also known as application control programs, are used to specify
which applications are authorized for use on a host. Most application whitelisting technologies can be run
in two modes: audit and enforcement. In enforcement mode, the technology generally prohibits all
applications that are not in the whitelist from being executed. In audit mode, the technology logs all
instances of non-whitelisted applications being run on the host, but does not act to stop them. The tradeoff
between enforcement mode and audit mode is simple; using enforcement mode will stop malware from
executing, but it may also prevent benign applications not included on the whitelist from being run.
Organizations deploying application whitelisting technologies should consider first deploying them in
audit mode, so as to identify any necessary applications missing from the whitelist, before reconfiguring
them for enforcement mode. Running application whitelisting technologies in audit mode is analogous to
intrusion detection software without intrusion prevention capabilities; it can be useful after an infection
occurs to determine which hosts were affected, but it has no ability to prevent infections.

Organizations with high security needs or high-risk environments should consider the use of application
whitelisting technologies for their managed hosts. Application whitelisting technologies are built into
many operating systems and are also available through third-party utilities.

3.5     Defensive Architecture

No matter how rigorous vulnerability and threat mitigation efforts are, malware incidents will still occur.
This section describes four types of complementary methods that organizations should consider using to
alter the defensive architecture of a host’s software so as to reduce the impact of incidents: BIOS
protection, sandboxing, browser separation, and segregation through virtualization.

3.5.1    BIOS Protection

Unauthorized modification of BIOS firmware by malicious software constitutes a significant threat
because of the BIOS’s unique and privileged position within the PC architecture. A malicious BIOS
modification could be part of a sophisticated, targeted attack on an organization—either a permanent
denial of service (if the BIOS is corrupted) or a persistent malware presence (if the BIOS is implanted
