GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



phone numbers. Encryption programs are sometimes used in conjunction with e-mail clients to encrypt
an e-mail’s body and/or attachments.

When a user sends an e-mail, it is transferred from the e-mail client to the server using SMTP. If the
sender and recipient of the e-mail use different e-mail servers, the e-mail is then routed using SMTP
through additional e-mail servers until it reaches the recipient’s server. Typically, the recipient uses an e-
mail client on a separate system to retrieve the e-mail using Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) or Internet
Message Access Protocol (IMAP); in some cases, the e-mail client may be on the destination server (e.g.,
a multi-user UNIX system). The destination server often performs checks on the e-mails before making
them available for retrieval, such as blocking messages with inappropriate content (e.g., spam, virus).
From end to end, information regarding a single e-mail message may be recorded in several places—the
sender’s system, each e-mail server that handles the message, and the recipient’s system, as well as
antivirus, spam, and content filtering servers.118

7.2.2     Web Usage

Through Web browsers, people access Web servers that contain nearly every type of data imaginable.
Many applications also offer Web-based interfaces, which are also accessed through Web browsers.
Because they can be used for so many purposes, Web browsers are one of the most commonly used
applications. The basic standard for Web communications is HTTP; however, HTTP can contain many
types of data in a variety of standard and proprietary formats. HTTP is essentially the mechanism for
transferring data between the Web browsers and the Web servers.119

Typically, the richest sources of information regarding Web usage are the hosts running the Web
browsers. Information that may be retrieved from Web browsers include a list of favorite Web sites, a
history (with timestamps) of Web sites visited, cached Web data files, and cookies (including their
creation and expiration dates). Another good source of Web usage information is Web servers, which
typically keep logs of the requests they receive. Data that is often logged by Web servers for each request
includes a timestamp; the IP address, Web browser version, and OS of the host making the request; the
type of request (e.g., read data, write data); the resource requested; and the status code. The response to
each request includes a three-digit status code that indicates the success or failure of the request. For
successful requests, the status code explains what action was performed; for failures, the status code
explains why the request failed.

Several other types of devices and software, in addition to Web browsers and servers, might also log
related information. For example, Web proxy servers and application proxying firewalls might perform
detailed logging of HTTP activity, with a level of detail similar to that of Web server logs.120 Routers,
non-proxying firewalls, and other network devices might log the basic aspects of HTTP network
connections, such as source and destination IP addresses and ports. Organizations that use Web content
monitoring and filtering services might find useful data in the services’ logs, particularly regarding denied
Web requests.

      Typically, proxies cannot log the details of SSL or TLS-protected HTTP requests, because the requests and the
      corresponding responses pass through the proxy encrypted, which conceals their contents.
