Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In addition, the
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of central property management
information usually depends on the urgency with which the information is needed or the
immediacy with which the information is used. In most cases, it is unlikely that the information
will be time-critical or acted upon immediately.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external publication of central
property management information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect public
confidence in the agency. However, damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
central property management information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the central property management
information. The functions supported by most central property management information are
tolerant of delays. Typically, the disruption of access to central property management
information will have a limited adverse effect on agency operations (including mission functions
and public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Exceptions may include emergency
response aspects of disaster management. In such cases, delays measured in hours can cost lives
and major property damage. Consequently, the availability impact level associated with
unauthorized modification or destruction of central property management information needed to
respond to emergencies may be high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
central property management information is low.
C.2.8.5 Central Personnel Management Information Type

Central Personnel Management involves most of the operating activities of the Office of
Personnel Management and related agencies. The recommended security categorization for the
central personnel management information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of central personnel
management information on the ability of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to build a
high quality and diverse Federal workforce, based on merit system principles. Central personnel
management information includes human resources management and consulting services,
education and leadership development services, and investigation services. The unauthorized
disclosure of most central personnel management information will have only a limited adverse
effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.
