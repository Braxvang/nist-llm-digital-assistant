                                                                 Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

       Capturing a direct image of the UICC data is not possible because of the protection
       mechanisms built into the module. Instead, forensic tools send command directives called
       Application Protocol Data Units (APDUs) to the UICC to extract data logically, without
       modification, from each elementary data file of the file system. The APDU protocol is a simple
       command-response exchange. Each element of the file system defined in the GSM standards
       has a unique numeric identifier assigned, which can be used to walk through the file system
       and recover data by referencing an element and performing some operation, such as reading its
       contents.

       Because UICCs are highly standardized devices, few issues exist with regard to a logical
       acquisition. The main consideration is selecting a tool that reports the status of any PINs and
       recovers the data of interest. Vast differences exist in the data recovered by UICC tools, with
       some recovering only the data thought to have the highest relevance in a typical investigation,
       and others performing a complete recovery of all data, even though much of it is network
       related with little investigative value.

 5.4   Tangential Equipment

       Tangential equipment includes devices that contain memory and are associated with a mobile
       device. The three main categories are memory cards, host computers to which a mobile device
       has synchronized its contents and cloud-based storage.

       Smartphones may provide an interface that supports removable media (e.g., microSD or
       MMC), which may contain significant amounts of data. Memory cards are typically flash
       memory, used as auxiliary user file storage, or as a means to convey files to and from the
       device. Data may be acquired with the use of a write-blocked media reader and a forensic
       application.

       The data contained on a mobile device is often present on a personal computer, due to the
       capability of mobile devices to synchronize or otherwise share information among one or more
       host computers. Such personal computers or workstations are referred to as synched devices.
       Because of synchronization, a significant amount of data on a mobile device may be present on
       the ownerâ€™s laptop or personal computer and recovered using a conventional computer
       forensic tool for hard drive acquisition and examination [Bad10].

5.4.1 Synched Devices

       Synchronization refers to the process of resolving differences in certain classes of data, such as
       e-mail residing on two devices (i.e., a mobile phone and a personal computer), to obtain a
       version that reflects any actions taken by the user (e.g., deletions or additions) on one device or
       the other. Synchronization of information may occur at either the record level or the file level.
       When done at the file level, any discrepancies from the last synchronization date and time
       result in the latest version automatically replacing the older version. Occasionally manual
       intervention may be needed if both versions were modified independently since the last
       synchronization occurred. Record level synchronization is done similarly, but with more
       granularity, whereby only out-of-date parts of a file are resolved and replaced.

       Mobile devices are typically populated with data from the personal computer during the
       synchronization process. A significant amount of informative data may reside locally on a
       personal computer. Data from the mobile device may also be synchronized to the computer,
       through user-defined preferences in the synchronization software. Because the synchronized
                                                  45
