                                                                                              proofing architecture an agency selects. However, there are scenarios an agency may encounter
                                                                                              that make identity federation potentially more efficient and effective than establishing identity
                                                                                              services local to the agency or individual applications. The following list details scenarios where,

                                                                                                  2. Multiple credential form factors are required to cover all possible user communities.
                                                                                                  3. Agency does not have infrastructure to support authentication management (e.g., account

                                                                                                  4. There is a desire to allow primary authenticators to be added and upgraded over time
                                                                                                     without changing the RPâ€™s implementation.
                                                                                                  5. There are different environments to be supported, as federation protocols are network-

                                                                                                     infrastructure.

                                                                                                  2. Access to the service only requires a partial attribute list.
                                                                                                  3. Access to the service only requires at least one attribute reference.
                                                                                                  4. The agency is not the authoritative source or issuing source for required attributes.
                                                                                                  5. Attributes are only required temporarily during use (such as to make an access decision),
                                                                                                     such that agency does not need to locally persist the data.
