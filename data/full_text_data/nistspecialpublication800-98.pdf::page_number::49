                                                   SECTION 3: RFID APPLICATIONS AND APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS



servers are preferable to those that store data on tags, both in terms of cost and security. However, a
system may require local storage of data on tags for several reasons, including:

 Extending the network to a remote RFID reader is not feasible or is more expensive than using tags
  that support the required functionality.
 Accessing the data from the network introduces unacceptable latency.
 Network availability is inherently poor, perhaps as a result of harsh operating conditions, which
  makes accessing data on tags a more reliable approach.
 The participants in an open system have determined that the risk of storing data on tags is less than
  the risk of opening their networks to external entities.
 Each tag must collect and store information from a sensor or other data source before it can
  communicate with a networked reader.
 Users want control over when personal data is shared and therefore prefer that it remain on the tag
  and not in an enterprise database.
3.4     The Tag Environment between Transactions

RFID system requirements depend on what happens between transactions, as well as during transactions.
Relevant factors before and after reader communication include:

 Whether or not the business process requires that the tag collect data about its environment, and
 The human, technical, and environmental threats that pose risks to the tag’s integrity.
These factors are discussed in Sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2.

3.4.1    Data Collection Requirements

In some applications, each tag is attached to a sensor that stores data in memory that is accessible to the
tag. The memory may belong to the sensor, to the tag, or to a combined device. In some cases, the
application’s core purpose is to capture this data, and RFID technology merely provides a vehicle to
access it remotely. In other cases, the sensor data supports an asset management or tracking application,
and the objective is to take measurements to ensure that storage or transport conditions are as expected.

3.4.2    Human and Environmental Threats to Tag Integrity

Tags are vulnerable to a variety of threats that could adversely impact the business processes that they
support. Selecting appropriate RFID technology and security controls depends on the level of the threat
in the environments in which the tags are expected to reside. Some human threats to tags include the
ability of an adversary to:

 Damage or destroy a tag,
 Remove the tag from the item to which it was attached,
 Replace a tag with another one, or
 Clone a tag and use the clone for an unintended purpose.
