NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                                               GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS



3        Minimum Requirements for TLS Servers

This section provides a minimum set of requirements that a server must implement in order to
meet these guidelines. Requirements are organized in the following sections: TLS protocol
version support, server keys and certificates, cryptographic support, TLS extension support,
client authentication, session resumption, compression methods, and operational considerations.

Specific requirements are stated as either implementation requirements or configuration
requirements. Implementation requirements indicate that federal agencies shall not procure TLS
server implementations unless they include the required functionality or can be augmented with
additional commercial products to meet the requirements. Configuration requirements indicate
that TLS server administrators are required to verify that particular features are enabled or
disabled, or in some cases, configured appropriately, if present.

3.1      Protocol Version Support

Servers that support government-only applications 8 shall be configured to use TLS 1.2 and
should be configured to use TLS 1.3 as well. These servers should not be configured to use TLS
1.1 and shall not use TLS 1.0, SSL 3.0, or SSL 2.0. TLS versions 1.2 and 1.3 are represented by
major and minor number tuples (3, 3) and (3, 4), respectively, and may appear in that format
during configuration. 9

Servers that support citizen or business-facing applications (i.e., the client may not be part of a
government IT system) 10 shall be configured to negotiate TLS 1.2 and should be configured to
negotiate TLS 1.3. The use of TLS versions 1.1 and 1.0 is generally discouraged, but these
versions may be configured when necessary to enable interaction with citizens and businesses.
See Appendix F for a discussion on determining whether to support TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1. These
servers shall not allow the use of SSL 2.0 or SSL 3.0.

Agencies shall support TLS 1.3 by January 1, 2024. After this date, servers shall support TLS
1.3 for both government-only and citizen or business-facing applications. In general, servers that
support TLS 1.3 should be configured to use TLS 1.2 as well. However, TLS 1.2 may be
disabled on servers that support TLS 1.3 if it has been determined that TLS 1.2 is not needed for
interoperability.

Some server implementations are known to implement version negotiation incorrectly. For
example, there are TLS 1.0 servers that terminate the connection when the client offers a version


8 A government-only application is an application where the intended users are exclusively government employees or contractors

      working on behalf of the government. This includes applications that are accessed on a government employee’s bring-your-
      own-device (BYOD) system.

9 Historically, TLS 1.0 was assigned major and minor tuple (3,1) to align it as SSL 3.1. TLS 1.1 is represented by the major and

      minor tuple (3,2).

10 For the purposes of this document, clients that reside on “bring your own device” (BYOD) systems or privately-owned systems

      used to perform telework are considered to be part of the government IT system, as they access services that are not
      available to the public.
