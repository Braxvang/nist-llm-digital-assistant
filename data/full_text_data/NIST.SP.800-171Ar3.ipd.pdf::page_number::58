       NIST SP 800-171Ar3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                         Assessing CUI Security Requirements
       November 2023

1780           A.03.07.04.d: the removal of system maintenance equipment containing CUI is prevented by
1781           verifying that there is no CUI on the equipment; sanitizing or destroying the equipment; or
1782           retaining the equipment within the facility.

1783           ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
1784           Examine
1785           [SELECT FROM: maintenance policy and procedures; procedures for system maintenance tools;
1786           system maintenance tools; maintenance tool inspection records; equipment sanitization records;
1787           media sanitization records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records]
1788           Interview
1789           [SELECT FROM: personnel with system maintenance responsibilities; personnel responsible for
1790           media sanitization; personnel with information security responsibilities]
1791           Test
1792           [SELECT FROM: processes for approving, controlling, and monitoring maintenance tools;
1793           mechanisms for supporting and/or implementing the approval, control, and/or monitoring of
1794           maintenance tools; processes for preventing the unauthorized removal of information; processes
1795           for inspecting media for malicious code; mechanisms for supporting media sanitization or the
1796           destruction of equipment; mechanisms for supporting the verification of media sanitization;
1797           processes for inspecting maintenance tools; mechanisms for supporting and/or implementing the
1798           inspection of maintenance tools; mechanisms for supporting and/or implementing the inspection
1799           of media used for maintenance]

1802   3.7.5. Nonlocal Maintenance
1803           REQUIREMENT: 03.07.05

1804           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
1805           Determine if:
1806           A.03.07.05.a[01]: nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are approved.
1807           A.03.07.05.a[02]: nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are monitored.
1808           A.03.07.05.b: multi-factor authentication and replay resistance are implemented in the
1809           establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions.
1810           A.03.07.05.c[01]: session connections are terminated when nonlocal maintenance is completed.
1811           A.03.07.05.c[02]: network connections are terminated when nonlocal maintenance is completed.

1812           ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
1813           Examine
1814           [SELECT FROM: maintenance policy and procedures; remote access policy and procedures;
1815           procedures for nonlocal system maintenance; records of remote access; maintenance records;
1816           diagnostic records; system design documentation; system configuration settings; system security
1817           plan; other relevant documents or records]
