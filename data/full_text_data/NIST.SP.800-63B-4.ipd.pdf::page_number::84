2373   10.4. Biometrics Usability Considerations
2374   This section provides a high-level overview of general usability considerations for
2375   biometrics. A more detailed discussion of biometric usability can be found in Usability &
2376   Biometrics, Ensuring Successful Biometric Systems [UsabilityBiometrics].
2377   Although there are other biometric modalities, the following three biometric modalities
2378   are more commonly used for authentication: fingerprint, face and iris.
2379   Typical Usage
2380       • For all modalities, user familiarity and practice with the device improves
2381         performance.
2382       • Device affordances (i.e., properties of a device that allow a user to perform an
2383         action), feedback, and clear instructions are critical to a user’s success with the
2384         biometric device. For example, provide clear instructions on the required actions for
2385         liveness detection.
2386       • Ideally, users can select the modality they are most comfortable with for their
2387         second authentication factor. The user population may be more comfortable and
2388         familiar with — and accepting of — some biometric modalities than others.
2389       • User experience with biometrics as an activation factor.
2390            – Provide clear, meaningful feedback on the number of remaining allowed
2391              attempts. For example, for rate limiting (i.e., throttling), inform users of the
2392              time period they have to wait until next attempt to reduce user confusion and
2393              frustration.
2394       • Fingerprint Usability Considerations:
2395            – Users have to remember which finger(s) they used for initial enrollment.
2396            – The amount of moisture on the finger(s) affects the sensor’s ability for
2397              successful capture.
2398            – Additional factors influencing fingerprint capture quality include age, gender,
2399              and occupation (e.g., users handling chemicals or working extensively with
2400              their hands may have degraded friction ridges).
2401       • Face Usability Considerations:
2402            – Users have to remember whether they wore any artifacts (e.g., glasses) during
2403              enrollment because it affects facial recognition accuracy.
2404            – Differences in environmental lighting conditions can affect facial recognition
2405              accuracy.
2406            – Facial expressions affect facial recognition accuracy (e.g., smiling versus
2407              neutral expression).
