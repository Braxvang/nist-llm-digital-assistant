                                                                        GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


     6.1.4   Dual Operations

An organization that deploys IPv6 may support IPv4 for legacy applications, services, and clients. This
will result in a dual protocol environment and increased complexity. The risk is that an organization’s
security infrastructure may not be aware of both protocols. Dual protocols will increase the complexity of
the environment. Two protocols mean twice as many things can go wrong, and twice the number of
configurations are required to install new equipment or change existing equipment. Attacks against upper
layer protocols could use either the IPv4 or IPv6 stack to reach the client. Administrators will need to
maintain the same level of coverage for both protocols to mitigate risks.

     6.1.5   Perceived Risk

A misconception about IPv6 is that IPv6 by itself introduces many more security risks than the IPv4
protocol. Perceived risk can cause an organization to delay deployment despite the fact that IPv6 enabled
equipment is already on hand. As discussed in Section 2.4 of this document, IPv6 is no more or less
secure than IPv4. General security concepts are the same for both IP protocols. However, it will take
time to acquire the level of operational experience and practical deployment solutions that have been
developed for IPv4 over the years.

     6.1.6   Vendor Support

Many security vendors are waiting for customer demand before implementing support for IPv6, while
customers are waiting for vendors to support IPv6 before purchasing software and systems. This has
resulted in a ―chicken and egg‖ problem. While some vendors fully support IPv6, many do not support
IPv6 at all or only offer limited support.

Organizations need to analyze their existing IPv4 security infrastructure and develop baseline
requirements that an IPv6 infrastructure must meet to achieve the same or better security as their IPv4
environments. New base requirements may be added to address IPv6-only requirements or deficiencies in
the existing environment. Some existing IPv4 equipment may support both IPv4 and IPv6 requirements,
but organizations should plan to evaluate products with IPv6 support to supplement and/or replace
existing equipment or bridge security gaps. Use the developed baseline security requirements to evaluate
IPv6 security products. Product evaluation, selection and procurement can slow down the deployment
schedule for IPv6. Organizations planning to deploy IPv6 should begin a dialog with their security
vendors to support IPv6 as early as possible.

There are no industry standards that define IPv6 support. Organizations must understand they will be
gaining and losing capabilities by deploying IPv6 and this will change their security posture. When
vendors claim IPv6 support, it is up to the organization to evaluate whether they can function with the
vendors’ level of IPv6 support. Often IPv6 support is not as complete as IPv4 support. An example of
this is that many IPv6 security devices require IPv4 addressing for management and configuration.

NIST has issued a special publication to define the capabilities IPv6 devices should support. NIST SP
500-267, A Profile for IPv6 in the U. S. Government – Version 1.0 21 will help organizations identify and
select products that support IPv6. This document has a section dedicated to Network Protection Devices
that discusses the capabilities firewalls, application firewalls, and intrusion detection systems should
support. When evaluating these types of security devices, organizations should ensure the equipment
complies with the profile. To facilitate that goal, NIST has launched a USGv6 (US Government IPv6)
test program52 to verify the IPv6 conformance and interoperability of three classes of IPv6 devices: hosts,
