2.7   Program Manager (Owner Of Data)/Acquisition Initiator

This Program Manager represents programmatic interests during the IT security services life cycle.
Program Managers play an essential role in security because they have been involved in strategic
planning initiatives of the IT security service and are intimately aware of functional service requirements.

2.8   Privacy Officer

The Privacy Officer ensures that the service and service arrangement meet existing privacy policies
regarding protection, dissemination (information sharing and exchange) and information disclosure.

2.9   Other Participants

The list of roles in a service acquisition can grow with the complexity involved in acquiring and
managing IT systems. It is vital that all members of the acquisition team work together to ensure that a
successful acquisition is achieved. Since the system certifier and accreditor will be making critical
decisions near the end of the procurement process, it is helpful to include them earlier in the acquisition
so that critical issues can be addressed early. System users may assist in the acquisition by helping the
program manager to determine the need, refine the requirements, and inspect and accept the delivered
system. Participants may also include personnel who represent information technology, configuration
management, design/engineering, and facilities groups.
