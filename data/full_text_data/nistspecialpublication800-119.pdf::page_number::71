                                                                 GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


                              flgs
                            +-+-+-+-+

The flags are set as follows (see RFC 3306 and RFC 3956):
          0000              Well-known, pre-defined multicast address (as in all of the examples above)
          0001              Transient multicast address without an embedded unicast prefix
          0011              Transient multicast address with an embedded unicast prefix and no rendezvous
                            point
          0111              Transient multicast address with an embedded unicast prefix and rendezvous
                            point
This provides a simple way to allocate multicast addresses belonging to or allocated by a given network
prefix in the following format, without adding any new multicast address allocation protocol:

          | 8         | 4     | 4    | 8         | 8         | 64                   | 32            |
          +--------+----+----+--------+--------+----------------+----------+
          |11111111|flgs|scop|reserved| p-len                | network prefix | group ID |
          +--------+----+----+--------+--------+----------------+----------+


The eight bits after the flags and scope must be zero. The next eight bits specify a prefix length, up to 64,
followed by the prefix, left justified and zero filled.

This example comes from RFC 3306. The address FF38:0030:3FFE:FFFF:0001:0:1234:5678 is:

         Multicast (FF)

         Transient with embedded prefix (3)

         Organization Local scope (8)

         Using a prefix of length 48 (30)

         Specifying the prefix as 3FFE:FFFF:0001::/48

         Using a 32-bit Group ID of 1234:5678

Note that the scope of such multicast addresses must not be greater than the scope of their embedded
prefixes.


  4.2.2     Differences between IPv4 and IPv6 Multicast

Although multicast addresses are common in both IPv4 and IPv6, several important differences exist:


                                                       4-8
