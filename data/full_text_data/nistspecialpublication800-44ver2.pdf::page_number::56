relevant and necessary to the business purpose, 33 and, in many cases, to collect information, to the
greatest extent practicable, directly from the subject individual. 34 In addition, accepted practices (many
of which are reflected in laws applicable to both private and public institutions) are to provide subject
individuals:

 Notice that information about them is being collected, including descriptions of what data is being
  collected, with whom it is being shared, and what is being done with that data
 Opportunities to opt out of data collection unless the data collection is mandatory under law,
  necessary to the performance of a contract with the subject individual, or if the individual has freely
  offered his/her PII
 Opportunities to access and review the records kept about themselves, and to request corrections or
  additions, especially if that information may be used to make a determination about the individuals’
  rights, opportunities, or benefits.
The following are examples of personal information:

 Name

 E-mail address

 Mailing address

 Telephone number

 SSN

 Financial information.

Federal agencies and many state agencies are also restricted in their ability to use Web browser cookies
[OMB00a, OMB00b, OMB00c, and MASS99]. A cookie is a small piece of information that may be
written to a user’s hard drive when a Web site is visited. There are two principal types of cookies:

 Persistent cookies cause the most concern. These cookies can be used to track activities of users over
  time and across different Web sites. The most common use of persistent cookies is to retain and
  correlate information about users between sessions. Federal agencies and many state agencies are
  generally prohibited from using persistent cookies on publicly accessible Web sites.

 Session cookies are valid for a single session (visit) to a Web site. These cookies expire at the end of
  the session or within a limited time frame. Because these cookies cannot be used to track personal
  information, they are generally not subject to the prohibition that applies to persistent cookies.
  However, their use must be clearly stated and defined in the Web site’s privacy statement.
