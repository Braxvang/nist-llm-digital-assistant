26
  As mentioned in section 5.4, if additional power cannot be supplied, consideration should be given to switching off
the device.
27
  Some devices connect to a PC through the cradle connector, but without a cradle per se, and also fall under this
condition.
28
   This action normally causes the battery to deplete more quickly as the device continually tries to reestablish
communications. Alternatively, consideration may be given to turning off communications through the device
configuration settings, to preserve battery life.
