Special Publication 800-73-4        Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification – Part 1: PIV
                                 Card Application Namespace, Data Model and Representation

              The second byte of the PIN Usage Policy encodes the cardholder’s PIN preference for
              PIV Cards with both the PIV Card Application PIN and the Global PIN enabled:

              Second byte: 0x10 indicates that the PIV Card Application PIN is the primary PIN used
                                to satisfy the PIV ACRs for command execution and object access.

                              0x20 indicates that the Global PIN is the primary PIN used to satisfy the
                                   PIV ACRs for command execution and object access.

              Note: If Bit 6 of the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy is set to zero, then the second byte
              is RFU and shall be set to 0x00.

              PIV Card Applications that implement the VCI or for which the Global PIN or OCC
              satisfy the PIV ACRs for PIV data object access and command execution shall
              implement the Discovery Object.

The encoding of the 0x7E Discovery Object is as follows:

         {'7E 12' {'4F 0B A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 10 00 01 00'} {'5F 2F 02 xx yy'}}, where xx and yy
         encode the first and second byte of the PIN Usage Policy as described in this section.

The Security Object enforces integrity of the Discovery Object according to the issuer.

3.3.3    Key History Object

Up to twenty retired key management private keys may be stored in the PIV Card Application. The
Key History object provides information about the retired key management private keys that are
present within the PIV Card Application. 7 Retired key management private keys are private keys that
correspond to X.509 Certificates for Key Management that have expired, have been revoked, or have
otherwise been superseded. The Key History object shall be present in the PIV Card Application if

7 See NIST Interagency Report 7676 [IR7676] for suggestions on the implementation and use of the Key History

mechanism.
