Special Publication 800-73-4                                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification – Part 2:
                                                            PIV Card Application Card Command Interface

3.     PIV Card Application Card Command Interface

Table 2 lists the card commands surfaced by the PIV Card Application at the card edge of the ICC when it
is the currently selected card application. All PIV Card Application card commands shall be supported by
a PIV Card Application. Card commands indicated with a 'Yes' in the Command Chaining column shall
support command chaining for transmitting a data string too long for a single command as defined in
[ISO7816].

The PIV Card Application shall return the status word of '6A 81' (Function not supported) when it
receives a card command on the contactless interface marked “No” in the Contactless Interface column in
Table 2. The PIV Card Application may return a different status word (e.g., '69 82') if the card command
can be performed over the contactless interface in support of card management. The PIV Card
Application will only perform the command in support of card management if the requirements specified
in Section 2.9.2 of FIPS 201-2 are satisfied.

Note 1: For SM, OCC and pairing code alone can be submitted via secure messaging (SM) over the
contactless interface. All other key references require VCI for communication over the contactless
interface.




3 The VERIFY command is only required to support command chaining if the PIV Card Application supports on-card biometric

comparison (OCC).
