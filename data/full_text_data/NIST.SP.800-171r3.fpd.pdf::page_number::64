1794             Terminate network connections associated with communications sessions at the end of the
1795             sessions or after periods of inactivity.

1796             DISCUSSION
1797             This requirement applies to internal and external networks. Terminating network connections
1798             associated with communications sessions includes deallocating TCP/IP addresses or port pairs
1799             at the operating system level or deallocating networking assignments at the application level if
1800             multiple application sessions are using a single network connection. Time periods of inactivity
1801             may be established by organizations and include time periods by type of network access or for
1802             specific network accesses.

1806   3.13.10. Cryptographic Key Establishment and Management
1807              REQUIREMENT: 03.13.10
1808              Establish and manage cryptographic keys in the system in accordance with the following key
1809              management requirements: [Assignment: organization-defined requirements for key
1810              establishment and management].

1811              DISCUSSION
1812              Cryptographic key establishment and management include key generation, distribution,
1813              storage, access, rotation, and destruction. Cryptographic keys can be established and managed
1814              using either manual procedures or automated mechanisms supported by manual procedures.
1815              Organizations satisfy key establishment and management requirements in accordance with
1816              applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, policies, directives, regulations, and standards that
1817              specify appropriate options, levels, and parameters. This requirement is related to 03.13.11.

1822   3.13.11. Cryptographic Protection
1823              REQUIREMENT: 03.13.11
1824              Implement the following types of cryptography when used to protect the confidentiality of CUI:
1825              [Assignment: organization-defined types of cryptography].

1826              DISCUSSION
1827              Cryptography is implemented in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders,
1828              directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.
