                                      GUIDE TO MALWARE INCIDENT PREVENTION AND HANDLING FOR DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS


4.     Malware Incident Response

As defined in NIST SP 800-61, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, the incident response
process has four major phases: preparation, detection and analysis, containment/eradication/recovery, and
post-incident activity. Figure 4-1 displays this incident response life cycle. This section of the guide
builds on the concepts of SP 800-61 by providing additional details about responding to malware
incidents. 16

The initial phase of malware incident response involves performing preparatory activities, such as
developing malware-specific incident handling procedures and training programs for incident response
teams. As described in Section 3, the preparation phase also involves using policy, awareness activities,
vulnerability mitigation, and security tools to reduce the number of malware incidents. Despite these
measures, residual risk will inevitably persist, and no solution is foolproof. Detection of malware
infections is thus necessary to alert the organization whenever incidents occur. Early detection is
particularly important for malware incidents because they are more likely than other types of incidents to
increase their impact over time, so faster detection and handling can help reduce the number of infected
hosts and the damage done.

For each incident, the organization should act appropriately, based on the severity of the incident, to
mitigate its impact by containing it, eradicating infections, and ultimately recovering from the incident.
The organization may need to jump back to the detection and analysis phase during containment,
eradication, and recoveryâ€”for example, to check for additional infections that have occurred since the
original detection was done. After an incident has been handled, the organization should issue a report
that details the cause and cost of the incident and the steps the organization should take to prevent future
incidents and to prepare more effectively to handle incidents that do occur.

This section of the document focuses on those aspects of incident handling that are specific to malware
incidents.
