OT Discussion: Continuous monitoring programs for OT are designed, documented, and
implemented with input from OT personnel. The organization ensures that continuous
monitoring does not interfere with OT functions. The individual or group designing and
conducting the continuous monitoring for the OT systems implements a monitoring program that
is consistent with the organizational information security policies and procedures, the OT
security policies and procedures, and the specific health, safety, and environmental risks
associated with a particular facility and/or process. Continuous monitoring can be automated or
manual at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions. For example, the organization
may monitor event logs manually on a specified frequency less often for lower-risk, isolated
systems than for higher-risk, networked systems.
Control Enhancement: (1) (4) No OT Discussion for this control.

OT Discussion: Penetration testing is used with care on OT networks to ensure that OT functions
are not adversely impacted by the testing process. In general, OT systems are highly sensitive to
timing constraints and have limited resources. Example compensating controls include
employing a replicated, virtualized, or simulated system to conduct penetration testing.
Production OT may need to be taken offline before testing can be conducted. If OT systems are
taken offline for testing, tests are scheduled to occur during planned OT outages whenever
possible. If penetration testing is performed on non-OT networks, extra care is taken to ensure
that tests do not propagate into the OT network.
