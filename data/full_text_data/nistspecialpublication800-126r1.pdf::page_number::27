                  The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



4.      SCAP Processing Requirements and Recommendations

This section defines the processing requirements that tools MUST follow in order to correctly process
SCAP 1.1 content. This section also provides recommendations that are not mandatory; organizations are
encouraged to adopt them to promote stronger interoperability and greater consistency. The topics
covered in this section are legacy support, SCAP content validation, the <xccdf:Profile> element,
and check system usage. The end of the section covers result-related topics: SCAP result data streams,
XCCDF results, OVAL results, and OCIL results.

4.1     Legacy Support

Products supporting SCAP 1.1 SHALL process SCAP 1.0 content as described under the SCAP 1.0
version of NIST SP 800-126.21

Products supporting OVAL SHALL support OVAL Definition documents written against OVAL versions
5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, and 5.8.

Within the OVAL Language, constructs may be deprecated.22 Deprecated constructs MUST be handled
properly during OVAL Definition evaluation. Similar to the requirement to support previous minor
versions of OVAL, this requirement will ensure that content that made use of these deprecated constructs
continues to be supported in SCAP.

4.2     SCAP Content Validation

An SCAP implementation that can import SCAP content SHALL be capable of validating the content
against the appropriate schemas and Schematron stylesheets, detecting and reporting errors, and failing
gracefully if there are errors.

4.3     The <xccdf:Profile> Element

If an <xccdf:Profile> element is not provided or selected, then profile processing SHALL be
skipped and standard XCCDF benchmark processing rules SHALL apply.23

4.4     CPE Applicability Processing

When evaluating an <xccdf:platform> element in XCCDF content, it is necessary to evaluate
machine state to determine the presence of a referenced CPE on the machine. CPEs referenced in an
<xccdf:platform> element directly or by a <cpe-lang:fact-ref> contained within a
referenced <cpe-lang:platform-specification> element SHALL be evaluated as follows:

      1. The <cpe_dict:cpe-item> element data SHALL be located from the CPE dictionary data
         stream component in the same data stream with the @name attribute that is identical to the
         referenced CPE Name.
