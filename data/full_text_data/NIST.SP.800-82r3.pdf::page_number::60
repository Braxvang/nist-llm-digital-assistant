    •   Establish recovery processes and procedures that will be executed to restore the OT
        assets and services affected by cybersecurity incidents.
    •   Establish communication plans to coordinate restoration activities with internal and
        external stakeholders and the executive management team.
    •   Establish communication plans to manage public relations.
    •   Establish a task for lessons learned as part of the recovery process for continuous
        improvement of the cybersecurity capabilities (e.g., vulnerability management,
        cybersecurity operation, incident response handling, and recovery handling).
    •   Test these plans at reasonable intervals that are appropriate for the organization.
Further guidance for OT recovery and restoration can be found in Section 6. Additional
information with specific examples for OT recovery and restoration are also provided in NIST IR
8183A, Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile Low Impact Level Example
Implementations Guide [IR8183A].
