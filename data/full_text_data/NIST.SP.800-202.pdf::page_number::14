                                                                                                 1) Export Contact information from the internal memory of the device to the SIM/UICC.
                                                                                                    This typically is done by clicking on a Contact/Address book entry and selecting
                                                                                                    copy/export and selecting the SIM as the location.

                                                                                                 3) Incoming text messages (SMS, EMS) – send messages from a secondary device to the
                                                                                                    target device.

                                                                                             Note: Document subscriber and equipment related data (e.g., ICCID, IMSI) after successfully
                                                                                             acquiring the contents of the target SIM/UICC.

                                                                                             Document SIM/UICC Card in Appendix B.
