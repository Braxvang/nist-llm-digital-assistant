        •   eXpect the unexpected    — IT security safeguards target unauthorized actions.
            Unauthorized actions (acts by individuals or Acts-of-God) can take many forms and can
            occur at any time. Thus, security safeguards should be sufficiently flexible to identify and
            respond to any activity that deviates from a pre-defined set of acceptable actions.

        •   You   — You   are responsible and will be held accountable for your actions relative to an IT
            system or its associated data. You can strengthen or weaken an IT security environment by
            your actions or inactions. For example, you can strengthen an IT environment by changing
            passwords at appropriate intervals and weaken it by failing to do so.

        •   Zoning/Compartmenting     — Zoning/Compartmenting      is a concept whereby an application is

            segmented into independent security environments. A breach of security would require a
            security failure in two or more zones/compartments before the application is compromised.
            This layered approach to security can be applied within physical or technical environments
            associated with an IT system.




3.3 Literacy    — Curriculum Framework
The literacy level is the first solid step of the IT security training level, where the knowledge
obtained through training can be directly related to the individual's role in his or her specific
organization. Although the curriculum framework, presented below, provides a generic outline
for material to be included in literacy training throughout government, it is imperative that the
instructor relate the actual course content to the organization's unique culture and mission
requirements. Emphasis placed on the specific topics may vary by student audience or
organization needs.   The curriculum framework was developed to present topics and concepts in
a logical order, based on IT system planning and life cycle stages, but may be presented in any
order. Literacy training may also be divided into more than one session. Regardless of the
training method or structure used, it is expected that the actual literacy training, including all
topics and concepts in the curriculum framework, can be completed within an 8-hour time frame.
This is because, at the literacy level, the material should be presented as an introduction of the
concepts and topics only.


There are a variety of suitable approaches for teaching this subject matter. One of the most
effective is to encourage participation by the students in interactive discussions on how the
various concepts relate to their particular organization or roles. This approach allows the
students to understand the significance of IT security principles and procedures to their
organization, and to begin finding ways of applying this new knowledge in their work
environment.
