were being used by a full computer. Of course, using disk backups as part of a security strategy is just as
important with virtual computers as it is with non-virtual computers, so organizations should incorporate
backups of virtualized storage into their backup policies. In addition, access to the virtual storage can be
controlled at the host and VM level. Existing authentication and authorization mechanisms is leveraged
to restrict user access to the file and object resources according to the organization policy.

2.3.3     Guest OS Images

A full virtualization hypervisor encapsulates all of the components of a guest OS, including its
applications and the virtual resources they use, into a single logical entity. An image is a file or a
directory that contains, at a minimum, this encapsulated information. Images are stored on hard drives,
and can be transferred to other systems the same way that any file can (note, however, that images are
often many gigabytes in size). Some virtualization systems use a virtualization image metadata standard
called the Open Virtualization Format (OVF) 1 that supports interoperability for image metadata and
components across virtualization solutions.

A snapshot is a record of the state of a running image, generally captured as the differences between an
image and the current state. For example, a snapshot would record changes within virtual storage, virtual
memory, network connections, and other state-related data. Snapshots allow the guest OS to be suspended
and subsequently resumed without having to shut down or reboot the guest OS. Many, but not all,
virtualization systems can take snapshots.

On some hypervisors, snapshots of the guest OS can even be resumed on a different host. While a number
of issues may be introduced to handle real-time migration, including the transfer delay and any
differences that may exist between the two physical servers (e.g., IP address, number of processors or
hard disk space), most live-migration solutions provide mechanisms to resolve these issues. Should the
target system use the same virtualization product, many of these issues will not arise. However, live
migration across heterogeneous hypervisors may introduce potential configuration errors that may affect
the security of the guest OS.

2.4     Full Virtualization Use Cases

Full virtualization solutions have two major use cases: server virtualization and desktop virtualization.
These are described below.

2.4.1     Server Virtualization

Virtualizing a server can provide some security benefits. Running a server within a hypervisor provides a
sandbox, which can limit the impact of a compromise, and the hypervisor might provide a smaller attack
surface than a host operating system would, reducing the possibility of expanding a successful
compromise outside the guest OS. However, server virtualization does not prevent attackers from
compromising the server through vulnerabilities in the server application or the guest OS, nor does it
prevent attackers from directly compromising the host OS (if present), such as attacking the host OSâ€™s
network services from another host on the same subnet. Most importantly, virtualizing multiple servers on
the same host tends to negatively affect security because of the logical proximity of the servers and the
potential impact of a single compromise affecting all the servers on a host.

The discussions below address common reasons for using single server and multiple server virtualization.
