GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



then harden the host as much as possible. Hardening should include updating the OS, services, and
applications, including the IDPS software. Administrators also need to perform basic configuration of the
IDPS software, just as is done for appliance-based IDPS components.

After deploying either appliance-based or software-based IDPS components, considerable effort may be
needed to configure the products’ detection and prevention capabilities, depending on the type of IDPS
being deployed. Without performing this configuration work, some IDPSs might be capable of detecting
only a small number of older, easily identified attacks.

3.3.1.3 Securing IDPS Components

Securing IDPS components is very important because IDPSs are often targeted by attackers. If an
attacker can compromise an IDPS, it can be rendered useless in detecting subsequent attacks against other
hosts. Also, IDPSs often contain sensitive information such as host configurations and known
vulnerabilities that could be helpful in planning additional attacks. In addition to hardening software-
based IDPS components and ensuring that all IDPS components are fully up-to-date, administrators
should perform additional actions to ensure that the IDPS components themselves are secured
appropriately. Specific security recommendations are as follows:

 Administrators should create separate accounts for each user and administrator of the IDPS, and
  assign each account only the necessary privileges.
 Administrators should configure firewalls, routers, and other packet filtering devices to limit direct
  access to all IDPS components to only those hosts that need such access.
 Administrators should ensure that all IDPS management communications are protected appropriately,
  either through physical (e.g., management network) or logical (e.g., management VLAN) separation,
  or through encryption of communications. If encryption is used for protection, it should be performed
  using FIPS-approved encryption algorithms. 11 Many products encrypt their communications using
  Transport Layer Security (TLS); for products that do not provide sufficient protection through
  encryption, organizations should consider using a virtual private network (VPN) or other encrypted
  tunneling method to protect the traffic.
Some organizations also require the use of strong authentication for remote access to IDPS components,
such as two-factor authentication. This provides an additional layer of security.

3.3.2    Operation and Maintenance

Nearly all IDPS products are designed to be operated and maintained through a graphical user interface
(GUI), also known as the console. The console typically permits administrators to configure and update
the sensors and management servers, as well as monitor their status (e.g., agent failure, packet dropping).
Administrators can also manage user accounts, customize reports, and perform many other functions
using the console. IDPS users can also perform many functions through the console, including
monitoring and analyzing the IDPS data and generating reports. Most IDPSs permit administrators to set
up individual user accounts for each administrator and user, and to grant each account only the privileges
necessary for each person’s role. The console often reflects this by showing different menus and options
based on the currently authenticated account’s designated role. Some products also provide finer-grained
