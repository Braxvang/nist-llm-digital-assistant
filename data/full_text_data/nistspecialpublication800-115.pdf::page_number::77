                                             TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



Phishing: A digital form of social engineering that uses authentic-looking—but bogus—e-mails to
request information from users or direct them to a fake Web site that requests information.

Plan of Actions and Milestones (POA&M): A document that identifies tasks needing to be
accomplished. It details resources required to accomplish the elements of the plan, any milestones for
meeting the tasks, and scheduled milestone completion dates.

Port Scanner: A program that can remotely determine which ports on a system are open (e.g., whether
systems allow connections through those ports).

Review Techniques: Passive information security testing techniques, generally conducted manually, that
are used to evaluate systems, applications, networks, policies, and procedures to discover vulnerabilities.
They include documentation, log, ruleset, and system configuration review; network sniffing; and file
integrity checking.

Rogue Device: An unauthorized node on a network.

Rules of Engagement (ROE): Detailed guidelines and constraints regarding the execution of information
security testing. The ROE is established before the start of a security test, and gives the test team
authority to conduct defined activities without the need for additional permissions.

Ruleset: A collection of rules or signatures that network traffic or system activity is compared against to
determine an action to take—such as forwarding or rejecting a packet, creating an alert, or allowing a
system event.

Social Engineering: The process of attempting to trick someone into revealing information (e.g., a
password).

Target Identification and Analysis Techniques: Information security testing techniques, mostly active
and generally conducted using automated tools, that are used to identify systems, ports, services, and
potential vulnerabilities. Target identification and analysis techniques include network discovery,
network port and service identification, vulnerability scanning, wireless scanning, and application security
testing.

Target Vulnerability Validation Techniques: Active information security testing techniques that
corroborate the existence of vulnerabilities. They include password cracking, remote access testing,
penetration testing, social engineering, and physical security testing.

Version Scanning: The process of identifying the service application and application version currently
in use.

Virtual Machine (VM): Software that allows a single host to run one or more guest operating systems.

Vulnerability: Weakness in an information system, or in system security procedures, internal controls, or
implementation, that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source.

Vulnerability Scanning: A technique used to identify hosts/host attributes and associated vulnerabilities.
