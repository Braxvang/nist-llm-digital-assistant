D.15.2 Unemployment Compensation Information Type

Unemployment Compensation provides income security to those who are no longer employed,
while they seek new employment. The recommended provisional categorization of the
unemployment compensation information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of unemployment
compensation information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide income security to
those who are no longer employed, while they seek new employment. The consequences of
unauthorized disclosure of most unemployment compensation information would have a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Exceptions that might have a
potential for more serious consequences are based on privacy information (e.g., information
required by the Privacy Act of 1974 or other statutes and executive orders to receive special
handling to protect the privacy of individuals). The Privacy Act Information provisional impact
levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. This can
result in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for unemployment compensation information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of unemployment compensation
information would have, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external
communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public
confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
unemployment compensation information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to unemployment compensation
information. The effects of disruption of access to unemployment compensation information or
information systems would have, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
unemployment compensation information is low.
