      monitor it, but can also be deployed to locations where unauthorized wireless networking could be
      occurring. More information on wireless IDPSs is presented in Section 5.
 Network Behavior Analysis (NBA), which examines network traffic to identify threats that generate
  unusual traffic flows, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, certain forms of malware
  (e.g., worms, backdoors), and policy violations (e.g., a client system providing network services to
  other systems). NBA systems are most often deployed to monitor flows on an organization’s internal
  networks, and are also sometimes deployed where they can monitor flows between an organization’s
  networks and external networks (e.g., the Internet, business partners’ networks). NBA products are
  discussed in more detail in Section 6.
 Host-Based, which monitors the characteristics of a single host and the events occurring within that
  host for suspicious activity. Examples of the types of characteristics a host-based IDPS might
  monitor are network traffic (only for that host), system logs, running processes, application activity,
  file access and modification, and system and application configuration changes. Host-based IDPSs
  are most commonly deployed on critical hosts such as publicly accessible servers and servers
  containing sensitive information. Section 7 contains additional information on host-based IDPSs.
Some forms of IDPS are more mature than others because they have been in use much longer. Network-
based IDPS and some forms of host-based IDPS have been commercially available for over ten years.
Network behavior analysis software is a somewhat newer form of IDPS that evolved in part from
products created primarily to detect DDoS attacks, and in part from products developed to monitor traffic
flows on internal networks. Wireless technologies are a relatively new type of IDPS, developed in
response to the popularity of wireless local area networks (WLAN) and the growing threats against
WLANs and WLAN clients.

2.5     Summary

Intrusion detection is the process of monitoring the events occurring in a computer system or network and
analyzing them for signs of possible incidents, which are violations or imminent threats of violation of
computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices. Intrusion prevention is
the process of performing intrusion detection and attempting to stop detected possible incidents. Intrusion
detection and prevention systems (IDPS) are primarily focused on identifying possible incidents, logging
information about them, attempting to stop them, and reporting them to security administrators. In
addition, organizations use IDPSs for other purposes, such as identifying problems with security policies,
documenting existing threats, and deterring individuals from violating security policies. IDPSs have
become a necessary addition to the security infrastructure of nearly every organization.

There are many types of IDPS technologies, which are differentiated primarily by the types of events that
they can recognize and the methodologies that they use to identify possible incidents. This publication
discusses the following four types of IDPS technologies:

 Network-Based, which monitors network traffic for particular network segments or devices and
  analyzes the network and application protocol activity to identify suspicious activity.
 Wireless, which monitors wireless network traffic and analyzes it to identify suspicious activity
  involving the wireless networking protocols themselves.
 Network Behavior Analysis (NBA), which examines network traffic to identify threats that generate
  unusual traffic flows, such as DDoS attacks, scanning, and certain forms of malware.
 Host-Based, which monitors the characteristics of a single host and the events occurring within that
  host for suspicious activity.
