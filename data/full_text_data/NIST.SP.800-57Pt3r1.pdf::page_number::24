2.3.3 Cryptographic Modules
1. Ensure that Cryptographic modules for CAs, Key Recovery Servers, and OCSP
   responders are hardware modules validated as meeting FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or higher
   [FIPS 140-2].

2. Ensure that cryptographic modules for RAs are hardware cryptographic modules
   validated as meeting FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or higher [FIPS 140-2].

3. Ensure that relying party and user cryptographic modules are validated as meeting
   FIPS 140-2 Level 1 or higher [FIPS 140-2].


2.3.4 Key Recovery Servers
1. If the PKI supports key establishment (i.e., certificates will include key transport or
   key agreement keys), the PKI should include a key recovery mechanism.

2. Implementations should support automated, user-initiated key recovery; key recovery
   by the organization should also be supported.14


2.3.5 Relying Party Software
1. Relying party path validation
     a) Ensure that relying party implementations use RFC 5280-conformant path
        validation [RFC 5280].
     b) Where interoperability outside a single organization is required (e.g., a single
        federal agency), path validation modules should conform to requirements for an
        Enterprise path validation module (PVM), as specified in NIST Recommendation
        for X.509 Path Validation [X.509 Path].
     c) Where interoperability across organizations is required, path validation modules
        should conform to requirements for a Bridge-Enabled PVM, as specified in the
        draft NIST Recommendation for X.509 Path Validation [X.509 Path].
     d) Ensure that relying party implementations support CRLs or OCSP for certificate
        status, and should support both.

2. Building certificate paths
     a) Ensure that relying party implementations are able to build certification paths.
     b) At a minimum, implementations should support http-based certificate retrieval.
     c) Relying party implementations should also be able to obtain CA certificates and
        CRLs using LDAP from an organizationally designated local directory, as well as
        locations specified within a user certificate.

  Organizational key recovery should emphasize security and privacy, rather than performance. Dual
control for recovery of a userâ€™s keys by the organization is strongly recommended.
