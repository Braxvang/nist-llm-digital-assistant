2.4.5 OCSP Responders
For federal agencies, detailed configuration guidance for OCSP responders is specified in
Draft Guidance for OCSP Responders in the U.S. Federal PKI.17

1. If maximum interoperability is required then:
       a) OCSP responders shall not require that requests be signed and shall not limit the
          set of relying parties to which certificate status information is provided.
       b) The responders shall generate OCSP basic responses, and the responses shall not
          include critical extensions.
2. Where interoperability requirements are limited to a closed community:
       a) OCSP responders may require signed requests, and may reject requests from
          entities outside that community.
       b) OCSP response messages may include private extensions known within the target
          community.

2.4.6 Backup and Archive
       1. To maintain the availability of status information, CAs shall ensure that sufficient
          information is stored in a secure location to reconstitute the CA after a disaster.

       2. CAs should archive sufficient information to establish when certificates were
          issued, and under whose authority.

       3. As a general rule, audit logs should be maintained, along with any certificates and
          CRLs issued by the CA.

       4. User public signature verification keys should be archived, along with their
          corresponding certificates as long as required.


2.4.7 Relying Party Integration and Configuration
       1. Path discovery components shall be configured to enable path discovery and
          require the retrieval of status information.

       2. Status information should be accepted in both CRL and OCSP formats.

       3. Relying party implementations shall be configured to recognize the smallest set
          of acceptable trust anchors possible.

       4. For business-to-government and government-to-government applications, federal
          agencies should use either the Common Policy Root CA or an agency CA that is
          cross-certified with the Common Policy Root CA or the Federal Bridge as the
          trust anchor.
