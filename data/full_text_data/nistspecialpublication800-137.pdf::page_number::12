CHAPTER TWO

THE FUNDAMENTALS
ONGOING MONITORING IN SUPPORT OF RISK MANAGEMENT




T      his chapter describes the fundamental concepts associated with organization-wide
       continuous monitoring of information security and the application of ISCM in support of
       organizational risk management decisions (e.g., risk response decisions, ongoing system
authorization decisions, Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&M) resource and prioritization
decisions, etc.). In order to effectively address ever-increasing security challenges, a well-
designed ISCM strategy addresses monitoring and assessment of security controls for
effectiveness, and security status monitoring. 8 It also incorporates processes to assure that
response actions are taken in accordance with findings and organizational risk tolerances and to
assure that said responses have the intended effects.

The process of implementing ISCM as described in Chapter Three is:

•   Define the ISCM strategy;
•   Establish an ISCM program;

•   Implement the ISCM program;
•   Analyze and Report findings;

•   Respond to findings; and

•   Review and Update ISCM strategy and program.
ISCM strategies evolve in accordance with drivers for risk-based decision making and
requirements for information. These requirements may come from any tier in the organization.
Organizations implement ISCM based on requirements of those accountable and responsible for
maintaining ongoing control of organizational security posture to within organizational risk
tolerances. The implementation is standardized across the organization to the greatest extent
possible so as to minimize use of resources (e.g., funding for purchase of tools/applications, data
calls, organization-wide policies/procedures/templates, etc.) and to maximize leveragability of
security-related information. Upon analysis, the resulting information informs the discrete
processes used to manage the organization’s security posture and overall risk. ISCM helps to
provide situational awareness of the security status of the organization’s systems based on
information collected from resources (e.g., people, processes, technology, environment) and the
capabilities in place to react as the situation changes.

    Organizations implement processes to manage organizational security and metrics that provide insight into those
    processes and hence into organizational security status. Some of those security processes will align with individual
    security controls, and others will align with components or combinations of controls. Discussions of metrics can
    be found in Section 3.2.1 and in NIST SP 800-55, Performance Measurement Guide for Information Security, as
    amended.
