communications among other teams and supervises information system contingency plan tests and
exercises. Some or all of the management team may lead specialized recovery teams. A senior
management official, such as the CIO, has the ultimate authority to activate the plan and to make
decisions regarding spending levels, acceptable risk, and interagency coordination. The senior
management official typically leads the management team.

3.5       Plan Testing, Training, and Exercises (TT&E)

An ISCP should be maintained in a state of readiness, which includes having personnel trained to fulfill
their roles and responsibilities within the plan, having plans exercised to validate their content, and having
systems and system components tested to ensure their operability in the environment specified in the
ISCP. In addition, as indicated in Step 4 (Assess Security Controls) of the RMF, the effectiveness of the
information system controls should be assessed by using the procedures documented in NIST SP 800-
53A, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems. NIST SP 800-84, Guide
to Test, Training and Exercise Programs for Information Technology Plans and Capabilities, provides
guidelines on designing, developing, conducting, and evaluating test, training, and exercise (TT&E)
events so that organizations can improve their ability to prepare for, respond to, manage, and recover
from adverse events. While the majority of TT&E activities occur during the Operations/Maintenance
phase, initial TT&E events should be conducted during the Implementation/Assessment phase of the
SDLC to validate ISCP recovery procedures.

Organizations should conduct TT&E events periodically, following organizational or system changes, or
the issuance of new TT&E guidance, or as otherwise needed. Execution of TT&E events assists
organizations in determining the plan’s effectiveness, and that all personnel know what their roles are in
the conduct of each information system plan. TT&E event schedules are often dictated in part by
organizational requirements. For example, NIST SP 800-53 includes a control (CP-4) for federal
organizations to conduct exercises or tests for their systems’ contingency plans around an organization-
defined frequency. Section 3.5.4 provides guidance on the type of TT&E identified for each FIPS 199
impact level.

For each TT&E activity conducted, results are documented in an after-action report, and Lessons Learned
corrective actions are captured for updating information in the ISCP. While NIST SP 800-84 provides
detailed information on how to plan and conduct TT&E activities for information systems, the following
sections provide summarized details.

3.5.1     Testing

ISCP testing is a critical element of a viable contingency capability. Testing enables plan deficiencies to
be identified and addressed by validating one or more of the system components and the operability of the
plan. Testing can take on several forms and accomplish several objectives but should be conducted in as
close to an operating environment as possible. Each information system component should be tested to
confirm the accuracy of individual recovery procedures. The following areas should be addressed in a
contingency plan test, as applicable:

         Notification procedures;
         System recovery on an alternate platform from backup media;
         Internal and external connectivity;
         System performance using alternate equipment;
         Restoration of normal operations; and
