The Trustworthy Intelligent Networks project works with industry and academia to improve
the trustworthiness and applicability of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)
technologies in future networks and distributed systems. Research focuses on applications
of AI/ML to address security and robustness issues in today's networks and the development
of a means to test and measure the robustness of the AI/ML techniques necessary for future
autonomic networks.

5G Cybersecurity

The NCCoE announced a 5G Cybersecurity project in the Federal Register in May 2020.
The center has invited an impressive roster of technology providers and industry experts to
collaborate on its 5G Cybersecurity Project, including AMI, AT&T, CableLabs, Cisco, Dell, Intel,
Keysight, MiTAC, Nokia, Palo Alto Networks, and T-Mobile. These collaborators will work with
the NCCoE 5G team to identify 5G use case scenarios and demonstrate how components of
the 5G architecture can provide security capabilities to mitigate identified risks and comply with
industry sector requirements. The result will be a publicly available NIST Cybersecurity Practice
Guide in the Special Publication 1800 series, describing the practical steps needed to implement
a cybersecurity reference design.

Public Safety Communications Research

The Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) Division serves as a technical advisor and
laboratory. PSCR is driven to advance communications technologies for public safety workers
by accelerating their development, adoption, and implementation so that the public safety
community can more effectively carry out their mission to protect lives and property.

Improving Wearable Device Cybersecurity for Public Safety

In partnership with PSCR, NIST finalized NISTIR 8196, Security Analysis of First Responder
Mobile and Wearable Devices, which helps consider various threats to and security objectives
for new types of products (e.g., smartphones, tablets, wearable devices) that have been made
available to public safety via the proliferation of the Nationwide Public Safety Broadband
Network (NPSBN). Its goals are to help public safety organizations make informed decisions
when selecting wearable technology and to better inform industry about cybersecurity concerns
of the public safety use case.

Innovations in Novel Technologies

NIST researchers designed and implemented a PSCR Prize Challenge â€“ Making the Case:
Proactive Image Protection, one of ten challenges within the Tech to Protect Challenge. The
contest tasked participants with designing a system that could identify the provenance and
prove the authenticity of an image captured on a mobile device being used for public safety
purposes. NIST awarded prizes to four finalists whose solutions stand to build more confidence
in digital images gathered by public safety and law enforcement.
