       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


2341   Appendix B.      Change Log
2342   B.1. SP 800-63-1
2343   NIST SP 800-63-1 updated NIST SP 800-63 to reflect current authenticator (then referred
2344   to as “token”) technologies and restructured it to provide a better understanding of
2345   the digital identity architectural model used here. Additional (minimum) technical
2346   requirements were specified for the CSP, protocols used to transport authentication
2347   information, and assertions if implemented within the digital identity model.

2348   B.2. SP 800-63-2
2349   NIST SP 800-63-2 was a limited update of SP 800-63-1 and substantive changes were
2350   made only in Sec. 5, Registration and Issuance Processes. The substantive changes in the
2351   revised draft were intended to facilitate the use of professional credentials in the identity
2352   proofing process, and to reduce the need to send postal mail to an address of record to
2353   issue credentials for level 3 remote registration. Other changes to Sec. 5 were minor
2354   explanations and clarifications.

2355   B.3. SP 800-63-3
2356   NIST SP 800-63-3 is a substantial update and restructuring of SP 800-63-2. SP 800-63-
2357   3 introduces individual components of digital authentication assurance — AAL, IAL,
2358   and FAL — to support the growing need for independent treatment of authentication
2359   strength and confidence in an individual’s claimed identity (e.g., in strong pseudonymous
2360   authentication). A risk assessment methodology and its application to IAL, AAL, and
2361   FAL has been included in this guideline. It also moves the whole of digital identity
2362   guidance covered under SP 800-63 from a single document describing authentication
2363   to a suite of four documents (to separately address the individual components mentioned
2364   above) of which SP 800-63-3 is the top-level document.
2365   Other areas updated in 800-63-3 include:
2366       • Renamed to Digital Identity Guidelines to properly represent the scope includes
2367         identity proofing and federation, and to support expanding the scope to include
2368         device identity, or machine-to-machine authentication in future revisions.
2369       • Changed terminology, including the use of authenticator in place of token to avoid
2370         conflicting use of the word token in assertion technologies.
2371       • Updated authentication and assertion requirements to reflect advances in both
2372         security technology and threats.
2373       • Added requirements on the storage of long-term secrets by verifiers.
2374       • Restructured identity proofing model.
2375       • Updated requirements regarding remote identity proofing.
