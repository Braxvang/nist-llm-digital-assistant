                                                                                   GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



5.       Securing the Server Software

Once the OS has been installed and secured, as described in Section 4, the next step is to install and
secure the chosen server software, which is described in this section. Before starting this process, read the
server software documentation carefully and understand the various options available during the
installation process. Also, be sure to visit the server software manufacturer’s Web site or a vulnerability
database Web site, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), 23 to determine whether there are
known vulnerabilities and related patches available that should be installed or configured as part of the
setup process. Only after these preliminary steps are accomplished should the installation be started.
Note that this section discusses only generic installation and configuration procedures; specific directions
for particular servers are available from server manufacturers and from security checklist repositories. 24

A partially configured and/or patched server should not be exposed to external networks (e.g., the
Internet) or external users. In addition, internal network access should be as limited as possible until all
software is installed, patched, and configured securely. Insecure servers can be compromised in a matter
of minutes after being placed on the Internet. While it is ideal to fully harden the platform before placing
it on the network, it is not always feasible. For example, some application development tool
combinations cannot be installed, configured, and tested on top of a pre-hardened OS and Web server
configuration. In such situations, stepwise or incremental hardening is a viable option to consider, with
full validation of complete hardening occurring at production deployment.

5.1      Securely Installing the Server Software

In many respects, the secure installation and configuration of the server software mirrors the OS process
discussed in Section 4. The overarching principle, as before, is to install only the services required for the
server and to eliminate any known vulnerabilities through patches or upgrades. Any unnecessary
applications, services, or scripts that are installed should be removed immediately once the installation
process is complete. During the installation of the server software, the following steps should be
performed:

 Install the server software either on a dedicated host or on a dedicated guest OS if virtualization is
  being employed.

 Apply any patches or upgrades to correct for known vulnerabilities in the server software.

 Create a dedicated physical disk or logical partition (separate from OS and server application) for
  server data, if applicable.

 Remove or disable all services installed by the server application but not required (e.g., gopher, FTP,
  HTTP, remote administration).

 Remove or disable all unneeded default user accounts created by the server installation.

 Remove all manufacturers’ documentation from the server.

 Remove all example or test files from the server, including sample content, scripts, and executable
  code.
