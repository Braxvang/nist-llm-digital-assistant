      NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                                Enrollment and Identity Proofing


647   A credible source is an entity that can provide or validate the accuracy of identity
648   evidence and attribute information through one or more of the following characteristics. A
649   credible source:
650       • Has access to attribute information that was validated through an identity proofing
651         process; or
652       • Has access to attribute information that can be traced to an authoritative source; or
653       • Maintains identity attribute information obtained from multiple sources that is
654         checked for data correlation for accuracy, consistency, and currency.

655   4.4. Identity Veriﬁcation
656   The goal of identity verification is to confirm and establish a linkage between the claimed
657   identity and the real-life existence of the applicant engaged in the identity proofing
658   process.

659   4.4.1. Identity Veriﬁcation Methods
660   The CSP SHALL verify the linkage of the claimed identity to the applicant engaged in
661   the identity proofing process through one or more of the following methods, depending
662   on the IAL identity verification requirements presented in Sec. 5.
663       • Enrollment code verification as specified in Sec. 5.1.6.
664       • In-person physical comparison. The CSP operator and applicant interact in person
665         for the identity proofing event. The CSP operator performs a physical comparison
666         of the facial portrait presented on identity evidence to the face of the applicant
667         engaged in the identity proofing event.
668       • Remote (attended and unattended) physical facial image comparison. The CSP
669         operator performs a physical comparison of the facial portrait presented on identity
670         evidence to the facial image of the applicant engaged in the identity proofing event.
671         The CSP operator may interact directly with the applicant during some or all of the
672         identity proofing event (attended) or may conduct the comparison at a later time
673         (unattended) using a captured video or photograph and the uploaded copy of the
674         evidence. If the comparison is performed at a later time, steps are taken to ensure
675         the captured video or photograph was taken from the live applicant present during
676         the identity proofing event.
677       • Automated biometric comparison. Biometric system comparison may be
678         performed for in-person or remote identity proofing events. The facial portrait,
679         or other biometric characteristic, contained on identity evidence is compared by
680         an automated biometric comparison system to the facial image photograph of the
681         live applicant or other biometric live sample submitted by the applicant during
682         the identity proofing event. The automated biometric comparison system uses a
683         mathematical algorithm for the comparison.
