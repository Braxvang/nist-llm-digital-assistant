products meet established security requirements and
use only tested and validated cryptographic modules and
algorithms.
     STVMG’s testing-focused activities include validating
cryptographic algorithm implementations, cryptographic
modules, and Security Content Automation Protocol
(SCAP)-compliant products; developing test suites and test
methods; providing implementation guidance and technical
support to industry forums; and conducting education,
training, and outreach programs.
    STVMG’s validation programs work together with
independent Cryptographic and Security Testing
laboratories that are accredited by the NIST National
Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP).
Based on the independent laboratory test report and
test evidence, the Validation Program then validates the
implementation under test. NIST publishes, through public
websites, lists of the validations awarded.
