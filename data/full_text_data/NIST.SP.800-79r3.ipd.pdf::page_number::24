      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                  Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                         and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

702   ensuring that all identity proofing, registration, card/token production, issuance, post-enrollment
703   binding, and reissuance processes are carried out and adhere to the principle of separation of
704   duties wherever necessary to comply with [HSPD-12] and [FIPS201].

705   2.7.6. Assessor
706   The assessor is responsible for performing a comprehensive, third-party assessment of an issuer.
707   The assessor (usually supported by an assessment team) verifies that the issuer’s PIV processes
708   comply with the control objectives of [FIPS201]. The EIMO reviews the assessment findings and
709   prepares recommended corrective actions to reduce or eliminate any discrepancies or
710   shortcomings prior to submission to the DAO for an authorization decision. The assessor is also
711   responsible for providing recommendations for reducing or eliminating deficiencies and security
712   weaknesses and describing the potential impacts if those deficiencies are not corrected. An
713   assessor SHALL NOT be assigned the DAO’s role and vice versa.
714   To preserve the impartial and unbiased nature of the assessment, the assessor SHALL be a third-
715   party that is independent of the offices and personnel that are directly responsible for the day-to-
716   day operation of the issuer. The assessor SHALL also be independent of those individuals
717   responsible for correcting the deficiencies and discrepancies identified during the assessment
718   phase. The independence of the assessor is important for maintaining the credibility of the
719   assessment results and ensuring that the DAO receives objective information in order to make an
720   informed authorization decision.

721   2.7.7. Applicant Representative (AR)
722   The applicant representative (AR) is an optional role that MAY be established and used at the
723   discretion of the organization. The AR represents the interests of current or prospective
724   employees and contractors who are applicants for a PIV Card or derived PIV credential. ARs are
725   responsible for assisting an applicant who is denied a PIV credential because of missing or
726   incorrect information and for ensuring that all applicants obtain useful information and assistance
727   when needed. This role is typically assigned to someone in the organization’s personnel or
728   human resources office.

729   2.7.8. Privacy Official (PO)
730   The responsibilities of the privacy official (PO) are defined in [FIPS201]. The person filling this
731   role SHALL not assume any other operational role within the organization. The PO issues policy
732   guidelines with respect to the collection and handling of personally identifiable information from
733   applicants to ensure that the issuer complies with all relevant directives of the privacy laws. The
734   PO’s role MAY be filled by an organization’s existing official for privacy (e.g., Senior Agency
735   Official for Privacy or Chief Privacy Officer).

736   2.7.9. Role Assignment Policies
737   Although organizational roles are independent and SHOULD be filled by different people if
738   feasible, there may be a need (e.g., because of availability or economy) to have one person fill
739   more than one role. Except for the roles of the assessor and PO and the separation of duty
