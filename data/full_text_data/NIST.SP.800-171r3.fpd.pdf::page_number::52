1350   3.8.4. Media Marking
1351           REQUIREMENT: 03.08.04
1352           Mark system media containing CUI to indicate distribution limitations, handling caveats, and
1353           security markings.

1354           DISCUSSION
1355           System media includes digital and non-digital media. Security marking refers to the application or
1356           use of human-readable security attributes. Security labeling refers to the use of security attributes
1357           for internal system data structures. Digital media includes diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or
1358           removable solid state or magnetic drives, flash drives, compact discs, and digital versatile discs.
1359           Non-digital media includes paper and microfilm. CUI is defined by NARA along with marking,
1360           safeguarding, and dissemination requirements for such information.

1364   3.8.5. Media Transport
1365           REQUIREMENT: 03.08.05
1366           a. Protect and control system media containing CUI during transport outside of controlled areas.
1367           b. Maintain accountability of system media containing CUI during transport outside of controlled
1368              areas.

1369           DISCUSSION
1370           System media includes digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes flash drives,
1371           diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable solid state or magnetic drives, compact discs,
1372           and digital versatile discs. Non-digital media includes microfilm and paper. Controlled areas are
1373           spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural measures to meet the requirements
1374           established for protecting information and systems. Media protection during transport can include
1375           cryptography and/or locked containers. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality
1376           protections, depending on the mechanisms implemented. Activities associated with media
1377           transport include releasing media for transport, ensuring that media enters the appropriate
1378           transport processes, and the actual transport. Authorized transport and courier personnel may
1379           include individuals external to the organization. Maintaining accountability of media during
1380           transport includes restricting transport activities to authorized personnel and tracking or obtaining
1381           records of transport activities as the media moves through the transportation system to prevent
1382           and detect loss, destruction, or tampering. This requirement is related to 03.13.11.
