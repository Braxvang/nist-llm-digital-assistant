 Expected Result(s)        1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                              template with the status word '90 00'.
                           2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                              along with the status word '90 00'.
                           3. From Step 6, the digestAlgorithms field value of the
                              SignedData is in accordance with Table 3-2 of [SP800-78].

9.2.1.5 encapContentInfo Contents

 Test Assertion            TA-09.02.01.05
 Purpose                   Verifies that the eContentType of the encapContentInfo is id-icao-
                           ldsSecurityObject and the eContent field of the encapContentInfo
                           contains the contents of the ldsSecurity object.

 Precondition(s)           • A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                               appropriate token reader.
                           • Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                               an instance of the reader.
                           • A Security Object is present within the Derived PIV
                               Application.
 Test Scenario             1. Send the SELECT command with
                                 • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                           2. Send the GET DATA command with
                                 • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                    ('5FC106') of the Security Object
                           3. Extract and parse the encapContentInfo field
                              contents from the Security Object.
 Expected Result(s)        1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                              template with the status word '90 00'.
                           2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                              along with the status word '90 00'.
                           3. From Step 3, the eContent field contains a correctly formatted
                              ldsSecurityobject and the eContentType asserts id-icao-
                              ldsSecurityObject in encapContentInfo.

9.2.1.6 Derived PIV Credential Issuer’s (Content Signing) Certificate Inclusion

 Test Assertion            TA-09.02.01.06
 Purpose                   Verifies that the Security Object includes the certificate of the
                           Derived PIV Credential Issuer (i.e., the issuer’s content signing
                           certificate).
