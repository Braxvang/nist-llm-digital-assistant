Appendix H. Technical Processes
This appendix contains the Technical Processes from [4] with security-relevant considerations
and contributions for the purpose, outcomes, activities, and tasks. As noted in Section G.2, the
application of these processes at any life cycle stage is described in [96], which has a set of
example stages and stage outcomes for enacting technical processes within system and software
life cycles.

H.1.     Business or Mission Analysis
The purpose of the Business or Mission Analysis process is to define the overall strategic
problem or opportunity, characterize the solution space, and determine potential solution
class(es) that can address a problem or take advantage of an opportunity.

H.1.1. Security Purpose
-   Define the security aspects related to the strategic problems or opportunities.
-   Identify the security objectives, concerns, and constraints that inform the potential solution
    class(es).

H.1.2. Security Outcomes
-   Security aspects of the strategic problem or opportunity space are defined.
-   Security aspects of the solution space are characterized.
-   The definition of the preliminary operational concepts and other concepts in the life cycle
    stages is informed by the security aspects of the problem or opportunity space.
-   Alternative solution class(es) that consider(s) identified security aspects is/are analyzed.
-   Selection of the preferred alternative solution class(es) is informed by the security aspects of
    the solution space.
-   Enabling systems or services needed for the security aspects of business or mission analysis
    are available.
-   Traceability of the security aspects of the strategic problems and opportunities to the
    preferred alternative solution class(es) is established.

H.1.3. Security Activities and Tasks
BA-1     PREPARE FOR BUSINESS OR MISSION ANALYSIS
         BA-1.1 Identify the security aspects for enabling systems or services needed to support
                business or mission analysis.
         BA-1.2 Identify and plan for enabling systems or services needed to support the security
                aspects of business or mission analysis.
