                                                    GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



Executive Summary

Forensic science is generally defined as the application of science to the law. Digital forensics, also
known as computer and network forensics, has many definitions. Generally, it is considered the
application of science to the identification, collection, examination, and analysis of data while preserving
the integrity of the information and maintaining a strict chain of custody for the data. Data refers to
distinct pieces of digital information that have been formatted in a specific way. Organizations have an
ever-increasing amount of data from many sources. For example, data can be stored or transferred by
standard computer systems, networking equipment, computing peripherals, personal digital assistants
(PDA), consumer electronic devices, and various types of media, among other sources.

Because of the variety of data sources, digital forensic techniques can be used for many purposes, such as
investigating crimes and internal policy violations, reconstructing computer security incidents,
troubleshooting operational problems, and recovering from accidental system damage. Practically every
organization needs to have the capability to perform digital forensics (referred to as forensics throughout
the rest of the guide). Without such a capability, an organization will have difficulty determining what
events have occurred within its systems and networks, such as exposures of protected, sensitive data.
This guide provides detailed information on establishing a forensic capability, including the development
of policies and procedures. Its focus is primarily on using forensic techniques to assist with computer
security incident response, but much of the material is also applicable to other situations.

Because different organizations are subject to different laws and regulations, this publication
should not be used as a guide to executing a digital forensic investigation, construed as legal advice,
or used as the basis for investigations of criminal activity.1 Instead, organizations should use this
guide as a starting point for developing a forensic capability in conjunction with extensive guidance
provided by legal advisors, law enforcement officials, and management.

The process for performing digital forensics comprises the following basic phases:

    ! Collection: identifying, labeling, recording, and acquiring data from the possible sources of
      relevant data, while following procedures that preserve the integrity of the data.
    ! Examination: forensically processing collected data using a combination of automated and
      manual methods, and assessing and extracting data of particular interest, while preserving the
      integrity of the data.
    ! Analysis: analyzing the results of the examination, using legally justifiable methods and
      techniques, to derive useful information that addresses the questions that were the impetus for
      performing the collection and examination.
    ! Reporting: reporting the results of the analysis, which may include describing the actions used,
      explaining how tools and procedures were selected, determining what other actions need to be
      performed (e.g., forensic examination of additional data sources, securing identified
      vulnerabilities, improving existing security controls), and providing recommendations for
      improvement to policies, procedures, tools, and other aspects of the forensic process.
This guide provides general recommendations for performing the forensic process. It also provides
detailed information about using the analysis process with four major categories of data sources: files,
