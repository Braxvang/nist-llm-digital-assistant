6.3.3     Attacks on the Authentication Server

Operating system security was not a major concern for pre-RSN WLANs because of the limited
functionality of most APs. In an RSN, the core STA authentication function is performed on a separate
authentication server, which typically runs on a sophisticated operating system such as UNIX, Linux, or
Windows. A breach of the operating system or an application or service with operating system privileges
could lead to a complete compromise of RSN security. Accordingly, WLAN security should include
hardening of the servers that support the authentication process. 90

6.4     EAP Multiplexing Model and Related Support Requirements

This section provides additional information on the conceptual architecture of EAP for readers seeking a
better understanding of how EAP works and how it interacts with other protocols. Readers who do not
need this information should skip this section and proceed to Section 6.5.

RFC 3748 provides a framework for EAP using a four-layer conceptual model described in Table 6-5. It
is called the EAP multiplexing model because it describes how EAP can handle multiple EAP methods in
the same EAP implementation.

                                            Table 6-5. EAP Multiplexing Model

          Model Layer                                                     Description
                                   Implements the specified EAP method, which performs the actual authentication
 Method Layer                      transaction. During an EAP dialog, an EAP method on the peer communicates with
                                   the equivalent EAP method on the authenticator.
                                   Forwards EAP packets between the EAP layer and the appropriate EAP method.
                                   STAs and ASs that mutually authenticate one another serve in both the peer and
 Peer/Authenticator Layer
                                   authenticator roles. APs serve as pass-through authenticators, proxying traffic for
                                   both the STA and the AS when they serve in the authenticator role.
                                   Manages the EAP dialog—receiving and transmitting EAP packets via the lower
                                   layer, detecting duplicate packets, retransmitting packets when necessary, and
 EAP Layer                         handling communication with the EAP peer or authenticator. EAP packets
                                   containing request, success, or failure notices are delivered to the peer layer; EAP
                                   packets containing responses to requests are delivered to the authenticator layer.
                                   Responsible for encapsulating and transmitting EAP frames between the peer and
 Lower Layer
                                   the authenticator.
