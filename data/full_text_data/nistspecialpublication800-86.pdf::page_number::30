GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



3.2     Examination

After data has been collected, the next phase is to examine the data, which involves assessing and
extracting the relevant pieces of information from the collected data. This phase may also involve
bypassing or mitigating OS or application features that obscure data and code, such as data compression,
encryption, and access control mechanisms. An acquired hard drive may contain hundreds of thousands
of data files; identifying the data files that contain information of interest, including information
concealed through file compression and access control, can be a daunting task. In addition, data files of
interest may contain extraneous information that should be filtered. For example, yesterdayâ€™s firewall log
might hold millions of records, but only five of the records might be related to the event of interest.

Fortunately, various tools and techniques can be used to reduce the amount of data that has to be sifted
through. Text and pattern searches can be used to identify pertinent data, such as finding documents that
mention a particular subject or person, or identifying e-mail log entries for a particular e-mail address.
Another helpful technique is to use a tool that can determine the type of contents of each data file, such as
text, graphics, music, or a compressed file archive. Knowledge of data file types can be used to identify
files that merit further study, as well as to exclude files that are of no interest to the examination. There
are also databases containing information about known files, which can also be used to include or exclude
files from further consideration. Specific information about examination tools and techniques is
presented in Sections 4.3, 5.3, 6.4, and 7.4.

3.3     Analysis

Once the relevant information has been extracted, the analyst should study and analyze the data to draw
conclusions from it.14 The foundation of forensics is using a methodical approach to reach appropriate
conclusions based on the available data or determine that no conclusion can yet be drawn. The analysis
should include identifying people, places, items, and events, and determining how these elements are
related so that a conclusion can be reached. Often, this effort will include correlating data among
multiple sources. For instance, a network intrusion detection system (IDS) log may link an event to a
host, the host audit logs may link the event to a specific user account, and the host IDS log may indicate
what actions that user performed. Tools such as centralized logging and security event management
software can facilitate this process by automatically gathering and correlating the data. Comparing
system characteristics to known baselines can identify various types of changes made to the system.
Section 8 describes this analysis process in more detail.

As described in Section 3.1.2, if evidence may be needed for legal or internal disciplinary actions,
analysts should carefully document the findings and all steps taken.

3.4     Reporting

The final phase is reporting, which is the process of preparing and presenting the information resulting
from the analysis phase. Many factors affect reporting, including the following:

      ! Alternative Explanations. When the information regarding an event is incomplete, it may not
        be possible to arrive at a definitive explanation of what happened. When an event has two or
        more plausible explanations, each should be given due consideration in the reporting process.
        Analysts should use a methodical approach to attempt to prove or disprove each possible
        explanation that is proposed.

      Some forensic process methodologies have a separate analysis phase after the examination phase. For the sake of simplicity,
      this publication presents analysis as part of the examination phase. Typically, an analyst examines data and performs
      analysis of that data, then conducts additional examination and analysis based on the results of the initial analysis.
