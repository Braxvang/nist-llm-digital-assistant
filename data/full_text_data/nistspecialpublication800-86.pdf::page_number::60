GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



process. Analysts generally find it useful to identify a few data sources to review initially, then find other
likely sources of important information on the basis of that review. In addition, in many cases, analysis
can involve data from other types of sources, such as network traffic or applications. Section 8 provides
examples of how data from OSs and other sources can be correlated through analysis.

5.4     Recommendations

The key recommendations presented in this section for using data from OSs are as follows.

      ! Analysts should act appropriately to preserve volatile OS data. The criteria for determining
        whether volatile OS data must be preserved should be documented in advance so that analysts can
        make informed decisions as quickly as possible. To determine whether the effort required to
        collect volatile OS data is warranted, the risks associated with such collection should be weighed
        against the potential for recovering important information.
      ! Analysts should use a forensic toolkit for collecting volatile OS data. Use of a forensic toolkit
        enables accurate OS data to be collected while minimizing the disturbance to the system and
        protecting the tools from changes. The analyst should know how each tool is likely to affect or
        alter the system during collection of data.
      ! Analysts should choose the appropriate shutdown method for each system. Each method of
        shutting down a particular OS can cause different types of data to be preserved or corrupted;
        analysts should be aware of the typical shutdown behavior of each OS.
