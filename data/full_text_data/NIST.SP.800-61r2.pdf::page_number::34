3.2.1    Attack Vectors

Incidents can occur in countless ways, so it is infeasible to develop step-by-step instructions for handling
every incident. Organizations should be generally prepared to handle any incident but should focus on
being prepared to handle incidents that use common attack vectors. Different types of incidents merit
different response strategies. The attack vectors listed below are not intended to provide definitive
classification for incidents; rather, they simply list common methods of attack, which can be used as a
basis for defining more specific handling procedures.
 External/Removable Media: An attack executed from removable media or a peripheral device—for
  example, malicious code spreading onto a system from an infected USB flash drive.
 Attrition: An attack that employs brute force methods to compromise, degrade, or destroy systems,
  networks, or services (e.g., a DDoS intended to impair or deny access to a service or application; a
  brute force attack against an authentication mechanism, such as passwords, CAPTCHAS, or digital
  signatures).
 Web: An attack executed from a website or web-based application—for example, a cross-site
  scripting attack used to steal credentials or a redirect to a site that exploits a browser vulnerability and
  installs malware.
 Email: An attack executed via an email message or attachment—for example, exploit code disguised
  as an attached document or a link to a malicious website in the body of an email message.
 Impersonation: An attack involving replacement of something benign with something malicious—
  for example, spoofing, man in the middle attacks, rogue wireless access points, and SQL injection
  attacks all involve impersonation.
 Improper Usage: Any incident resulting from violation of an organization’s acceptable usage
  policies by an authorized user, excluding the above categories; for example, a user installs file sharing
  software, leading to the loss of sensitive data; or a user performs illegal activities on a system.
