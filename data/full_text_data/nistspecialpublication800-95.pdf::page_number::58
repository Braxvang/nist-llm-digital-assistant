The artifact resolution protocol allows a SAML provider to retrieve a SAML message based on its
artifact, which is a reference to the message. The SAML-aware service passes the artifact to the provider
instead of the SAML message itself. Artifacts are intended to be used when the transport mechanism has
size constraints or cannot provide a secure channel through which to send a SAML message. For
example, a SAML artifact can be passed as an HTTP GET parameter, allowing a traditional Web browser
to pass a SAML assertion from the identity provider to a Web application without requiring the Web
browser to be SAML-compliant.

The name identifier management protocol provides a mechanism through which SAML identity providers
and service providers can notify one another that a principal's identifier has a new or modified value or
format. Identity providers supply a ManageNameIDRequest element containing a NameID or
EncryptedNameID element and NewID, NewEncryptedID, or Terminate element. Privacy concerns may
be met by submitting the identifiers in encrypted form. Through the Terminate element, an identity
provider can inform service providers that it will no longer supply assertions for the specified principal, or
a service provider can inform the identity provider that it will no longer accept assertions for the specified
principal.

The single logout protocol allows a principal to simultaneously log out of multiple sessions from a single
service provider. When a principal has authenticated to an identity provider, the identity provider may
initiate a session so that the principal does not need to re-authenticate (the identity provider becomes a
session authority). When the principal accesses service providers, they may wish to initiate sessions to
alleviate the need to communicate with the identity provider for each of the principal's requests (the
service provider becomes a session participant). Should the principal wish to terminate all sessions
associated with the initial authentication, a LogoutRequest may be sent to any of the session participants.
If a session participant received the LogoutRequest, it will forward the LogoutRequest to the session
authority. The session authority will send a LogoutRequest to all session participants except for the
participant that initiated the LogoutRequest. The single logout protocol ensures that the principal does not
need to be aware of all sessions associated with the original authentication.

The name identifier mapping protocol allows a provider to request a principal's name identifier from an
identity provider in a specific format. A service provider must send a NameIDMappingRequest to the
identity provider with a BaseID, NameID or EncryptedID element identifying the principal and a
NameIDPolicy element indicating the format of the identifier to be returned. Use of an EncryptedID
element can ensure that the principal's privacy is adequately maintained during the exchange. The
identity provider will return a NameID or EncryptedID that satisfies the request parameters.

3.5.3.4 SAML Profiles

The SAML specification provides a number of profiles 40 that specify how SAML messages, assertions
and protocols are to be used in various contexts. Because SAML is a versatile specification, there are five
categories of profiles. Some categories only define a single profile, leaving room for future SAML
specifications to expand. The five profile categories are:

 Single sign-on (SSO). These profiles define the protocols necessary to support SSO across multiple
  Web applications. There are profiles defining how to support SAML SSO when the client uses a
