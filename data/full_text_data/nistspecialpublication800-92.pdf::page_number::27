3.       Log Management Infrastructure

A log management infrastructure consists of the hardware, software, networks, and media used to
generate, transmit, store, analyze, and dispose of log data.20 Most organizations have one or more log
management infrastructures.21 This section describes the typical architecture of a log management
infrastructure and how its components interact with each other. It then describes the basic functions
performed within a log management infrastructure. Next, it examines the two major categories of log
management software: syslog-based centralized logging software and security information and event
management software. The section also describes additional types of software that may be useful within a
log management infrastructure.

3.1      Architecture

A log management infrastructure typically comprises the following three tiers:

       Log Generation. The first tier contains the hosts that generate the log data. Some hosts run
        logging client applications or services that make their log data available through networks to log
        servers in the second tier. Other hosts make their logs available through other means, such as
        allowing the servers to authenticate to them and retrieve copies of the log files.
       Log Analysis and Storage. The second tier is composed of one or more log servers that receive
        log data or copies of log data from the hosts in the first tier. The data is transferred to the servers
        either in a real-time or near-real-time manner, or in occasional batches based on a schedule or the
        amount of log data waiting to be transferred. Servers that receive log data from multiple log
        generators are sometimes called collectors or aggregators. Log data may be stored on the log
        servers themselves or on separate database servers.
       Log Monitoring. The third tier contains consoles that may be used to monitor and review log
        data and the results of automated analysis. Log monitoring consoles can also be used to generate
        reports. In some log management infrastructures, consoles can also be used to provide
        management for the log servers and clients. Also, console user privileges sometimes can be
        limited to only the necessary functions and data sources for each user.
The second tier—log analysis and storage—can vary greatly in complexity and structure. The simplest
arrangement is a single log server that handles all log analysis and storage functions. Examples of more
complex second tier arrangements are as follows:

       Multiple log servers that each perform a specialized function, such as one server performing log
        collection, analysis, and short-term log storage, and another server performing long-term storage.
       Multiple log servers that each perform analysis and/or storage for certain log generators. This can
        also provide some redundancy. A log generator can switch to a backup log server if its primary
        log server becomes unavailable. Also, log servers can be configured to share log data with each
        other, which also supports redundancy.

      Although this document describes log management infrastructures solely in the context of computer security log data,
      organizations can use the same infrastructures for other types of log data. The general principles and technologies presented
      in this section are applicable to other logging needs.
21
      Some organizations, particularly smaller ones, may choose to have a single log management infrastructure used throughout
      the enterprise. For most organizations, a single infrastructure is not feasible for any of several reasons, including limitations
      on the scalability of a single infrastructure, logging occurring on logically or physically separate networks, concern about
      robustness (e.g., having a single infrastructure means that a failure of that infrastructure affects logging throughout the
      organization), and interoperability issues among log generators and infrastructure components.
