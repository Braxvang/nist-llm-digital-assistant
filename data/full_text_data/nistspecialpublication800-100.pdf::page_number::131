CHAPTER 12                                        Security Services and Products Acquisition


Consideration
                                      Questions                                       Comments
   Type
Product          What is the frequency of product failures and
                  adequacy of corrective actions?
Vendor           Will the selection of a particular product limit the   Note: the change and pace of technology
                  future choices of other computer security or           may make it difficult to estimate the
                  operational modifications and improvements?            impact to an organization’s future
                                                                         security architecture.
Vendor           Does the vendor have experience in producing high
                  quality information security products?
Vendor           What is the vendor’s “track record” in responding to
                  security flaws in its products?
Vendor           How does the vendor handle software and hardware
                  maintenance, end-user support, and maintenance
                  agreements?
Vendor           What is the long-term viability of the vendor?

Vendor           Has the vendor developed a security configuration
                  guide?
Vendor           Does the vendor have an associated security guide
                  for the product?
Vendor           Does the vendor use or make reference to NIST,
                  consortia, or other consensus-based checklists,
                  security configurations/settings, or benchmarks?

    Some examples of product types include access control, intrusion detection and
other information security-related products. Before deciding to purchase any type of
security product, decision makers should consider product capabilities, compatibility
with other products, and environmental considerations, among others.

12.4 Security Checklists for IT Products
    Vulnerabilities in IT products surface nearly every day, and many ready-to-use
exploits are widely available on the Internet. Because IT products are often intended
for a wide variety of audiences, restrictive security controls are usually not enabled
by default, so many IT products are immediately vulnerable out of the box. Security
program managers should review the NIST SP 800-70, Security Configuration
Checklists Program for IT Products, May 2005, which helps to facilitate the
development and dissemination of security checklists so that organizations and
individual users can better secure their IT products. A security configuration
checklist (sometimes called a lockdown or hardening guide or benchmark) is, in its
simplest form, a series of instructions for configuring a product to a particular
operating environment.

12.5 Organizational Conflict of Interest
    An organizational conflict of interest (OCI) may exist when a party to an
agreement has a past, present, or future interest related to the work performed (or
to be performed), which may diminish its capacity to provide technically sound,
objective service or which may result in an unfair competitive advantage. Agencies
should do their best to avoid organizational conflicts before they arise. However, if
an organization determines that an OCI exists but cannot be avoided and the
organization wishes to proceed nonetheless, the head of the organization must
formally waive the OCI.
   Identifying the existence of OCIs, mitigating the effect of the OCI to an
acceptable level, or waiving the OCI are important steps for consideration when


                                                                                                           122
