       NIST SP 800-171Ar3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                            Assessing CUI Security Requirements
       November 2023

2900             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
2901             Determine if:
2902             A.03.16.02.a: system components are replaced when support for the components is no longer
2903             available from the developer, vendor, or manufacturer.
2904             A.03.16.02.b: options for risk mitigation or alternative sources for continued support for
2905             unsupported components are provided if components cannot be replaced.

2906             ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
2907             Examine
2908             [SELECT FROM: system and services acquisition policy and procedures; procedures for the
2909             replacement or continued use of unsupported system components; documented evidence of
2910             replacing unsupported system components; documented approvals (including justification) for
2911             the continued use of unsupported system components; SCRM plan; system security plan; other
2912             relevant documents or records]
2913             Interview
2914             [SELECT FROM: personnel with system and service acquisition responsibilities; personnel
2915             responsible for component replacement; personnel with system development life cycle
2916             responsibilities; personnel with information security responsibilities]
2917             Test
2918             [SELECT FROM: processes for replacing unsupported system components; mechanisms for
2919             supporting and/or implementing the replacement of unsupported system components]

2922   3.16.3. External System Services
2923             REQUIREMENT: 03.16.03

2924             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
2925             Determine if:
2926             A.03.16.03.ODP[01]: the security requirements to be employed by external system
2927             service providers are defined.
2928             A.03.16.03.a: the providers of external system services used for the processing, storage, or
2929             transmission of CUI comply with the following security requirements: <A.03.16.03.ODP[01]:
2930             security requirements>.
2931             A.03.16.03.b: user roles and responsibilities with regard to external system services, including
2932             shared responsibilities with external providers, are defined and documented.
2933             A.03.16.03.c: processes, methods, and techniques to monitor security requirement compliance
2934             by external service providers on an ongoing basis are implemented.

2935             ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
2936             Examine
2937             [SELECT FROM: system and services acquisition policy and procedures; procedures for
2938             monitoring security requirement compliance by external service providers; acquisition
