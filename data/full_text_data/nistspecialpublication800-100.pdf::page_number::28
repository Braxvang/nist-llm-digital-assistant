3. System Development Life Cycle
     The system development life cycle (SDLC) is the overall process of developing,
implementing, and retiring information systems through a multistep process from
initiation, analysis, design, implementation, and maintenance to disposal. There are
many different SDLC models and methodologies, but each generally consists of a
series of defined steps or phases.
    Various SDLC methodologies have been developed to guide the processes
involved, and some methods work better than others for specific types of projects.
Regardless of the type of the life cycle used by an organization, information security
must be integrated into the SDLC to ensure appropriate protection for the
information that the system is intended to transmit, process, and store. Security is
most useful and cost-effective when such integration begins with a system
development or integration project initiation, and is continued throughout the SDLC
through system disposal. A number of federal laws and directives require integrating
security into the SDLC, including the Federal Information Security Management Act
(FISMA) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix III.
    This section provides a general overview of security integration into the SDLC and
is not intended to prescribe any particular model or methodology. Each phase of the
SDLC includes a minimum set of information security-related activities required to
effectively incorporate security into a system. An organization can either use a
generic SDLC as described in this section or develop a tailored SDLC that meets its
specific needs. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special
Publication (SP) 800-64 Rev. 1, Security Considerations in the Information System
Development Life Cycle, presents a framework for incorporating security into all
phases of the SDLC, depicted in Figure 3-1, to ensure the selection, acquisition, and
use of appropriate and cost-effective security controls. 19

3.1 Initiation Phase
     All information technology (IT) projects have a starting point, what is commonly
referred to as the initiation phase. During the initiation phase, the organization
establishes the need for a particular system and documents its purpose. The
information to be processed, transmitted, or stored is typically evaluated, as well as
who is required access to such information and how (in high-level terms). In
addition, it is often determined whether the project will be an independent
information system or a component of an already-defined system. A preliminary risk
assessment is typically conducted in this phase, and security planning documents are
initiated (system security plan).
