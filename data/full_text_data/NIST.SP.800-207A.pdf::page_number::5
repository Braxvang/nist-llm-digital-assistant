Abstract
One of the basic tenets of zero trust is to remove the implicit trust in users, services, and devices
based only on their network location, affiliation, and ownership. NIST Special Publication 800-
207 has laid out a comprehensive set of zero trust principles and referenced zero trust
architectures (ZTA) for turning those concepts into reality. A key paradigm shift in ZTAs is the
change in focus from security controls based on segmentation and isolation using network
parameters (e.g., Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, subnets, perimeter) to identities. From an
application security point of view, this requires authentication and authorization policies based
on application and service identities in addition to the underlying network parameters and user
identities. This in turn requires a platform that consists of Application Programming Interface
(API) gateways, sidecar proxies, and application identity infrastructures (e.g., Secure Production
Identity Framework for Everyone [SPIFFE]) that can enforce those policies irrespective of the
location of the services or applications, whether on-premises or on multiple clouds. The
objective of this publication is to provide guidance for realizing an architecture that can enforce
granular application-level policies while meeting the runtime requirements of ZTA for multi-
cloud and hybrid environments.

Reports on Computer Systems Technology
The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
with industry, government, and academic organizations.
