                                                   CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS




The following persons or roles may activate the ISCP if one or more of these criteria are met:

Establish one or more roles that may activate the plan based on activation criteria. Authorized persons
may include the system or business owner, or the operations point of contact (POC) for system support.

3.2       Notification

The first step upon activation of the {system name} ISCP is notification of appropriate business and
system support personnel. Contact information for appropriate POCs is included in {Contact List
Appendix name}.

For {system name}, the following method and procedure for notifications are used:

Describe established notification procedures. Notification procedures should include who makes the
initial notifications, the sequence in which personnel are notified (e.g., system owner, technical POC,
ISCP Coordinator, business unit or user unit POC, and recovery team POC), and the method of
notification (e.g., email blast, call tree, automated notification system, etc.).

3.3       Outage Assessment

Following notification, a thorough outage assessment is necessary to determine the extent of the
disruption, any damage, and expected recovery time. This outage assessment is conducted by {name of
recovery team}. Assessment results are provided to the ISCP Coordinator to assist in the coordination of
the recovery of {system name}.

Outline detailed procedures to include how to determine the cause of the outage; identification of
potential for additional disruption or damage; assessment of affected physical area(s); and determination
of the physical infrastructure status, IS equipment functionality, and inventory. Procedures should
include notation of items that will need to be replaced and estimated time to restore service to normal
operations.

4.        Recovery

The Recovery Phase provides formal recovery operations that begin after the ISCP has been activated,
outage assessments have been completed (if possible), personnel have been notified, and appropriate
teams have been mobilized. Recovery Phase activities focus on implementing recovery strategies to
restore system capabilities, repair damage, and resume operational capabilities at the original or an
alternate location. At the completion of the Recovery Phase, {system name} will be functional and
capable of performing the functions identified in Section 2.1 of this plan.

4.1       Sequence of Recovery Activities

The following activities occur during recovery of {system name}:

Modify the following list as appropriate for the selected system recovery strategy.
      1. Identify recovery location (if not at original location);
      2. Identify required resources to perform recovery procedures;
      3. Retrieve backup and system installation media;
