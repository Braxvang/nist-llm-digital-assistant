In Fiscal Year (FY) 2020, the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) finalized
two publications. The first, NIST Interagency or Internal Report (NISTIR) 8287, A Roadmap for
Successful Regional Alliances and Multistakeholder Partnerships to Build the Cybersecurity
Workforce, provides a summary of how to create ecosystems and partnerships to stimulate
cybersecurity education and workforce development.
The second, NIST Special Publication (SP) 1500-16, Improving Veteran Transitions to Civilian
Cybersecurity Roles: Workshop Report, presents the findings and recommendations from
a workshop on how to help transitioning military members discover opportunities in the
cybersecurity workforce.
NICE also curated a webpage for free and low-cost online cybersecurity learning content. At a
time when many are transitioning to remote learning or considering a job or career change, this
resource provided links to training courses, labs, and curriculum for the purposes of progressing
toward new skills or credentials in cybersecurity.
NICE hosted several events in FY 2020. In addition to monthly webinars, NICE held two annual
conferences – the NICE Conference and Expo in Phoenix, Arizona, which had more than
800 registrants; and the NICE K12 Cybersecurity Education Conference in Garden Grove,
California, which had more than 450 registrants. NICE also conducted a workshop on Use
Cases for the NICE Framework and the annual National Cybersecurity Career Awareness
Week where organizations from around the world held virtual and in-person events to
help inspire and promote awareness and exploration of cybersecurity careers.
Advancing Cybersecurity Usability
NIST has popularized the “Phish Scale” as a method to better characterize an organization’s
phishing risk. The scale considers phishing cues and user context to help Chief Information
Security Officers and phishing training implementers rate the difficulty of their organizations’
phishing exercises and explain associated click rates. NIST’s Video and Digital Media Production
Group created a video for the Phish Scale, and research results were published in the Journal of
Cybersecurity and highlighted in a NIST article that garnered media attention across industry,
government, and academia.
NIST also completed an in-depth interview study to understand consumers’ challenges,
perceptions, and experiences related to smart home security and privacy. The results of the
study inform the Internet of Things (IoT) security and privacy guidelines by identifying current
gaps in users’ experiences and suggesting how smart home devices might be designed to
better integrate usability, privacy, and security. The capstone paper describing the results will
be published in the proceedings of the 2021 USENIX Security Symposium.
Small Business Cybersecurity Corner
In FY 2020, the Small Business Cybersecurity Corner website organization and design were
updated based on the results of a usability study conducted by a set of small business owners.
In addition to facilitating access to many popular small business security resources, the
language of the site was updated to be more accessible and relatable to the small business
community. Training materials and accompanying resources continue to be expanded based
on cybersecurity resources and feedback received from NIST’s federal partners and the public.
