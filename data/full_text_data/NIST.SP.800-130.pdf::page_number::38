SP 800-130                                                              August 2013



   h) Audit Administrator: An audit administrator is responsible for auditing all
      aspects of a CKMS to verify its security and authorized operation. In particular,
      the audit administrator will manage and review the event log and should have no
      operational responsibilities for the CKMS. Audit administrators should not have
      access to any operational keys other than their own keys.

   i) Registration Agent: A registration agent is responsible for registering new
      entities and binding their key(s) to their identifiers and perhaps other selected
      metadata. The registration agent may also enter entity information, keys, and
      metadata into a database used by the CKMS.

   j) Key-Recovery Agent: A key-recovery agent is allowed to recover keys from
      backup or archive storage after identity verification and authorization of the
      requesting entity is performed in accordance with the CKMS Security Policy (see
      Sections 6.4.15 and 6.4.17).

   k) CKMS Operator: A CKMS operator is authorized to operate (e.g., initiate the
      CKMS, monitor performance, and perform backups) a CKMS as directed by the
      system administrator.

Multiple individuals may be assigned to each role, and a single person may have multiple
roles. However, certain roles should be separated so that no individual is assigned to both
roles at the same time. For example, audit logs should be managed by someone other than
a system administrator in order to detect administrative misuse or abuse. In addition, it is
wise to rotate individuals from roles so as to minimize the likelihood of long-term abuses.

FR:5.1 The CKMS design shall specify each role employed by the CKMS, the
responsibilities of each role, and how entities are assigned to each role.

FR:5.2 The CKMS design shall specify the key and metadata management functions (see
Section 6.4) that can be used by entities fulfilling each role employed by the CKMS.

FR:5.3 The CKMS design shall specify which roles require role separation.

FR:5.4 The CKMS design shall specify how the role separation is maintained for the
roles that require role separation.

FR:5.5 The CKMS design shall specify all automated provisions for identifying security
violations, whether by individuals performing authorized roles (insiders) or by those with
no authorized role (outsiders).
