      We have also investigated a particular class of vulnerabilities, denial-of-serivce,
using reports from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), a publicly available
repository of data on all publicly reported software security vulnerabilities. NVD can
be queried for fine-granularity reports on vulnerabilities. Data from 3,045 denial-ofÂ­
service vulnerabilities have the distribution shown in Table 3. We present this data
separately from that above because it covers only one particular kind of failure, rather
than data on any failures occurring in a particular program as shown in Figure 1.

      Why do the failure detection curves look this way? That is, why does the error rate
tail off so rapidly with more variables interacting? One possibility is that there are simply
few complex interactions in branching points in software. If few branches involve 4-way,
5-way, or 6-way interactions among variables, then this degree of interaction could be rare
for failures as well. The table below (Table 4 and Fig. 2) gives the number and percentage
of branches in avionics code triggered by one to 19 variables. This distribution was
