2.3.4.1 The Media

The incident handling team should establish media communications procedures that comply with the
organization’s policies on media interaction and information disclosure.7 For discussing incidents with the
media, organizations often find it beneficial to designate a single point of contact (POC) and at least one
backup contact. The following actions are recommended for preparing these designated contacts and
should also be considered for preparing others who may be communicating with the media:

 Conduct training sessions on interacting with the media regarding incidents, which should include the
  importance of not revealing sensitive information, such as technical details of countermeasures that
  could assist other attackers, and the positive aspects of communicating important information to the
  public fully and effectively.
 Establish procedures to brief media contacts on the issues and sensitivities regarding a particular
  incident before discussing it with the media.

    For example, an organization may want members of its public affairs office and legal department to participate in all
    incident discussions with the media.
