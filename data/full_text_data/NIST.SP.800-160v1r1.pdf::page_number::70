flaw
Imperfection or defect.

generalized reference monitor concept
An abstract model of the necessary and sufficient properties that must be achieved by any mechanism that enforces a
constraint. [36] [37]

incident
Anomalous or unexpected event, set of events, condition, or situation at any time during the life cycle of a project,
product, service, or system. [4]

information
Knowledge that is exchangeable amongst users, about things, facts, concepts, and so on, in a universe of discourse.
[80]
         Note: Although information will necessarily have a representation form to make it communicable, it is the
         interpretation of this representation (the meaning) that is relevant. The representation form is arguably
         considered data.

information item
Separately identifiable body of information that is produced, stored, and delivered for human use. [81]

information system
A discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing,
dissemination, or disposition of information. [82]
See system.

interface
Wherever two or more logical, physical, or both system elements or software system elements meet and act on or
communicate with each other. [4]

interoperating system
System that exchanges information with the system of interest and uses the information that has been exchanged. [4]

integrity
Quality of being complete and unaltered. [83]

life cycle
Evolution of a system, product, service, project, or other human-made entity from conception through retirement. [4]

life cycle model
Framework of processes and activities concerned with the life cycle that may be organized into stages, which also
acts as a common reference for communication and understanding. [4]

life cycle security concepts
The processes, methods, and procedures associated with the system throughout its life cycle and provide distinct
contexts for the interpretation of system security. Life cycle security concepts apply during program management,
development, engineering, acquisition, manufacturing, fabrication, production, operations, sustainment, training, and
retirement.

likelihood
Chance of something happening. [28]

margin
A spare amount or measure or degree allowed or given for contingencies or special situations. The allowances
carried to account for uncertainties and risks. [39]
See design margin and operational margin.
