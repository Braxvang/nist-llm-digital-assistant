                   Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


Risk               The process of identifying risks to agency operations (including
Assessment         mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, or
[NIST SP 800-      individuals by determining the probability of occurrence, the
30]                resulting impact, and additional security controls that would mitigate
                   this impact. Part of risk management, synonymous with risk analysis,
                   and incorporates threat and vulnerability analyses.
Risk               The process of managing risks to agency operations (including
Management         mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, or
[NIST SP 800-      individuals resulting from the operation of an information system. It
30]                includes risk assessment; cost-benefit analysis; the selection,
                   implementation, and assessment of security controls; and the formal
                   authorization to operate the system. The process considers
                   effectiveness, efficiency, and constraints due to laws, directives,
                   policies, or regulations.
Safeguards         Protective measures prescribed to meet the security requirements
[CNSS Inst.        (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability) specified for an
4009, Adapted]     information system. Safeguards may include security features,
                   management constraints, personnel security, and security of physical
                   structures, areas, and devices. Synonymous with security controls and
                   countermeasures.
Sanitization       Process to remove information from media such that information
[CNSS Inst.        recovery is not possible. It includes removing all labels, markings,
4009, Adapted]     and activity logs.
Scoping            Provides organizations with specific technology-related,
Guidance           infrastructure-related, public access-related, scalability-related,
                   common security control-related, and risk-related considerations on
                   the applicability and implementation of individual security controls in
                   the control baseline.
Security           The characterization of information or an information system based
Category           on an assessment of the potential impact that a loss of confidentiality,
[FIPS 199]         integrity, or availability of such information or information system
                   would have on organizational operations, organizational assets, or
                   individuals.
Security           The management, operational, and technical controls (i.e., safeguards
Controls           or countermeasures) prescribed for an information system to protect
[FIPS 199]         the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its
                   information.
Security Control The set of minimum security controls defined for a low-impact,
Baseline         moderate-impact, or high-impact information system.
Security Control Statements of security capability to: (i) build in additional, but
Enhancements     related, functionality to a basic control; and/or (ii) increase the
                 strength of a basic control.
