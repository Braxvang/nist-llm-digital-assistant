An organization-wide approach to continuous monitoring of information and information system
security supports risk-related decision making at the organization level (Tier 1), the
mission/business processes level (Tier 2), and the information systems level (Tier 3). 14

2.1.1 TIER 1- ORGANIZATION
Tier 1 risk management activities address high-level information security governance policy as it
relates to risk to the organization as a whole, to its core missions, and to its business functions. At
this tier, the criteria for ISCM are defined by the organizationâ€™s risk management strategy,
including how the organization plans to assess, respond to, and monitor risk, and the oversight
required to ensure that the risk management strategy is effective. Security controls, security status,
and other metrics defined and monitored by officials at this tier are designed to deliver information
