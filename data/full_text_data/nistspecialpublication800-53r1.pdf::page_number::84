CM-3      CONFIGURATION CHANGE CONTROL

          Control: The organization authorizes, documents, and controls changes to the information system.

          Supplemental Guidance: The organization manages configuration changes to the information system
          using an organizationally approved process (e.g., a chartered Configuration Control Board).
          Configuration change control involves the systematic proposal, justification, implementation,
          test/evaluation, review, and disposition of changes to the information system, including upgrades
          and modifications. Configuration change control includes changes to the configuration settings
          for information technology products (e.g., operating systems, firewalls, routers). The organization
          includes emergency changes in the configuration change control process, including changes
          resulting from the remediation of flaws. The approvals to implement a change to the information
          system include successful results from the security analysis of the change. The organization audits
          activities associated with configuration changes to the information system. Related security
          controls: CM-4, CM-6, SI-2.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to: (i) document proposed changes to the
                information system; (ii) notify appropriate approval authorities; (iii) highlight approvals that have
                not been received in a timely manner; (iv) inhibit change until necessary approvals are received;
                and (v) document completed changes to the information system.

CM-4      MONITORING CONFIGURATION CHANGES

          Control: The organization monitors changes to the information system conducting security impact
          analyses to determine the effects of the changes.
          Supplemental Guidance: Prior to change implementation, and as part of the change approval
          process, the organization analyzes changes to the information system for potential security
          impacts. After the information system is changed (including upgrades and modifications), the
          organization checks the security features to verify that the features are still functioning properly.
          The organization audits activities associated with configuration changes to the information system.
          Monitoring configuration changes and conducting security impact analyses are important elements
          with regard to the ongoing assessment of security controls in the information system. Related
          security control: CA-7.
          Control Enhancements: None.
