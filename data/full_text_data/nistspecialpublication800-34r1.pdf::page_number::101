       Notification procedures;
       System recovery on an alternate platform from backup media;
       Internal and external connectivity; and
       Reconstitution procedures.

Results of the test are documented in an After Action Report, and Lessons Learned are developed for
updating information in the ISCP.

Examples of functional tests that may be performed include:
       Full notification and response of key personnel to recovery location;
       Recovery of a server or database from backup media;
       Setup and processing from a server at an alternate location.

The following is a sample of a yearly test and maintenance schedule for a moderate-impact system:

APPENDIX K ASSOCIATED PLANS AND PROCEDURES

NOTE: Information for this section should be available from the system’s System Security Plan (SSP) and
can be copied from the SSP, or reference the applicable section in the SSP and attach the latest version of
the SSP to this contingency plan. ISCPs for other systems that either interconnect or support the system
should be identified in this appendix. The most current version of the ISCP, location of ISCP, and
primary point of contact (such as the ISCP Coordinator) should be noted.

APPENDIX L BUSINESS IMPACT ANALYSIS

The Business Impact Analysis results should be included in this appendix.
