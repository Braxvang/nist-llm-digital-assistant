also responsible for deciding who has access to the system (and with what types of privileges or
access rights)74 and ensures that system users and support personnel receive the requisite security
training (e.g., instruction in rules of behavior). Based on guidance from the authorizing official,
the information system owner informs appropriate organizational officials of the need to conduct
the security authorization, ensures that the necessary resources are available for the effort, and
provides the required information system access, information, and documentation to the security
control assessor. The information system owner receives the security assessment results from the
security control assessor. After taking appropriate steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities, the
information system owner assembles the authorization package and submits the package to the
authorizing official or the authorizing official designated representative for adjudication.75

D.10 INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY OFFICER
The information system security officer76 is an individual responsible for ensuring that the
appropriate operational security posture is maintained for an information system and as such,
works in close collaboration with the information system owner. The information system security
officer also serves as a principal advisor on all matters, technical and otherwise, involving the
security of an information system. The information system security officer has the detailed
knowledge and expertise required to manage the security aspects of an information system and, in
many organizations, is assigned responsibility for the day-to-day security operations of a system.
This responsibility may also include, but is not limited to, physical and environmental protection,
personnel security, incident handling, and security training and awareness. The information
system security officer may be called upon to assist in the development of the security policies
and procedures and to ensure compliance with those policies and procedures. In close
coordination with the information system owner, the information system security officer often
plays an active role in the monitoring of a system and its environment of operation to include
developing and updating the security plan, managing and controlling changes to the system, and
assessing the security impact of those changes.

D.11 INFORMATION SECURITY ARCHITECT
The information security architect is an individual, group, or organization responsible for
ensuring that the information security requirements necessary to protect the organizational
missions/business functions are adequately addressed in all aspects of enterprise architecture
including reference models, segment and solution architectures, and the resulting information
systems supporting those missions and business processes. The information security architect
serves as the liaison between the enterprise architect and the information system security engineer
and also coordinates with information system owners, common control providers, and
information system security officers on the allocation of security controls as system-specific,
hybrid, or common controls. In addition, information security architects, in close coordination
with information system security officers, advise authorizing officials, chief information officers,

74
   The responsibility for deciding who has access to specific information within an information system (and with what
types of privileges or access rights) may reside with the information owner/steward.
75
  Depending on how the organization has organized its security authorization activities, the authorizing official may
choose to designate an individual other than the information system owner to compile and assemble the information for
the security authorization package. In this situation, the designated individual must coordinate the compilation and
assembly activities with the information system owner.
76
  Organizations may also define an information system security manager or information security manager role with
similar responsibilities as an information system security officer or with oversight responsibilities for an information
security program. In these situations, information system security officers may, at the discretion of the organization,
report directly to information system security managers or information security managers.
