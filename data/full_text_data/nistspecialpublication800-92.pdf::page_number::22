GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



          Section 4.22 specifies that documentation of actions and activities need to be retained for at least
          six years.
       Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002.14 Although SOX applies primarily to financial and
        accounting practices, it also encompasses the information technology (IT) functions that support
        these practices. SOX can be supported by reviewing logs regularly to look for signs of security
        violations, including exploitation, as well as retaining logs and records of log reviews for future
        review by auditors.
       Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). PCI DSS applies to
        organizations that “store, process or transmit cardholder data” for credit cards. One of the
        requirements of PCI DSS is to “track…all access to network resources and cardholder data”.15
2.3     The Challenges in Log Management

Most organizations face similar log management-related challenges, which have the same underlying
problem: effectively balancing a limited amount of log management resources with an ever-increasing
supply of log data. This section discusses the most common types of challenges, divided into three
groups. First, there are several potential problems with the initial generation of logs because of their
variety and prevalence. Second, the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of generated logs could be
breached inadvertently or intentionally. Finally, the people responsible for performing log analysis are
often inadequately prepared and supported. Sections 2.3.1 through 2.3.3 discuss each of these three
categories of log challenges.

2.3.1     Log Generation and Storage

In a typical organization, many hosts’ OSs, security software, and other applications generate and store
logs. This complicates log management in the following ways:

       Many Log Sources. Logs are located on many hosts throughout the organization, necessitating
        log management to be performed throughout the organization. Also, a single log source can
        generate multiple logs—for example, an application storing authentication attempts in one log
        and network activity in another log.
       Inconsistent Log Content. Each log source records certain pieces of information in its log
        entries, such as host IP addresses and usernames. For efficiency, log sources often record only
        the pieces of information that they consider most important. This can make it difficult to link
        events recorded by different log sources because they may not have any common values recorded
        (e.g., source 1 records the source IP address but not the username, and source 2 records the
        username but not the source IP address). Each type of log source may also represent values
        differently; these differences may be slight, such as one date being in MMDDYYYY format and
        another being in MM-DD-YYYY format, or they may be much more complex, such as use of the
        File Transfer Protocol (FTP) being identified by name in one log (“FTP”) and by port number in
        another log (21). This further complicates the process of linking events recorded by different log
        sources.16

      There are some standards for log content, such as Web server logs. However, for most log sources there are no logging
      standards available. One current standards effort is the Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format (IDMEF); the latest
      Internet-Draft for IDMEF is available at http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-idwg-idmef-xml-16.txt.
