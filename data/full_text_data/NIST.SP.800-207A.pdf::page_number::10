       Introduction
Zero trust (ZT) tenets or principles have been accepted as the guide markers for architecting all
applications. There are several reasons why adherence to these tenets is critical for obtaining
necessary security assurances, especially for cloud-native applications. The enterprise
application environments for this class of applications are highly geographically distributed and
span multiple cloud and on-premises environments (e.g., headquarters, enterprise-operated data
centers, branch offices). Further, the user base consists of both remote and on-premises
employees. These two features call for establishing trust in all of the data sources and computing
services of the enterprise — irrespective of their location — through secure communication and
the validation of access policies.
Apart from geographic distribution, another common feature of cloud-native applications is the
presence of many microservices that are loosely coupled and collectively support business
processes through extensive inter-service calls. This is augmented by an integrated infrastructure
for providing all application services called the service mesh. These features emphasize the
concept of identity for the various components of the application in the form of microservices as
well as the users who access them through direct calls or clients (other services). This in turn
highlights the critical need for authenticating these identities and for providing legitimate access
on a per-session basis through a dynamic policy that takes the current status of the user, service,
and requested resource into account.
The above requirements can only be met through a comprehensive policy framework. This
document provides guidance for developing a policy framework that will form the foundation for
realizing a zero trust architecture (ZTA) while incorporating zero trust principles into its design
for cloud-native applications. The policy framework should also consist of a comprehensive set
of policies that span all critical entities and resources in the application stack, including the
network, network devices, users, and services.

       Background — Zero Trust Principles and Zero Trust Architecture
A summary of the zero trust principles and the definition of a zero trust architecture, as described
in SP 800-207, Zero Trust Architecture [1], are:
   •   Zero trust is the term for an evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms that move defenses
       from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users and resources. It is a set of
       security primitives rather than a particular set of technologies. Zero trust assumes that
       there is no implicit trust granted to user accounts based solely on their physical or
       network location (i.e., local area networks versus the internet) or to endpoints (devices)
       based on their ownership (e.g., enterprise or personally owned). Zero trust focuses on
       protecting resources (e.g., devices, services, workflows, network accounts) rather than
       network segments, as the network location is no longer seen as the prime component to
       the security posture of the resource.
   •   A zero trust architecture uses zero trust principles to plan industrial and enterprise
       infrastructures and workflows.
