                 The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



      1. Adhere to the requirements detailed in each applicable component specification (for each selected
         SCAP component specification, and for each SCAP component specification required to
         implement the selected SCAP capabilities). The authoritative references for each specification are
         listed in Appendix B. If requirements are in conflict between component specifications, this
         document will provide clarification. If a component specification is in conflict with this
         document, the requirements in this document SHALL take precedence.

      2. Products that process SCAP data streams SHALL consume and correctly process well-formed
         SCAP data streams. This includes following all of the processing requirements defined in Section
         4 for each selected SCAP component specification and for each SCAP component specification
         required to implement the selected SCAP capabilities.

      3. Products that produce SCAP data streams SHALL produce well-formed SCAP data streams. This
         includes following all of the syntax, structural, and other content design requirements defined in
         Section 3 for each selected SCAP component specification and for each SCAP component
         specification required to implement the selected SCAP capabilities. This also includes following
         the requirements in Section 5 if the content is one of the types addressed in that section.

      4. Make an explicit claim of conformance to this specification in any documentation provided to end
         users.

2.2     Organization Conformance

Organizations creating or maintaining SCAP data streams that claim conformance with the SCAP 1.1
specification SHALL adhere to the following requirements:

      1. Adhere to the requirements detailed in each applicable component specification (for each selected
         SCAP component specification, and for each SCAP component specification required to
         implement the selected SCAP capabilities). The authoritative references for each specification are
         listed in Appendix B. If requirements are in conflict between component specifications, this
         document will provide clarification. If a component specification is in conflict with this
         document, the requirements in this document SHALL take precedence.

      2. Follow all of the syntax, structural, and other content design requirements defined in Section 3 for
         each selected SCAP component specification and for each SCAP component specification
         required to implement the selected SCAP capabilities. If the content is one of the types addressed
         in Section 5, follow all of its requirements as well.
