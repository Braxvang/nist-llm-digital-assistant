SP 800-152                                                  A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


                            A Federal CKMS could have one or more archive facilities
PF:10.2
                            for long-term storage of keys and metadata.

10.2 Utility Service Outage

An FCKMS module in a fixed facility requires reliable utility services (e.g., electrical
power) for assuring its availability. Other required services could include water, sewer,
air conditioning, heat, and clean air. Adequate utility services in all primary and backup
fixed facilities must be available to support all electronic devices, human safety and
comfort during normal operations and emergencies, and should be provided to all
primary and backup facilities.

Mobile devices with FCKMS capabilities will require battery chargers and may require
backup batteries.

Backup systems should have utility services that are independent from those of the
primary system. For example, a surge from a power-line lightning strike could cause
both the primary system and its backup to fail if they are both served by the same power
line.

FR:10.2 The CKMS design shall specify the minimum, as well as recommended
electrical, water, sanitary, heating, cooling, and air filtering requirements for the primary
and all backup facilities.

                PE-9 (1)     A Federal CKMS shall be provided with sufficient utility
PR:10.10
                 PE-11       services to support all primary and backup fixed facilities
                 PE-12       during both normal operation and emergencies.
                             A Federal CKMS shall conform to applicable Federal and
PR:10.11
                             industry standards for utility assurance and satisfy the
                             CKMS design requirements for utility services for all
                             primary, backup, and archive facilities.
              CP-8 (3)       For High impact-level systems, the utility service for a
PR:10.12
                             backup system of a Federal CKMS shall be independent
                             from that of the primary system.

              CP-8 (3)       For Low and Moderate impact-level systems, the utility
PA:10.6
                             service for a backup system of a Federal CKMS should be
                             independent from that of the primary system.

10.3 Communication and Computation Outage

An FCKMS needs sufficient communication and computation capabilities to perform its
required functions and to provide the key-management services that are required by its
users. Backup communication and computation capabilities should be provided by an
FCKMS in the event of system failure. The ability to access alternative communication
services is highly desirable in the event of a communication-service failure.
