NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                  Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

-   Traceability of the security aspects of the integrated system elements is established.

H.8.3. Security Activities and Tasks
IN-1   PREPARE FOR INTEGRATION
       IN-1.1 Identify and define checkpoints for the correct secure activation and integrity of the
              interfaces and the selected system functions as the system elements are synthesized.
       IN-1.2 Define the security aspects of the integration strategy.
       Note: Integration is performed to achieve trustworthy secure results using aspects such as
       secure assembly sequences and checkpoints for the system elements based on established
       priorities while minimizing integration time and cost and providing appropriate risk treatments.
       IN-1.3 Identify the security-relevant constraints and objectives from integration to be
              incorporated into the system requirements, architecture, or design.
       IN-1.4 Identify the security aspects for enabling systems, services, and materials needed to
              support integration.
       IN-1.5 Identify and plan for enabling systems, services, and materials needed to support the
              security aspects of integration.
       IN-1.6 Obtain or acquire access to the security aspects of enabling systems, services, and
              materials to be used in integration.

IN-2   PERFORM INTEGRATION
       IN-2.1 Check interface availability and conformance of the interfaces in accordance with the
              security aspects of interface definitions and integration schedules.
       IN-2.2 Perform actions to address any security-relevant conformance or availability issues.
       IN-2.3 Securely combine the implemented system elements in accordance with planned
              sequences.
       IN-2.4 Securely integrate system element configurations until the complete system is securely
              synthesized.
       IN-2.5 Check for the expected results of interfaces, interconnections, selected functions, and
              security characteristics.

IN-3   MANAGE RESULTS OF INTEGRATION
       IN-3.1 Record the security aspects of integration results and any anomalies encountered.
       Note: Anomaly analyses determine corrective actions that may affect the protection capability
       of the system and the level of assurance that can be obtained.
       IN-3.2 Maintain traceability of the security aspects of integrated system elements.
       Note: Bidirectional traceability of the security aspects of the integrated system elements to the
       system security requirements, security views of the architecture, security design, and security
