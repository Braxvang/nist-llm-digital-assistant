3.4.6   Roles and Responsibilities

Having selected and implemented the backup and system recovery strategies, the ISCP Coordinator must
designate appropriate teams to implement the strategy. Each team should be trained and ready to respond
in the event of a disruptive situation requiring plan activation. Recovery personnel should be assigned to
one of several specific teams that will respond to the event, recover capabilities, and return the system to
normal operations. To do so, recovery team members need to clearly understand the team’s recovery
effort goal, individual procedures the team will execute, and how interdependencies between recovery
teams may affect overall strategies.

The types of teams required are based on the information system affected and could be tailored according
to FIPS 199 impact levels to reflect specific differences in requirements and backup procedures. The size
of each team, team titles, and hierarchy designs depend on the organization. In addition to a single
authoritative role for overall decision-making responsibility, including plan activation, a capable strategy
will require some or all of the following groups:

       Management team (including the ISCP
                                                                 Application recovery team(s);
        Coordinator);
                                                                 Telecommunications team;
       Outage assessment team;
                                                                 Test team;
       Operating system administration team;
                                                                 Transportation and relocation team;
       Server recovery team (e.g., client server,
        Web server);                                             Media relations team;
       Local Area Network/Wide Area                             Legal affairs team;
        Network (LAN/WAN) recovery team;                         Physical/personnel security team; and
       Database recovery team;                                  Procurement team (equipment and
       Network operations recovery team;                         supplies).

Personnel should be chosen to staff these teams based on their skills and knowledge. Ideally, teams are
staffed with personnel responsible for the same or similar functions under normal conditions. For
example, server recovery team members should include the server administrators. Team members must
understand not only the contingency plan purpose, but also the procedures necessary for executing the
recovery strategy. Teams should be sufficient in size to remain viable if some members are unavailable to
respond or alternate team members may be designated. Similarly, team members should be familiar with
the goals and procedures of other teams to facilitate cross-team coordination. The ISCP Coordinator
should also consider that a disruption could render some personnel unavailable to respond. In this
situation, executing the plan may be possible only by using personnel from another geographic area of the
organization or by hiring contractors or vendors. Such personnel may be coordinated and trained as an
alternate team.

Each team is led by a team leader who directs overall team operations, acts as the team’s representative to
management, and liaises with other team leaders. The team leader disseminates information to team
members and approves any decisions that must be made within the team. Team leaders should have a
designated alternate to act as the leader if the primary leader is unavailable.

For most systems, a management team is necessary for providing overall guidance following a major
system disruption or emergency. The team is responsible for activating the contingency plan and
supervising the execution of contingency operations. The management team also facilitates
