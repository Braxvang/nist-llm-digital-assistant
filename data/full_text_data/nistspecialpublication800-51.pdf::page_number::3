 Use of the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Vulnerability Naming Scheme

                                     Recommendations of the
                     National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

Purpose

This document provides guidelines for federal organizations’ acquisition and use of security-
related information technology (IT) products and services. NIST’s advice is provided in the
context of larger recommendations regarding security assurance (see NIST Special Publication
800-23, http://csrc.nist.gov).

This document has been developed by NIST in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities (under
the Computer Security Act of 1987 and the Information Technology Management Reform Act of
1996, specifically 15 U.S.C. 278 g-3 (a)(5)). This is not a guideline within the meaning of (15
U.S.C. 278 g-3 (a)(3)).

These guidelines are for use by federal organizations which process sensitive information. They
are consistent with the requirements of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-
130, Appendix III.

This document may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis. It is not
subject to copyright.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made
mandatory and binding upon federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory
authority. Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing
authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, the Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.

Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be identified in this document in order
to describe an experimental procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended
to imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards and Technology,
nor is it intended to imply that the entities, materials, or equipment are necessarily the best
available for the purpose.

Background

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) vulnerability naming scheme is a dictionary
of common names for publicly known IT system vulnerabilities. It is an emerging industry
standard that has achieved wide acceptance by the security industry and a number of government
organizations. Technical vulnerability experts from 31 industry, academia, and government
organizations vote on the common names. CVE provides the computer security community
with:
    1. a comprehensive list of publicly known vulnerabilities,
