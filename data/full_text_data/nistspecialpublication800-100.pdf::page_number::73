CHAPTER 7                                                       Performance Measures


   • Modifications of data collection and tracking tools; and
   • Metrics summary reporting formats.

7.4.2   Collect Data and Analyze Results
    Phase 2 of the process, Collect Data and Analyze Results, involves activities that
are essential for ensuring that the collected metrics are used to gain an
understanding of system security and to identify appropriate improvement actions.
This phase includes the following activities:
   • Collect metrics data according to the processes defined in the metrics program
     implementation plan;
   • Consolidate collected data and store in a format (i.e., a database or a
     spreadsheet) conducive to data analysis and reporting;
   • Conduct gap analysis, compare collected measurements with targets if defined,
     and identify gaps between actual and desired performance;
   • Identify causes of poor performance; and
   • Identify areas requiring improvement.
    The causes of poor performance can often be identified using the data from more
than one metric. For example, determining that the percentage of approved security
plans is unacceptably low would not be helpful for determining how to correct the
problem. To determine the cause of low compliance, collect information on the
reasons for low percentages (e.g., lack of guidance, insufficient expertise, or
conflicting priorities). This information can be collected as separate metrics or as
implementation evidence for the percentage of approved security plans. Once this
information is collected and compiled, the agency should develop a correction plan to
address the root cause of the problem.
   Root causes for faulty security run the gamut between highly technical
misconfiguration issues to lack of training or outdated policies or practices. Below
are examples of causation factors that contribute to poor security control
implementation and effectiveness:
   • Resources—insufficient human, monetary, or other resources;
   • Training—lack of appropriate training for the personnel installing, administering,
     maintaining, or using the systems;
   • System Upgrades—security patches that have been removed but not replaced
     during the operating system upgrades;
   • Configuration Management (CM) Practices—new or upgraded systems that are
     not configured with required security settings and patches;
   • Software Compatibility—security patches or upgrades that are incompatible
     with software applications supported by the system;
   • Awareness and Commitment—lack of management awareness and/or
     commitment to security;
   • Policies and Procedures—lack of policies and procedures that are required to
     ensure existence, use, and audit of required security functions;
   • Architectures—poor system and security architectures that make systems
     vulnerable; and
