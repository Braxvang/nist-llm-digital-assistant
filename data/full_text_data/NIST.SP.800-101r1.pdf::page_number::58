                                                                 Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics


6. Examination and Analysis

       The examination process uncovers digital evidence, including that which may be hidden or
       obscured. The results are gained through applying established scientifically based methods and
       should describe the content and state of the data fully, including the source and the potential
       significance. Data reduction, separating relevant from irrelevant information, occurs once the
       data is exposed. The analysis process differs from examination in that it looks at the results of
       the examination for its direct significance and probative value to the case. Examination is a
       technical process that is the province of a forensic specialist. However, analysis may be done
       by roles other than a specialist, such as the investigator or the forensic examiner.

       The examination process begins with a copy of the evidence acquired from the mobile device.
       Fortunately, compared with classical examination of personal computers or network servers,
       the amount of acquired data to examine is much smaller with mobile devices. Because of the
       prevalence of proprietary case file formats, the forensic toolkit used for acquisition will
       typically be the one used for examination and analysis. While interoperability among the
       acquisition and examination facilities of different tools is possible, only a few tools support this
       feature. Examination and analysis using 3rd party tools are generally accomplished by
       importing a generated mobile device memory dump into a mobile forensics tool that supports
       3rd party mobile device images.

       The forensic examiner will need information about the case and the parties involved to provide
       a starting point for potential evidence that might be found. Conducting the examination is a
       partnership between the forensic analyst or examiner and the investigator. The investigator
       provides insight into the types of information sought, while the forensic examiner provides the
       means to find relevant information that might be on the system.

       The understanding gained by studying the case should provide ideas about the type of data to
       target and specific keywords or phrases to use when searching the acquired data. Depending
       on the type of case, the strategy varies. For example, a case about child pornography may
       begin with browsing all of the graphic images on the system, while a case about an Internet-
       related offense might begin with browsing all Internet history files.

 6.1   Potential Evidence

       Mobile device manufacturers typically offer a similar set of information handling features and
       capabilities, including Personal Information Management (PIM) applications, messaging and
       e-mail, and web browsing. The set of features and capabilities vary based on the era in which
       the device was manufactured, the version of firmware running, modifications made for a
       particular service provider, and any modifications or applications installed by the user. The
       potential evidence on these devices may include the following items:
