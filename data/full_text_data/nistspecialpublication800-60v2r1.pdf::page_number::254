earmarked grants information is public knowledge. Typically, unauthorized disclosure of most
earmarked grants information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In some cases, project/competitive
grants information may be sensitive with moderate to high impact. In a few cases, details of
programs for which grants are awarded may be classified and outside the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for earmarked grants information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Earmarked
grants activities are not generally time-critical and multiple individuals in multiple organizations
are usually involved in the grants process. Therefore, the information maintained by all the
individuals/agencies is probably necessary to alter a grants decision. In most cases, the adverse
effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of earmarked grants information on agency
mission functions or public confidence in the agency will be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
earmarked grants information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to earmarked grants information.
Earmarked grants processes are generally tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of
access to earmarked grants information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
earmarked grants information is low.

D.25.4 State Loans Information Type

State Loans involve all disbursement of funds by the Government to a State or Local
Government (or Indian Tribe) entity under a contract that requires the repayment of such funds
with or without interest. The recommended provisional security categorization for the state loan
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of state loan information
on the ability of responsible agencies to disburse Federal funds a State or Local Government (or
Indian Tribe) entity under a contract that requires the repayment of such funds with or without
