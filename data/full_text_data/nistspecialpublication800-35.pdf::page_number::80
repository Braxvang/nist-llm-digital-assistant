   Industry certifications do not guarantee that IT security personnel are qualified or technically suitable. Blanket requirements for
     all personnel to acquire a particular certification can be expensive and needlessly limit the available choices without
     increasing the value to the organization. Certifications can be used along with other means to develop an understanding of
     IT security skill levels. General security certifications are useful for positions such as security program manager or systems
     administrator but may have less value for certain other specialized skill positions such as a protocol or cryptographic
     engineer. In those areas, specialized certifications can have value. General and specialized certifications alone are not
     necessarily guarantees of competency or effectiveness and additional evidence will, in general, be needed.
