NIST SP 800-82r3                                              Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

4.1.2. Assessing Risk in an OT Environment
Risk assessments leverage the outputs of framing risk (e.g., acceptable risk assessment
methodologies, risk management strategy, and risk tolerance) and facilitate efforts to identify,
estimate, and prioritize risks to operations, assets, individuals, and other organizations. Risk
assessments occur at all risk management levels (i.e., organization, mission and business
function, and system) and can be used to inform risk assessments at other levels. Regardless of
which risk management level the risk assessment is conducted at, assessing risk requires
identifying threats and vulnerabilities, the harm that such threats and vulnerabilities may cause,
and the likelihood that adverse events may arise from those threats and vulnerabilities.
When the organization conducts a risk assessment that includes OT systems, there may be
additional considerations that do not exist when assessing the risks of traditional IT systems. For
example, the impact of a cyber incident on an OT may include both physical and digital effects.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Risk assessments are typically point-in-time reports. As a result,
            organizations should ensure that they are updated to remain current and
            that the security level remains adequate.
            Organizations may want to review the information provided by CISA’s
            Alerts and Advisories, NIST’s NVD, and MITRE ATT&CK for ICS to
            identify common vulnerability areas for OT environments, such as:
                   •   Poor coding practices, network designs, or device configurations
                   •   Vulnerable network services and protocols
                   •   Weak authentication
                   •   Excessive privileges
                   •   Information disclosure
            OT systems often have specific environmental requirements (e.g., a
            manufacturing process may require a precise temperature), or they may
            be tied to their physical environment for operations. Organizations may
            want to consider incorporating these requirements and constraints into
            the framing component so that associated risks are identified.
            Additionally, organizations may want to consider:
                   •   Identifying the physical assets and security controls that directly
                       relate to safety, human life, and maintaining continuity of
                       operations of the OT system
                   •   Identifying the cybersecurity risks associated with physical assets
                       that could threaten OT system functionality
                   •   Ensuring that physical security personnel understand the relative
                       risks and physical security countermeasures associated with the
                       OT system environments that they protect
