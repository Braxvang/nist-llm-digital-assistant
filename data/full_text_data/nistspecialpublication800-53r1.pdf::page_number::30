Figure 2 summarizes the security control selection process, including the tailoring of the initial
security control baseline and any additional modifications to the baseline required based on the
organization’s assessment of risk.

3.5 UPDATING SECURITY CONTROLS
As part of a comprehensive continuous monitoring program, organizations should initiate specific
actions to determine if there is a need to update the current, agreed-upon set of security controls
documented in the security plan and implemented within the information system. Specifically,
the organization should revisit, on a regular basis, the risk management activities described in the
Risk Management Framework in Section 3.1. Additionally, there are events which can trigger the
immediate need to assess the security state of the information system and if required, update the
current security controls. These events include, for example:
•    An incident results in a breach to the information system, producing a loss of confidence in
     the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information processed, stored, or transmitted
     by the system;
•    A newly identified, credible threat exists to the organization’s operations or assets, or to
     individuals (due to the use of the information system supporting those operations, assets, or
     individuals) based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or other
     credible sources of information; or
•    Significant changes to the configuration of the information system through the removal or
     addition of new or upgraded hardware, software, or firmware or changes in the operational
     environment potentially degrade the security state of the system.

When events such as those described above occur, organizations should at a minimum: 47



47
  Organizations should determine the specific types of events that would trigger a modification to the security plan and
changes to the security controls within the information system. The decision to commit resources in light of such
events should be guided by an organizational assessment of risk to the organization’s operations and assets, or to
individuals, that would result if these modifications and changes are not made.
