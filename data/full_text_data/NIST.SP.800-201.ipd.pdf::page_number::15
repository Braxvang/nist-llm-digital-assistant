      NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                  Cloud Computing Forensic
      February 2023                                                                  Reference Architecture

399       Overview of NIST Cloud Forensic Challenges
400   The NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Science Working Group (NCC FSWG) was established to
401   research forensic science challenges and architectures related to the cloud environment. The
402   Working Group surveyed the literature and identified a set of challenges related to cloud
403   computing forensics. These challenges are presented in NIST IR 8006 [1], where each of 62
404   challenges is described along with potential results of overcoming each challenge. In addition,
405   the document provides a preliminary analysis of these challenges by including 1) the relationship
406   between each challenge and the five essential characteristics of cloud computing, as defined in
407   the NIST cloud computing model [16]; 2) how the challenges correlate to cloud technology; and
408   3) nine categories to which the challenges belong. The analysis also considers logging data, data
409   in media, and issues associated with time, location, and sensitive data. In addition, the relevance
410   of topics such as rapid elasticity, multi-tenancy, and hypervisor/virtual machine layers is
411   discussed. These 62 challenges support the criminal justice and civil litigation systems, security
412   incident response, and internal enterprise operations.
413   The nine categories to which the challenges belong are reproduced below (from NIST IR 8006
414   [1], pp. 8-9):

415   1. Architecture (e.g., diversity, complexity, provenance, multi-tenancy, data segregation).
416      Architecture challenges in cloud forensics include:
417         a. Dealing with variability in cloud architectures between providers
418         b. Tenant data compartmentalization and isolation during resource provisioning
419         c. Proliferation of systems, locations, and endpoints that can store data
420         d. Accurate and secure provenance for maintaining and preserving chain of custody
421   2. Data collection (e.g., data integrity, data recovery, data location, imaging). Data collection
422      challenges in cloud forensics include:
423         a. Locating forensic artifacts in large, distributed, and dynamic systems
424         b. Locating and collecting volatile data
425         c. Data collection from virtual machines
426         d. Data integrity in a multi-tenant environment where data is shared among multiple
427             computers in multiple locations and accessible by multiple parties
428         e. Inability to image all of the forensic artifacts in the cloud
429         f. Accessing the data of one tenant without breaching the confidentiality of other tenants
430         g. Recovery of deleted data in a shared and distributed virtual environment
431   3. Analysis (e.g., correlation, reconstruction, time synchronization, logs, metadata, timelines).
432      Analysis challenges in cloud forensics include:
433         a. Correlation of forensic artifacts across and within cloud providers
434         b. Reconstruction of events from virtual images or storage
435         c. Integrity of metadata
436         d. Timeline analysis of log data, including synchronization of timestamps
437   4. Anti-forensics (e.g., obfuscation, data hiding, malware). Anti-forensics are a set of
438      techniques used specifically to prevent or mislead forensic analysis. Anti-forensic challenges
439      in cloud forensics include:
440          a. The use of obfuscation, malware, data hiding, or other techniques to compromise the
441             integrity of evidence
