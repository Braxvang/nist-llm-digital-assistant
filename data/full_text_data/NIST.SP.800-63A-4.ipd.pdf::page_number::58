1499   9.1. General User Considerations During Enrollment and Identity Prooﬁng
1500   This sub-section provides usability considerations that are applicable across all steps of
1501   the enrollment process. Usability considerations specific to each step are detailed in Secs.
1502   9.2 to 9.4.
1503       • To avoid user frustration, streamline the process required for enrollment to make
1504         each step as clear and easy as possible.
1505       • Clearly communicate how and where to acquire technical assistance. For example,
1506         provide helpful information such as a link to online self-service feature, chat
1507         sessions, and a phone number for help desk support. Ideally, sufficient information
1508         should be provided to enable users to answer their own enrollment preparation
1509         questions without outside intervention.
1510       • Clearly explain who is collecting their data and why. Also indicate the path their
1511         data will take, in particular where the data is being stored.
1512       • Ensure all information presented is usable.
1513            – Follow good information design practice for all user-facing materials (e.g.,
1514              data collection notices and fillable forms).
1515            – Write materials in plain language and avoid technical jargon. If appropriate,
1516              tailor language to the literacy level of the intended population. Use active
1517              voice and conversational style, logically sequence main points, use the same
1518              word consistently rather than synonyms to avoid confusion, and use bullets,
1519              numbers, and formatting where appropriate to aid readability.
1520            – Consider text legibility, such as font style, size, color, and contrast with
1521              surrounding background. The highest contrast is black on white. Text
1522              legibility is important because users have different levels of visual acuity.
1523              Illegible text will contribute to user comprehension errors or user entry errors
1524              (e.g., when completing fillable forms). Use sans serif font styles for electronic
1525              materials and serif fonts for paper materials. When possible, avoid fonts that
1526              do not clearly distinguish between easily confusable characters (such as the
1527              letter “O” and the number “0”). This is especially important for enrollment
1528              codes. Use a minimum font size of 12 points, as long as the text fits the
1529              display.
1530       • Perform a usability evaluation for each step with representative users. Establish
1531         realistic goals and tasks, and appropriate contexts of use for the usability evaluation.

1532   9.2. Pre-Enrollment Preparation
1533   This section describes an effective approach to facilitate sufficient pre-enrollment
1534   preparation so users can avoid challenging, frustrating enrollment sessions. Ensuring
