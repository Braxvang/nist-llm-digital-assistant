                                                 GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



Network-based IDPSs provide a wide variety of security capabilities. Some products can collect
information on hosts such as which OSs they use and which application versions they use that
communicate over networks. Network-based IDPSs can also perform extensive logging of data related to
detected events; most can also perform packet captures. Network-based IDPSs usually offer extensive
and broad detection capabilities. Most products use a combination of signature-based detection, anomaly-
based detection, and stateful protocol analysis to perform in-depth analysis of common protocols;
organizations should use network-based IDPS products that provide such a combination of detection
features, because the combination increases detection accuracy. Organizations should also use network-
based IDPSs that can compensate for the use of common evasion techniques, which further improves
detection accuracy.

Network-based IDPSs have some significant limitations. They cannot detect attacks within encrypted
network traffic; accordingly, either they should be deployed where they can monitor traffic before
encryption or after decryption, or host-based IDPSs should be used on endpoints to monitor unencrypted
activity. Network-based IDPSs are often unable to perform full analysis under high loads; organizations
using inline sensors should select those that can recognize high load conditions and either pass certain
types of traffic without performing full analysis or drop low-priority traffic to reduce load. Another
limitation of network-based IDPSs is that they are susceptible to various types of attacks, most involving
large volumes of traffic. Organizations should select products that offer features designed to make them
resistant to failure due to attack. Organizations should also ensure that IP addresses are not assigned to
the network interfaces of passive or inline sensors used to monitor network traffic, except for network
interfaces used for both traffic monitoring and IDPS management.

Network-based IDPS sensors offer various prevention capabilities. Many passive sensors can attempt to
end TCP sessions by resetting them, but this technique often does not work in time, and it is not
applicable to non-TCP sessions, such as UDP and ICMP. Inline sensor-specific techniques include
performing inline firewalling, throttling bandwidth usage, and altering malicious content, all of which are
helpful for certain circumstances. Both passive and inline sensors can reconfigure other network security
devices; they can also run third-party programs or scripts to initiate additional prevention actions.
