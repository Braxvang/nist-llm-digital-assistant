  3.3.2   GENERATE ASYMMETRIC KEY PAIR Card Command

The GENERATE ASYMMETRIC KEY PAIR card command initiates the generation and storing in the
card of the reference data of an asymmetric key pair, i.e., a public key and a private key. The public key
of the generated key pair is returned as the response to the command. If there is reference data currently
associated with the key reference, it is replaced in full by the generated data.
