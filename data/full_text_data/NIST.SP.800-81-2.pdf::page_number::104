SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



If the new ZSK (the next ZSK to be used) has been compromised, it should be replaced immediately in
the zone key set. This replacement also can be done atomically because the new key was not used to
produce any RRSIGs; only the zone key set needs to be re-signed. It also is possible simply to remove the
compromised key and replace it with a new ZSK in one update.

There still is a danger of attackers using the compromised ZSK to forge responses coming from the zone.
This danger exists as long as the current KSK is still active, with the option of initiating a KSK rollover.
Once a ZSK has been compromised, a zone administrator should initiate a rollover of the KSK as soon as
possible.

11.3.2 Emergency KSK Rollover

When a zone’s KSK has been compromised, the only response is to initiate a KSK rollover with the
parent. This rollover, however, is not the same process as a scheduled KSK rollover. There must be a way
to alert the parent zone administrator that the old KSK has been compromised and not to accept any KSK
rollover messages using that key. The replacement key must be transmitted and verified using some other
secure channel to ensure the child zone’s identity and may involve one or more non-DNSSEC
authentication methods. This process could be the same as that used to establish the original KSK of the
child zone.


Checklist item 33: A DNS administrator should have the emergency contact information for the
immediate parent zone to use when an emergency KSK rollover must be performed.

Checklist item 34: A parent zone must have an emergency contact method made available to its
delegated child subzones in case of emergency child subzone KSK rollover. There also should be a secure
means of obtaining the subzone’s new KSK.


The only way to minimize the exposure period to a minimum, it is a good idea for a zone administrator to
keep the signature validity period (time between signature inception and expiration fields in the RRSIG
record RDATA) as short as possible. Since a compromised KSK can only be used by an attacker for as
long as the non-compromised parent zone vouches for its security. The downside to shorter signature
validity periods is that it leads to frequent re-signing (see below). A zone administrator must take the
resources required in re-signing into consideration when choosing a signature validity period for
delegation DS RRset RRSIG(s).

11.4 Re-Signing a Zone

The zone file has to be re-signed (new RRSIG RRs generated) in the following situations:

    •   The signatures have expired or are about to expire.

    •   The zone file content has changed (as a result of dynamic updates for example).

    •   One of the signing keys has been compromised or is scheduled for replacement.
There are two strategies for re-signing zone data:
