                                                                                               consider two policy recommendations. One is that a particular piece of software be installed, and the
                                                                                               second that another piece of software not be installed. Both rules for these policy recommendations could
                                                                                               use the same CPE entry in their <xccdf:ident> elements. However, because the interpretation of a
                                                                                               CPE entry is that a “pass” result indicates software was installed, the second policy recommendation’s
                                                                                               rule would violate this. This can be corrected by using the @con:negate attribute, a Boolean attribute
                                                                                               that inverts the rule result. The second rule could check for the software being installed and then negate
                                                                                               that result, thus giving a result consistent in meaning with the first rule. For rules that cannot have their
                                                                                               interpretations preserved through the use of the @con:negate attribute, an alternative is to have a CCE
                                                                                               entry corresponding to the recommendation. Rules that do not use <xccdf:ident> elements have no
