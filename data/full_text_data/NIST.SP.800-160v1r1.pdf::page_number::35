includes the resultant adverse events and conditions and their ramifications. The loss control
objectives also serve as the basis to acquire evidence of assurance that the system as designed,
built, used, and sustained will adequately protect against loss while achieving its design intent.
The loss control objectives reflect an ideal to preserve the assets’ characteristics (i.e., state,
condition, form, utility) to the extent practicable despite the potential for those characteristics to
be changed. The objectives accept uncertainty in the form of limits to what can be done (i.e., not
all losses can be avoided) and limits to the effectiveness of what is done (i.e., anything done has
its scope of effectiveness and set of potential failure modes).

Due to uncertainty, it is not possible to guarantee that some form of loss will not occur. There is
a need to emphasize protection against the effects of loss, including cascading or ripple events
(i.e., the immediate effect of a loss causes some additional unintended or undesired effects or
causes additional losses to occur). Thus, holistically protecting against loss and the unintended or
undesired effects of loss considers the full spectrum of possible loss across types of losses and
loss effects associated with each asset class. This is important considering that all forms of
adversity are not knowable. Therefore, it is prudent to ensure that there is focus on the effect to
be controlled rather than on the cause when protecting against loss.

The loss control objectives in Table 2 address the possibilities to control the potential for loss
and the effects of loss given the limits of certainty, feasibility, and practicality. Collectively, the
loss control objectives include the concerns attributed to security and to system survivability,
safety, and resilience. Note that satisfying loss control objectives may require trade-offs.
Avoiding or limiting the loss of one asset may come at the expense of not avoiding or limiting
the loss of another asset, as well as having trade-offs with other objectives (e.g., cost and
schedule).

  LOSS CONTROL
                                                                  DISCUSSION
    OBJECTIVE

 LOSS PREVENTION     • This is the case where a loss is totally avoided. That is, despite the presence of adversity:
 (Prevent the loss     - The system continues to provide only the intended behavior and produces only the intended
 from occurring)         outcomes.
                       - The desired properties of the system and assets used by the system are retained.
                       - The assets continue to exist.
                     • Loss avoidance may be achieved by any combination of:
                       - Preventing or removing the event or events that cause the loss
                       - Preventing or removing the condition or conditions that allow the loss to occur
                       - Not suffering an adverse effect despite the events or conditions
                     • Terms such as avoid, continue, delay, divert, eliminate, harden, prevent, redirect, remove, tolerate,
                       and withstand are typically used to characterize approaches to achieving this objective such that a
                       loss does not occur despite the system being subjected to adversity.
                     • The term tolerate refers to the objective of fault/failure tolerance, whereby adversity in the form of
                       faults, errors, and failures is rendered inconsequential and does not alter or prevent the realization
                       of authorized and intended system behavior and outcomes (i.e., the faults, errors, and failures are
                       tolerated).
 LOSS LIMITATION     • This covers cases where a loss can or has occurred, and the extent of loss is to be limited.
                     • The extent of loss can be limited in terms of any combination of the following:
