BRM subdivides the lines of business into 72 sub-functions. The support delivery of services and
management of resource business areas are common to most Federal government agencies, and
the information associated with each of their sub-functions is identified in this guideline as a
management and support information type. Four additional management and support sub-factor
information types have been defined to address privacy information. One additional
management and support sub-factor information type has been defined to address General
Information as a catch-all information type that may not be defined by the FEA BRM. As such,
agencies may find it necessary to identify additional information types not defined in the BRM
and assign associated security impact levels to those types.

4.1.2.1       Services Delivery Support Information
Most information systems employed in both service delivery support and resource management
activities engage in one or more of the eight support delivery of services lines of business. Each
of the information types associated with support delivery of services sub-functions is provided in
Table 5. Volume II, Appendix C.2, “Services Delivery Support Functions,” recommends
provisional impact levels for confidentiality, integrity, and availability security objectives. These
service support functions are the day-to-day activities necessary to provide the critical policy,
programmatic, and managerial foundation that support Federal government operations. The
direct service missions and constituencies ultimately being supported by service support
functions comprise a significant factor in determining the security impacts associated with
compromise of information associated with the support delivery of services business area.
