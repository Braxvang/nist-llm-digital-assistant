NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                             Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                    Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


         •   A prediction_resistance_request parameter has been added to the Reseed_function
             call.
         •   A description of the parameter has been added below the function call.
         •   A step was inserted that checked a request for prediction resistance (via the
             prediction_resistance_request parameter) against the state of the
             prediction_resistance_flag that may have been set during instantiation.
         •   A prediction_resistance_request parameter has been added to the
             Get_entropy_input call of (newly numbered) step 4 of the Reseed Process.
         •   In the description of the entropy_input parameter, a restriction was added that the
             entropy_input is not to be provided by the instantiation being reseeded.
         •   A footnote was inserted to explain why the prediction_resistance_request parameter
             might be useful.
   13.   In Section 9.3.1, the following changes were made:
         •   Text has been added to item 4 to refer to the Reseed_function.
         •   A prediction_resistance_request parameter has been added to the
             Get_entropy_input call of step 7.1 of the Generate Process.
         •   A substep was inserted in step 9 of the Generate Process to check the
             prediction_resistance request against the state of the prediction_resistance_flag.
   14.   In Section 9.3.2, step e, a phrase addressing the presence of the
         prediction_resistance_request indicator was inserted.
   15.   In Sections 10.1 and 10.3.1, the new hash functions approved in FIPS 180-4 have been
         added.
   16.   In Sections 10.1.2 (HMAC_DRBG) and 10.2.1 (CTR_DRBG), the update functions
         have been renamed to reflect the DRBG with which they are associated (i.e., renamed
         to HMAC_DRBG_Update and CTR_DRBG_Update).
   17.   In Section 10.1.2.1, the last paragraph has been revised to indicate that only the Key is
         considered to be a critical value.
   18.   In Sections 10.1.2.3, 10.2.1.3.1, 10.2.1.3.2 and 10.3.1.2, the description of the
         personalization_string has been revised to indicate that the length the
         personalization_string may be zero.
   19.   In Section 10.2.1.5, the following statement has been added to the first paragraph:
          If the derivation function is not used, then the maximum allowed length of
         additional_input = seedlen.
   20.   In Section 10.3.1.2, the specification was changed to select an elliptic curve and return
         the parameters of that curve to the Instantiate_function that called the routine.
   21.   In the first paragraph of Appendix A.1, a statement has been added that if alternative
         points are desired, they shall be generated as specified in Appendix A.2.
