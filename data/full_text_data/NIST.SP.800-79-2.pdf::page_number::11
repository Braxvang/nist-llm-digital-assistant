Special Publication 800-79-2                           Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                        and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



Although organizations may feel constrained by the uniformity required by FIPS 201-2,
standardization greatly contributes to achieving the objectives of [HSPD-12] across issuer
implementations. For all organizations to accept PIV Cards or Derived PIV Credentials of other
organizations, one set of rules (i.e., FIPS 201-2) must be followed by all PIV system participants.
This Special Publication provides a way of determining if the participants are following these
rules. Assessment methods that are consistent, reliable, and repeatable provide a basis for
determining the reliability and capability of issuers of PIV Cards and Derived PIV Credentials,
which herein is defined as consistent adherence to the PIV standards. In particular, if an issuer
meets the requirements of FIPS 201-2 and relevant documents as verified through applicable
assessment procedures and maintain consistency of their operations with respect to meeting these
criteria, they can be considered reliable as is required by [HSPD-12].

The objectives of the guidelines in this document are to—

       Outline the requirements for PIV Card Issuers and for the Derived PIV Credentials
        Issuers, the rationale for the requirements and the assessment procedures required to
        determine the satisfaction of those requirements through a combination of policies,
        procedures, and operations.
       Describe an authorization methodology that provides a framework for organizing the
        requirements and assessment procedures stated above and at the same time provides
        coverage for all the control objectives stated in [HSPD-12].
       Emphasize the role of risk associated with an authorization decision, based on assessment
        outcomes that take into account the organization’s mission.

1.1 Applicability, Intended Audience, and Usage

This document is applicable to, and shall be used by all federal organizations. It may also be
used by any other organization (e.g., state and local government, educational, non-profit)
desiring close alignment with FIPS 201-2 and associated PIV credentials.

All federal organizations are required to adopt [HSPD-12] and implement FIPS 201-2. They
must use SP 800-79-2 to assess the adequacy of their implementations as well as the reliability of
either the directly-controlled or sub-contracted services involved in creating and issuing the
mandatory PIV Cards and the optional Derived PIV Credentials (if implemented).

SP 800-79-2 is consistent and compatible with the control objectives in [HSPD-12], [FIPS 201-
2], and [SP 800-37-1]. SP 800-79-2 includes a number of roles, requirements, definitions,
specifications, and procedures needed to assess the reliability of an issuing organization. In
situations where an issuer fails to meet the assessment criteria in SP 800-79-2, they must
immediately halt operations.

Once an issuer is authorized to operate using the guidelines from 800-79-2, trust can be
established in the issued PIV Card or Derived PIV Credential throughout its lifecycle. Hence,
organizations that accept PIV Cards or Derived PIV Credentials that do not follow these
guidelines, are doing so at their own risk since the reliability of their operations cannot be
assured.
