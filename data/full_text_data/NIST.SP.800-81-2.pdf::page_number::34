SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



      •    Threat T6: A malicious host on the same LAN as a DNS client may be able to intercept and/or
           alter DNS responses. This would allow an attacker to redirect a client to a different site. This
           could be the first action in an attack on a client host.
5.2       DNS Software Threats

Threats to the DNS software itself can have serious security impacts. The most common software
problems and the impact of threats against them are as follows:

      •    Threat T7: DNS software (name server or resolver) could have vulnerabilities such as buffer
           overflows that result in denial of service.

      •    Threat T8: DNS software does not provide adequate access control capabilities for its
           configuration files (e.g., named.conf), its data files (e.g., zone file) and files containing signing
           keys (e.g., TSIG, DNSKEY) to prevent unauthorized read/update of these files. These capabilities
           are provided on top of O/S-file level protection referred to in threats T4 and T5 and may depend
           upon the latter.
5.3       Threats Due to DNS Data Contents

DNS data is made up of two types: zone files and configuration files. The content of both these types of
DNS data has security ramifications. All the security deployment options discussed in this document
relate to configuration file contents. Security implications due to zone file content are discussed in the
section titled “Guidelines for Minimizing Information Exposure through DNS Content Control” (Section
10) and are mostly due to the following aspects of zone data:

      •    Parameter values for certain key fields in RRs of various RRTypes

      •    Presence of certain RRs in the zone file.
The various types of undesirable contents in the zone file results in different security exposures and
consequent potential threats as follows:

      •    Threat T9—Lame Delegation: This error occurs when FQDN and/or IP addresses of name
           servers have been changed in the child zone but the parent zone has not updated the delegation
           information (NS RRs and glue records). In this situation, the child zone becomes unreachable
           (denial of service).

      •    Threat T10—Zone Drift and Zone Thrash: If the Refresh, and Retry, fields in the SOA RR of
           the primary name server are set too high and the zone file is changed frequently, there may be a
           mismatch of data between the primary and secondary name servers. This error is called zone drift;
           it results in incorrect zone data at the secondary name servers. If the Refresh and Retry fields in
           the SOA RR are set too low, the secondary server will initiate zone transfers frequently. This
           error is called zone thrash; it results in more workload on both the primary and secondary name
           servers. Such incorrect data or increased workload may result in denial of service.

      •    Threat T11—Information for Targeted Attacks: RRs such as HINFO and TXT provide
           information about software name and versions (e.g., for resources such as Web servers and mail
           servers) that will enable the well-equipped attacker to exploit the known vulnerabilities in those
           software versions and launch attacks against those resources.
