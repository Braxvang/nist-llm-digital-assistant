NIST SP 800-82r3                                         Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

Rationale for removing CA-8 (1) from HIGH baseline: Specific expertise is necessary to conduct
effective penetration testing on OT systems, and it may not be feasible to identify independent
personnel with the appropriate skillset or knowledge to perform penetration testing on an OT
environment. While an independent penetration test agent or team is recommended, it may not be
feasible for all high-impact OT systems.

OT Discussion: Organizations perform risk-benefit analysis to determine whether OT equipment
should be connected to other internal system components and then document those connections.
The AO fully understands the potential risks associated with approving individual connections or
approving a class of components to be connected. For example, the AO may broadly approve the
connection of any sensors limited to 4 to 20 milliamp (mA) communication, while other
connection types (e.g., serial or Ethernet) require individual approval. Decisions to accept risk
are documented.

F.7.5. CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT â€“ CM
Tailoring Considerations for the Configuration Management Family
When the OT cannot be configured to restrict the use of unnecessary functions or cannot support
the use of automated mechanisms to implement configuration management functions, the
organization employs nonautomated mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls in
accordance with the general tailoring guidance. Examples of compensating controls are given
with each control as appropriate.
