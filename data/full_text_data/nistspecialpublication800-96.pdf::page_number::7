Special Publication 800-96                                   PIV Card to Reader Interoperability Guidelines

2.1.8    Support for PPS Procedure
The reader shall support Protocol and Parameters Selection (PPS) procedure by having the ability to read
character TA1 of the Answer to Reset (ATR) sent by the card as defined in ISO/IEC 7816-3:1997.

2.2     PIV Contact Card Reader (Physical Access)

2.2.1    Common Requirements
The contact interface of the reader shall support all requirements in sections 2.1.2 to 2.1.8.

2.3     PIV Contactless Card Reader (Logical Access)

2.3.1    API
The reader shall be Personal Computer Smart Card (PC/SC) conformant when used with corresponding drivers
for the host Operating System Platform.
The reader, in conjunction with its corresponding driver, should handle the APDU exchange with T=0 for case 4
commands (e.g., GET DATA, GENERATE ASYMMETRIC KEY PAIR) by reading all data from the card. In
other words, the reader in conjunction with its corresponding driver should process all APDUs from the card
consisting of SW1 = ‘61’ and SW2 = Number of bytes in the buffer, and should not transmit these APDUs
through the PC/SC API to the software implementing the client-application programming interface
(middleware).

2.3.2    APDU Support
At a minimum, the contactless interface shall support all card commands for contactless based access specified
in Section 7, End-point PIV Card Application Card Command Interface of SP 800-73-1, Interfaces for Personal
Identity Verification.

2.3.3    Buffer Size
The reader shall contain a buffer large enough to receive the maximum size frame permitted by ISO/IEC 7816-
3, Section 9.4.

2.3.4    ISO 14443 Support
The PIV Reader shall support parts (1 through 4) of ISO/IEC 14443 as amended in the References of this
publication.

2.3.5    Type A and B Communication Signal Interfaces
The contactless interface of the reader shall support both the Type A and Type B communication signal
interfaces as defined in ISO/IEC 14443-2:2001.

2.3.6    Type A and B Initialization and Anti-Collision
The contactless interface of the reader shall support both Type A and Type B initialization and anti-collision
methods as defined in ISO/IEC 14443-3:2001.
