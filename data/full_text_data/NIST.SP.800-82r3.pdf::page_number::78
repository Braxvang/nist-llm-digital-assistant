NIST SP 800-82r3                                                Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

OT owners can tailor the overlay from Appendix F when it is not possible or feasible to
implement specific controls. The use of overlays does not in any way preclude organizations
from performing further tailoring (i.e., overlays can also be subject to tailoring) to reflect
organization-specific needs, assumptions, or constraints. However, all tailoring activities should
primarily focus on meeting the intent of the original controls whenever possible or feasible. For
example, when the OT cannot support or the organization determines that it is not advisable to
implement particular controls or control enhancements in an OT (e.g., performance, safety, or
reliability are adversely impacted), the organization should provide a complete and convincing
rationale for how the selected compensating controls provide an equivalent security capability or
level of protection for the OT and why the related baseline controls could not be employed. If the
OT cannot support the use of automated mechanisms, the organization employs nonautomated
mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls in accordance with the general tailoring
guidance in Section 3.3 of NIST SP 800-53. Compensating controls are not exceptions or
waivers to the baseline controls. Rather, they are alternative safeguards and countermeasures
employed within the OT that accomplish the intent of the original controls that could not be
effectively employed. Organizational decisions on the use of compensating controls are
documented in the security plan for the OT.
