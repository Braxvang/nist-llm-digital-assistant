NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                               Guidelines for Media Sanitization


 2.2 Types of Media

There are two primary types of media in common use:

      Hard Copy. Hard copy media are physical representations of information, most often
       associated with paper printouts. However, printer and facsimile ribbons, drums, and
       platens are all examples of hard copy media. The supplies associated with producing
       paper printouts are often the most uncontrolled. Hard copy materials containing sensitive
       data that leave an organization without effective sanitization expose a significant
       vulnerability to “dumpster divers” and overcurious employees, risking unwanted
       information disclosures.

      Electronic (i.e., “soft copy”). Electronic media are devices containing bits and bytes
       such as hard drives, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), disks,
       flash memory, memory devices, phones, mobile computing devices, networking devices,
       office equipment, and many other types listed in Appendix A.

In the future, organizations will be using media types not specifically addressed by this guide.
The processes described in this document should guide media sanitization decision making
regardless of the type of media in use. To effectively use this guide for all media types,
organizations and individuals should focus on the information that could possibly have been
recorded on the media, rather than on the media itself.

 2.3 Trends in Data Storage Media

Historical efforts to sanitize magnetic media have benefitted from the wide use of a single
common type of storage medium implemented relatively similarly across vendors and models.
The storage capacity of magnetic media has increased at a relatively constant rate and vendors
have modified the technology as necessary to achieve higher capacities. As the technology
approaches the superparamagnetic limit, or the limit at which magnetic state can be changed with
existing media and recording approaches, additional new approaches and technologies will be
necessary in order for storage vendors to produce higher capacity devices.

Alternative technologies such as flash memory-based storage devices, or Solid State Drives
(SSDs), have also become prevalent due to falling costs, higher performance, and shock
resistance. SSDs have already begun changing the norm in storage technology, and—at least
from a sanitization perspective—the change is revolutionary (as opposed to evolutionary).
Degaussing, a fundamental way to sanitize magnetic media, no longer applies in most cases for
flash memory-based devices. Evolutionary changes in magnetic media will also have potential
impacts on sanitization. New storage technologies, and even variations of magnetic storage, that
are dramatically different from legacy magnetic media will clearly require sanitization research
and require a reinvestigation of sanitization procedures to ensure efficacy.

Both revolutionary and evolutionary changes make sanitization decisions more difficult, as the
storage device may not clearly indicate what type of media is used for data storage. The burden
falls on the user to accurately determine the media type and apply the associated sanitization
procedure.
