4.7.2 Unlinkability
In order to provide privacy to entities, to adhere to applicable privacy laws, or to enhance
security (by protecting against inferring who is associated with a given transaction), a
CKMS may provide unlinkability protection for CKMS transactions in terms of the
entities that participate in the transaction.

FR:4.10 The CKMS design shall specify which CKMS transactions have or can be
provided with unlinkability protection.

FR:4.11 The CKMS design shall specify how CKMS transaction unlinkability is
achieved.

4.7.3 Unobservability
In order to provide privacy to entities, to adhere to applicable privacy laws, or to enhance
security (by protecting against inferring any information whose disclosure might not be
desired), a CKMS may provide unobservability of CKMS transactions in terms of the
entities that initiate or participate in the transaction.

FR:4.12 The CKMS design shall specify which CKMS transactions have or can be
provided with unobservability protection.

FR:4.13 The CKMS design shall specify how CKMS transaction unobservability is
achieved.

4.8 Laws, Rules, and Regulations
The security policies of an organization should conform to the laws, rules, and
regulations of the locality, state, and nation(s) in which the CKMS will be used. If a
CKMS is designed for international use, then it should be flexible enough to conform to
national restrictions.

FR:4.14 The CKMS design shall specify the countries and/or regions of countries where
it is intended for use and any legal restrictions that the CKMS is intended to enforce.

4.9 Security Domains
A security domain is a collection of entities, including their CKMS, in which each CKMS
operates under the same security policy âˆ’ known as the Domain Security Policy. When
two mutually trusting entities are in the same security domain, the entities can exchange
keys and metadata while providing the protections that are required by the Domain
Security Policy.

When two entities are in different security domains, they may not be able to provide
equivalent protection to the exchanged keys and metadata because they operate under
different domain security policies. However, there are circumstances in which an entity in
one domain can send keys and metadata to another entity in a different domain, even
though the domain security policies are not completely identical.
