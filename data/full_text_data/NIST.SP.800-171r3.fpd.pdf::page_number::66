       NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                         Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
       November 2023

1867   3.13.15. Session Authenticity
1868              REQUIREMENT: 03.13.15
1869              Protect the authenticity of communications sessions.

1870              DISCUSSION
1871              Protecting session authenticity addresses communications protection at the session level, not
1872              at the packet level. Such protection establishes grounds for confidence at both ends of the
1873              communications sessions in the ongoing identities of other parties and the validity of the
1874              transmitted information. Authenticity protection includes protecting against “adversary-in-the-
1875              middle” attacks, session hijacking, and the insertion of false information into sessions.

1882   3.14.1. Flaw Remediation
1883             REQUIREMENT: 03.14.01
1884             a. Identify, report, and correct system flaws.
1885             b. Install security-relevant software and firmware updates within [Assignment: organization-
1886                defined time period] of the release of the updates.

1887             DISCUSSION
1888             Organizations identify systems that are affected by announced software and firmware flaws,
1889             including potential vulnerabilities that result from those flaws, and report this information to
1890             designated personnel with information security responsibilities. Security-relevant updates
1891             include patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations address the
1892             flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response
1893             activities, and system error handling. Organizations can take advantage of available resources,
1894             such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
1895             (CVE) databases, in remediating the flaws discovered in organizational systems. Organization-
1896             defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary based on a
1897             variety of factors, including the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related
1898             to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation may require more testing than other
1899             types of remediation.
