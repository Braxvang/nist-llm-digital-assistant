4.3.4. Implement
The Implement step involves the implementation of controls in new or legacy systems. The
control selection process described in this section can be applied to OT from two perspectives:
new development and legacy.
For new development systems, the control selection process is applied from a requirements
definition perspective since the systems do not yet exist and organizations are conducting initial
security categorizations. The controls included in the security plans for the systems serve as
security specifications and are expected to be incorporated into the systems during the
development and implementation phases of the system development life cycle.
In contrast, the security control selection process for legacy systems is applied from a gap
analysis perspective when organizations anticipate significant changes to the systems (e.g.,
during major upgrades, modifications, or outsourcing). Since the systems already exist,
organizations have likely completed the security categorization and security control selection
processes, resulting in the establishment of previously agreed-upon controls in the respective
security plans and the implementation of those controls within the systems.
Table 9 provides additional details on applying the RMF Implement step to OT.
