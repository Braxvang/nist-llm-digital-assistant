C.1       Sample Component Test Documentation

An example of a component test is the occasional test of the nationâ€™s Emergency Alert System, formerly
known as the Emergency Broadcast Network. 24 During such a test, the equipment is tested, and a tone
and announcement associated with an emergency are broadcasted on the radio or television. Although the
test does not involve a simulated emergency with responders, the message tests a specific component of
the system.
