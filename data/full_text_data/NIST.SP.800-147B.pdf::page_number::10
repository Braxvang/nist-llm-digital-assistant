2.    Background

This section provides background information on the system BIOS and types of server architectures. It
identifies the primary methods used for updating the system BIOS, and it also discusses security issues
and threats to the system BIOS. Finally, it discusses Root of Trust for Update components.

2.1    System BIOS
Exclusive of certain configuration and security code that may be embedded into a platformâ€™s silicon
components, e.g., processor, the system BIOS is the first software executed on the main central
processing unit (CPU) when a computer is powered on. While the system BIOS was originally
responsible for providing operating systems access to hardware, its primary role on modern machines is to
initialize and test hardware components and load the operating system. In addition, the BIOS loads and
initializes important system management functions, such as power and thermal management. The system
BIOS may also load CPU microcode patches during the boot process.

There are several different types of BIOS firmware. Some computers use a 16-bit conventional BIOS,
while many newer systems use boot firmware based on the UEFI specifications [UEFI], or use other
customized boot firmware. In this document we refer to all types of boot firmware as BIOS firmware, the
system BIOS, or simply BIOS. When necessary, we differentiate conventional BIOS firmware from UEFI
firmware by calling them the conventional BIOS and UEFI BIOS, respectively.

System BIOS is typically developed by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the server.
Manufacturers frequently update system firmware to fix bugs, patch vulnerabilities, and support new
hardware. The system BIOS is typically stored on electrically erasable programmable read-only memory
(EEPROM) or other forms of flash memory. Typically, system BIOS firmware is updated using a utility
or tool that has special knowledge of the non-volatile storage components in which the BIOS is stored.
This tool may run on one of the CPUs in the server itself, or it could run on a management processor
within the server chassis.

A given computer system can have BIOS in several different locations. In addition to the motherboard,
BIOS may be found on hard drive controllers, video cards, network cards and other add-in cards. This
additional firmware generally takes the form of Option ROMs (containing conventional BIOS and/or
UEFI drivers). These are loaded by the system firmware during the boot process and executed on the host
CPU. Option ROMs should not be confused with device firmware; there are many system devices in a
server with microcontrollers that run their own firmware.

The guidelines in this document apply to BIOS firmware stored in the BIOS flash memory, including the
BIOS code, the cryptographic keys that are part of the Root of Trust for Update, and static BIOS data.
Option ROMs that are stored with the system BIOS firmware and are updated by the same mechanism are
considered part of the BIOS for the purposes of this document. However, the guidelines do not apply to
Option ROMs and other device firmware stored elsewhere in a server, such as on an add-on card.

2.2   Server Architectures
In this subsection, we differentiate servers into three classes: Basic Servers, Managed Servers, and Blade
Servers. The distinctions made here have to do with the mechanisms employed to update the system
BIOS.
