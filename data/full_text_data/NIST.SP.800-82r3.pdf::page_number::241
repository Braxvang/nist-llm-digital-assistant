selection of compensating controls. Compensating controls in the OT environment may be
required when the OT cannot support certain controls or control enhancements or when the
organization determines that it is not advisable to implement controls or control enhancements
due to potential adverse impacts to performance, safety, or reliability. Compensating controls are
alternatives to a specific baseline control or enhancement that provides equivalent or comparable
protection. For example, if controls or control enhancements require automated mechanisms that
are not readily available, cost-effective, or technically feasible in OT environments,
compensating controls implemented through nonautomated mechanisms or procedures may be
acceptable to meet the intent of the control.
Compensating controls implemented in accordance with PL-11 from SP 800-53, Rev. 5 are not
considered exceptions or waivers to the baseline controls. Rather, they are alternative safeguards
and countermeasures employed within the OT environment that accomplish the intent of the
original controls that could not be effectively employed. See “Control Tailoring” in Section 3.3
of NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 2 [SP800-37r2].
Using compensating controls may also include control enhancements that supplement the
baseline. Using compensating controls typically involves a trade-off between additional risk and
reduced functionality. Every use of compensating controls should involve a risk-based
determination of how much residual risk to accept and how much functionality to reduce.
Additionally, when compensating controls are employed, organizations should document the
rationale and describe:
   •   Why the baseline control could not be implemented
   •   How the compensating controls provide equivalent security capabilities for OT systems
   •   The risk acceptance for any residual risk that results from using the compensating
       controls instead of the baseline control
Organizational decisions on the use of compensating controls are documented in the security
plan for the OT.
Controls that contain assignments (e.g., Assignment: organization-defined conditions or trigger
events) may be tailored out of the baseline. This is equivalent to assigning a value of “none.” The
assignment may take on different values for different impact baselines.

F.5.   OT Communication Protocols
The unique network properties within OT may warrant specific attention when applying certain
controls. Many of the controls in NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 that pertain to communication,
devices, and interfaces implicitly assume the applicability of network routing or communication
between network segments or zones. Some devices or subsystems used in OT may be configured
or architected in a way that may create an exception to this assumption. As a result, controls for
devices that communicate using standards and protocols that do not include network addressing
generally require tailoring. An RS-232 (serial) interface is an example of a non-network
addressable or routable communication method that is commonly employed in OT equipment.
