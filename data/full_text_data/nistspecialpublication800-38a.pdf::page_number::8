1 Purpose

This publication provides recommendations regarding modes of operation to be used with
symmetric key block cipher algorithms.


2 Authority

This document has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Computer Security Act of 1987
(Public Law 100-235) and the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996,
specifically 15 U.S.C. 278 g-3(a)(5). This is not a guideline within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. 278
g-3 (a)(5).

This recommendation is neither a standard nor a guideline, and as such, is neither mandatory nor
binding on Federal agencies. Federal agencies and non-government organizations may use this
recommendation on a voluntary basis. It is not subject to copyright.

Nothing in this recommendation should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines that have
been made mandatory and binding upon Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under
his statutory authority. Nor should this recommendation be interpreted as altering or superseding
the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, the Director of the Office of Management
and Budget, or any other Federal official.

Conformance testing for implementations of the modes of operation that are specified in this
recommendation will be conducted within the framework of the Cryptographic Module
Validation Program (CMVP), a joint effort of the NIST and the Communications Security
Establishment of the Government of Canada. An implementation of a mode of operation must
adhere to the requirements in this recommendation in order to be validated under the CMVP.

3 Introduction

This recommendation specifies five confidentiality modes of operation for symmetric key block
cipher algorithms, such as the algorithm specified in FIPS Pub. 197, the Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES) [2]. The modes may be used in conjunction with any symmetric key block cipher
algorithm that is approved by a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). The five
modes—the Electronic Codebook (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), Cipher Feedback
(CFB), Output Feedback (OFB), and Counter (CTR) modes—can provide data confidentiality.

Two FIPS publications already approve confidentiality modes of operation for two particular
block cipher algorithms. FIPS Pub. 81 [4] specifies the ECB, CBC, CFB, and OFB modes of the
Data Encryption Standard (DES). FIPS Pub. 46-3 [3] approves the seven modes that are
specified in ANSI X9.52 [1]. Four of these modes are equivalent to the ECB, CBC, CFB, and
OFB modes with the Triple DES algorithm (TDEA) as the underlying block cipher; the other
