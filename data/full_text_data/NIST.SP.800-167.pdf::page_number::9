2.      The Basics of Application Whitelisting

A whitelist is a list of discrete entities, such as hosts, email addresses, network port numbers, runtime
processes, or applications that are authorized to be present or active on a system according to a well-
defined baseline. A blacklist is a list of discrete entities that have been previously determined to be
associated with malicious activity. A graylist is a list of discrete entities that have not yet been established
as benign or malicious; more information is needed to move graylist items onto a whitelist or a blacklist.
Whitelists, blacklists, and graylists are primarily used as a form of access control: permitting activity
corresponding to the whitelist and not permitting activity corresponding to the blacklist. Graylist
treatment depends on the type of entities it contains. An example of how a graylist might be handled is
prompting the user to make a decision or notifying an administrator that the entity needs to have its
security evaluated before use.

An application whitelist is a list of applications and application components (libraries, configuration files,
etc.) that are authorized to be present or active on a host according to a well-defined baseline. The
technologies used to enforce application whitelists—to control which applications are permitted to be
installed or executed on a host—are called whitelisting programs, application control programs, or
application whitelisting technologies. Application whitelisting technologies are intended to stop the
execution of malware and other unauthorized software. Unlike security technologies such as antivirus
software, which use blacklists to block known bad activity and permit all other, application whitelisting
technologies are designed to permit known good activity and block all other.

This section examines the basics of application whitelisting. It first discusses the categories of threats that
application whitelisting can mitigate and the types of application whitelisting. Next, it defines the types of
operational runtime modes available for application whitelisting technologies. The section also explains
the motivations for application whitelisting and discusses uses of application whitelisting technologies
other than application access control. Finally, the section concludes by examining differences in
deployment based on operational environment, as well as considerations for evaluating the relative
effectiveness of application whitelisting solutions.

2.1     Threats

As previously discussed, application whitelisting software prevents installation and/or execution of any
application that is not specifically authorized for use on a particular host. This mitigates multiple
categories of threats, including malware and other unauthorized software.

Malware, also known as malicious code, refers to an application that is covertly inserted into another piece
of software (e.g., operating system, application) with the intent to steal or destroy data, run destructive
or intrusive programs, or otherwise compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of
the victim’s data, applications, or operating system.1 Many of today’s threats are malware-based,
attempting to infect hosts (install their malicious code) and execute on those hosts to steal their data or
perform other harmful activities. When properly configured, application whitelisting technologies can stop
most malware from being executed (and often from being installed in the first place). Application
whitelisting technologies can be significantly more effective at stopping unknown malware threats than
conventional antivirus software and other traditional antimalware security controls. This is important
because today’s malware threats are increasingly customized and targeted, making traditional detection
technologies largely ineffective.
