355   2.   Introduction
356   This section is informative.
357   Digital authentication is the process of determining the validity of one or more
358   authenticators used to claim a digital identity. Authentication establishes that a subject
359   attempting to access a digital service is in control of the technologies used to authenticate.
360   For services in which return visits are applicable, successfully authenticating provides
361   reasonable risk-based assurances that the subject accessing the service today is the same
362   as the one who accessed the service previously.
363   The ongoing authentication of subscribers is central to the process of associating a
364   subscriber with their online activity (i.e., with their subscriber account). Subscriber
365   authentication is performed by verifying that the claimant controls one or more
366   authenticators (called tokens in some earlier versions of SP 800-63) associated with
367   a given subscriber account. A successful authentication results in the assertion of a
368   pseudonymous or non-pseudonymous identifier and optionally other identity information
369   to the relying party (RP).
370   This document provides recommendations on types of authentication processes, including
371   choices of authenticators, that may be used at various authentication assurance levels
372   (AALs). It also provides recommendations on the lifecycle of authenticators, including
373   revocation in the event of loss or theft.
374   This technical guideline applies to digital authentication of subjects to systems over a
375   network. It does not address the authentication of a person for physical access (e.g., to a
376   building), though some credentials used for digital access may also be used for physical
377   access authentication. This technical guideline also requires that federal systems and
378   service providers participating in authentication protocols be authenticated to subscribers.
379   The AAL characterizes the strength of an authentication transaction as an ordinal
380   category. Stronger authentication (a higher AAL) requires malicious actors to have
381   better capabilities and to expend greater resources in order to successfully subvert
382   the authentication process. Authentication at higher AALs can effectively reduce the
383   risk of attacks. A high-level summary of the technical requirements for each of the
384   AALs is provided below; see Sec. 4 and Sec. 5 of this document for specific normative
385   requirements.
386   Authentication Assurance Level 1: AAL1 provides some assurance that the claimant
387   controls an authenticator bound to the subscriber account. AAL1 requires either single-
388   factor or multi-factor authentication using a wide range of available authentication
389   technologies. Successful authentication requires that the claimant prove possession and
390   control of the authenticator through a secure authentication protocol.
391   Authentication Assurance Level 2: AAL2 provides high confidence that the claimant
392   controls one or more authenticators bound to the subscriber account. Proof of
