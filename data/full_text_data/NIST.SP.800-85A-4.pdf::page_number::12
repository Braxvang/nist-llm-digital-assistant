NIST SP 800-85A-4                                                    PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                              INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

2.1 Test Plan

The test plan identifies the tasks/artifacts required for testing the PIV Middleware and PIV
Card Applications. These artifacts include the following: PIV Middleware and a smart card
populated with a PIV Card Application; the test toolkit (or test scripts), which implements
the test assertions; and the various infrastructure devices needed to interface with the card
and the card reader. The components involved in the test plan and the elements of the test
configuration for the two broad categories of tests presented in this document are discussed
in the next two subsections.
2.2 Test Set-up

The test system consists of the following components: 2
            Test toolkit application software that resides on a personal computer (PC).
            Smart card (SC) readers:
                  o An ISO/IEC 7816 and PC/SC-compliant contact-based smart card reader
                    and
                  o An ISO/IEC 14443 and PC/SC-compliant contactless smart card reader.
             or
                  o A dual interface reader.
            A personal identification number (PIN) pad or a keyboard that can transmit the
             PIN to the smart card reader.
            A set of test PIV Cards, loaded with PIV Card Application, with a contact
             interface that is compliant with ISO/IEC 7816 and a contactless interface that is
             compliant with ISO/IEC 14443, or a test PIV Card emulator.
            PIV Middleware application.
These components will be used in different configurations based on the type of test being
conducted in the test bed.
2.3 Test System Configuration

The test system shown in Figure 2 will be configured in both the PIV Middleware tests and
the PIV Card Application tests to accommodate the different components to be tested, as
explained in Section 3.

  Compliance of the readers and input devices with an external standard such as ISO/IEC 7816 is not addressed
in this document.
