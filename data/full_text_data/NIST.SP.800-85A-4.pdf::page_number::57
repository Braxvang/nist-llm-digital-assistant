                                                                        INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES



(a) If the authentication data in the command data field satisfies the criteria in Section 2.4.3
    of Part 2 of SP 800-73-4 and matches the current value of the reference data, but the new
    reference data in the command data field of the command does not satisfy the criteria in
    Section 2.4.3 of Part 2 of SP 800-73-4 the PIV Card Application shall return status word
    '6A 80'.

(b) If the authentication data in the command data field does not match the current value of
    the reference data, but both the authentication data and the new reference data in the
    command data field of the command satisfy the criteria in Section 2.4.3 of Part 2 of SP
    800-73-4, the PIV Card Application shall return status word '63 CX'.

(c) If status word '6A 80' is returned, the security status and retry counter associated with the
    key reference shall remain unchanged.

Required Vendor Information

VE05.25A-R4.01: The vendor shall state in its documentation that the card supports the assertions
made in AS05.25A-R4.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.25A-R4.01: The tester shall validate that: 1) the vendor documentation contains the
information required in VE05.25A-R4.01; and 2) the card returns status word '6A 80' or '63 CX'
based on the conditions mentioned in AS05.25A-R4.

AS05.26: If the card command succeeds, then the security status of the key reference shall be
set to TRUE and the retry counter associated with the key reference shall be set to the reset
retry value associated with the key reference.

Required Vendor Information

VE05.26.01: The vendor shall state in its documentation that the card supports the assertion made
in AS05.26.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.26.01: The tester shall validate that the vendor documentation states the required information
in VE05.26.01 and the retry counter associated with the key reference is set to the reset retry value
associated with the key reference when the command succeeds.
