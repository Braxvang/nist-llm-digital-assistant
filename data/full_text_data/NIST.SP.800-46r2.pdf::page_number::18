                                                                                                There are a few types of portal solutions commonly used for remote access. A web-based portal provides
                                                                                                a user with access to multiple web-based applications from a single portal website. An SSL portal VPN is
                                                                                                a common form of web-based portal. Another type of portal solution is terminal server access, which
                                                                                                gives each teleworker access to a separate standardized virtual desktop. The terminal server simulates the
                                                                                                look and feel of a desktop operating system and provides access to applications. Terminal server access
                                                                                                requires the teleworker either to install a special terminal server client application on the client device or
                                                                                                to use a web-based interface, often with a browser plug-in or other additional software provided by the
                                                                                                organization. Another similar remote access method, called virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), involves
                                                                                                the user connecting to a system that contains virtual images of standardized, non-simulated operating
                                                                                                systems and desktops. When the teleworker is finished with a remote access session, the virtual image is
                                                                                                discarded so that the next user will have a clean virtual desktop. VDI is particularly helpful for
                                                                                                safeguarding telework on BYOD and third-party-controlled devices, which are more likely than
                                                                                                organization-issued devices to not meet the organization’s security requirements.
