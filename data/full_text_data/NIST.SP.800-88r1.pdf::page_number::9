NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                                    Guidelines for Media Sanitization


1        Introduction

    1.1 Purpose and Scope

The information security concern regarding information disposal and media sanitization resides
not in the media but in the recorded information. The issue of media disposal and sanitization is
driven by the information placed intentionally or unintentionally on the media. Electronic media
used on a system should be assumed to contain information commensurate with the security
categorization of the system’s confidentiality. If not handled properly, release of these media
could lead to an occurrence of unauthorized disclosure of information. Categorization of an
information technology (IT) system in accordance with Federal Information Processing Standard
(FIPS) 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information
Systems 1, is the critical first step in understanding and managing system information and media.

Based on the results of categorization, the system owner should refer to NIST Special
Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information
Systems and Organizations 2, which specifies that “the organization sanitizes information system
digital media using approved equipment, techniques, and procedures. The organization tracks,
documents, and verifies media sanitization and destruction actions and periodically tests
sanitization equipment/procedures to ensure correct performance. The organization sanitizes or
destroys information system digital media before its disposal or release for reuse outside the
organization, to prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access to and using the
information contained on the media.”

This document will assist organizations in implementing a media sanitization program with
proper and applicable techniques and controls for sanitization and disposal decisions, considering
the security categorization of the associated system’s confidentiality.

The objective of this special publication is to assist with decision making when media require
disposal, reuse, or will be leaving the effective control of an organization. Organizations should
develop and use local policies and procedures in conjunction with this guide to make effective,
risk-based decisions on the ultimate sanitization and/or disposition of media and information.

The information in this guide is best applied in the context of current technology and
applications. It also provides guidance for information disposition, sanitization, and control
decisions to be made throughout the system life cycle. Forms of media exist that are not
addressed by this guide, and media are yet to be developed and deployed that are not covered by
this guide. In those cases, the intent of this guide outlined in the procedures section applies to all
forms of media based on the evaluated security categorization of the system’s confidentiality
according to FIPS 199.
