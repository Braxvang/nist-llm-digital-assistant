                                                            CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



7.5.6    Data Erase Practices

Virtual machines access disk resources maintained by the provider. When a consumer releases such a
resource, the provider must ensure that the next consumer to rent the resource does not observe data
residue from previous tenants. Strong data erase policies (e.g., multiple overwriting of disk blocks) are
time consuming and may not be compatible with high performance when tenants are changing. Data
replication and backup practices also complicate data erase practices.

7.6     Recommendations for Infrastructure as a Service

For Federal information systems and those operated on behalf of the US Government, the Federal
Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 and the associated NIST standards and special
publications (e.g. FIPS 199, FIPS 200, SP 800-53, etc.) do apply to IaaS systems. General
recommendations for cloud computing services are given in section 9. See also Appendix A on the
sharing of roles and responsibilities between customers and cloud providers. The following are additional
recommendations for IaaS systems:

 Multi-tenancy. When an IaaS cloud provider provides computing resources in the form of Virtual
  Machines (VMs), ensure that the provider has mechanisms in place to protect VMs from attacks (a)
  from other VMs on the same physical host (b) from the physical host as well as (c) from network
  originated attacks. Typical attack detection and prevention mechanisms include Virtual Firewalls,
  Virtual IDS/IPS, and Virtual Private Networks.
 Data Protection. Analyze the IaaS provider’s data protection mechanisms, data location
  configuration and processing technologies, and assess whether they will meet the confidentiality,
  compliance, integrity and availability needs of the organization that will be using the provider’s
  infrastructure.
 Secure Data Deletion. Require that a cloud provider offer a mechanism for reliably deleting data on
  a consumer's request.
 Administrative Access. When renting computing resources from an IaaS cloud provider in the form
  of virtual machines or physical servers, ensure that a limited set of trained/trusted users (from the
  consumer organization) alone are provided administrative access to those resources.
 VM Migration. Formulate a strategy for future migration of Virtual Machines and their associated
  storage among alternate cloud providers (e.g., the OVF standard could be a partial basis for such a
  strategy).
 Virtualization Best Practices. Follow best practices for the administration of conventional systems
  and networks, and for use of virtualization (i.e., NIST Guide to Security for Full Virtualization
  Technologies SP 800-125).
