Special Publication 800-157                                               Guidelines for Derived PIV Credentials


[SP800-124]).

Once the request has been submitted the Applicant needs to authenticate to the Derived PIV Credential
issuer using his/her PIV Card. The authentication is performed using the PKI-AUTH authentication
mechanism from Section 6.2.3.1 of [FIPS201]. If the credential is being issued at LOA-3 this
authentication may be performed remotely. At LOA-4, the authentication needs to be performed in person
and has to be accompanied by a biometric authentication. In addition to authenticating the cardholder,
performing the PKI-AUTH authentication mechanism verifies that the Applicant is currently eligible to
possess PIV credentials. After the Applicant has been authenticated the Derived PIV Credential may be
issued by the certification authority. The Derived PIV Credential may then be used for authentication to
remote systems in the same way as the PIV Authentication certificate on the PIV Card is used.

The maintenance activities for a Derived PIV Credential are the same as for other X.509 public key
certificate. Certificate re-key is typically used to replace a certificate that is nearing expiration. Certificate
modification is used to replace a certificate if information about the Subscriber that appears in the
certificate needs to be changed.

When the token containing the private key corresponding to the Derived PIV Credential is lost, stolen,
damaged, or is being transferred to another individual, or when the Subscriber becomes ineligible to
possess a PIV credential, the issuer needs to prevent further use of the Derived PIV Credential. If the
private key corresponding to the Derived PIV Credential is created and stored on a hardware token that
does not permit the key to be exported then this may be accomplished by zeroizing the private key or by
destroying the token. In other cases, including when the token has been lost or stolen, the Derived PIV
Credential (i.e., the Derived PIV Authentication certificate) needs to be revoked in order to ensure that it
will no longer be accepted by relying parties. If the Derived PIV Credential was revoked (or the private
key was zeroized) because the Subscriber is no longer eligible to possess a PIV Card or because the
Subscriber no longer has a need for a Derived PIV Credential, then a new Derived PIV Credential cannot
be issued. Otherwise, a new Derived PIV Credential may be issued by following the initial issuance
process.

2.2    Initial Issuance

The initial issuance activity deals with the identification of an Applicant and the issuance of the Derived
PIV Credential and other related data.

A Derived PIV Credential shall be issued following verification of the Applicant’s identity using the PIV
Authentication key on his or her existing PIV Card. Verification is demonstrated by proving possession
and control of the PIV Card through the PKI-AUTH authentication mechanism as per section 6.2.3.1 of
[FIPS201]. The revocation status of the Applicant’s PIV Authentication certificate should be rechecked
seven (7) calendar days following issuance of the Derived PIV Credential – this step can detect the use of
a compromised PIV Card to obtain a Derived PIV Credential.

Derived PIV Credentials can be issued at identity assurance levels three or four (LOA-3 or LOA-4). The
credential resides on a hardware or software security token as illustrated in Table D-1. Appendix C
provides example issuance processes for Derived PIV Credentials.

An LOA-3 Derived PIV Credential may be issued remotely or in person in accordance with [SP800-63].
If the credential is issued remotely, all communications shall be authenticated and protected from
modification (e.g., using Transport Layer Security (TLS)), and encryption shall be used, if necessary, to
protect the confidentiality of any private or secret data. Moreover, if the issuance process involves two or
more electronic transactions, the Applicant must identify himself/herself in each new encounter by
