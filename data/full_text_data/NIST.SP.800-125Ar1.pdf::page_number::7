                                                                    SERVER-BASED HYPERVISOR PLATFORMS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

 Server Virtualization is now an established technology for enterprise Information Technology (IT)
 infrastructure in data centers and cloud services as it provides better utilization of hardware resources,
 reduces physical space required, and reduces power consumption and administrative overhead. The core
 software used for server virtualization is called the Hypervisor which directly provides Central Processing
 Unit (CPU) and memory virtualization. Together with its supporting modules, it enables virtualization of
 all hardware resources (e.g., CPU, Memory, Network and Storage) and thus enables multiple computing
 stacks called Virtual Machines (VMs) or Guests, each hosting an Operating System (OS) (Guest OS)
 and application programs, to be run on a single physical host. This physical host is referred to as
 Virtualized Host or Hypervisor Host. Since the hypervisor by itself cannot provide all functions needed
 for server virtualization, it has supporting software modules (e.g., device drivers) for devices (e.g.,
 Network and Storage devices) virtualization in addition to management modules for VM lifecycle
 operations and hypervisor configuration. The hypervisor together with these supporting modules and the
 hosting hardware constitute the hypervisor platform. The hypervisor can be installed either directly on
 the hardware or bare metal (Type 1 Hypervisor) or on top of a full-fledged conventional OS called Host
 OS (Type 2 Hypervisor).

 At first glance, it might appear that all activities related to secure management of a hypervisor and its
 hardware host (collectively called Hypervisor Platform) should consist of just the established state of the
 art practices for any server class software and its hosting environment. However, closer examination
 reveals that functions for supporting hardware virtualization that a hypervisor provides have extensive
 security ramifications and therefore require a focused set of security recommendations based on an
 analysis of threats to the secure execution of these functions.

 Since there are multiple ways by which an architecture of a hypervisor can be classified, the approach
 taken in this document is to identify the baseline functions that a hypervisor performs, the tasks
 involved in each baseline function, the potential threats to the secure execution of the task, and the
 countermeasures that can provide assurance against exploitation of these threats in the form of security
 recommendations.

 The following five are identified as baseline functions of a hypervisor platform:
    • VM Process Isolation
    • Devices Mediation and Access Control
    • Direct Execution of commands from Guest VMs
    • VM Lifecycle Management
    • Management of hypervisor platform

 Apart from providing security recommendations for ensuring the secure execution of the baseline
 functions listed above, a recommendation for ensuring the overall integrity of all components of a
 hypervisor platform is also provided. The recommendations cover both Type 1 and Type 2 hypervisors.

 Secure execution of routine administrative functions for the physical host where the hypervisor is
 installed is not covered in this document. The protection requirements for countering physical access
 threats, as well as those for Guest OS and applications running on VMs and associated security
 recommendations, are also beyond the scope of this document. Further, the security recommendations
 pertain to hypervisors deployed for server virtualization and do not cover other use cases such as the use
 of hypervisor for desktops and embedded systems.
