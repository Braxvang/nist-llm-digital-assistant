Stateful Protocol Analysis: A firewalling capability that improves upon standard stateful inspection by
adding basic intrusion detection technology. This technology consists of an inspection engine that
analyzes protocols at the application layer to compare vendor-developed profiles of benign protocol
activity against observed events to identify deviations, allowing a firewall to allow or deny access based
on how an application is running over a network.

Stateless Inspection: See “Packet Filtering”.
