                                      IMPERATIVE 3 – Strengthening Cryptographic Standards And Validation



      •   Lightweight Cryptography. Many different devices and systems—including
          smart cards, tiny devices for IoT use, and individual microchips—need effective
          encryption yet have limited processor power. These devices and systems are
          vital in sensor networks, healthcare, distributed control systems, and cyber
          physical systems. Because the majority of current cryptographic algorithms were
          designed for desktop/server environments, many do not fit into constrained
          devices. Quantum-resistant algorithms that can perform this sort of “lightweight
          cryptography” are sorely needed. In FY18, NIST invited submissions of candidate
          lightweight cryptographic algorithms12 that provide adequate security for
          environments in which processing performance is constrained and where the
          performance of current NIST cryptographic standards is not acceptable. In FY19,
          NIST aims to pare down those candidates for further evaluation and public review.
      •   Responding to and Anticipating Other Technology Developments. Recent
          developments in cryptographic technologies, including the use of blockchain
          techniques, have driven the need for updated cryptographic key establishment
          and implementation guidance. In FY18, NIST released multiple documents
          designed to fulfill those needs. Significant accomplishments included:
          •    Release of random number generation guidelines13 and an online public
               source14 of random numbers
          •    Updated recommendations for best practices for key management
               organization
          •    Additional guidance on transitioning15 to more effective cryptography
          •    Advanced automated testing and validation 16 of the correctness of algorithms
               (see Text Box #3), including introduction of a new protocol to the international
               standards development process
In FY19, NIST will begin revising additional guidance, convene17 a stakeholder workshop
on threshold cryptography, complete development18 of a hardware chip that implements
improved techniques, and continue to work with external collaborators on developing
consensus-based blockchain standards.
