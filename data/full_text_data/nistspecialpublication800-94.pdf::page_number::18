GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



2.3.1    Signature-Based Detection

A signature is a pattern that corresponds to a known threat. Signature-based detection is the process of
comparing signatures against observed events to identify possible incidents. 5 Examples of signatures are
as follows:

 A telnet attempt with a username of “root”, which is a violation of an organization’s security policy
 An e-mail with a subject of “Free pictures!” and an attachment filename of “freepics.exe”, which are
  characteristics of a known form of malware
 An operating system log entry with a status code value of 645, which indicates that the host’s auditing
  has been disabled.
Signature-based detection is very effective at detecting known threats but largely ineffective at detecting
previously unknown threats, threats disguised by the use of evasion techniques, and many variants of
known threats. For example, if an attacker modified the malware in the previous example to use a
filename of “freepics2.exe”, a signature looking for “freepics.exe” would not match it.

Signature-based detection is the simplest detection method because it just compares the current unit of
activity, such as a packet or a log entry, to a list of signatures using string comparison operations.
Signature-based detection technologies have little understanding of many network or application
protocols and cannot track and understand the state of complex communications. For example, they
cannot pair a request with the corresponding response, such as knowing that a request to a Web server for
a particular page generated a response status code of 403, meaning that the server refused to fill the
request. They also lack the ability to remember previous requests when processing the current request.
This limitation prevents signature-based detection methods from detecting attacks that comprise multiple
events if none of the events contains a clear indication of an attack.

2.3.2    Anomaly-Based Detection

Anomaly-based detection is the process of comparing definitions of what activity is considered normal
against observed events to identify significant deviations. An IDPS using anomaly-based detection has
profiles that represent the normal behavior of such things as users, hosts, network connections, or
applications. The profiles are developed by monitoring the characteristics of typical activity over a period
of time. For example, a profile for a network might show that Web activity comprises an average of 13%
of network bandwidth at the Internet border during typical workday hours. The IDPS then uses statistical
methods to compare the characteristics of current activity to thresholds related to the profile, such as
detecting when Web activity comprises significantly more bandwidth than expected and alerting an
administrator of the anomaly. Profiles can be developed for many behavioral attributes, such as the
number of e-mails sent by a user, the number of failed login attempts for a host, and the level of processor
usage for a host in a given period of time.

The major benefit of anomaly-based detection methods is that they can be very effective at detecting
previously unknown threats. For example, suppose that a computer becomes infected with a new type of
malware. The malware could consume the computer’s processing resources, send large numbers of e-

    Signature-based detection is sometimes referred to as misuse detection, but this publication does not use that term because it
    implies that misuse is only detected using signatures, which is not true. Also, signature-based detection is considered by
    some parties to include stateful protocol analysis, as described in Section 2.3.3. For the purposes of this publication,
    signature-based detection is defined so as not to include stateful protocol analysis, but other publications may have different
    definitions.
