organization’s confines might still pose significant risks because the organization’s devices might
inadvertently associate to them.

4.4.2   Active Wireless Scanning

Organizations can move beyond passive wireless scanning to conduct active scanning. This builds on the
information collected during passive scans, and attempts to attach to discovered devices and conduct
penetration or vulnerability-related testing. For example, organizations can conduct active wireless
scanning on their authorized wireless devices to ensure that they meet wireless security configuration
requirements—including authentication mechanisms, data encryption, and administration access if this
information is not already available through other means.

Organizations should be cautious in conducting active scans to make sure they do not inadvertently scan
devices owned or operated by neighboring organizations that are within range. It is important to evaluate
the physical location of devices before actively scanning them. Organizations should also be cautious in
performing active scans of rogue devices that appear to be operating within the organization’s facility.
Such devices could belong to a visitor to the organization who inadvertently has wireless access enabled,
or to a neighboring organization with a device that is close to, but not within, the organization’s facility.
Generally, organizations should focus on identifying and locating potential rogue devices rather than
performing active scans of such devices.

Organizations may use active scanning when conducting penetration testing on their own wireless
devices. Tools are available that employ scripted attacks and functions, attempt to circumvent
implemented security measures, and evaluate the security level of devices. For example, tools used to
conduct wireless penetration testing attempt to connect to access points (AP) through various methods to
circumvent security configurations. If the tool can gain access to the AP, it can obtain information and
identify the wired networks and wireless devices to which the AP is connected. Some active tools may
also identify vulnerabilities discovered on the wireless client devices, or conduct wired network
vulnerability tests as outlined in Section 4.

While active scanning is being performed, the organization’s WIDPSs can be monitored to evaluate their
capabilities and performance. Depending on assessment goals, assessors conducting these scans may
need to inform the WIDPS administrators and wireless network administrators of pending scanning to
prepare them for possible alarms and alerts. In addition, some WIDPSs can be configured to ignore
alarms and alerts triggered by a specific device—such as one used to perform scanning.

Tools and processes to identify unauthorized devices and vulnerabilities on wired networks can also be
used to identify rogue and misconfigured wireless devices. Wired-side scanning is another process that
can be conducted to discover, and possibly locate, rogue wireless devices. Sections 3.5 and 4.1 discuss
wired scanning.

4.4.3   Wireless Device Location Tracking

Security personnel who operate the wireless scanning tool should attempt to locate suspicious devices.
RF signals propagate in a manner relative to the environment, which makes it important for the operator
to understand how wireless technology supports this process. Mapping capabilities are useful here, but
the main factors needed to support this capability are a knowledgeable operator and an appropriate
wireless antenna.

If rogue devices are discovered and physically located during the wireless scan, security personnel should
ensure that specific policies and processes are followed on how the rogue device is handled—such as
