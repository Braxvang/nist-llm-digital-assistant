                                                                    Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


Null value; obtains pseudorandom bits (see generate process step 8); passes through generate
process step 9, since another reseed will not be required; and continues with generate process
step 10.

9.4 Removing a DRBG Instantiation

The internal state for an instantiation may need to be “released” by erasing (i.e., zeroizing) the
contents of the internal state. The uninstantiate function:
   1. Checks the input parameter for validity, and
   2. Empties the internal state.
The following or an equivalent process shall be used to remove (i.e., uninstantiate) a DRBG
instantiation:
Uninstantiate_function (state_handle):
   1. state_handle: A pointer or index that indicates the internal state to be “released”. If a
      state handle is not used by an implementation because the implementation does not
      support multiple simultaneous instantiations, a state_handle is not provided as input. In
      this case, uninstantiate process step 1 is omitted, and process step 2 erases the internal
      state.
Output to a consuming application after uninstantiation:
   1. status: The status returned from the function.
Information retained within the DRBG mechanism boundary after uninstantiation:
   1. An empty internal state.
Uninstantiate Process:
   1. If state_handle indicates an invalid state, then return (ERROR_FLAG).
   2. Erase the contents of the internal state indicated by state_handle.
   3. Return (SUCCESS).
