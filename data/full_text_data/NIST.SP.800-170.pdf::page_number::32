 competitions, educational outreach meetings, and workshops
 to promote the activities within NICE. The NNLT worked with
 the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on the OPM Cross-
 Agency Priority Goal: “Closing Skills Gap” for IT/Cybersecurity
 and on the OPM Special Cybersecurity Workforce Project focused
 on reducing cybersecurity workforce skills gaps. The project
 will allow agencies to identify and address their needs for
 cybersecurity skill sets to meet their missions. In accomplishing
 this project, agencies will also be updating their cybersecurity
 positions with codes that revise the definitions of and taxonomy
 used for cybersecurity work. In FY 2013, the NNLT supported
 DHS in the launch of the National Initiative for Cybersecurity
 Careers and Studies (NICCS), (http://niccs.us-cert.gov), an
