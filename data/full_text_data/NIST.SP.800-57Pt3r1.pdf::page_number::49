       1. Government systems shall be configured so that approved algorithms (e.g., AES)
          shall be used [RFC 3962], and DES shall not be used [RFC 6649].
      2. An approved MAC checksum (e.g., HMAC-SHA1 or HMAC-SHA256-128) shall
         be installed and used in all implementations for data integrity purposes (see [RFC
         3962] and the IETF Informational Draft, AES Encryption with HMAC-SHA2 for
         Kerberos 5, at: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-kitten-aes-cts-hmac-sha2-04).
      3. The AS, TGS, TSs, and clients shall use strong access control mechanisms30
         (physical and logical) for protecting and updating keys.
      4. Kerberos version 5 permits the use of smart cards or tokens (e.g., FIPS 201
         Personal Identity Verification cards [FIPS 201]) to store a user's password.
         Passwords stored on tokens shall be randomly generated; therefore, when
         tokens are used, a means of generating random passwords by a NIST-approved
         random number generation function ([SP 800-90A], [SP 800-90B], [SP 800-
         90C]), and securely writing them on the token shall be used. When tokens are
         used, manual entry of passwords shall not be permitted except to authenticate the
         user to the token.
      5. Kerberos with public key-based user authentication and key establishment can
         provide stronger security than password-based keys and should be installed where
         PKI mechanisms are available and the software has the capability. See [RFC
         4556] for further information.
      6.     TLS should be used when the system supports it, see Section 4 for guidelines on
            using TLS.
      7. If user passwords are generated by the system, the system shall generate strong
         passwords [SP 800-118]. If passwords are used to form user symmetric keys, then
         an approved hash algorithm (e.g., SHA-1 or stronger) shall be used as the
         password-hashing algorithm.
       8.
            If user passwords are used to generate cryptographic keys, the password
            mechanism shall be configured to use and require strong passwords [SP 800-
            118].29
      9. A backup AS and TGS should be provided so as to minimize the impact in case
         of operational failure or denial-of-service attacks.
      10. Clocks should be synchronized periodically and whenever a new system is
          brought on-line31.


6.5 Recommendations for System Administrators
The System Administrator is any individual(s) who runs a system with a Kerberos
capability on a day-to-day basis and interacts with the end user.

  Strong access control mechanisms either prevent or detect unauthorized attempts to access or replace
sensitive data. These controls may be physical (e.g., locks, guards, or alarms) or logical (e.g., encryption,
data integrity, or entity authentication).
