                 The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



4.3     XCCDF Processing
The following requirements and recommendations pertain to content consumers processing XCCDF
benchmark and tailoring components from an SCAP source data stream.

4.3.1     CPE Applicability Processing
CPEs referenced in an <xccdf:platform> element directly or by a <cpe2:fact-ref> contained
within a referenced <cpe2:platform-specification> element SHALL be evaluated as follows
to determine their presence on a machine:
      1. The CPE SHALL be matched against all CPEs in all of the dictionaries referenced by the
         <ds:data-stream> element. All CPEs that return an EQUAL or SUPERSET result as
         defined in CPE Name Matching [CPE-M] SHALL be used in evaluating the
         <xccdf:platform> or <cpe2:fact-ref>.
      2. Either a list of CPEs found on the target asset MUST be known before the scan, or a list SHALL
         be generated. If a previously known list is used, it MUST be equivalent to a newly generated list.
         To generate the list, the <cpe2_dict:check> element data associated with the found
         <cpe2_dict:cpe-item> elements SHALL be evaluated against the target using the
         referenced OVAL inventory class definition. If a <cpe2_dict:check> returns “pass”, then
         the corresponding CPE SHALL be added to the list of CPEs found on the target.
      3. The list of CPEs found on the target asset, along with the <xccdf:platform> or
         <cpe2:platform-specification> SHALL be used as input to the CPE Applicability
         Language [CPE-L] algorithm to determine the XCCDF Benchmark applicability to the target
         asset.

4.3.2     Check System Usage
If an XCCDF component has multiple <xccdf:check-content-ref> elements, then check
processing SHALL be performed according to [XCCDF:7.2.3.5.1] with the following changes:
      1. For each <xccdf:check-content-ref> element, a content consumer either MUST attempt
         to retrieve the document referenced by the <ds:component-ref> element that is referenced
         directly by the <xccdf:check-content-ref> element’s @href attribute, or it MUST
         resolve the @href attribute within the context of the XML Catalog specified as part of the
         <ds:component-ref> element used to reference this benchmark. If not resolvable, the next
         available <xccdf:check-content-ref> element SHALL be evaluated. If none of the
         <xccdf:check-content-ref> elements are resolvable, then the result of the rule
         evaluation SHALL be the XCCDF “notchecked” status and processing of the check SHALL end.
      2. Once a resolvable <xccdf:check-content-ref> element is found, then check system
         processing SHALL proceed. When evaluating a rule, an <xccdf:rule-
         result/xccdf:message> with the @severity attribute value of “info” SHALL be
         generated, indicating the <xccdf:check-content-ref> @href attribute and @name
         attribute, if provided.
Content consumers SHALL implement check systems supported by SCAP as defined in Section 3.2.4.2.
Content consumers MAY implement check systems that are not supported by SCAP. If a tool encounters
a check system it does not support, it MUST issue a warning and it MUST continue processing according
to the [XCCDF] specification.
