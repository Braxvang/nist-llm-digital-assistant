the TTA’s private signature key. SIGA( ) is verified using entity A’s public signature
verification key, and SIGTTA( ) is verified using the TTA’s public signature verification
key. The following discussions assume that entities A and B successfully verify all
received signatures.

4.3.1 Optional (or No) User Information Provided to the TTA by Entity A
As shown in Figure 1, entity A may request a timestamp from a TTA, or entity A may use
a timestamp that is broadcast from a TTA (i.e., entity A does not explicitly request a
timestamp from the TTA).

   1. The Request message in Figure 1 is sent only if entity A explicitly requests a
      timestamp from the TTA. If the request is sent, the Request message contains any
      desired user_supplied_info (see Section 4.1).
   2. The TTA sends a TSP to entity A (or broadcasts a TSP that is subsequently
      obtained by A), where:
           TSP = timestamped_data, timestamp_signatureTTA.
       If a Request message was sent (in step 1):
           timestamped_data = user_supplied_info, TTA-supplied_info, timestamp.
           timestamp _signatureTTA = SIGTTA(user_supplied_info, TTA_supplied_info,
                                     timestamp).
       If a Request message was not sent (in step 1), i.e., the TSP is broadcast:
           timestamped_data = TTA_supplied_info, timestamp.
           timestamp_signatureTTA = SIGTTA(TTA_supplied_info, timestamp),
       Note that the user_supplied_info is Null in the case of a broadcast TSP.
       If there is a mutual agreement between entity A and the TTA, the following
