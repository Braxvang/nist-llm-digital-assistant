An example of education is a degree program at a college or university. Some people take a course or
several courses to develop or enhance their skills in a particular discipline. This is training as opposed to
education. Many colleges and universities offer certificate programs, wherein a student may take two,
six, or eight classes, for example, in a related discipline, and is awarded a certificate upon completion.
Often, these certificate programs are conducted as a joint effort between schools and software or hardware
vendors. These programs are more characteristic of training than education. Those responsible for
security training need to assess both types of programs and decide which one better addresses identified
needs.

2.5   Professional Development

Professional development is intended to ensure that users, from beginner to the career security
professional, possess a required level of knowledge and competence necessary for their roles.
Professional development validates skills through certification. Such development and successful
certification can be termed “professionalization.” The preparatory work to testing for such a certification
normally includes study of a prescribed body of knowledge or technical curriculum, and may be
supplemented by on-the-job experience.

The movement toward professionalization within the IT security field can be seen among IT security
officers, IT security auditors, IT contractors, and system/network administrators, and is evolving. There
are two types of certification: general and technical. The general certification focuses on establishing a
foundation of knowledge on the many aspects of the IT security profession. The technical certification
focuses primarily on the technical security issues related to specific platforms, operating systems, vendor
products, etc.

Some agencies and organizations focus on IT security professionals with certifications as part of their
recruitment efforts. Other organizations offer pay raises and bonuses to retain users with certifications
and encourage others in the IT security field to seek certification.
