       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                                     Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

2761   Appendix E. Glossary
2762   adversary
2763   A malicious entity whose goal is to determine, to guess, or to influence the output of an RBG.

2764   approved
2765   An algorithm or technique for a specific cryptographic use that is specified in a FIPS or NIST Recommendation,
2766   adopted in a FIPS or NIST Recommendation, or specified in a list of NIST-approved security functions.

2767   backtracking resistance
2768   A property of a DRBG that provides assurance that compromising the current internal state of the DRBG does not
2769   weaken previously generated outputs. See SP 800-90A for a more complete discussion. (Contrast with prediction
2770   resistance.)

2771   biased
2772   A random variable is said to be biased if values of the finite sample space are selected with unequal probability.
2773   Contrast with unbiased.
2774   big-endian format
2775   A format in which the most significant bytes (the bytes containing the high-order or leftmost bits) are stored in the
2776   lowest address with the following bytes in sequentially higher addresses.

2777   bitstring
2778   An ordered sequence (string) of 0s and 1s. The leftmost bit is the most significant bit.

2779   block cipher
2780   A parameterized family of permutations on bitstrings of a fixed length; the parameter that determines the permutation
2781   is a bitstring called the key.

2782   conditioning function (external)
2783   As used in SP 800-90C, a deterministic function that is used to produce a bitstring with full entropy.

2784   consuming application
2785   An application that uses random outputs from an RBG.

2786   cryptographic boundary
2787   An explicitly defined physical or conceptual perimeter that establishes the physical and/or logical bounds of a
2788   cryptographic module and contains all of the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of a cryptographic
2789   module.

2790   cryptographic module
2791   The set of hardware, software, and/or firmware that implements cryptographic functions (including cryptographic
2792   algorithms and key generation) and is contained within the cryptographic boundary.

2793   deterministic random bit generator (DRBG)
2794   An RBG that produces random bitstrings by applying a deterministic algorithm to initial seed material.
2795   Note: A DRBG at least has access to a randomness source initially.
2796   Note: A portion of the seed material is secret.

2797   digitization
2798   The process of generating raw discrete digital values from non-deterministic events (e.g., analog noise sources) within
2799   a noise source.

2800   entropy
2801   A measure of disorder, randomness, or variability in a closed system.
