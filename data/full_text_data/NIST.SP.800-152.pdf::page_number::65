SP 800-152                                                  A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


An archive should support the FCKMS Security Policy (see Section 4.3) in archive facilities
and when moving keys and metadata to and from an archive. Archived keys and/or metadata
must be physically or cryptographically protected. Keys used to protect archived keys and/or
metadata will have cryptoperiods, and must be replaced when their cryptoperiods expire.
Changing an archive key may involve changing to a stronger cryptographic algorithm and
archive key, and re-encryption of the archived keys and/or metadata under the new archive
key and algorithm.

Maintaining a key and metadata archive could require moving archived keys and/or metadata
to new storage media when the old media are no longer readable because of the aging of, or
technical changes to, the media and media readers. When the archived keys and/or metadata
have been transferred to a new storage medium, the copies on the old storage medium must
be destroyed (see [SP 800-88]).

FR:6.50 The CKMS design shall specify how, where, and the circumstances under which
keys and/or their metadata are archived.

FR:6.51 The CKMS design shall specify the technique for the secure destruction of the key
and/or metadata or the secure destruction of the old storage medium after being written onto
a new storage medium.

FR:6.52 The CKMS design shall specify how keys and/or their metadata are protected after
the cryptoperiod of an archive key expires.

               SC-28       When keys and metadata are archived, a Federal CKMS shall
PR:6.46
                           provide them with the same integrity and confidentiality
                           protections as the operational copies of the keys and metadata
                           and at the same, or a higher, security strength.
                SI-12      When keys and metadata are archived, a Federal CKMS shall
PR:6.47
                           archive keys and metadata in accordance with applicable
                           laws, regulations, and policies.
                           When archived keys and metadata are moved to a new
PR:6.48
                           medium, a Federal CKMS shall destroy the copies of keys
                           and metadata on the old storage medium using approved
                           methods.

                           A Federal CKMS should archive long-term keys and
PA:6.12
                           metadata in accordance with [SP 800-57 Part 1].
                           A Federal CKMS should move archived keys and metadata
PA:6.13
                           to an alternate readable storage medium before the old
                           medium is replaced or becomes unreadable.

6.4.17 Recover a Key and/or Metadata
Key and/or metadata recovery involves obtaining a copy of a key and/or its metadata that has
been previously backed up or archived. The key and/or metadata must be recovered by an
