                                                GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



In addition to hardening software-based IDPS components and ensuring that all IDPS components are
fully up-to-date, administrators should perform additional actions to ensure that the IDPS components
themselves are secured appropriately. Examples include creating separate accounts for each IDPS user
and administrator, restricting network access to IDPS components, and ensuring that IDPS management
communications are protected appropriately. All encryption used for protection should be performed
using FIPS-approved encryption algorithms.

Administrators should maintain IDPSs on an ongoing basis. This should include monitoring the IDPS
components for operational and security issues, performing regular vulnerability assessments, responding
appropriately to vulnerabilities in the IDPS components, and testing and deploying IDPS software and
signature updates. Administrators should verify the integrity of updates before applying them, because
updates could have been inadvertently or intentionally altered or replaced. Administrators should test
software and signature updates before applying them, except for emergency situations. Administrators
should also back up configuration settings periodically and before applying software or signature updates
to ensure that existing settings are not inadvertently lost.
