information) to high. (National security information and national security systems are outside
the scope of this guideline.)

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Particularly in the case of passwords and
cryptographic keys, the provisional impact level recommended for information management
information depends on the sensitivity and criticality of system information and processes.
Although an individual organizationâ€™s IT infrastructure maintenance information type base may
include data elements that will require a higher rating, the recommended provisional impact is
low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of information management
information (e.g., configuration settings, passwords, authorization codes, cryptographic keying
material) can compromise the effectiveness of the system and impair agency operations. The
level of impact depends on the criticality of system functionality to the agency mission

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: The loss of integrity for some information
management information (e.g., encryption keys) can be very serious for agency operations and
can have serious consequences for public confidence in the agency. The integrity impact level
recommended for information management information associated with highly critical
information is high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: Potentially serious adverse effects can be expected in most
government organizations resulting from the unauthorized modification or deletion of
information management information. Therefore, the provisional integrity impact level
recommended for information management information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to information management
information. The effects of disruption of access to information management information may
temporarily impair agency operations. The level of impact depends on the sensitivity of the
information being managed and the criticality of the system to the agency mission. Except for
information needed by real-time processes (e.g., information that feeds real-time monitoring or
audit functions), information management processes are generally tolerant of reasonable
delays. In most cases, disruption of access to information management information can be
expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals. Not many business management systems perform functions for which loss of
availability can cause significant degradation in mission capability, place the agency at a
significant disadvantage, result in major damage to assets, or pose a threat to human life.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
information management information is low.
