SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


FR:8.15 The CKMS design shall specify the boundary protection mechanisms employed by
the CKMS.

FR:8.16 The CKMS design shall specify:

   a) The types of firewalls used and the protocols permitted through the firewalls,
      including the source and destination for each type of protocol; and

   b) The types of intrusion detection and prevention systems used, including their logging
      and security breach reaction capabilities.

FR:8.17 The CKMS design shall specify the methods used to protect the CKMS devices
against denial of service.

FR:8.18 The CKMS design shall specify how each method used protects against the denial
of service.

               AC-4        A networked Federal CKMS shall support the following
PR:8.19
              CA-3(1)      network security-control mechanisms unless exempted by its
                           FCKMS service-using organizations:
                             a) Firewalls,
                             b) Filtering routers,
                             c) Virtual private networks (VPNs),
                             d) Intrusion detection systems (IDS), and
                             e) Intrusion prevention systems (IPS).
                           A networked Federal CKMS shall install network security-
PR:8.20
                           control mechanisms in physically secure facilities.
               AC-3        A networked Federal CKMS shall allow only authorized
PR:8.21
                           entities to configure, initiate, activate, and disable network
                           security-control mechanisms.
                IA-3       For Moderate and High impact-level systems, a Federal
PR:8.22
                           CKMS shall support the identification and authentication of
                           each FCKMS module and device.
                SC-5       A Federal CKMS shall employ methods that minimize
PR:8.23
                           successful denial-of-service attacks and notify the FCKMS
                           management personnel if any such attempted attack is
                           detected.

                            For Low impact-level systems, a Federal CKMS should
PA:8.7
                            support the identification and authentication of each
                            FCKMS module and device.
