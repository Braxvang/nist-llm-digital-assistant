                                                                                 GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



      URL, such as https://www.organization.org/, but then redirect them to another URL, such as
      https://www.secure-organization.org/. A user redirected to https://www.secured-organization.org/
      may not notice the attack.

 Using Secure Connections (i.e., HTTPS) for Logins, which Allows Users to Verify that the
  Server Certificates are Valid and Associated with a Legitimate Web Site—Modern browsers will
  notify a user if the DNS name does not match the one provided by the certificate, but some pharming
  sites could have a legitimate certificate. 40

 Ensuring User Awareness of the Dangers of Pharming Attacks and How to Avoid Them—
  Pharming is a recent phenomenon; many users may not know to watch for pharming attacks.

 Verifying Third-Party Host Resolution—A number of vendors provide third-party Web browser
  plug-ins 41 that support matching the Internet Protocol (IP) address of a Web site against a previously
  verified “good” IP address, providing users with a warning if the Web site is suspicious.

 Using Pre-Shared Secrets—Pre-shared secrets can be used to prevent pharming attacks. A common
  implementation of pre-shared secrets is to have authorized users set up certain questions and answers
  that only they should know. In addition, the Web site provides each user with a specific image
  and/phrase that only it and the user knows. Subsequently, when a user logs in to the Web site, the
  user is asked one of the secret questions. If the user answers correctly, he or she is presented with the
  secret image/phrase and only then asked for a password. Since a pharming site would not know those
  pre-shared secrets and be able to respond accordingly, it should be recognizable as a malicious site.
  The main disadvantage of using pre-shared secrets is that user acceptance may be low because of the
  work involved to set up the secrets and log into a site. Moreover, some users might not recognize the
  missing data and use the pharming site anyway.

Many of the techniques used to prevent phishing attacks—particularly in commercial offerings—are
relevant to preventing pharming attacks. As with anti-phishing solutions, when contemplating anti-
pharming measures, it is important to consider the type of information being hosted on the Web site. Web
sites with little or no sensitive information may not need to implement more advanced or costly anti-
pharming measures. Web sites storing PII should strongly consider implementing more robust anti-
pharming measures. Requiring strong authentication can greatly reduce the risk of successful phishing
and pharming attacks.

6.4      Securing Active Content and Content Generation Technologies

In the early days of the Web, most sites presented textual, static HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
pages. No interactivity occurred between the user and Web site beyond the user clicking on hyperlinks.
Soon thereafter, various types of interactive elements were introduced that offered users new ways to

      In January 2001, VeriSign issued two Class 3 code-signing certificates to an individual claiming to be a Microsoft employee
      (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms01-017.mspx). With TLS certificates available at less than $20 with
      little or no background check, it is becoming increasingly easier for attackers to acquire valid TLS certificates. While it is
      possible for Certificate Authorities (CA) to revoke certificates, most browsers are not configured to perform certificate
      revocation list checking. Section 7.5 provides more information about TLS.

      A plug-in is a program that works in conjunction with a Web browser to enhance the browser’s capabilities. A browser
      typically prompts the user to download a new plug-in when content is encountered that requires functionality beyond the
      browser’s existing capabilities.
