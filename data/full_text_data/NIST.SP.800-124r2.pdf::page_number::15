NIST SP 800-124r2                                                   Guidelines for Managing the Security

This definition emphasizes portability, wireless communication, local storage, and long battery
life – all of which exist in modern smartphones and tablets. It is common for these systems to
have an always-on cellular connection, but this feature is not shared by all mobile devices. In
fact, many tablets lack a cellular modem yet still run a mobile OS. It is also not a requirement
that mobile devices run applications or apps, although this capability is commonplace.
Applications are used to expand a mobile device’s basic functionality.

       Mobile Device Characteristics
Commercially available mobile devices lack a unified set of features. Each feature and
characteristic has the potential to introduce new threats to security and privacy, so it is important
to establish a baseline understanding of the set of characteristics that are common to mobile
devices. The following list explores the baseline characteristics of a mobile device for the
purposes of this publication:
   •   Operating system: A mobile device comes with a rich OS that can be used in a variety of
       ways. This is the primary distinction between mobile devices and IoT devices, which
       typically do not have a full-fledged OS and have limited functionality.
   •   Small form factor: The size of a mobile device allows for easy portability.
   •   Self-contained power source: Mobile devices traditionally house a self-contained power
       source. Some mobile devices are capable of swapping out their battery power source for
       another.
   •   Physical port: A physical connection can be used to sync/transfer data or to charge the
       device. Some phones have wireless charging capabilities.
   •   Wireless network interface: Mobile devices have at least one wireless network interface
       for data communications, often offering connectivity to the internet or other data
       networks.
   •   Data storage: Mobile devices contain local, built-in, and non-removable data storage.
   •   Apps: A mobile device ships with native apps to handle common operations. Beyond
       native apps, most mobile devices also support third-party apps, which usually add
       functionality and significantly expand a device’s utility.
   •   Management capability: Mobile devices include a consistent way to manage the device
       via application programming interfaces (APIs) or proprietary mechanisms.
The following details other common characteristics of mobile devices. These features do not
define the scope of devices included in the publication but rather indicate features that are
particularly important in terms of security. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list.
   •   Network services: A mobile device may come with additional networking capabilities,
       such as Bluetooth, WiFi, near-field communications (NFC), and cellular data and voice
       (e.g., 4G LTE or 5G).
   •   Camera: Mobile devices may use one or more digital cameras that are capable of
       capturing photos and video recordings. Cameras also accept biometric input to unlock a
