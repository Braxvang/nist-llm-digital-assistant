NIST SP 800-58                                              Voice Over IP Security
_____________________________________________________________________________

       Packets must arrive at their destination and they must arrive fast. Of course the
       packets must also be secure during their travels, thus the introduction of VOIPsec.
       However, the price of this security is a decisive drop in QoS caused by a number
       of factors.

       A 2002 study by researchers at the University of Milan [8] focused on the effect
       of VOIPsec on various QoS issues and on the use of header compression as a
       solution to these problems. They studied several codecs, encryption algorithms,
       and traffic patterns to garner a broad description of these effects. Their results are
       an integral part of the next few sections.

       Some empirical results developed by Cisco are available as well [31]
       − Delay
             o Processing—PCM to G.729 to packet
             o Encryption — ESP encapsulation + 3DES
             o Serialization — time it takes to get a packet out of the router, each
                 “hop” generally has fixed delay.
                        IPsec overhead: about 40 bytes (depending configuration)
                        IP header: 20 bytes
                        UDP + RTP headers: 20 bytes
                        RTP header compression: 3 bytes for IP+UDP+RTP
       − Effects on 8 kbps CODEC (voice data: 20 bytes)
             o clear text voice has an overhead of 3 bytes, which suggests required
                 bandwidth of approximately 9 kbps
             o IPsec encrypted voice: overhead 80 bytes and required bandwidth 40
                 kbps

 8.5   Encryption / Decryption Latency

       The studies performed by Barbieri et al. revealed the cryptographic engine as a
       bottleneck for voice traffic transmitted over IPsec. The driving factor in the
       degraded performance produced by the cryptography was the scheduling
       algorithms in the crypto-engine itself, which will be covered in Section 8.6.
       However, there still was significant latency due to the actual encryption and
       decryption. Barbieri et al. set up a controlled experiment to measure the effect of
       encryption and decryption on throughput. They tested four cryptographic
       algorithms on a fully VOIP dedicated network with a 100Mbps link (to negate
       saturation issues) using the same traffic in plain form as a benchmark. The
       algorithms tested were (in increasing order of computational expense) DES,
       3DES, NULL (no encryption) + SHA-1, and 3DES + SHA-1. The results showed
       that the computationally lighter algorithms achieved better throughput than the
       more expensive ones. The disparities between each of the algorithms represent
       the relative latencies associated with the computational time for each algorithm.
       The range in throughput is significant, with a difference of approximately 500
       packets per second between DES and 3DES + SHA-1 at a high traffic volume.
