GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES




SAMPLE SCENARIO

D-Day
0900: The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) issues an alert indicating the
presence of what is thought to be an advanced computer worm. US-CERT estimates that the worm has
already infected over 500,000 computers worldwide in only 2 hours, prompting the center to warn that the
worm’s spread has the potential to disrupt business and personal use of the Internet for applications such
as electronic commerce, e-mail, and entertainment. U.S. intelligence agencies link the worm’s release as
a response to U.S. military deployments and fear the attack may have been designed specifically to
disrupt communications between agencies supporting the military deployment.
Intrusions into numerous Federal Web sites have been reported in recent hours. Hackers, who
government officials believe to be associated with hostile nations, have successfully compromised the
security of various U.S. Government information systems. Anti-government vandalism has also been
reported on numerous department and agency Web sites.

[Insert organization/data center name] is currently in the process of responding to the effects of the worm
and defending against further electronic intrusions.

1000: As a result of credible threats of imminent terrorism and the fear that ongoing electronic intrusions
against Federal information systems may be part of a concerted information warfare attack, the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) raises the Homeland Security Advisory System threat condition
from an Orange “High” to a Red “Severe” risk of terrorist attack.

1200: A freight train pulling numerous tanker cars passes slowly through the center of the city. Some of
the tankers are carrying methyl isocyanate (MIC), a highly explosive chemical used in the production of
pesticides. As the train passes the [insert name of organization’s facility], one of the tanker cars erupts in
a violent explosion. The blast collapses a portion of the building and results in power outages in the
immediate vicinity. Many personnel in the [insert name of organization’s facility] are killed or injured.

The [insert data center name] survived the blast and emergency power was engaged for critical IT
systems. Several data center personnel had recently left the center for lunch and their well-being is
unknown at this time. Management has directed that the data center implement contingency plans and
relocate to their alternate computing facility. In addition to restoring essential data center operations at
the alternate facility, management indicates that defending [insert organization name] from further
electronic intrusions remains a priority.

D-Day Plus 1
1000: Intelligence and law enforcement agencies continue to track numerous threats against the United
States. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) notifies Government agencies of documented threats of
further attacks against Federal departments and agencies throughout the United States. One such notice to
[insert organization name] includes a report of possible terrorist surveillance activities outside the
organization’s alternate computing facility. As a result, management directs that data center personnel
explore options to move operations to a backup alternate facility in the event that the threat is found to be
credible.
