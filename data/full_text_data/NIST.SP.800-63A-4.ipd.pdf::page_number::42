       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                                  Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1122      2. validating the accuracy of self-asserted attributes by comparison with authoritative
1123         or credible sources
1124   For added assurance, the CSP SHALL evaluate the core attributes, as validated by various
1125   sources, for overall consistency.

1126   5.4.4. Identity Veriﬁcation Requirements
1127   5.4.4.1. Remote Identity Prooﬁng
1128   The CSP SHALL verify the binding of the applicant to the claimed identity by one of the
1129   following:
1130      1. Comparison of a collected biometric characteristic, such as a facial image, to the
1131         associated reference biometric contained on a piece of presented SUPERIOR or
1132         STRONG evidence
1133      2. Demonstrated association with a digital account through an AAL2 authentication or
1134         an AAL2 and FAL2 federation protocol

1135   5.4.4.2. In-person Identity Prooﬁng
1136   The CSP SHALL verify the binding of the applicant to the claimed identity by physical or
1137   biometric comparison of the facial image of the applicant to the facial portrait contained
1138   on a piece of presented SUPERIOR or STRONG evidence.

1139   5.4.5. Notiﬁcation of Prooﬁng Requirement
1140   Upon the successful completion of identity proofing at IAL2, the CSP SHALL send a
1141   notification of proofing to a validated address for the applicant, as specified in Sec. 5.1.7.

1142   5.5. Identity Assurance Level 3
1143   IAL3 adds additional rigor to the steps required at IAL2 and is subject to additional and
1144   specific processes (including the use of biometric information comparison, collection,
1145   and retention) to further protect the identity and RP from impersonation, fraud, or other
1146   significantly harmful damages. In addition, identity proofing at IAL3 is performed in
1147   person (to include supervised remote identity proofing defined in Sec. 5.5.8).

1148   5.5.1. Automated Attack Prevention
1149   The CSP SHALL implement a means to prevent automated attacks on the identity
1150   proofing process. Acceptable means include, but are not limited to: bot detection,
1151   mitigation, and management solutions; behavioral analytics; web application firewall
1152   settings; and traffic analysis.
