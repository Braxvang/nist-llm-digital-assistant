________________________________________________________________________________________________


Risk assessments can also inform other risk management activities across the three tiers that are
not security-related. For example, at Tier 1, risk assessments can provide useful inputs to: (i)
operational risk determinations (including business continuity for organizational missions and
business functions); (ii) organizational risk determinations (including financial risk, compliance
risk, regulatory risk, reputation risk, and cumulative acquisition risk across large-scale projects);
and (iii) multiple-impact risk (including supply chain risk and risk involving partnerships). At
Tier 2, risk assessments can provide the same useful inputs to operational, organizational, and
multiple-impact risks, specific to mission/business processes. At Tier 3, risk assessments can
inform assessments of cost, schedule, and performance risks associated with information systems,
with information security experts coordinating with program managers, information system
owners, and authorizing officials. This type of coordination is essential within organizations in
order to eliminate silos and/or stove-piped activities that produce less than optimal or inefficient
information technology and security solutions—thus affecting the ability of organizations to carry
out assigned missions/business functions with maximum efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

It is important to note that information security risk contributes to non-security risks at each tier.
Thus, the results of a risk assessment at a given tier serve as inputs to, and are aligned with, non-
security risk management activities at that tier. 35 In addition, the results of risk assessments at
lower tiers serve as inputs to risk assessments at higher tiers. Risks can arise on different time
scales (e.g., the disclosure of information about current organizational operations can compromise
the effectiveness of those operations immediately, while the disclosure of strategic planning
information can compromise future operational capabilities). Risk response decisions can also
take effect in different time frames (e.g., changes in organizational policies or investment
strategies can sometimes require years to take effect, while configuration changes in an individual
system can often be implemented immediately). In general, the risk management process tends to
move more slowly at Tiers 1 and 2 than at Tier 3. This is due to how organizations typically
respond to risks that potentially affect widespread organizational operations and assets—where
such risk responses may need to address systemic or institutional issues. However, some Tier 1
decisions (e.g., newly discovered threats or vulnerabilities requiring the implementation of an
organization-wide mandate for mitigation) can involve immediate action.

2.4.1    Risk Assessments at the Organizational Tier
At Tier 1, risk assessments support organizational strategies, policies, guidance, and processes for
managing risk. Risk assessments conducted at Tier 1 focus on organizational operations, assets,
and individuals—comprehensive assessments across mission/business lines. For example, Tier 1
risk assessments may address: (i) the specific types of threats directed at organizations that may
be different from other organizations and how those threats affect policy decisions; (ii) systemic
weaknesses or deficiencies discovered in multiple organizational information systems capable of
being exploited by adversaries; (iii) the potential adverse impact on organizations from the loss or
compromise of organizational information (either intentionally or unintentionally); and (iv) the
use of new information and computing technologies such as mobile and cloud and the potential
effect on the ability of organizations to successfully carry out their missions/business operations
while using those technologies. Organization-wide assessments of risk can be based solely on the
assumptions, constraints, risk tolerances, priorities, and trade-offs established in the risk framing
step (i.e., derived primarily from Tier 1 activities). However, more realistic and meaningful risk
assessments are based on assessments conducted across multiple mission/business lines (i.e.,
derived primarily from Tier 2 activities). The ability of organizations to effectively use Tier 2 risk

guidance on integrating information security into the Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) process.
