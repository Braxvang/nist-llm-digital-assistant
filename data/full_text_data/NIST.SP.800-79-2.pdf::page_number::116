                     MP(DC)-17 If the Derived PIV Authentication private key was created DPCI – LOA   [SP 800-157], Section 2.3 –
                     (NEW)     and stored on a hardware cryptographic token that does 4 Only          Maintenance
                               not permit the user to export the private key, then
                               termination of the Derived PIV Credential is performed
                               by collecting and either zeroizing the private key or
                               destroying the token. Otherwise, termination is
                               performed by revoking the Derived PIV Authentication
                               certificate.

                                  Assessment
                                  Determine that:
                                    (i) the issuer has developed and follows compliant
                                        processes to terminate Derived PIV Credentials
                                        (review, observe).

                     MP(DC)-18 A Derived PIV Credential issuer can issue a Derived PIV DPCI           [SP 800-157], Section 2.4 –
                     (NEW)     Credential to an Applicant only if it has access to                    Linkage with PIV Card
                               information about the Applicant’s PIV Card from the
                               issuer of the PIV Card. The Derived PIV Credential
                               issuer shall have a mechanism to periodically check with
                               the PIV Card issuer to determine if the PIV Card has
                               been terminated or if information about the individual that
                               will appear in the Derived PIV Credential (e.g., name)
                               has changed, as these would require revocation or
                               modification of the Derived PIV Credential.
                               Assessment
                               Determine that:
                                   (i) the issuer has developed procedures for updating
                                       the link between the Derived PIV Credentials data
                                       and the PIV Card when a new PIV Card is issued
                                       (review);
                                  (ii) The issuer implements and maintains one or
                                       more mechanisms to update the linkage between
                                       the Derived PIV Credential and a PIV Card as a
                                       result of a new PIV Card issuance (review,
                                       observe, test).
