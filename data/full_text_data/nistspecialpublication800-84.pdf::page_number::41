                               GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



 Design. The TT&E program coordinator works with a test design team to design the event.
  Several factors can affect the design of the test, including the form (component, system, or
  comprehensive), the organizational entities involved, and the scope of the test. The major steps in
  the event design process are as follows:

    –   Determine the test scope based on current system or security requirements and any potential
        compliance or regulatory requirements

    –   Identify the objectives of the test

    –   Determine which assessment tools and procedures are needed to accomplish the test

    –   Identify the individuals that should participate in the test and notify them of when it will
        occur

    –   Identify the staff for the test, including a test director and one or more data collectors

    –   Coordinate the logistics for the test event.
 Development. The design team creates the documentation to be used before, during, and after
  the test event. Typical documentation includes briefings, a test guide, test plans, and an after
  action report. For some tests, especially comprehensive tests, materials similar to those used for
  functional exercises, such as a scenario, MSEL, and message injects may also be needed.
 Conduct. The locations for tests vary based on the type of test being conducted and the test’s
  scope. For example, a small component test could be conducted in a single office, while a
  comprehensive test of components and systems for an IT plan could involve many different parts
  of an organization in various locations. During a test, the mission of the organization should not
  be disrupted to the extent that the organization can no longer function and provide the services
  that it was created to provide. The test director should monitor all tests closely, and if there is any
  sign of a possible catastrophic disruption, or the safety of an individual is at stake or the security
  of the organization or its data is in question, the test director and any other member of the test
  staff should have the ability to terminate the test immediately. After the test concludes, the test
  director and data collectors should conduct an informal test debrief, requesting feedback from
  everyone present.
 Evaluation. The comments from the debrief, along with lessons learned during the test, should
  be captured in an after action report. The report should include background information about the
  test, documented observations made by the test staff, and recommendations for enhancing the IT
  plan that had its components or systems tested. Outcomes of the evaluation could include
  updating the IT plan or other security-related documents, briefing managers on the results, and
  performing other actions.
