       NIST SP 800-217 ipd                         Guidelines for PIV Federation (Initial Public Draft)
       January 2023


1007   The IdP MAY provide a provisioning API to the RP, subject to a trust agreement. When
1008   a provisioning API is used, the trust agreement SHALL include a justification for the
1009   intended use of all attributes provided to the RP by the provisioning API.

1010   6.6. Identity Proxies and Brokers
1011   An identity proxy acting in a PIV federation context SHALL disclose the IdPs used
1012   as sources of attributes to the downstream RP. For example, if an assertion contains
1013   attributes for a PIV identity account from IdP A and IdP B, the proxy will list both IdPs as
1014   sources within the assertion. Note that the proxy, in its role as an IdP to downstream RPs,
1015   is still the issuer of the assertion and will identify itself as such.
1016   See Sec. 3.3 for more information about the trust agreement requirements of identity
1017   proxies.
