5.3.1.2.       Cloud Architecture
The cloud solution is an alternative to the on-prem architecture that allows mobile security
technologies to be hosted external from the local enterprise network. When using the cloud
solution, the mobile security technology provider gives the enterprise the ability to use its
applications, which are run on a cloud infrastructure. This is also known as SaaS, and mobile
security and management services are delivered via the internet to the enterprise [24].
Cloud-based EMM deployments are often easier to set up and begin using. They involve signing
up for web-based services, and users are quickly taken to the primary dashboard after purchase.
The most difficult aspects of setup are joining the EMM to an active directory service and
proving that the email domain being used actually belongs to the company. The EMM vendor
often provides unique information that must be placed into DNS and can then be externally
checked. Another benefit of the SaaS model is that problems or issues can be more easily
addressed by the vendor since they have access to the EMM instance and underlying platform.
Finally, with this model, the enterprise data resides outside of the traditional enterprise, much
like the mobile devices that the EMMs manage. This is often a key factor in organizations
deciding not to use this model. Below is a sample architecture that demonstrates a cloud-based
mobile enterprise architecture (e.g., MDM server, app vetting server, MTD solution).
