       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                       Authentication and Lifecycle Management


1735   6.1.3. Binding to a Subscriber-provided Authenticator
1736   A subscriber may already possess authenticators suitable for authentication at a particular
1737   AAL. For example, they may have a two-factor authenticator from a social network
1738   provider, considered AAL2 and IAL1, and would like to use those credentials at an RP
1739   that requires IAL2.
1740   CSPs SHOULD , where practical, accommodate the use of subscriber-provided
1741   authenticators in order to relieve the burden to the subscriber of managing a large
1742   number of authenticators. Binding of these authenticators SHALL be done as described
1743   in Sec. 6.1.2. In situations where the authenticator strength is not self-evident (e.g.,
1744   between single-factor and multi-factor authenticators of a given type), the CSP SHALL
1745   assume the use of the weaker authenticator unless it is able to establish that the stronger
1746   authenticator is in fact being used (e.g., by verification with the issuer or manufacturer of
1747   the authenticator).

1748   6.1.4. Renewal
1749   The subscriber SHOULD bind a new or updated authenticator an appropriate amount of
1750   time before an existing authenticatorâ€™s expiration. The process for this SHOULD conform
1751   closely to the binding process for an additional authenticator described in Sec. 6.1.2.1.
1752   The CSP MAY periodically take other actions, such as reconfirming address of record,
1753   either as a part of the renewal process or separately. Following successful use of the
1754   replacement authenticator, the CSP MAY invalidate the authenticator that is expiring.

1755   6.2. Loss, Theft, Damage, and Unauthorized Duplication
1756   Compromised authenticators include those that have been lost, stolen, or subject
1757   to unauthorized duplication. Generally, one must assume that a lost authenticator
1758   has been stolen or compromised by someone that is not the legitimate subscriber of
1759   the authenticator. Damaged or malfunctioning authenticators are also considered
1760   compromised to guard against any possibility of extraction of the authenticator secret.
1761   One notable exception is a memorized secret that has been forgotten without other
1762   indications of having been compromised, such as having been obtained by an attacker.
1763   Suspension, revocation, or destruction of compromised authenticators SHOULD occur as
1764   promptly as practical following detection. Organizations SHOULD establish time limits
1765   for this process.
1766   To facilitate secure reporting of the loss, theft, or damage to an authenticator, the
1767   CSP SHOULD provide the subscriber with a method of authenticating to the CSP
1768   using a backup or alternate authenticator. This backup authenticator SHALL be either
1769   a memorized secret or a physical authenticator. Either could be used, but only one
1770   authentication factor is required to make this report. Alternatively, the subscriber MAY
1771   establish an authenticated protected channel to the CSP and verify information collected
1772   during the proofing process. The CSP MAY choose to verify an address of record (i.e.,

                                                    46
