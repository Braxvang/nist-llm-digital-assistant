5.      Log Management Operational Processes

System-level and infrastructure administrators should follow standard processes for managing the logs for
which they are responsible. This section describes the major operational processes for log management,
which are as follows:

       Configure the log sources, including log generation, storage, and security
       Perform analysis of log data
       Initiate appropriate responses to identified events
       Manage the long-term storage of log data.
This section describes each of these processes and provides guidance on performing them. It also
provides a brief discussion of other operational processes that system-level and infrastructure
administrators should perform. The section also describes the need to perform regular audits of log
management operations. The guidance in this section is based on the assumption that an organization has
already designed and deployed one or more log management infrastructures.

5.1     Configure Log Sources

System-level administrators need to configure log sources so that they capture the necessary information
in the desired format and locations, as well as retain the information for the appropriate period of time.
Configuring log sources is often a complex process. First, administrators need to determine which of
their hosts and host components must or should participate in the log management infrastructure, based
on the organization’s policies. A single log file might contain information from several sources, such as
an OS log containing information from the OS itself and several security software programs and
applications. Administrators should ascertain which log sources use each log file.52

Next, for each identified log source, administrators need to determine which types of events each log
source must or should log, as well as which data characteristics must or should be logged for each type of
event. 53 The administrator’s ability to configure each log source is dependent on the features offered by
that particular type of log source. For example, some log sources offer very granular configuration
options, while some offer no granularity at all—logging is simply enabled or disabled, with no control
over what is logged. This section discusses log source configuration in three categories: log generation,
log storage and disposal, and log security.

5.1.1     Log Generation

Assuming that a log source offers configuration options, it is generally prudent to be conservative when
selecting initial logging settings.54 A single setting could cause an enormous number of log entries to be
recorded, or far too much information to be logged for each event. Excessive logging can cause loss of
log data, as well as operational problems such as system slowdowns or even denial of service conditions.
System-level administrators need to consider the likely effect of the log source configuration not only on


52
      In some cases, it may be very difficult to identify all the log sources without running the host in a production environment
      and monitoring the actual logs.
53
      For common host implementations that use security configuration checklists, organizations should find it effective to modify
      the checklists to include log source configuration.
54
      This is most applicable to the first days of logging for a source. Conservative settings should only be used for an extended
      period if the use of less conservative settings would cause serious problems.
