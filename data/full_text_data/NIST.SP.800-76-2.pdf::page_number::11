1.4.2         Inclusion of iris recognition
Iris specifications are included, in Section 6, to support biometric authentication of individuals. [FIPS] allows use of
iris for this purpose. The recommendation to agencies to install and operate iris equipment in its PIV issuance
processes allows agencies to additionally populate PIV Cards with iris as an alternative authentication modality. [FIPS]
requires the cardholder to enter a PIN number to release the templates. When the card is cryptographically
authenticated, this constitutes multi-factor authentication.

1.4.3         Inclusion of fingerprint on-card comparison
[FIPS] requires fingerprint templates of Section 4 as the mandatory biometric element for PIV. These templates are
intended to be compared on a reader device with templates collected in an authentication attempt. [FIPS] requires
the cardholder to enter a PIN number to release the templates. When the card is cryptographically authenticated,
this constitutes multi-factor authentication.
Agencies may additionally choose to populate the card with an on-card comparison algorithm, and on-card
comparison templates. The specifications for these appear in Section 5. [FIPS] does not require PIN entry ahead of a
fingerprint minutiae on-card comparison transaction. Indeed, [FIPS] extends on-card comparison as an alternative to
PIN entry in altering the security state of the PIV Card.
Agencies should consider economics of on vs. off card comparison. Particularly, a security flaw, for example, in a card
may have different remediation cost than in a card reader.
Table 1 describes the differences between the off-card and on-card specifications.

1.5       Relation to other biometric applications
                                                                                      3
[FIPS] advances a PIV concept of biometric operations that is three-factor : A PIN verification is required before
biometric data is read from the PIV Card and matched in a 1:1 mode during authentication. In other programs,
biometrics are sometimes stored on a central server, or read from a card and cached on one. In others, the biometric
is matched in a one-to-many mode without presentation of a card to claim an identity. There are tradeoffs with such
approaches.
