3.9.6    UDDI and WSDL

While UDDI provides a registry for searching for and automatically connecting to Web services, there is
no mechanism for describing how to connect to candidate services. This is done through the WSDL
document. A Web service’s WSDL document is referenced through the bindingTemplate and tModel
data structures. 53

When publishing a Web service, a UDDI publisher must make certain that there is a tModel associated
with the WSDL for the Web service being published. These are referred to as wsdlSpec tModels.
wsdlSpec tModels allow inquirers to locate Web services that correspond to the same published WSDL
document. For example, there are standard WSDL specifications for UDDI and NCES services, but there
may be multiple Web services that implement them.

tModels are referenced from the bindingTemplate data structure by providing a tModelInstanceInfo entry
for each tModel that corresponds to the service’s WSDL document. A tModel provides the location to a
Web service’s WSDL document, but the bindingTemplate’s accessPoint element specifies the location of
the Web service itself. UDDI allows for Web services and WSDL documents to be in separate locations.

Once the requester receives the WSDL document for the candidate Web service, it must be validated.
The simplest method for doing this is to provide a digital signature of the WSDL document for the
requester to use. WSDL v1.1 does not provide an internal mechanism for signing WSDL documents.
Until such a mechanism is available, the candidate Web service should provide an external signature for
the WSDL document or the requester should independently verify via out-of-band communications that
the site providing the WSDL document is a trusted entity.

Requesters cannot connect to most providers without some form of authentication. WSDL v1.1 does not
provide a method for specifying the security requirements of a Web service. Future versions of WSDL
are slated to have this feature. At the moment, the requesting Web service must use some external
method for determining what authentication requirements a candidate service has. This can be done using
tModels.

In a UDDI registry, a bindingTemplate structure can hold zero or more references to tModels. tModels
are used to represent the different WSDL service interfaces, but may be used to reference other metadata
related to the Web service.

Because tModels are used to describe the particular interfaces and behavior of a Web service, an
additional unique tModel could be developed for each method of authentication that Web services in the
registry may use. When a requesting Web service sees this tModel, the requester will know what
methods of authentication the candidate Web service requires. This approach is implemented for the
NCES service discovery services.

3.10 Summary

Web service security standards are developed and maintained by several different organizations: W3C,
OASIS, Liberty Alliance, and an industry forum headed by Microsoft and IBM. Some industry forum
specifications, such as WS-Security, are submitted to OASIS for maintenance and acceptance as a
standard. In contrast, other industry forum specifications directly conflict with OASIS or W3C standards,
like the WS-Reliability and WS-ReliableMessaging standards. Where such conflicts exist, one or more of
