system. The full functional test should include all ISCP points of contact and be facilitated by an outside
or impartial observer. A formal test plan is developed prior to the functional test, and test procedures are
developed to include key sections of the ISCP, including the following:
        Notification procedures;
        System recovery on an alternate platform from backup media;
        Internal and external connectivity; and
        Reconstitution procedures.

Results of the test are documented in an After Action Report, and Lessons Learned are developed for
updating information in the ISCP.

NOTE: Full functional tests of systems normally are failover tests to the alternate locations, and may be
very disruptive to system operations if not planned well. Other systems located in the same physical
location may be affected by or included in the full functional test. It is highly recommended that several
functional tests be conducted and evaluated prior to conducting a full functional (failover) test.

Examples of functional tests that may be performed prior to a full functional test include:
        Full notification and response of key personnel to recovery location;
        Recovery of a server or database from backup media; and
        Setup and processing from a server at an alternate location.

The following is a sample of a yearly test and maintenance schedule for a high-impact system:

APPENDIX K ASSOCIATED PLANS AND PROCEDURES

NOTE: Information for this section should be available from the system’s System Security Plan (SSP) and
can be copied from the SSP, or reference the applicable section in the SSP and attach the latest version of
the SSP to this contingency plan. ISCPs for other systems that either interconnect or support the system
should be identified in this appendix. The most current version of the ISCP, location of ISCP, and
primary point of contact (such as the ISCP Coordinator) should be noted.
