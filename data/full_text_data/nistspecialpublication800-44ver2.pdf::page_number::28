                                                                            GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



 Controls—This section of the plan describes the control measures (in place or planned) that are
  intended to meet the protection requirements of the information system. Controls fall into three
  general categories:

       Management controls, which focus on the management of the computer security system and the
          management of risk for a system.

       Operational controls, which are primary implemented and executed by people (rather than
          systems). They often require technical or specialized expertise, and often rely upon management
          activities as well as technical controls.

       Technical controls, which are security mechanisms that the computer system employs. The
          controls can provide automated protection from unauthorized access or misuse, facilitate
          detection of security violations, and support security requirements for applications and data. The
          implementation of technical controls, however, always requires significant operational
          considerations and should be consistent with the management of security within the organization
          [NIST06a]. 14

3.5     Human Resources Requirements

The greatest challenge and expense in developing and securely maintaining a public Web server is
providing the necessary human resources to adequately perform the required functions. Many
organizations fail to fully recognize the amount of expense and skills required to field a secure public
Web server. This failure often results in overworked employees and insecure systems. From the initial
planning stages, organizations need to determine the necessary human resource requirements.
Appropriate and sufficient human resources are the single most important aspect of effective Web server
security. Organizations should also consider the fact that, in general, technical solutions are not a
substitute for skilled and experienced personnel.

When considering the human resource implications of developing and deploying a Web server,
organizations should consider the following:

 Required Personnel—What types of personnel are required? This would include such positions as
  system and Web server administrators, Webmasters, network administrators, and ISSOs.

 Required Skills—What are the required skills to adequately plan, develop, and maintain the Web
  server in a secure manner? Examples include OS administration, network administration, active
  content expertise, and programming.

 Available Personnel—What are the available human resources within the organization? In addition,
  what are their current skill sets and are they sufficient for supporting the Web server? Often, an
  organization discovers that its existing human resources are not sufficient and needs to consider the
  following options:

       Train Current Staff—If there are personnel available but they do not have the requisite skills, the
          organization may choose to train the existing staff in the skills required. Although this is an
          excellent option, the organization should ensure that employees meet all prerequisites for training.
