NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                             Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                    Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


       parameter and instantiate process step 2 are omitted, and the prediction_resistance_flag is
       omitted from the internal state in step 11 of the instantiate process. In addition, step 6 can
       be modified to not perform a check for the prediction_resistance_flag when the flag is
       not used in an implementation; in this case, the Get_entropy_input call need not include
       the prediction_resistance_request parameter.
   3. personalization_string: An optional input that provides personalization information (see
      Sections 8.6.1 and 8.7.1). The maximum length of the personalization string
      (max_personalization_string_length) is implementation dependent, but shall be less than
      or equal to the maximum length specified for the given DRBG mechanism (see Section
      10). If the input of a personalization string is not supported, then the
      personalization_string input parameter and step 3 of the instantiate process are omitted,
      and instantiate process step 9 is modified to omit the personalization string.
Required information not provided by the consuming application during instantiation
(This information shall not be provided by the consuming application as an input parameter
during the instantiate request):
   1. entropy_input: Input bits containing entropy. The maximum length of the entropy_input
      is implementation dependent, but shall be less than or equal to the specified maximum
      length for the selected DRBG mechanism (see Section 10).
   2. nonce: A nonce as specified in Section 8.6.7. Note that if a random value is used in the
      nonce, the entropy_input and random portion of the nonce could be acquired using a
      single Get_entropy_input call (see step 6 of the instantiate process); in this case, the
      first parameter of the Get_entropy_input call is adjusted to include the entropy for the
      nonce (i.e., the security_strength is increased by at least Â½ security_strength, and min-
      length is increased to accommodate the length of the nonce), instantiate process step 8 is
      omitted, and the nonce is omitted from the parameter list in instantiate process step 9.
       Note that in some cases, a nonce will not be used by a DRBG mechanism; in this case,
       step 8 is omitted, and the nonce is omitted from the parameter list in instantiate process
       step 9.
Output to a consuming application after instantiation:
   1. status: The status returned from the instantiate function. If any status other than
      SUCCESS is returned, either no state_handle or an invalid state_handle shall be returned
      to the consuming application. A consuming application should check the status to
      determine that the DRBG has been correctly instantiated.
   2. state_handle: Used to identify the internal state for this instantiation in subsequent calls
      to the generate, reseed, uninstantiate and health test functions.
       If a state handle is not required for an implementation because the implementation does
       not support multiple simultaneous instantiations, a state_handle need not be returned. In
       this case, instantiate process step 10 is omitted, process step 11 is revised to save the only
       internal state, and process step 12 is altered to omit the state_handle.
Information retained within the DRBG mechanism boundary after instantiation:
