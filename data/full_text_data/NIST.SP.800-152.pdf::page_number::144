SP 800-152                                              A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


Penetration testing       Testing that verifies the extent to which a system, device or
                          process resists active attempts to compromise its security.
Personal accountability   A policy that requires that every person who accesses
                          sensitive information be held accountable for his or her
                          actions. A method for identity authentication is required.
Personnel-security        The accidental or intentional action of any person that reduces
compromise                the security of the FCKMS and/or compromises any of its
                          keys and sensitive metadata.
Physical-security         The unauthorized access to sensitive data, hardware, and/or
compromise                software by physical means.
Pre-activation state      A lifecycle state of a key in which the key has been created,
                          but is not yet authorized for use.
Primary facility          An FCKMS facility that houses a primary system.
Primary system            An FCKMS module that is currently active. Contrast with
                          Backup (system).
Private key               A cryptographic key used by a public-key (asymmetric)
                          cryptographic algorithm that is uniquely associated with an
                          entity and is not made public.
Profile (for a CKMS)      A document that provides an implementation-independent
                          specification of CKMS security requirements for use by a
                          community of interest (e.g., U.S. Government, banking,
                          health, or aerospace).
Profile (for an FCKMS)    The specifications for Federal CKMSs in SP 800-152,
                          including the requirements for their design, implementation,
                          procurement, installation, configuration, management,
                          operation, and use by Federal organizations and their
                          contractors
Profile augmentations     The properties or characteristics that are recommended, but
                          not required, by this Profile for FCKMSs.
Profile features          The properties or characteristics that could be used by
                          FCKMSs, but are not required or recommended by this
                          Profile.
Profile requirements      The properties or characteristics that shall be exhibited in
                          FCKMSs in order to conform to, or comply with, this Profile.
Public key                A cryptographic key used by a public-key (asymmetric)
                          cryptographic algorithm that may be made public.
Registration agent        An FCKMS role that is responsible for registering new
                          entities and perhaps other selected information.
