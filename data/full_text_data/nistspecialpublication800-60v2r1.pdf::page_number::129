Table D-2 includes provisional impact assessments for each mission information type or
delivery mode represented in Table D-1. In Table D-2, exceptions to provisional impact
assignments are identified by displaying impact assignments in a gray font [gray font] and
are described as applicable by security objective in the information type descriptions to
follow. The specific descriptions are provided under the sub-heading “Special Factors
Affecting [Security Objective] Impact Determination.


                                             Implementation Tip
            The impact levels assigned to several information types should be
            considered context-dependent. For example, a given information type in
            some agencies may include information elements, the compromise of
            which may endanger human life. In other agencies, the same information
            type may not include such elements.


Many of the information types are also lifecycle-dependent. That is, information that requires
protection at one stage in the system development process may be publicly accessible at a later
stage or following some event. For example, information that has confidentiality attributes
during the period that an agency is using it to make a decision may be public knowledge once the
decision has been made (e.g., financial/budgetary information used during development of
requests for proposals in procurement actions).

The following sections describe information attributes that affect impact assessment for each
information type.

   Where foreign intelligence information is involved, the information and information systems are categorized as
   national security information or systems and are outside the scope of this guideline.
