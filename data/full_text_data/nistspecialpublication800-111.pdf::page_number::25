                                             GUIDE TO STORAGE ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES FOR END USER DEVICES



4.    Storage Encryption Technology Planning and Implementation

This section discusses considerations for planning and implementing storage encryption technologies for
end user devices. As with any new technology deployment, storage encryption technology planning and
implementation should be addressed in a phased approach. A successful deployment can be achieved by
following a clear, step-by-step planning and implementation process. The use of a phased approach for
deployment can minimize unforeseen issues and identify potential pitfalls early in the process. This
model also allows for incorporating advances in new technology and adapting the technology to the ever-
changing enterprise. The following is an example of planning and implementation phases:

1. Identify Needs. The first phase involves identifying the needs to encrypt storage on end user
   devices, determining which devices and data need protection, and identifying related requirements
   (e.g., minimum performance). This phase also involves determining how that need can best be met
   (e.g., FDE, virtual disk encryption) and deciding where and how the security should be implemented.

2. Design the Solution. The second phase involves all facets of designing the solution. Examples
   include architectural considerations, authentication methods, cryptography policy, and supporting
   security controls.

3. Implement and Test a Prototype. The next phase involves implementing and testing a prototype of
   the designed solution in a lab or test environment. The primary goals of the testing are to evaluate the
   functionality, performance, scalability, and security of the solution, and to identify any issues with the
   components, such as interoperability issues.

4. Deploy the Solution. Once the testing is completed and all issues are resolved, the next phase
   includes the gradual deployment of the storage encryption technology throughout the enterprise.

5. Manage the Solution. After the solution has been deployed, it is managed throughout its lifecycle.
   Management includes maintenance of the storage encryption components and support for operational
   issues. The lifecycle process is repeated when enhancements or significant changes need to be
   incorporated into the solution.

This document does not describe the planning and implementation process in depth because the same
basic steps are performed for any security technology. For example, the document assumes that the
organization has already determined what information needs to be protected and assigned an impact level
from FIPS 199 to the information. This section only highlights those considerations that are particular to
storage encryption for end user devices.

4.1   Identify Needs

The purpose of this phase is to identify the needs to protect information stored on end user devices and
determine how those needs can best be met. Requirements specific to storage encryption that should be
considered include the following:

 External Requirements. The organization may be subject to oversight or review by another
  organization that requires storage encryption. An example is a legal requirement to protect stored PII.

 System and Network Environments. It is important to understand the characteristics of the
  organizationâ€™s system and network environments so that storage encryption solutions can be selected
  that will be compatible with them and able to provide the necessary protection. Aspects to consider
  include the following:
