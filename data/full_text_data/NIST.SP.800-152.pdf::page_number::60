SP 800-152                                                      A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


"recipient usage period." The validity period in a certificate applies to the key that is used to
apply protection, and must not exceed the key's originator usage period.

Several algorithms have been approved that use key pairs, and the role of each key of the key
pair is not necessarily the same. See [SP 800-57 Part 1] for more information.

        For digital signature key pairs, the private key is used to generate the signature (i.e.,
         apply protection), so it would have an originator usage period; the public key is used
         to verify the signature (i.e., process the protected information), so it would have a
         recipient usage period. The validity period in a certificate pertains to the use of the
         private key.
        For key transport keys, the public key is used to apply protection (i.e., encrypt), so its
         cryptoperiod would be considered as an originator usage period, while the private key
         is used to decrypt, so it's cryptoperiod would be considered as the recipient usage
         period. In this case, the originator usage period pertains to the use of the public key.
        For key agreement algorithms, the cryptoperiods of the two keys of the key pair are
         usually the same.

The sum of the validity periods for the original certificate and all renewed certificates for the
same key must not exceed the cryptoperiod of the key used to apply protection (i.e., the key
with the originator usage period).

An FCKMS could notify the owner of a certificate when a certificate is about to expire so
that the certificate could be renewed prior to the end validity date on the certificate.

FR:6.34 The CKMS design shall specify how and the conditions under which a public key
can be renewed.

FR:6.35 For each key type, the CKMS design shall specify requirements for advance
notification of the key type renewal, including which parties are notified, how they are
notified, what security services are applied to the notification, and the time-frames for
notification(s).

                            A Federal CKMS shall not renew the validity period of a
PR:6.30
                            public key certificate beyond the cryptoperiod of the key of the
                            key pair used to apply cryptographic protection (i.e., the
                            originator usage period).

                            A Federal CKMS could notify the owner of a public-key
PF:6.3
                            certificate that the certificate is about to expire.
                            A Federal CKMS could provide notification to the relying
PF:6.4
                            parties of a public key certificate that the certificate has been
                            renewed.
