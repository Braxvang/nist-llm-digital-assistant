SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



The address match list parameter in an access control statement can contain any of the following values:

    •   An IP address or list of IP addresses

    •   An IP prefix or list of IP prefixes

    •   ACLs

    •   A combination of the above three.
The definition of ACLs forms a critical element in the configuration of DNS transaction restrictions.
Hence, it is a good operational practice for the DNS administrator to define and create ACLs pertaining to
different DNS transactions.


Checklist item 7: It is recommended that the administrator create a named list of trusted hosts (or
blacklisted hosts) for each of the different types of DNS transactions. In general, the role of the following
categories of hosts should be considered for inclusion in the appropriate ACL:

        –   DMZ hosts defined in any of the zones in the enterprise

        –   All secondary name servers allowed to initiate zone transfers

        –   Internal hosts allowed to perform recursive queries.



In addition to IP address, IP prefix, or ACL, the address match list parameter in the access control
statements can take on any of the following special values:

    •   none: matches no hosts

    •   any: matches all hosts

    •   localhost: matches all IP addresses of the server on which the name server is running

    •   localnets: matches all IP addresses and subnet masks of the server on which the name server is
        running.
Following are a few more examples of commands for creating ACLs and the use of ACLs within options
and zone statements:

        acl “local_hosts” {
             254.10.20.10;
             239.10.30.29/25;
        };

        acl “fake-net” {
             0.0.0.0/8;
             1.0.0.0/8;
        };
