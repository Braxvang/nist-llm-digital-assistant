                                         Figure 2.2: SMTP Commands

When a user sends an email, the client contacts its SMTP server and conducts a “conversation” using the
SMTP language. A MUA is typically part of the mail client application (e.g., Outlook, Eudora). If an
MUA is unavailable, email messages can be sent using a Telnet client connected to the SMTP service.
Figure 2.3 depicts a sample SMTP conversation using Telnet. The Telnet and SMTP commands entered
by the user for this session are shown in bold. During a manual SMTP Telnet session, the HELP
command can be used to determine which of the SMTP commands are enabled on the server.

2.3.2    Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Extensions

As the number of email users grew, additional functionality was sought in mail clients and SMTP servers.
For SMTP servers to support this additional functionality, extensions were added to SMTP. In 1993,
RFC 1425 introduced the concept of SMTP service extensions. Subsequently, RFC 1425 was superseded
by RFC 1651 in 1994, RFC 1869 in 1995, and RFC 2821 in 2001. These RFCs added three pieces to the
SMTP framework:
