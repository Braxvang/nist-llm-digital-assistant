Advancing the Application of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework
NIST has continued to foster the adoption and application of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework
Version 1.1 (the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity). The NIST
Cybersecurity Framework website has been expanded to provide learning materials, success
stories, and other helpful resources. Notably, the team has made significant progress in
encouraging global use of the framework and interoperability with other cybersecurity models.
Progress includes translation of the framework into several additional languages, including
Arabic, Bulgarian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish. NIST also continues to contribute
to international standards development efforts related to cybersecurity risk management
and the development of cybersecurity frameworks, including t he International Organization
for Standardization / International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) Technical
Specification 27110:2021, Information technology, cybersecurity and privacy protection â€“
Cybersecurity framework development guidelines, which is expected to be published in 2021.
NIST will also discuss and share information on the Cybersecurity Framework in bilateral
and multilateral international dialogues.
A key example of such an application is the development of NISTIR 8323, Foundational
PNT Profile: Applying the Cybersecurity Framework for the Responsible Use of Positioning,
Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Services. This publication describes a flexible and voluntary
model (based on the Cybersecurity Framework Profile concept) that can be used as part of a
risk management program to help organizations manage risks to systems, networks, and assets
that use PNT services. The project was launched in support of Executive Order 13905 to help
manage risks to PNT signals and data, which are susceptible to disruptions and manipulations
that can be natural, manufactured, intentional, or unintentional. Because the Cybersecurity
Framework provides a common set of terms and methods for organizing and communicating
about risks, such Profiles help foster discussions regarding how to identify important elements,
protect against known risks, detect incidents efficiently, and respond and recover effectively in
support of critical mission objectives.
In FY 2020, NIST continued to develop the National Cybersecurity Online Informative References
(OLIR) Program, an effort to facilitate subject-matter experts in defining standardized reference
documents regarding the relationships between elements of their documents and elements of
other documents like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, NIST Privacy Framework, and SP
800-53. While organizations have published written comparisons of various elements (e.g.,
between NIST SP 800-53 controls and the Cybersecurity Framework Subcategories) for
many years, the OLIR Program provides a standardized format for digitally expressing those
relationships. To support consistent usage, NIST developed NISTIR 8278A, National
Online Informative References (OLIR) Program: Submission Guidance for OLIR Developers.
The OLIR Program can incorporate any authoritative documents, from national and international
standards, guidelines, frameworks, and regulations to policies for individual organizations,
sectors, and jurisdictions. Cybersecurity document owners can use the OLIR Program as a
mechanism for communicating with owners and users of other cybersecurity documents.
