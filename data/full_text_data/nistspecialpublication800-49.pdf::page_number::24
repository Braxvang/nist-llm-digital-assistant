                               Federal S/MIME V3 Client Profile



A. Appendix A Cryptographic Algorithms (Non-Normative)

The availability and implementation of cryptographic algorithms affect both the security and
interoperability of S/MIME implementations. If a message is hashed or signed with an algorithm
not supported by the recipient, the recipient cannot verify the signature. If the symmetric key
(for message encryption) is derived or transferred with a key management algorithm not
supported by the recipient, the recipient will not be able to recover the symmetric key and
decrypt the message. If a message is encrypted with a symmetric algorithm not supported by the
recipient, the recipient will not be able to recover the clear text.

In addition, cryptographic algorithms offer different levels of protection [ORMAN]. Users of
S/MIME products need to make their systems resistant to some predetermined level of attack.
That level-of-attack resistance is the strength of the system. The one-way hash algorithm, digital
signature algorithm, key management algorithm, and symmetric algorithm SHOULD be at least
as strong as the system strength requirements.

Selecting and matching appropriate cryptographic algorithms is a complex task. This document
identifies algorithms that offer currently viable levels of security and identifies suites of
algorithms that may be used together.

To help ensure that cryptographic functions are correctly implemented, software modules
implementing cryptographic functions MUST conform to either FIPS 140-1 or to FIPS 140-2,
Security Requirements For Cryptographic Modules [FIPS140-1] [FIPS140-2] as specified in
Clause 2.1.1 of this profile.

A.1 One-Way Hash Algorithms
     Hash algorithms map arbitrarily long inputs into a fixed-size output such that it is very
     difficult (computationally infeasible) to find two different hash inputs that produce the
     same output. Such algorithms are an essential part of the process of producing fixed-size
     digital signatures that can both authenticate the signer and provide for data integrity
     checking (detection of input modification after signature) in a S/MIME message. For
     S/MIME V3, the following hash algorithms are identified:

               SHA-1:     S/MIME agents MUST support the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1)
                     as specified in [FIPS180-1] in agreement with Clause 2.1.1.1 of this
                     profile.

               SHA-256: This enhanced secure hash algorithm has been published. When it
                    becomes widely available, S/MIME agents SHOULD be capable of using
                    [FIPS180-2].

A.2 Symmetric Encryption Algorithms
     Symmetric encryption algorithms use the same secret key for data encryption and
     decryption. The Data Encryption Standard (DES) [FIPS46-3] algorithm using 56-bit
     keys has been available since the late 1970s and is now considered weak. The much
