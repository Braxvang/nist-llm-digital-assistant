Special Publication 800-85B                                  PIV Data Model Testing Specification


Test Scenario           1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                        2. Set OID := <<Card Holder Facial Image
                           (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.96.48)>>
                        3. Call pivGetData w/
                            • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                        4. Extract the Biometric Data Quality field of CBEFF Header.
                        5. Extract the value field for tag 0xBC, extract the first
                           88 bytes (CBEFF Header) and read the Biometric Data
                           Quality field (based on its position) in CBEFF Header.
Expected Result(s) The Biometric Data Quality field is -2.

9.2.2.10 Creator Field Value
Purpose                 Validates that the Creator field in the PIV Patron Format contains 18 bytes
                        of which the first K <= 17 bytes shall be ASCII characters, and the first of
                        the remaining 18-K shall be a null terminator (zero).

                        3. AS05.01.13
Precondition(s)         1. A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                        2. A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and
                             the contact reader.
                        3. The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                        4. A valid Card Holder Facial Image object is present on the PIV card.
                        5. Security conditions to read the object are met.
Test Scenario          Extract the value field for tag 0xBC, extract the first 88
                       bytes (CBEFF Header) and read the Creator field (based on its
                       position) in CBEFF Header. Start the following procedure at
                       the first byte of the Creator field:

                       For bytes 0 to 16, check if byte represents an ASCII
                       character
                          If yes, continue.
                              Else, check if zero.
                          If no, fail.
                              Else iterate through remaining bytes in field and fail
                          iff non-zero.

                       For bytes 17 through the end of the field, iterate through
                       all bytes and fail if non-zero
Expected Result(s) Procedure completes without failing.
