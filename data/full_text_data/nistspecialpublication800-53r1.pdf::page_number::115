PE-18     LOCATION OF INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENTS

          Control: The organization positions information system components within the facility to minimize
          potential damage from physical and environmental hazards and to minimize the opportunity for
          unauthorized access.
          Supplemental Guidance: Physical and environmental hazards include, for example, flooding, fire,
          tornados, earthquakes, hurricanes, acts of terrorism, vandalism, electrical interference, and
          electromagnetic radiation. Whenever possible, the organization also considers the location or site
          of the facility with regard to physical and environmental hazards.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization plans the location or site of the facility where the information system resides with
                regard to physical and environmental hazards and for existing facilities, considers the physical and
                environmental hazards in its risk mitigation strategy.


           LOW Not Selected              MOD PE-18                    HIGH PE-18 (1)



PE-19     INFORMATION LEAKAGE

          Control: The organization protects the information system from information leakage due to
          electromagnetic signals emanations.
          Supplemental Guidance: The FIPS 199 security categorization (for confidentiality) of the
          information system and organizational security policy guides the application of safeguards and
          countermeasures employed to protect the information system against information leakage due to
          electromagnetic signals emanations.
          Control Enhancements: None.
