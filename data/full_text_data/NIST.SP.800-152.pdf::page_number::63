SP 800-152                                                    A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


modifiable; other metadata elements may by modified by some entities, but not by others.
Attempted unauthorized modification of metadata that are associated with a key must be
detected, prevented, and should be reported.

FR:6.42 The CKMS design shall specify the circumstances under which associated metadata
is modified.

                           A Federal CKMS shall designate which metadata elements are
PR:6.39
                           modifiable by authorized entities and which metadata elements
                           cannot be modified after initial creation.
                AC-3       A Federal CKMS shall prevent the modification of metadata
PR:6.40
                           except by authorized entities.


                           A Federal CKMS should report the attempted modification of
PA:6.11
                           metadata by unauthorized entities to the system administrator.

6.4.12 Delete Metadata
This function deletes metadata associated with a key. A deletion of the metadata requires the
authentication of the requestor and verification of his/her authorization. Metadata elements
may be deleted as an entire group, as an individual element, or as a specific subset of the
elements.

FR:6.43 The CKMS design shall specify the circumstances under which the metadata
associated with a key is deleted.

FR:6.44 The CKMS design shall specify the technique used to delete associated metadata.

                AC-3       A Federal CKMS shall allow metadata destruction only by
PR:6.41
                           authenticated and authorized entities.
                           A Federal CKMS shall support the selection of metadata
PR:6.42
                           elements to be destroyed and the designation of who is
                           authorized to perform the destruction.

6.4.13 List Key Metadata
This function allows an authorized entity to list one or more metadata elements of a key. The
authorization of an entity to use a key does not automatically authorize that entity to list the
keyâ€™s metadata elements. Each metadata element could be assigned with a different set of
permissions (e.g., some metadata elements could be prohibited from being listed at all),
others could be listed by any user, while still others could be listed by only persons assuming
a particular role (e.g., an administrator or auditor).

FR:6.45 For each key type, the CKMS design shall specify which metadata can be listed by
authorized entities.
