      September 2023                                                                                          PIV Client API

669   Appendix B. Glossary
670   application identifier
671   A globally unique identifier of a card application. [ISO7816, Part 4, adapted]

672   application session
673   The period of time within a card session between when a card application is selected and a different card application
674   is selected or the card session ends.

675   Algorithm identifier
676   A 1-byte identifier that specifies a cryptographic algorithm and key size. For symmetric cryptographic operations,
677   the algorithm identifier also specifies a mode of operation (i.e., ECB).

678   BER-TLV data object
679   A data object coded according to ISO/IEC 8824-2:2021.

680   Card
681   An integrated circuit card.

682   Card application
683   A set of data objects and card commands that can be selected using an application identifier.

684   Card interface device
685   An electronic device that connects an integrated circuit card and the card applications therein to a client application.

686   Card reader
687   Synonym for card interface device.

688   Client application
689   A computer program running on a computer in communication with a card interface device.

690   Card management operation
691   Any operation involving the PIV Card Application Administrator.

692   Data object
693   An item of information seen at the card command interface for which is specified a name, a description of logical
694   content, a format, and a coding.

695   Interface device
696   Synonym for card interface device.

697   Key reference
698   A 1-byte identifier that specifies a cryptographic key according to its PIV Key Type. The identifier is part of
699   cryptographic material used in a cryptographic protocol, such as an authentication or a signing protocol.

700   Object identifier
701   A globally unique identifier of a data object. [ISO8824, adapted]

702   reference data
703   Cryptographic material used in the performance of a cryptographic protocol, such as an authentication or a signing
704   protocol. The reference data length is the maximum length of a password or PIN. For algorithms, the reference data
705   length is the length of a key.

706   status word
707   Two bytes returned by an integrated circuit card after processing any command that encodes the success of or errors
708   encountered during said processing.

709   template
710   A (constructed) BER-TLV data object whose value field contains specific BER-TLV data objects.
