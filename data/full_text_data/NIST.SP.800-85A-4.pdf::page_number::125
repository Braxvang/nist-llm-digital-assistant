NIST SP 800-85A-4                                       PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                 INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

                            arbitrary PIN value) concatenated without delimitation
                            with an arbitrary new PIN value (PIN 2). Both PINs are
                            padded with 'FF' to complete the total length of each
                            value to 8 bytes
                      4. Send CHANGE REFERENCE DATA card command with
                         • P2, key reference value is set to '81'
                         • Data field of the command will contain the correct PUK
                            value (PUK 1) concatenated without delimitation with an
                            arbitrary new PUK value (PUK 2). Each PUK is 8 bytes in
                            length
                      5. Send CHANGE REFERENCE DATA card command with
                         • P2, key reference value is set to '98'
                         • Data field of the command will contain the correct
                            pairing code value (if pairing code is unsupported use
                            an arbitrary 8-byte pairing code value) obtained from
                            the vendor, concatenated without delimitation with an
                            arbitrary new 8-byte pairing code value.
                      6. Send CHANGE REFERENCE DATA card command with
                         • P2, key reference value is set to '96'
                         • Data field of the command will contain an arbitrary
                            value of 16 bytes
                      7. Send CHANGE REFERENCE DATA card command with
                         • P2, key reference value is set to '97'
                         • Data field of the command will contain an arbitrary
                            value of 16 bytes
 Expected Result(s)   1. Command returns the application property template with the
                         status word '90 00' at the end.
                      2. The command returns an error status word.
                      3. The command returns an error status word.
                      4. The command returns an error status word.
                      5. The command returns an error status word.
                      6. The command returns an error status word.
                      7. The command returns an error status word.
 Postcondition(s)     PIN remains unchanged.

C.2.2.3       Secure Messaging Interface
 Purpose             Validates that the PIV Card does not accept the CHANGE
                     REFERENCE DATA command through the secure messaging
                     interface when a VCI has not been estalished.
 Reference(s)        1. SP 800-73-4 Part 2, Table 2
                     2. AS05.03, AS05.24A-R4
 Precondition(s)     1. The IUT is placed within the reading range of the contactless
                         reader.
                     2. There exists a valid PC/SC connection between the test system
                         and the contactless reader.
                     3. No other contactless card is within the proximity of the reader.
                     4. PIV Card Application PIN is recorded.
