                                                               GUIDELINES ON FIREWALLS AND FIREWALL POLICY


 If an edge firewall has a DMZ, consider which outward-facing services should be run from the DMZ
  and which should remain on the inside network.
 Do not rely on NATs to provide the benefits of firewalls.
 In some environments, putting one firewall behind another may lead to a desired security goal, but in
  general such multiple layers of firewalls can be troublesome.
