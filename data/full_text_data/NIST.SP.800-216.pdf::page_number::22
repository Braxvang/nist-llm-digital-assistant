NIST SP 800-216                                                                 Federal Vulnerability
May 2023                                                                        Disclosure Guidelines

   •   The advisory should contain the date of the initial publication and possibly other dates
       (e.g., revision history). Advisories should use date and time references in accordance with
       [ISO_8601].
   •   The description of the potential impact or consequence of the vulnerability should, at a
       minimum, explain the potential behavior that the vulnerability allows. The information
       could include security violations, access or privilege gains, likely subsequent impacts,
       and common attack scenarios. A technical severity rating system used in the advisory
       should be documented and the documentation referenced from the advisory. Existing
       technical severity rating systems, such as CVSS, should be leveraged to the extent
       possible.
   •   The remediation element should include information about actions that affected users
       should take to remediate the vulnerability. The advisory may also provide mitigating
       measures to protect affected products or services until a remediation is implemented.
       References to additional or related information may be added and should use original or
       source material and common cross-references, such as CVE, where applicable.
   •   The advisory should provide contact information, and methods for communicating
       advisories to users should be established and maintained. Best practices may vary (e.g.,
       websites, mailing lists, feeds, automatic update mechanisms, posts on public vulnerability
       discussion forums).
   •   If the reporter wishes to be publicly recognized, the advisory should acknowledge the
       reporter for reporting the vulnerability.
   •   The advisory should also include the copyright, terms of use, and redistribution of the
       advisory.

2.7.3. Government Advisory Services
The Federal Government maintains advisory services to reduce risks to both the cybersecurity
and economic security of the United States, including federal agencies that serve the public and
all economic actors in the Nation. The computer security industry also maintains a variety of
both free and paid vulnerability advisory services. The Federal Government participates in the
advisory services ecosystem to ensure the provisioning of accurate and comprehensive
vulnerability listings.
Below is a partial list of government vulnerability advisory resources available as of the writing
of this document.

2.7.3.1.          National Cyber Awareness System
The National Cyber Awareness System (NCAS) contains five products that provide information
on vulnerabilities and related threats [CISA] to technical users:
   1. Current Activity – provides details on the most frequent, high-impact types of security
      incidents currently being reported
