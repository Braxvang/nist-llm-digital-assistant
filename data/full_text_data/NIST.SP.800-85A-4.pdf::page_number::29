NIST SP 800-85A-4                                              PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                        INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

                  Derived Test Requirements

All DTRs that are new to Revision 4 of this document are new requirements introduced in SP 800-
73-4. These are referenced with the suffix -R4 (e.g., AS0X-R4). Updated DTRs that existed
previously are requirements updated in SP 800-73-4 and these retain their original identifiers.

A.1          Concepts and Constructs

A.1.1        Platform Requirements

AS01.01: The PIV Card Application shall place the following requirements on the ICC
platform on which it is implemented or installed:

      +   global security status that includes the security status of a global cardholder PIN.
      +   application selection using a truncated Application Identifier (AID).
      +   ability to reset the security status of an individual application.
      +   indication to applications as to which physical communication interface – contact
          versus contactless – is in use.
      +   support for the default selection of an application upon warm or cold reset.

Note: This assertion is not separately tested.

A.1.2        Card Applications

AS01.02: Each command that appears on the card command interface shall be implemented
by a card application that is resident on the ICC.

Note: This assertion is not separately tested – collection of DTRs for all commands implicitly tests
this assertion.

AS01.03: Each card application shall have a globally unique name called its Application
Identifier (AID) [ISO/IEC 7816, Part 4].

Note: This assertion is tested as part of AS05.05 through AS05.10.

AS01.04: Except for the default applications, access to the card commands and data objects of
a card application shall be gained by selecting the card application using its application
identifier.

Note: This assertion is tested as part of AS05.11.

AS01.05: The Proprietary Identifier eXtension (PIX) of the AID shall contain an encoding of
the version of the card application.


Note: This assertion is tested as part of the AS05.05 through AS05.10.
