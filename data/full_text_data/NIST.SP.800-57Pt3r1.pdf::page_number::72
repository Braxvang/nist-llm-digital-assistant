        RFC 4253 specifies two finite-field key-exchange methods: “diffie-hellman-
         group1-sha1” and “diffie-hellman-group14-sha1” [RFC4253]. Since diffie-
         hellman-group1-sha1 uses 1024-bit keys, which provide less than 112 bits of
         security strength, it shall not be used. However, note that the use of SHA-1, in
         this case, is acceptable.
        RFC 4419 specifies two additional finite-field Diffie-Hellman key-exchange
         methods: “diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1” and “diffie-hellman-group-
         exchange-sha256” [RFC 4419]. Although the modulus length (i.e., key size) that
         can be supported by these two methods is between 1024 and 8192 bits, a modulus
         length of at least 2048 bits shall be used.
        RFC 5656 specifies key-agreement options based on elliptic curves that can be
         used instead of the options described above [RFC 5656]. Two of the options are
         mandatory-to-implement for the Federal Government when supporting Elliptic
         Curve Cryptography for SSH: “ecdh-sha2-nistp256” and “ecdh-sha2-nistp384”.
         These options specify the use of elliptic curve Diffie Hellman with the
         appropriate, NIST-approved hash function and curve: “ecdh-sha2-nistp256”
         specifies the use of SHA-256 and the nistp256 curve, while “ecdh-sha2-nistp384”
         specifies the use of SHA-384 and the nistp384 curve [RFC 5656]. See [FIPS 186-
         4] for information about the curves.

10.2.1.3 Public Key Authentication Algorithms
Public-key authentication algorithms are the digital-signature algorithms that can be used
in the key exchange specified in [RFC 4253, Sec. 8] to perform server authentication.
RFC 4253 specifies two digital signature algorithms: RSA and DSA (which is called
“ssh-dss” in the RFC) using SHA-1 as the hash function for server authentication. It is
important to note that according to [SP 800-131A], SHA-1 is no longer allowed for
generating digital signatures. However, in this protocol, SHA-1 is allowed for server
authentication, as long as the public key size of the signing function (either RSA or DSA)
is at least 2048 bits. The protocol allows a server’s public key to be used without
validation (i.e., without obtaining assurance of public key validity). For Federal
Government use, the client shall obtain assurance of public key validity, as required in
[SP 800-89], before digital signature verification can be performed.

Additional authentication algorithms for SSH are specified in [RFC 5656]. These use the
Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) using the curves specified in [FIPS
186-4]. Table 10-1 identifies the requirements for the implementation of the ECDSA
algorithm and the curves to be used by the Federal Government.
