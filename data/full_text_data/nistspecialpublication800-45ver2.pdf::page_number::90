GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



    –   Resolver configuration problems (e.g., DNS, NIS)

    –   Mail server configuration errors (e.g., mismatch with DNS: local configuration error, out of date
        alias database)

    –   Lack of system resources (disk space, memory, CPU)

    –   Alias database rebuilds
 Connection-related logging

    –   Failed logins, and also successful logins if adequate space is available

    –   Security problems (e.g., spamming)

    –   Lost communications (network problems)

    –   Protocol failures

    –   Connection timeouts

    –   Connection rejections

    –   Use of VRFY and EXPN commands
 Message-related logging

    –   Send on behalf of

    –   Send as

    –   Malformed addresses

    –   Message collection statistics

    –   Creation of error messages

    –   Delivery failures (permanent errors)

    –   Messages being deferred (transient errors).
Ensuring that sufficient log capacity is available is a concern, since logs often take considerably more
space than administrators initially estimate, especially when logging is set to a highly detailed level.
Administrators should closely monitor the size of the log files when they implement different logging
settings to ensure that the log files do not fill up the allocated storage. Due to the size of the log files,
removing and archiving the logs more frequently or reducing the logging level of detail may be necessary.

Some mail server programs provide a capability to enforce or disable the checking of specified access
controls during program startup. This level of control may be helpful, for example, to avoid inadvertent
alteration of log files because of errors in file access administration. Mail server administrators should
determine the circumstances under which they may wish to enable such checks (assuming the mail server
software supports this feature).
