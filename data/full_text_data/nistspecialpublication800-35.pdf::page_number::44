5.1.1    IT Security Program Development

An IT security program is a set of security controls, which can be grouped under the terms management,
operational, and technical. Federal law and regulations, such as the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, OMB Circular A-130, Security of Federal Automated Information
Resources, and other government-wide policies, standards, and procedures issued by the OMB, NIST, and
other agencies establish the policies, standards, and procedures for federal organizations.

Because policy is typically written at a broad level, organizations must also develop standards, guidelines,
and procedures that provide employees with a clear approach to implementing policy. Standards and
guidelines specify technologies and methodologies that will be used to secure systems; procedures are
detailed steps to be followed to accomplish particular security-related tasks. Standards, guidelines, and
procedures may be distributed throughout an organization via handbooks, regulations, or manuals.
Together, these documents will ensure that employees are aware of their role in IT security and comply
with the IT security program.

IT Security Program Services

Service providers can assist organization decision makers in developing and maintaining an organization-
wide security program, helping to ensure effective implementation of the program, evaluate the
performance of major organization components, and provide appropriate security training of organization
employees with significant security responsibilities. The service providers can also perform independent
evaluations and audits of an organization IT security program.

A comprehensive IT security program service can consist of many elements that will depend on the
specific needs of the organization and the relative maturity of its IT security program. The elements of an
IT security program service may include the following:

 Assess the risk to operations and assets under the organization’s control
 Determine the level of security appropriate to protect the organization’s operations and assets
 Develop and maintain a current security plan for each system supporting the operations and assets
  under organizational control
 Develop security incident handling procedures
 Develop processes for sharing information regarding common vulnerabilities, including a description
  of procedures for external reporting
 Develop a set of effective security controls and techniques
 Develop capital planning and investment control processes that ensure appropriate integration of
  security controls into IT investments
 Develop a set of IT security metrics that enable an organization to effectively assess the adequacy of
  in-place security controls, policies, and procedures and to adequately justify security control
  investments
