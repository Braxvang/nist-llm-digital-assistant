NIST SP 800-215                                                            Guide to a Secure Enterprise
November 2022                                                                      Network Landscape

4.3 Network Configuration for User Authentication
HAE-NCF-2: Consistent with OMB memorandum M-22-09 [49], which outlines the federal zero
trust architecture strategy
   a. The network should be configured to route all user access requests to all applications (on-
      premises and cloud-based, such as SaaS), to an enterprise managed IdP.
   b. A minimum of two authenticator factors must be used to authenticate users. The multi-
      factor authentication (MFA) process employed should use phishing-resistant
      authenticators. Also termed as “verifier impersonation-resistant”, these authenticators
      should meet the requirements at level AAL3 in NIST guidance SP 800-63-3 [50].

4.4 Network Configuration for Device Authentication and Health Monitoring
HAE-NCF-3: Device authentication can be performed through certificate validation using
appropriate protocols. A device health check may involve both its security posture (e.g., the
version of an operating system it is running, the patches that have been applied, the security
software that is installed) and environmental information, such as geolocation.

4.5 Network Configuration for Authorizing Application/Service Access
HAE-NCF-4: Standardized protocols, such as OAuth 2.0 [20], should be used to issue access
tokens to the validated user, device, or service to enable access to cloud-based applications.
HAE-NCF-5: Network configuration for microservices-based applications (on-premises or in
cloud) should include capabilities such as service discovery, encryption, service authentication,
load balancing, observability (visibility of network traffic at layers 3-7), and canary rollouts.
Further, visibility into microservices runtime behavior (and the ability to provide more dynamic
security controls) can be enabled by attaching eBPF programs [52] to tracepoint events (the
entry to or exit from any function in kernel or user space).

4.6 Network Configurations for Preventing Attack Escalation
The network configurations for attack escalation prevention are techniques used to realize ZTNA
and are discussed in the next section. Two established configurations are:
   1. Microsegmentation
   2. Software-defined perimeter (SDP)
