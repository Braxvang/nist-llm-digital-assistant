Practical Combinatorial Testing
________________________________________________________________


1 INTRODUCTION

     Software implementation errors are one of the most significant contributors to
information system security vulnerabilities, making software testing an essential part of
system assurance. Combinatorial methods can help reduce the cost and increase the
effectiveness of software testing for many applications. This publication provides a self-
contained tutorial on using combinatorial testing for real-world software. It introduces the
key concepts and methods, explains use of software tools for generating combinatorial tests
(freely available on the NIST web site csrc.nist.gov/acts), and discusses advanced topics
such as the use of formal models of software to determine the expected results for each
possible set of test inputs. The material is accessible to an undergraduate student of
computer science or engineering, and includes an extensive set of references to papers that
provide more depth on each topic.


1.1   Authority

    The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document
in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347.

     NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum
requirements, for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and
assets, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This
guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency Information Systems,” as
analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental information is
provided in A-130, Appendix III.

      This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by
nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though
attribution is desired.

     Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made
mandatory and binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory
authority, nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing
authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other Federal
official.

1.2   Document Scope and Purpose

     This publication introduces combinatorial testing and explains how to use it effectively
for system and software assurance.
