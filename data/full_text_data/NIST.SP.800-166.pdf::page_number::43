 DTR No:           DTR Description                                      Spec. Reference
 DTR-07.03.03.05   If the public key algorithm is RSA, then the         • [PROF], Worksheet
                   keyUsage extension shall only assert the                titled - Key
                   keyEncipherment bit. If the public key                  Management
                   algorithm is elliptic curve, then the keyUsage          Certificate Profile
                   extension shall only assert the keyAgreement
                   bit.
 DTR-07.03.03.06   The policyIdentifier field in the                    •   [PROF], Worksheet
                   certificatePolicies must assert one of the               titled - Key
                   following: id-fpki-common-policy (OID =                  Management
                   2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.6), id-fpki-common-               Certificate Profile
                   hardware (OID = 2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.7) or
                   id-fpki-common-High (OID =
                   2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.16).
 DTR-07.03.03.07   The authorityInfoAccess field shall contain an       •   [PROF], Worksheet
                   id-ad-caIssuers (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2)                     titled - Key
                   accessMethod. The access location shall to               Management
                   specify the location of an LDAP accessible               Certificate Profile
                   directory server or HTTP accessible Web
                   server where certificates issued to the issuer of
                   this certificate may be found.
                   If LDAP is used, the URI must include the DN
                   of the entry containing the relevant certificates
                   and specify the directory attribute in which the
                   certificates are located. If the directory in
                   which the certificates are stored expects the
                   "binary" option to be specified, then the
                   attribute type must be followed by ";binary" in
                   the URI.
                   If HTTP is used, the URI must point to a file
                   that has an extension of ".p7c" containing a
                   certs-only CMS message (see [RFC5751],
                   Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
                   (S/MIME) Version 3.2 Message Specification).
 DTR-07.03.03.08   The cRLDistributionPoints extension is               •   [PROF], Worksheet
                   required and must contain at least one URI,              titled - Key
                   either LDAP or HTTP.                                     Management
                   If LDAP is used, the URI must include the DN             Certificate Profile
                   of the entry containing the CRL and specify
                   the directory attribute in which the CRL is
                   located (certificateRevocationList).
                   If HTTP is used, the URI must point to a file
                   that has an extension of ".crl" that contains the
                   DER encoded CRL. (see [RFC2585], Internet
                   X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Operational
                   Protocols: FTP and HTTP)
