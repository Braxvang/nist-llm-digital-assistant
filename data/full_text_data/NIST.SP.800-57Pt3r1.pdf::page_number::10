1.1 Purpose
Part 3 of the Recommendation for Key Management, Application-Specific Key
Management Guidance, is intended to address the key management issues associated
with currently available cryptographic mechanisms. General Guidance, Part 1 of the
Recommendation for Key Management, contains basic key management guidance for
users, developers and system managers regarding the “best practices” associated with the
generation and use of the various classes of cryptographic keying material [SP 800-57
Part 1]. General Organization and Management Requirements, Part 2 of the
Recommendation, provides a framework and general guidance to support establishing
cryptographic key management within an organization, and a basis for satisfying the key
management aspects of statutory and policy-based security planning requirements for
Federal Government organizations.

This document, Part 3 of the Recommendation, is designed for system installers, system
administrators and end users of existing key management infrastructures, protocols, and
other applications, as well as the people making purchasing decisions1 for new systems
using currently available technology. Note that end users who act as their own system
installers, administrators and purchasing agents may find the guidance intended for
administrators, installers and purchasers to be beneficial. In centrally managed
organizations, the organization’s management must establish a security policy that acts as
a foundation for all end-user guidance.

Recommendations are made for mechanisms designed to protect stored data and data in
transit. This document will not provide a complete restatement of existing standards or
implementation directives. Standards and guidelines with this level of detail are
referenced where appropriate.

For each of the key management infrastructures, protocols, and applications addressed in
Part 3, the following is provided:

          A brief description of the system under discussion that is intended to provide
           context for the security guidance provided,
          Recommended algorithm suites and key sizes, and associated security and
           compliance issues,
          Recommendations concerning the use of the mechanism in its current form for the
           protection of Federal Government information,
          Security considerations that may affect the security effectiveness of key
           management processes, and
          General recommendations for people making purchasing decisions, system
           installers, system administrators and end users.

The logistics of how one should obtain, store or transfer keys or key pairs within a given
application or system are application and implementation-specific and beyond the scope
