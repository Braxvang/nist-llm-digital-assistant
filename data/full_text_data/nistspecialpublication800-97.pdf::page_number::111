                                           EAP method selection is the cornerstone of RSN security
                                           protections; a poor EAP implementation can undermine
                                           nearly all aspects of RSN security. Appropriate EAP
                                           methods are those that meet the required security claims

                                           methods require at least some integration with a PKI, even if
                                           certificates are required on ASs only. Careful planning of

                                           Authorized users sometimes fail to successfully authenticate
                                           to the WLAN, even though they have a valid business
                                           reason to use the network. Reasons include forgotten
                                           passwords and lost smart cards. There should be a fallback
                                           strategy to provide access to these users. In some cases,
                                           this might involve a human process such as a call to the

                                           that does not hold a personal certificate. In either situation,
                                           the fallback method should be at least as strong as the
                                           primary method, otherwise attackers will attempt to exploit
