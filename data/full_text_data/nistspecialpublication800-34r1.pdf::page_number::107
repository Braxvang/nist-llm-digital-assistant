                                                 CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



         The {system name} is inoperable at the {organization name} and cannot be recovered within
          {RTO hours}.
         Key {system name} personnel have been identified and trained in their emergency response and
          recovery roles; they are available to activate the {system name} Contingency Plan.
         Additional assumptions as appropriate.

The {system name} ISCP does not apply to the following situations:
         Overall recovery and continuity of mission/business operations. The Business Continuity
          Plan (BCP) and Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) address continuity of business operations.
         Emergency evacuation of personnel. The Occupant Emergency Plan (OEP) addresses
          employee evacuation.
         Any additional constraints and associated plans should be added to this list.

2.        Concept of Operations

The Concept of Operations section provides details about {system name}, an overview of the three phases
of the ISCP (Activation and Notification, Recovery, and Reconstitution), and a description of roles and
responsibilities of {Organization’s} personnel during a contingency activation.

2.1       System Description

NOTE: Information for this section should be available from the system’s System Security Plan (SSP) and
can be copied from the SSP, or reference the applicable section in the SSP and attach the latest version of
the SSP to this contingency plan. Provide a general description of system architecture and functionality

Indicate the operating environment, physical location, general location of users, and partnerships with
external organizations/systems. Include information regarding any other technical considerations that
are important for recovery purposes, such as backup procedures.


2.2       Overview of Three Phases

This ISCP has been developed to recover the {system name} using a three-phased approach. This
approach ensures that system recovery efforts are performed in a methodical sequence to maximize the
effectiveness of the recovery effort and minimize system outage time due to errors and omissions.

The three system recovery phases are:

Activation and Notification Phase – Activation of the ISCP occurs after a disruption or outage that may
reasonably extend beyond the RTO established for a system. The outage event may result in severe
damage to the facility that houses the system, severe damage or loss of equipment, or other damage that
typically results in long-term loss.

Once the ISCP is activated, system owners and users are notified of a possible long-term outage, and a
thorough outage assessment is performed for the system. Information from the outage assessment is
presented to system owners and may be used to modify recovery procedures specific to the cause of the
outage.
