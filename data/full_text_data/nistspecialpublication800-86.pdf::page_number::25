                                                       GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



3.      Performing the Forensic Process

The most common goal of performing forensics is to gain a better understanding of an event of interest by
finding and analyzing the facts related to that event. As described in Section 2.1, forensics may be
needed in many different situations, such as evidence collection for legal proceedings and internal
disciplinary actions, and handling of malware incidents and unusual operational problems. Regardless of
the need, forensics should be performed using the four-phase process shown in Figure 3-1. The exact
details of these steps may vary based on the specific need for forensics; the organization’s policies,
guidelines, and procedures should indicate any variations from the standard procedure.

This section describes the basic phases of the forensic process: collection, examination, analysis, and
reporting.8 During collection, data related to a specific event is identified, labeled, recorded, and
collected, and its integrity is preserved. In the second phase, examination, forensic tools and techniques
appropriate to the types of data that were collected are executed to identify and extract the relevant
information from the collected data while protecting its integrity. Examination may use a combination of
automated tools and manual processes. The next phase, analysis, involves analyzing the results of the
examination to derive useful information that addresses the questions that were the impetus for
performing the collection and examination. The final phase involves reporting the results of the analysis,
which may include describing the actions performed, determining what other actions need to be
performed, and recommending improvements to policies, guidelines, procedures, tools, and other aspects
of the forensic process.

As shown at the bottom of Figure 3-1, the forensic process transforms media into evidence, whether
evidence is needed for law enforcement or for an organization’s internal usage.9 Specifically, the first
transformation occurs when collected data is examined, which extracts data from media and transforms it
into a format that can be processed by forensic tools.10 Second, data is transformed into information

     As explained in Section 2.1, the forensic process model presented in this document offers a simple way of looking at the
     phases of the forensic process. There are many other forensic process models that reflect the same basic principles and
     overall methodology. Forensic models differ primarily in how granular each phase of the process is and in the terms used
     for specific phases. Organizations should choose the specific forensic model that is most appropriate for their needs.

     From a legal perspective, the term evidence technically refers only to those items that are admitted into a court case by a
     judge. However, the term evidence is widely used in a much broader sense, and this publication uses the less restrictive
     definition of evidence.

     In this context, the word media refers to both systems and networks.
