      NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                                                           Building a Cybersecurity and

354   The Government Accountability Office (GAO) 5 noted that in FY 2021 federal civilian agencies
355   reported 32,511 information security incidents. The largest identified percentage (31 %) of
356   reported incidents were from improper usage and 9 % were from email phishing (46 % are
357   shown as “unknown”). Improper usage is defined as “any incident resulting from violation of an
358   organization’s acceptable usage policies by an authorized user.” While these statistics may
359   change from year to year, the high level of incidents from improper usage demonstrates the need
360   for CPLPs. To reduce improper use, it is crucial that every user receives training on the rules of
361   behavior and their role in reducing the risks associated with the organization’s data and systems.
362   To support an inclusive culture, the approach in any CPLP should focus on helping the learner
363   understand their role in the organization with respect to their cybersecurity and privacy
364   responsibilities. The content should indicate to the learner that they are a valued participant in
365   helping the organization manage risk. The workforce appreciates that they will contribute to the
366   organization’s positive cybersecurity and privacy culture with the knowledge and skills they
367   acquire by participating in the CPLP. The stereotypes of “hackers in hoodies” and myth of
368   “technologies solving the problem” are dated. People are an organization’s greatest asset. Any
369   effective learning activity can be incorporated into the CPLP when it is respectful and inclusive.
370   A cybersecurity and privacy culture supports an environment where – from executives to every
371   user – the workforce is well-versed in the cybersecurity and privacy risk management needs,
372   expectations, and values of their organization and understands their roles and responsibilities for
373   meeting them. An organization supports an effective cybersecurity and privacy culture when it
374   understands the needs of the workforce and provides education and training to help employees
375   and contractors learn expected cybersecurity and privacy behaviors.
376   Organizations and system owners must develop a CPLP approach that champions every user’s
377   responsibility to protect information and assets. It is important to recognize how new
378   technologies and new risks will continue to necessitate an organization-wide approach to
379   managing cybersecurity and privacy risks. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework [4], Privacy
380   Framework [5], and the Risk Management Framework (RMF) [7] highlight the importance of
381   awareness and training for personnel.

382              Relationship Between Cybersecurity and Privacy
383   While cybersecurity and privacy are independent and separate disciplines, some of their
384   objectives are overlapping and complementary. Cybersecurity programs are responsible for
385   protecting information and information systems as well as operational technologies from
386   unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction (i.e., unauthorized
387   system activity or behavior) in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, availability and safety.
388   Privacy programs are responsible for managing the risks to individuals associated with data
389   processing throughout the information life cycle 6 in order to provide predictability,
390   manageability, and disassociability, as well as ensuring compliance with applicable privacy
391   requirements. Managing cybersecurity risk contributes to managing privacy risk. However,
392   managing cybersecurity risk alone is not sufficient, as privacy risks can also arise by means
393   unrelated to cybersecurity incidents, as illustrated by Fig. 2.
