The following are some approaches that are employed to implement microsegmentation [22]:
   a. Virtualized server-based approach: This approach is only applicable to networks that
      contain virtualized servers since it is implemented in the hypervisor. There are two
      possible mechanisms:
       1. Using virtual firewalls inside a hypervisor to isolate traffic destined for different VMs
          inside the hypervisor
       2. Using encapsulation techniques to create overlays (e.g., Virtual Extensible LAN
          (VXLAN)) that run on top of an underlying network that consists of IP addresses
          designations; access control policies are enforced on the hypervisor itself outside of
          the workload (application or microservice)
   b. Host-based microsegmentation: Alternatively (or additionally), host-based
      microsegmentation can be implemented using software agents on the endpoint artifacts
      (e.g., servers). It leverages native firewall functionality built into the host. Software agents
      can overlay a software-defined segmented network across data centers, cloud, bare metal,
      and hybrid environments. The agent provides context awareness and visibility for each
      workload and enables the definition and enforcement of fine-grained policies.
