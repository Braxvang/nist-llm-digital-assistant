                                                      GUIDE TO SECURITY FOR FULL VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGIES



Because of the hypervisor’s level of access to and control over the guest OSs, limiting access to the
hypervisor is critical to the security of the entire system. The access options vary based on hypervisor
type. Most bare metal hypervisors have access controls to the system. Typically, the access method is just
username and password, but some bare metal hypervisors offer additional controls such as hardware
token-based authentication to grant access to the hypervisor’s management interface. On some systems,
there are different levels of authorization, such as allowing some users to view logs but not be able to
change any settings or interact directly with the guest OSs. These view-only user accounts allow auditors
and others to have sufficient access to meet their needs without reducing overall security.

In contrast to bare metal solutions, hosted virtualization products rarely have hypervisor access controls:
anyone who can launch an application on the host OS can run the hypervisor. The only access control is
whether or not someone can log into the host OS. Because of this wide disparity in security, organizations
should have security policies about which guest OSs can be run from bare metal hypervisors and which
can be run from hosted virtualization hypervisors. Further, organizations running bare metal hypervisors
should have policies specifying who can and cannot access various features of the hypervisor.

The following are security recommendations for the hypervisor itself:

 Install all updates to the hypervisor as they are released by the vendor. Most hypervisors have features
  that will check for updates automatically and install the updates when found. Centralized patch
  management solutions can also be used to administer updates.
 Restrict administrative access to the management interfaces of the hypervisor. Protect all
  management communication channels using a dedicated management network or the management
  network communications is authenticated and encrypted using FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic
  modules.
 Synchronize the virtualized infrastructure to a trusted authoritative time server.
 Disconnect unused physical hardware from the host system. For example, a removable disk drive
  might be occasionally used for backups, but it should be disconnected when not actively being used
  for backup or restores. Disconnect unused NICs from any network.
 Disable all hypervisor services such as clipboard- or file-sharing between the guest OS and the host
  OS unless they are needed. Each of these services can provide a possible attack vector. File sharing
  can also be an attack vector on systems where more than one guest OS share the same folder with the
  host OS.
 Consider using introspection capabilities to monitor the security of each guest OS. If a guest OS is
  compromised, its security controls may be disabled or reconfigured so as to suppress any signs of
  compromise. Having security services in the hypervisor permits security monitoring even when the
  guest OS is compromised.
 Consider using introspection capabilities to monitor the security of activity occurring between guest
  OSs. This is particularly important for communications that in a non-virtualized environment were
  carried over networks and monitored by network security controls (such as network firewalls, security
  appliances, and network IDPS sensors).
 Carefully monitor the hypervisor itself for signs of compromise. This includes using self-integrity
  monitoring capabilities that hypervisors may provide, as well as monitoring and analyzing hypervisor
  logs on an ongoing basis.
