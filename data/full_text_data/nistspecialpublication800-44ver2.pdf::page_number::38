remote administration services. These services may be required in certain instances, but they may
increase the risks to the server. Whether the risks outweigh the benefits is a decision for each
organization to make.

4.1.3   Configure Operating System User Authentication

For Web servers, the authorized users who can configure the OS are limited to a small number of
designated Web server administrators and Webmasters. The users who can access the public Web server,
however, may range from unrestricted to restricted subsets of the Internet community. To enforce policy
restrictions, if required, the Web server administrator should configure the OS to authenticate a
prospective user by requiring proof that the user is authorized for such access. Even though a Web server
may allow unauthenticated access to most of its services, administrative and other types of specialized
access should be limited to specific individuals and groups.

Enabling authentication by the host computer involves configuring parts of the OS, firmware, and
applications on the server, such as the software that implements a network service. Although not
normally the case for public Web servers, in special situations, such as high-value/high-risk sites,
organizations may also use authentication hardware, such as tokens or one-time password devices. Use of
authentication mechanisms where authentication information is reusable (e.g., passwords) and transmitted
in the clear over a network is strongly discouraged because the information can be intercepted and used
by an attacker to masquerade as an authorized user.

To ensure the appropriate user authentication is in place, take the following steps [Alle00]:

 Remove or Disable Unneeded Default Accounts and Groups—The default configuration of the OS
  often includes guest accounts (with and without passwords), administrator or root level accounts, and
  accounts associated with local and network services. The names and passwords for those accounts
  are well known. Remove or disable unnecessary accounts to eliminate their use by attackers,
  including guest accounts on computers containing sensitive information. If there is no requirement to
  retain a guest account or group, severely restrict access to it and change the password in accordance
  with the organizational password policy.

    For default accounts that need to be retained, change the names (where possible and particularly for
    administrator or root level accounts) and passwords to be consistent with the organizational password
    policy. Default account names and passwords are commonly known in the attacker community.

 Disable Non-Interactive Accounts—Disable accounts (and the associated passwords) that need to
  exist but do not require an interactive login. For Unix systems, disable the login shell or provide a
  login shell with NULL functionality (e.g., /bin/false).

 Create the User Groups—Assign users to the appropriate groups. Then assign rights to the groups,
  as documented in the deployment plan. This approach is preferable to assigning rights to individual
  users, which becomes unwieldy with large numbers of users.

 Create the User Accounts—The deployment plan identifies who will be authorized to use each
  computer and its services. Create only the necessary accounts. Permit the use of shared accounts
  only when no viable alternatives exist.

 Check the Organization’s Password Policy—Set account passwords appropriately. This policy
  should address the following:
