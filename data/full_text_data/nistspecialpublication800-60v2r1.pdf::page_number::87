other government facilities). Impact levels associated with security information directly relate to
the potential threat to human life associated with the asset(s) being protected (e.g., consequences
to the public of terrorist access to dams or nuclear power plants). The following recommended
categorization of the security management information type is subject to change where critical
infrastructure elements or key national assets are involved:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of security management
information on the ability of responsible organizations to physically protect their personnel,
assets, and facilities. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most security management
information depend on the likelihood that the information might jeopardize the physical security
of an organization’s assets and the value, and potential for damage of the assets being protected.

Information associated with the physical security of many Federal government office buildings,
transportation fleets, and operational facilities can be of material use to criminals seeking to gain
access to Federal facilities in order to perpetrate a major crime (e.g., extraction of inmates from
Federal detention facilities, theft of commodities market projections, access to information
associated with a felony criminal investigation or prosecution, theft of blank license issuing
facilities and/or materials, access to competition-sensitive information associated with major
procurements, undetected access to national archives or museum properties, access to currency
printing facilities or materials, theft of major currency or bullion storage facilities). In such
cases, unauthorized disclosure of information can have a serious adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals. Unauthorized disclosure of one agency’s security
management information by another agency could result in negative impacts on cross-
jurisdictional coordination within the security management infrastructure and the general
effectiveness of organizations tasked with physical protection of Federal facilities. The
consequences of physical protection failures at most Federal facilities are more likely to result in
serious 21 adverse effects.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Information associated with security
management at other Federal government office buildings, transportation fleets, and operational
facilities can be of material use to terrorists seeking to penetrate and/or commandeer such
facilities as part of operations intended to harm critical infrastructures, key national assets, or
people. Examples of more potentially damaging information includes information that reveals
specific measures for protecting government aircraft, information that might permit access that
creates an opportunity to bomb a government building (e.g., Congressional office buildings, FBI
Headquarters, the National Archives, Smithsonian Institution buildings, dams, nuclear power
plants, etc.), and leadership protection details that could result in assassination opportunities. In
these cases, the confidentiality impact must be high.

Unauthorized disclosure of security management information that can be reasonably expected to
pose a serious threat to human life (including those of security guards) must also be assigned a
high confidentiality impact. [Security management information associated with some Federal
government assets is classified. The classified information is national security related and is

     A loss of confidentiality that causes a significant degradation in mission capability, places the agency at a
     significant disadvantage, or results in major damage to assets, requiring extensive corrective actions or repairs.
