        FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information
         Systems 5, sets a base of security requirements that requires organizations to have a media
         sanitization program.

        FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules 6, establishes a standard
         for cryptographic modules used by the U.S. Government.

        NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 provides minimum recommended security controls,
         including sanitization, for Federal systems based on their overall system security
         categorization.

        NIST SP 800-53A Revision 1, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal
         Information Systems and Organizations: Building Effective Security Assessment Plans 7,
         provides guidance for assessing security controls, including sanitization, for federal
         systems based on their overall system security categorization.

        NIST SP 800-111, Guide to Storage Encryption Technologies for End User Devices 8,
         provides guidance for selecting and using storage encryption technologies.

        NIST SP 800-122, Guide to Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable
         Information (PII) 9, provides guidance for protecting the confidentiality of personally
         identifiable information in information systems.

 1.5 Document Structure

The guide is divided into the following sections and appendices:

        Section 1 (this section) explains the authority, purpose and scope, audience, assumptions
         of the document, relationships to other documents, and outlines its structure.

        Section 2 presents an overview of the need for sanitization and the basic types of
         information, sanitization, and media.
