ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



      Vendor-specific methods (to allow for flexibility and expansion).
As listed below, there are three options for what the IEEE 802.11 standard refers to as Authentication and
Key Management (AKM). An AKM suite defines the means by which the AP and STAs are mutually
authenticated during initial operation and the means for deriving the root key shown in the Pairwise Key
Hierarchy. RSNAs may be established for WLANs in either ad hoc mode (IBSS) or infrastructure mode
(BSS) using any of the AKM suites. The possible AKM suites are as follows:

      Mutual authentication and key management over IEEE 802.1X or using pairwise master key
       security association (PMKSA) caching, which is discussed in more detail in Section 5.4.4.
       Authentication is accomplished with an EAP method. If a specific AKM suite is not supplied
       during security policy negotiation, this suite will be used as the default AKM suite.
      Pre-shared key. No explicit authentication transaction takes place. If the PSK is unique for each
       STA, the STA and AP effectively authenticate each other by holding an identical pre-shared key,
       without which the data confidentiality and integrity services could not function properly. In
       practice, many PSK APs use a single PSK for every STA. This means that, rather than
       authenticating the client, the AP is verifying that the client is a member of an authorized group
       (the group that shares the key). The actual identity of the client has not been established, so this is
       not client authentication in the normal meaning of the term. However, the STA does authenticate
       the AP.
      Proprietary suites developed by vendors; this allows for flexibility and expansion.
A security association between a STA and an AP is a relationship established between these two entities
that enable them to protect data the exchange. Both entities store the security association information,
which includes the set of security policies and cryptographic keys used to protect the data (e.g., SSID, the
specific PMK, MAC addresses). An AP that is prepared to establish a RSNA will broadcast (advertise)
its capabilities, including its supported encryption and authentication capabilities. The capabilities are
included in a field called the RSN Information Element (RSNIE), which is part of Beacon and Probe
Response frames. 53 Figure 5-6 depicts the fields of the RSNIE. As shown, the RSNIE also conveys the
group key cipher suite, pairwise cipher suite, and AKM suite. For example, an RSNIE could specify a
group key cipher suite of CCMP, a pairwise cipher suite of CCMP, and an AKM suite of IEEE 802.1X.
The RSN Capabilities field includes an indication of whether Pre-Authentication is possible and whether
WEP with a default key is possible.
