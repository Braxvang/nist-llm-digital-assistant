     FIPS 201 defines requirements for the PIV lifecycle
activities including identity proofing, registration, PIV Card     Mr. Salvatore Francomacaro
issuance, and PIV Card usage. FIPS 201 also defines the            salvatore.francomacaro@nist.gov
structure of an identity credential that includes cryptographic
keys. This document contains the technical specifications          Mr. Ketan Mehta
needed for the mandatory and optional cryptographic keys           ketan.mehta@nist.gov
specified in FIPS 201 as well as the supporting infrastructure
specified in FIPS 201 and the related SP 800-73, Interfaces        DRAFT SP 800-57 Part 3, Revision 1, Recommendation

    FIPS 201 defines the requirements and characteristics
of a government-wide interoperable identity credential.            SP 800-56B Revision 1, Guidelines for Derived Personal
FIPS 201 also specifies that this identity credential must be      Identity Verification (PIV) Credentials

the technical specifications to interface with the smart           schemes using integer factorization cryptography, based on
card to retrieve and use the PIV identity credentials. The         ANS X9.44, Key Establishment Using Integer Factorization
specifications reflect the design goals of interoperability and    Cryptography, which was developed by the Accredited
PIV Card functions. The goals are addressed by specifying          Standards Committee (ASC) X9, Inc.

programming interface. Moreover, this document enumerates
requirements where the international integrated circuit card       CONTACTS :
standards include options and branches. The specifications         Ms. Elaine Barker			              Dr. Lily Chen
go further by constraining implementersâ€™ interpretations of        elaine.barker@nist.gov		          lily.chen@nist.gov

performance, in a manner tailored for PIV applications.            dustin.moody@nist.gov
