                                    Table B-1 Mapping of Data Objects

The detailed data model specifications for each of the data objects of the Derived PIV Application are the
same as the specifications of the corresponding data objects (mapped per the table above) of the PIV Card
Application as described in Appendix A of [SP800-73Part1] , except for the following:

       References to contactless interface are not applicable. The Derived PIV Application only supports
        a contact interface.

       The Security Object for the Derived PIV Application is optional. It is required if either the
        optional Discovery Object or the optional Key History object is present.

       The minimum capacity for the Security Object container shall be 3000 bytes, in order to allow
        space for the Derived PIV Credential Issuer’s certificate.


B.1.3     Derived PIV Application Data Objects Representation

The ASN.1 object identifiers (OID) and “basic encoding rules – tag length value” (BER-TLV) tags for the
various mandatory and optional data objects within the Derived PIV Application are the same as for the
corresponding data objects (mapped per the table above) of the PIV Card Application as described in
Section 4 of [SP800-73Part1] .

B.1.4     Derived PIV Application Data Types and their Representation

This appendix provides a description of the data types used in the Derived PIV Application Command
Interface.

B.1.4.1      Derived PIV Application Key References and Security Conditions of Use

Key references are assigned to keys and passwords of the Derived PIV Application. Table 6-1 of [SP800-
78] and Table 4 of [SP800-73Part1] define the key reference values that shall be used on the Derived PIV
Application interfaces with the following mappings:

Derived PIV Key Type                                   PIV Key Type
Derived PIV Application Password                       PIV Card Application PIN
Password Unblocking Key                                PIN Unblocking Key
