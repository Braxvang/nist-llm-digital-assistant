GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



of penetration testing is to exercise system protections (particularly human response to attack indications)
by using common tools and techniques developed by attackers. This testing is highly recommended for
complex or critical systems.

Penetration testing can be an invaluable technique for any organization’s information security program.
However, it is a very labor-intensive activity and requires great expertise to minimize the risk to targeted
systems. At a minimum, it may slow the organization’s network response time because of network
mapping and vulnerability scanning. Furthermore, the possibility exists that systems may be damaged or
rendered inoperable in the course of penetration testing. Although this risk is mitigated by the use of
experienced penetration testers, it can never be fully eliminated.

Penetration testing does offer the following benefits [Wack02b]:

 Tests the network using the same methodologies and tools employed by attackers
 Verifies whether vulnerabilities exist
 Goes beyond surface vulnerabilities and demonstrates how these vulnerabilities can be exploited
  iteratively to gain greater access
 Demonstrates that vulnerabilities are not purely theoretical
 Provides the “realism” necessary to address security issues
 Allows for testing of procedures and the susceptibility of the human element to social engineering.
9.5       Remotely Administering a Mail Server

It is strongly recommended that remote administration of a mail server be allowed only after careful
consideration of the risks. 66 The most secure configuration is to disallow any remote administration.
However, that may not be viable for all organizations. The risk of enabling remote administration varies
considerably depending on the location of the mail server on the network (see Section 7.1). For a mail
server that is located behind a firewall, remote administration can be implemented relatively securely
from the internal network, but not without added risk. Remote administration should generally not be
allowed from a host located outside the organization’s network unless performed from an organization-
controlled computer through the organization’s remote access solution, such as a virtual private network.

If an organization determines that it is necessary to remotely administer a mail server, following these
steps should ensure that it is implemented in as secure a manner as possible:

 Use a strong authentication mechanism (e.g., public/private key pair, two factor authentication).
 Restrict which hosts can be used to remotely administer the mail server:

      –    Restrict by authorized users

      –    Restrict by IP address (not hostname); for example, access could be restricted to some or all hosts
           on the internal network, or hosts using the organization’s enterprise remote access solution

      Similar caution is needed for Web servers used for Web-based mail access. See NIST SP 800-44, Guidelines on Securing
      Public Web Servers, for additional information (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/).
