                                                                                GUIDE TO SECURE WEB SERVICES



Obligation: An operation specified in a policy or policy set that should be performed by the PEP in
conjunction with the enforcement of an authorization decision. [17]

Orchestration: Defines the sequence and conditions in which one Web service invokes other Web
services to realize some useful function. An orchestration is the pattern of interactions that a Web service
agent must follow to achieve its goal. [1]

Pairwise Trust: Establishment of trust by two entities that have direct business agreements with each
other. [3]

Penetration Testing: A method of testing where testers target individual binary components or the
application as a whole to determine whether intra or intercomponent vulnerabilities can be exploited to
compromise the application, its data, or its environment resources. [12]

Policy: Statements, rules or assertions that specify the correct or expected behavior of an entity. For
example, an authorization policy might specify the correct access control rules for a software component.
[14]

Policy Based Access Control (PBAC): A strategy for managing user access to one or more systems,
where the business roles of users is combined with policies to determine what access privileges users of
each role should have. Theoretical privileges are compared to actual privileges, and differences are
automatically applied. For example, a role may be defined for a manager. Specific types of accounts on
the single sign-on server, Web server, and database management system may be attached to this role.
Appropriate users are then attached to this role. [20]

Policy Decision Point (PDP): Mechanism that examines requests to access resources, and compares
them to the policy that applies to all requests for accessing that resource to determine whether specific
access should be granted to the particular requester who issued the request under consideration. [21]

Policy Enforcement Point (PEP): Mechanism (e.g., access control mechanism of a file system or Web
server) that actually protects (in terms of controlling access to) the resources exposed by Web services.
[21]

Provider: The entity (person or organization) that provides an appropriate agent, referred to as the
“provider agent” to implement a particular Web service. It will use the provider agent to exchange
messages with the requester’s requester agent. “Provider” is also used as a shorthand to refer to the
provider agent acting on the provider’s behalf. [22]

Proxy: An agent that acts on behalf of a requester to relay a message between a requester agent and a
provider agent. The proxy appears to the provider agent Web service to be the requester. [1]

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI): A set of policies, processes, server platforms, software and
workstations used for the purpose of administering certificates and public-private key pairs, including the
ability to issue, maintain, and revoke public key certificates. The PKI includes the hierarchy of certificate
authorities that allow for the deployment of digital certificates that support encryption, digital signature
and authentication to meet business and security requirements. [18], [7], [19]

Registry: An authoritative, centrally-controlled store of information. Web services use registries to
advertise their existence and to describe their interfaces and other attributes. Prospective clients query
registries to locate required services and to discover their attributes. [14]
