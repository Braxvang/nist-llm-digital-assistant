       INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING MATRIX                           ~ Cell 3.4F
 Training Area: System Life Cycle Security           — Implementation
 Functional Specialty: Use

 Definition   —       The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an FT system
                      from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                      model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                      Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                      ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                      needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                      The implementation phase is the installation of the system into the
                      operational environment in a manner that does not compromise the integrity
                      and effectiveness of the successfully tested security safeguards.

 Beliavioral Outcome      — Users   are able to identify and report security and efficiency concerns
                             encountered during normal operations.
