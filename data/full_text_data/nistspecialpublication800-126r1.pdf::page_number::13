                  The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



2.      SCAP 1.1 Conformance

SCAP 1.1 uses the following specifications:

 Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF) 1.1.4, a language for authoring
  security checklists/benchmarks and for reporting results of checklist evaluation [XCCDF]
 Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) 5.8, a language for representing system
  configuration information, assessing machine state, and reporting assessment results [OVAL]
 Open Checklist Interactive Language (OCIL) 2.0, a language for representing checks that collect
  information from people or from existing data stores made by other data collection efforts [OCIL]
 Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) 2.2, a nomenclature and dictionary of hardware, operating
  systems, and applications [CPE]
 Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) 5, a nomenclature and dictionary of software security
  configurations [CCE]
 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), a nomenclature and dictionary of security-related
  software flaws11 [CVE]
 Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) 2.0, a specification for measuring the relative
  severity of software flaw vulnerabilities [CVSS].
All references to these specifications within this document are to the version numbers listed above, unless
otherwise explicitly specified.

Combinations of these specifications can be used together for particular functions, such as security
configuration scanning. These functions, known as SCAP capabilities, are not product types, but rather
ways in which a product can use SCAP. The collective XML content used for a capability is called an
SCAP data stream, which is a specific instantiation of SCAP content. An SCAP source data stream holds
the input content, and an SCAP result data stream holds the output content. The major elements of a data
stream, such as the XCCDF portion or the OVAL patch portion, are referred to as stream components.

Products and organizations may want to claim conformance to one or more of the SCAP capabilities
within the SCAP 1.1 specification for a variety of reasons. For example, a product may want to assert that
it uses SCAP content properly and can interoperate with other products using valid SCAP content.
Another example is a policy mandating that an organization use SCAP for performing vulnerability
assessments and other security operations.

This section provides the high-level requirements that a product or SCAP content must meet for
conformance with the SCAP 1.1 specification. Most of the requirements listed in this section reference
other sections in the document that fully define the requirements.

2.1     Product Conformance

All IT products claiming conformance with the SCAP 1.1 specification SHALL adhere to the following
requirements:
