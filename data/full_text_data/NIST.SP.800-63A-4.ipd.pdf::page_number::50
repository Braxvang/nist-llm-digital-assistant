1314   7.1. Threat Mitigation Strategies
1315   Threats to the enrollment and identity proofing process are summarized in Table 2.
1316   Related mechanisms that assist in mitigating the threats identified above are summarized
1317   in Table 3. These mitigations should not be considered comprehensive but a summary of
1318   mitigations detailed more thoroughly at each Identity Assurance Level and applied based
1319   on the risk assessment processes detailed in [SP800-63] Sec. 5.
