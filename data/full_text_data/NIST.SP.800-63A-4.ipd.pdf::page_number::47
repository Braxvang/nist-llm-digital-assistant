1237   6.1. Subscriber Accounts
1238   With the exception of identity proofing for the purposes of providing one-time access
1239   to an online service, or when an applicant declines enrollment into an account, the CSP
1240    SHALL enroll the applicant as a subscriber into its identity service and establish a unique
1241   subscriber account for that subscriber following the successful identity proofing of an
1242   applicant.
1243   The CSP SHALL assign a unique identifier to each subscriber account.
1244   At a minimum the CSP SHALL include the following information in each subscriber
1245   account:
1246        • Unique identifier established for the subscriber
1247        • A record of the identity proofing steps completed for the subscriber in accordance
1248          with Sec. 5.1.1
1249        • Maximum IAL successfully achieved for the identity proofing of the subscriber
1250        • Subscriber consent provided for the processing, retention, or disclosure of any
1251          personal or sensitive information maintained in the subscriber account
1252        • All authenticators currently bound to the subscriber account, whether registered at
1253          enrollment or subsequent to enrollment
1254        • All attributes that were validated during the identity proofing process or in
1255          subsequent transactions to support RP access
1256   The CSP SHALL record information in the subscriber account that was collected during
1257   the identity proofing process or subsequently updated for each subscriber, including:
1258        • Validated identity evidence
1259        • Validated attribute information
1260        • Attribute information that was collected for enrollment in the CSP identity service
1261          that was not validated for identity proofing purposes
1262   The CSP SHALL perform a privacy risk assessment for the processing, retention, or
1263   disclosure of any personal information maintained in the subscriber account in accordance
1264   with Sec. 5.1.2.
