                                                            CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



5.2   Software Stack and Provider/Consumer Scope of Control

In SaaS, the cloud provider controls most of the software stack. Figure 10 illustrates how control and
management responsibilities are shared. In the center, the figure depicts a traditional software stack
comprising layers for the hardware, operating system, middleware, and application. The figure also
depicts an assignment of responsibility either to the cloud provider, the cloud consumer, or both.




                           Figure 10: SaaS Provider/Consumer Scope of Control

In the SaaS service model, a consumer possesses control over the application-specific resources that a
SaaS application makes available. For example, if a provider supplies an email application, the consumer
will typically have the ability to create, send, and store email messages. Figure 10 depicts this as "user
level" control. In some cases, a consumer also has limited administrative control of an application. For
example, in the example of an email application, selected consumers may have the ability to create email
accounts for other consumers, review the activities of other consumers, etc.

In contrast, a provider typically maintains significantly more administrative control at the application
level. A provider is responsible for deploying, configuring, updating, and managing the operation of the
application so that it provides expected service levels to consumers. A provider's responsibilities also
extend to enforcing acceptable usage policies, billing, problem resolution, etc. To discharge these
obligations a provider must exercise final authority over the application. Although a consumer may
possess limited administrative control, the control possessed by the consumer exists only at the discretion
of the provider.

The middleware layer depicted in Figure 10 provides software building blocks for the application. A
middleware layer can take a number of forms, ranging from: (1) traditional software libraries, to (2)
software interpreters (e.g., the Java Virtual Machine [Lind99] or the Python runtime environment [Pyt11]
or implementations of the Common Language Infrastructure [ISO/IEC 23271:2006]), to (3) invocations
of remote network services. Middleware components may provide database services, user authentication
services, identity management, account management, etc. In general, a cloud consumer needs and
possesses no direct access to this layer. Similarly, consumers require and generally possess no direct
access to the operating system layer or the hardware layer. Optionally, a provider may employ a Virtual
Machine Monitor (VMM) as part of the software stack. In this case (not shown in Figure 10), the VMM
resides between the hardware and the operating-system layers. A VMM can be a useful tool to help a
provider manage available hardware resources, however SaaS consumers do not require or generally
possess direct access to it.

5.3   Benefits

Compared with traditional computing and software distribution solutions, SaaS clouds provide scalability
and also shift significant burdens from consumers to providers, resulting in a number of opportunities for
greater efficiency and, in some cases, performance. The following sections describe five key benefits of
SaaS clouds.
