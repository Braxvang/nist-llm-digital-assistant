useful capability but can also become a source of vulnerability for an attacker to exploit. Overall, four
different classes of attacks against this framework exist: browser-oriented, server-oriented, network-
oriented, and user-oriented attacks. While our emphasis is on browser-oriented attacks, the other attack
classes are important because they may provide an avenue for launching a browser-oriented attack. Keep
in mind that other desktop applications, particularly email clients, often possess browser-like capabilities
that are susceptible to browser-oriented attacks. Users may also install unapproved network-enabled
applications, such as instant messaging clients, that can serve as a means for delivering active content
malware.

3.3.1   Browser-Oriented Attacks

Attacks can be launched against Web browser components and technologies with active content from a
Web server. The mobile code paradigm requires a browser to accept and execute code developed
elsewhere. The downloaded code containing malware may originate not only from the Web application
developer, but also from secondary sources such as banner ads used by many sites to direct one to a
product site, or uploaded user content made available through social networking sites [Goo08b, Nad07,
Pro08].

Malicious incoming code has two main methods of attack. The first is to gain unauthorized access to
computational resources residing at the browser (e.g., security options) or its underlying platform (e.g.,
system registry). The second is to use its authorized access based on the user’s identity in an unexpected
and disruptive fashion (e.g., invade privacy or deny service). Because browsers can support multiple
associations with different Web servers as separate windowed contexts, the mobile code of one context
can also target another context. Unauthorized access may occur simply through a lack of adequate access
control mechanisms or weak identification and authentication controls, which allow untrusted code to act
or masquerade as a trusted component.

Attackers may take advantage of browser vulnerabilities in mobile code execution environments. Once
access is gained, information residing at the platform can be disclosed or altered. Attackers may install
spyware, connect the platform to a botnet, or modify the platform’s configuration. Depending on the
level of access, complete control of the platform may be taken over by the mobile code. Even without
gaining unauthorized access to resources, malicious code can deny platform services to other processes by
exhausting computational resources, if resource constraints are not established or not set tightly.

3.3.2   Server-Oriented Attacks

Attacks can be launched against Web server components and technologies as the first stage of a larger
scheme. For example, a browser or other utility can be used to isolate and capture a response from a
server, which may be manipulated and fed back to the server in a subsequent request in an attempt to take
advantage of a Web application’s failure to sanitize user input. The objective is to induce the server to
perform unauthorized commands provided by the browser as user input, which in turn gains an attacker
access to sensitive information or control of the server. User-provided input might be passed to an
application interface that treats the input as part of a Structured Query Language (SQL) command to
retrieve sensitive data such as login information (i.e., SQL injection attack). Attackers may also inject
malicious custom code into a Web site’s content, and that code is subsequently served to the site’s users
(i.e., cross-site scripting [XSS] attack).

A compromised server can be used against browsers attempting to interact with it. Subtle changes
introduced into the Web server could radically change the server’s behavior, turning a trusted entity into a
malicious one [Car08]. The reliability of the output supplied (e.g., delivering incorrect results, malware,
