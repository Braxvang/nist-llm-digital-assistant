Information Technology Security Training Requirements


Awareness       —a   learning process that sets the stage for training by changing individual and
organizational attitudes to realize the importance of security and the adverse consequences of its
failure.



Awareness, Training, and Education Controls                     — include   (1) awareness programs which
set the stage for training by changing organizational attitudes to realize the importance of security
and the adverse consequences of its failure, (2) training which teaches people the skills that will
enable them to perform their jobs more effectively, and (3) education which is targeted for IT
security professionals and focuses on developing the ability and vision to perform complex,
multi-disciplinary activities.


Baseline Security        —     the minimum security controls required for safeguarding an FT system
based on its identified needs for confidentiality, integrity and/or availability protection.


Behavioral Outcome             — what an   individual who has completed the specific training module is
expected to be able to accomplish in terms of FT security-related job performance.


Certification     — a formal process      for testing components or systems against a specified set of
security requirements. Certification is normally performed by an independent reviewer rather
than one involved in building the system. Certification can be part of the review of security
controls identified in   OMB Circular A- 130, Appendix HI, which calls for security reviews to
assure that management, operational, and technical controls are appropriate and functioning
effectively.   ( See Accreditation.
