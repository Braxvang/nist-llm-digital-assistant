NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                     Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
December 2023                                                                            and Derived PIV Credential Issuers


   Identifier                                  Issuer Control                                                 Source

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                   (i) The issuance of the new PIV Card has been authorized (review).
                  (ii) The issuer ensures that the adjudicative entity has verified that there
                       is a PIV eligibility determination in an authoritative record in the
                       IDMS or the Central Verification System (review).
    MP-17       During reissuance, the issuer only releases the new PIV card to the              [FIPS201], Sec. 2.9.1 – PIV Card
    (NEW)       applicant after a positive biometric verification decision using the BIO-A or    Reissuance Requirements
                OCC-AUTH authentication mechanisms. If the biometric verification
                decision is negative or if no biometric data records are available, the
                cardholder provides two identity source documents, and an attending
                operator inspects them and compares the cardholder with the electronic
                facial image retrieved from the enrollment data record and the photograph
                printed on the new PIV Card.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                   (i) The new PIV Card is only released to the applicant after a positive
                       biometric verification decision (review, observe).
                  (ii) If the biometric verification decision is negative or if no biometric
                       data records are available, the cardholder provides two identity
                       source documents that are compared to the electronic facial image
                       retrieved from the enrollment data record and the photograph
                       printed on the new PIV Card (interview, observe).
    MP-18       During reissuance of a PIV Card, the following actions are taken: (i) a new [FIPS201], Sec. 2.9.1 – PIV Card
    (NEW)       PIV authentication certificate and a new card authentication certificate are Reissuance Requirements
                generated, (ii) the corresponding certificates are populated with the new
                FASC-N and card UUID, and (iii) a new digital signature key and
                associated certificate are generated for government-issued email accounts,
                while key management keys and associated certificates may be imported to
                the new PIV Card.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                   (i) A new PIV authentication key and certificate and card authentication
                       key and certificate are generated (review).
                  (ii) A new FASC-N and card UUID are generated to be populated on
                       the newly issued certificates (review).
                 (iii) A new digital signature key and certificate are issued (to be used for
                       government-issued email accounts) (review).
                 (iv) A new key management key and certificate are issued, or old key
                       management keys and certificates are imported on to the new PIV
                       Card (review, observe).
    MP-19       In the event of a name change, the following actions are taken prior to the [FIPS201], Sec. 2.9.1 – PIV Card
    (NEW)       card issuer issuing a new PIV Card: (i) the cardholder notifies the issuer  Reissuance Requirements
                that their name has changed and presents the card issuer with evidence of
                a formal name change, and (ii) the card issuer notifies the respective
                adjudicative entity of the name change to ensure that appropriate records
                are updated unless the expiration date of the new card is no later than the
                expiration of the old card and no data other that the cardholder’s name is
                being changed.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                  (i) The cardholder presents the issuer with evidence of a formal name
                      change (e.g., marriage certificate, divorce decree, judicial




                                                                87
