Appendix Aâ€”Glossary

Selected terms used in the Guide to SSL VPNs are defined below.

Access Control: The process of permitting or restricting access to applications at a granular level, such
as per-user, per-group, and per-resources.

Agent: A host-based IPS program that monitors and analyzes activity and performs preventive actions;
OR a program or plug-in that enables an SSL VPN to access non-Web-based applications and services.

Application Layer: Layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack that sends and receives data for particular
applications such as DNS, HTTP, and SMTP.

Application Translation: A function that converts information from one protocol to another.

Authentication: The process a VPN uses to limit access to protected services by forcing users to identify
themselves.

Availability: The ability for authorized users to access systems as needed.

Confidentiality: The ability to protect data so that unauthorized parties cannot view the data.

Customization: The ability to control the appearance of the SSL VPN Web pages that the users see
when they first access the VPN.

Data Link Layer: Layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack that handles communications on the physical
network components such as Ethernet.

Diffie-Hellman: A method used to securely exchange or establish secret keys across an insecure
network. Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman is used to create temporary or single-use secret keys.

Full Tunneling: A method that causes all network traffic to go through the tunnel to the organization.

Header: A portion of a packet that contains layer-specific information such as addresses.

High Availability: A failover feature to ensure availability during device or component interruptions.

Integrity: The ability to detect even minute changes in the data.

Network Extension: A method of providing partial or complete network access to remote users.

Network Layer: Layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack that is responsible for routing packets across
networks.

Payload: Consists of the information passed down from the previous layer.

Portal VPN: A single standard SSL connection to a Web site (the portal) that allows a remote user to
securely access multiple network services via a standard Web browser.

Proxy: An intermediary device or program that provides communication and other services between a
client and server.
