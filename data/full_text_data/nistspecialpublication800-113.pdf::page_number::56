                                                                                                        GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



     perspective. 18 It is therefore important to verify the specific functionality of an IPv6-compliant SSL
     VPN device as well as of all Web browsers that will connect to the SSL VPN. For example, an
     organization should verify if the SSL VPN device can serve as a reverse proxy for IPv6 applications
     and assign IPv6 addresses to network extension clients, or if it just passes IPv6 packets through.
 Incident Response. Organizations should consider how SSL VPN components may be affected by
  security-related incidents and create a design that supports effective and efficient incident response
  activities. For example, if an SSL VPN user’s system is compromised, this should necessitate
  disabling the user’s SSL VPN account.
 Log Management. Many organizations have security logging policies. SSL VPN devices should be
  configured so they log sufficient details regarding successful and failed login attempts to support
  troubleshooting and incident response activities. It is helpful for these logs to track which users log
  in, what type of browser they are logging in from, their IP address, what capabilities of the SSL VPN
  service they use, and why they may be denied from logging in (e.g., fail endpoint security because of
  outdated antivirus software). SSL VPN logging should adhere to the organization’s policies on log
  management, such as requiring copies of all log entries to be sent through a secure mechanism to
  centralized log servers and preserving all log entries for a certain number of days. Additional
  guidance on log management can be found in NIST SP 800-92, Guide to Computer Security Log
  Management. 19
 Redundancy. Organizations should carefully consider the need for a robust SSL VPN solution that
  can survive the failure of one or more components, even if high availability or load balancing is
  already part of the VPN design. If the SSL VPN solution is supporting critical functions within the
  organization, redundancy should also be considered for supporting systems such as authentication
  servers and directory servers.
 End-to-end SSL VPNs. If the corporate policy requires network connections to be protected from
  end-to-end, VPN devices that can create SSL connections to internal hosts via proxy must have this
  functionality turned off. This is due to the encryption being removed by the VPN gateway, which
  breaks the end-to-end requirement even if the same gateway re-encrypts the connection to the
  endpoint.
4.3.7    Summary of Design Decisions

Table 4-3 provides a checklist that summarizes the major design decisions made during the first two
phases of the SSL VPN planning and implementation process.

Identify Requirements
                 Determine the resources to be made accessible by SSL VPN.
                 Determine who must access the resources.
                 Identify other current and future VPN-related requirements.
                 Consider the possible technical solutions and select the one that best meets the identified
                 requirements.
