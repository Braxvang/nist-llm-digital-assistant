                         without the application of decryption.
Private key              A cryptographic key, used with a public-key cryptographic
                         algorithm that is uniquely associated with an entity and is not
                         made public. In an asymmetric (public) cryptosystem, the
                         private key is associated with a public key. Depending on the
                         algorithm, the private key may be used to:
                          1. Compute the corresponding public key,
                          2. Compute a digital signature that may be verified by the
                              corresponding public key,
                          3. Decrypt data that was encrypted by the corresponding
                              public key, or
                          4. Compute a piece of common shared data, together with
                              other information.
Protocol                 A special set of rules used by two or more entities that describe
                         the message order and data structures for information
                         exchanged between the entities.
Public key               A cryptographic key used with a public-key cryptographic
                         algorithm that is uniquely associated with an entity and that
                         may be made public. In an asymmetric (public) cryptosystem,
                         the public key is associated with a private key. The public key
                         may be known by anyone and, depending on the algorithm, may
                         be used to:
                          1. Verify a digital signature that is signed by the
                             corresponding private key,
                          2. Encrypt data that can be decrypted by the corresponding
                             private key, or
                          3. Compute a piece of shared data.
Public-key               A cryptographic algorithm that uses two related keys, a public
(asymmetric)             key and a private key. The two keys have the property that
cryptographic            determining the private key from the public key is
algorithm                computationally infeasible.
Public-key certificate   A set of data that uniquely identifies an entity, contains the
                         entity's public key and possibly other information, and is
                         digitally signed by a trusted party, thereby binding the public
                         key to the entity.
Public Key               A framework that is established to issue, maintain and revoke
Infrastructure (PKI)     public-key certificates.
Reconstitute             Rebuilding a service system (possibly with a different
                         infrastructure) using previously saved security information
                         and/or keying material, rather than simply restarting a system
                         from a backup.
Rekey                    A new key replaces another key; the “value” of the new key is
                         entirely independent of the “value” of the old key.
