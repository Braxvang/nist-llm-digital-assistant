         Note: Metadata enables identification and traceability to support the analysis of completeness
         and consistency to determine security impact when requirements change.

SR-3     ANALYZE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
         SR-3.1 Analyze the complete set of system requirements in consideration of security concerns.
         Note: Requirements are analyzed to ensure that they fully and properly capture security
         protection and security-constraint considerations. Rationale is captured to support analysis
         conclusions and provide a basis to conclude that the analysis has the proper perspective and is
         fully aware of assumptions made. See Appendix C.
         SR-3.2 Define security-driven performance and assurance measures that enable the
                assessment of technical achievement.
         Note: Each security-driven performance measure (e.g., measure of performance and technical
         performance measure) is analyzed to help ensure that system requirements are met, and that
         project cost, schedule, or performance risks associated with any non-compliance are identified.
         SR-3.3 Provide feedback from the analyzed system requirements to applicable stakeholders for
                security-relevant reviews.
         SR-3.4 Resolve system requirements security issues.

SR-4     MANAGE THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
         SR-4.1 Obtain explicit agreement that system requirements express protection needs.
         SR-4.2 Record key security-relevant system requirement decisions and the rationale.
         SR-4.3 Maintain traceability of system requirements to their security-relevant aspects.
         Note: The traceability of system requirements to protection needs; stakeholder requirements;
         architecture elements; interface definitions; analysis results; verification methods; allocated,
         decomposed, and derived requirements (in their system, system element, security protection,
         and security-driven constraint forms); risk and loss tolerance; and assurance and
         trustworthiness objectives is maintained.
         SR-4.4 Provide the security-relevant artifacts that have been selected for baselines.

H.4.     System Architecture Definition
The purpose of the System Architecture Definition process is to generate system architecture
alternatives, to select one or more alternative(s) that frame stakeholder concerns and meet system
requirements, and to express this in a set of consistent views and models.
