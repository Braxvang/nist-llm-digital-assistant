It should be noted that HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT is a suite that is widely
implemented and often set as the default choice. However, it shall not be used for federal
implementations. Since TSIG message authentication is used between servers where
there is an existing trust relationship, the administrators must agree on the method used
and the secret (random) string used with the TSIG method.

Due to message size constraints (See Section 8.1.4 below), large RSA keys may result in
DNS transaction failures that are often interpreted by clients as DNS failures. It is
recommended that, instead, a digital signature algorithm that has the same security
strength, but with smaller sized keys be used, such as ECDSA [RFC 6605]. It is
recommended that DNS administrators plan to migrate to ECDSA for zone signing by
October 1, 2015, or plan to migrate earlier as soon as it becomes available in DNS
software components.

8.1.4 Special Considerations for Key Sizes
There are some special considerations needed when choosing the size of the RSA
DNSSEC signing keys. Early deployments have shown that large RSA keys can result in
protocol issues, such as response messages that are too large to fit in a standard UDP
packet. DNSSEC requires the use of larger DNS packet sizes up to 4 KB, but practical
limits are around 1500 bytes or less.

It is recommended that DNS administrators maintain 1024-bit RSA/SHA-1 and/or
RSA/SHA-256 ZSKâ€™s until October 1, 2015, or until it is proven that the majority of
routers, caches and other network middle boxes can handle packet sizes over 1500 bytes
(if before 2015). However, 1024-bit RSA keys are allowed until the 2015 date to
accommodate older versions of DNS clients that may be older network components that
cannot handle UDP packets with sizes over 1500 bytes. This is an exception to the
security guidance provided in [SP 800-131A]. However, this exception on RSA key sizes

 Generic Security Service Algorithm for Secret Key Transaction Authentication (GSS-TSIG [RFC3645])
may be found in some server implementations.
