Authentication information type. This can result in assignment of a moderate impact level to
such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for disclosure of staff acquisition information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of staff acquisition information
depends mostly on the criticality of the information with respect to agency mission, protection of
agency assets, and safety of individuals. Although there can be serious short-term effects for
individuals, the effects of modifications or deletion of this information are generally limited with
respect to agency mission capabilities or assets.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for staff
acquisition information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to staff acquisition information. Staff
acquisition processes are generally tolerant of delay. Typically, disruption of staff acquisition
information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
staff acquisition information is low.
C.3.3.3 Organization & Position Management Information Type

Organization and Position Management designs, develops, and implements organizational and
position structures that create a high-performance, competency-driven framework that both
advances the agency mission and serves agency human capital needs. The recommended
provisional security categorization for organization and position management information is as
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of organization and
position management information on the ability of responsible agencies to design, develop, and
implement organizational and position structures creating a high-performance, competency-
driven framework that both advances the agency mission and serves agency human capital needs.
In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of organization and position management information
will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where more sensitive information is
involved, it will probably be personal information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974. The
