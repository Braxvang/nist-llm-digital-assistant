SI-5      SECURITY ALERTS AND ADVISORIES

          Control: The organization receives information system security alerts/advisories on a regular basis,
          issues alerts/advisories to appropriate personnel, and takes appropriate actions in response.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization documents the types of actions to be taken in response to
          security alerts/advisories. The organization also maintains contact with special interest groups
          (e.g., information security forums) that: (i) facilitate sharing of security-related information (e.g.,
          threats, vulnerabilities, and latest security technologies); (ii) provide access to advice from security
          professionals; and (iii) improve knowledge of security best practices. NIST Special Publication
          800-40 provides guidance on monitoring and distributing security alerts and advisories.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to make security alert and advisory information
                available throughout the organization as needed.


           LOW SI-5                      MOD SI-5                   HIGH SI-5 (1)



SI-6      SECURITY FUNCTIONALITY VERIFICATION

          Control: The information system verifies the correct operation of security functions [Selection (one
          or more): upon system startup and restart, upon command by user with appropriate privilege,
          periodically every [Assignment: organization-defined time-period]] and [Selection (one or more):
          notifies system administrator, shuts the system down, restarts the system] when anomalies are
          discovered.
          Supplemental Guidance: The need to verify security functionality applies to all security functions.
          For those security functions that are not able to execute automated self-tests, the organization
          either implements compensating security controls or explicitly accepts the risk of not performing
          the verification as required.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to provide notification of failed automated
                security tests.
          (2)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to support management of distributed security
                testing.
