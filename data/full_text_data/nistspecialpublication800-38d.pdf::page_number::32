The following considerations are specific to the deterministic construction:

   •   How are the device identifiers installed into the fixed field so that compliance with the
       requirements on the fixed field in Sec. 8.2.1 is ensured, both for the initially deployed
       modules and for any subsequent deployed modules?

   •   Is the length of the invocation field sufficient to support all of the invocations that can
       occur in any module during the lifetime of any key, as discussed in the first bullet in Sec.
       8.3?

   •   For any given key and IV length, is the length of the fixed field sufficient to support the
       number of modules that will implement authenticated encryption, as discussed in the
       second bullet in Sec. 8.3?

   •   If the default setting for the lengths of the fixed field and the invocation field can be
       altered, then how is the choice enforced across all modules with any given key?

The following consideration is specific to the RBG-based construction:

   •   How are the RBGs for IV generation initialized so that compliance is ensured with the
       independence requirement in Sec. 8.2.2, for the initially deployed modules and for any
       subsequent deployed modules?

10 Conformance

The two categories of implementations that may claim conformance with this Recommendation
are GCM and GMAC.

Implementations may restrict the bit lengths of the plaintext, AAD, IVs, and authentication tags
that it supports, as discussed in Secs. 5.2.1.1 and 5.2.1.2 above. Although such restrictions may
affect interoperability, only the elimination of the plaintext altogether, i.e., GMAC, is considered
as a distinct category of implementation.

For every algorithm that is specified in this Recommendation, a conforming implementation may
replace the given set of steps with any mathematically equivalent sets of steps. In other words,
different procedures that produce the correct output for any input are permitted.
