NIST SP 800-85A-4                                                  PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                            INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

The following assumptions have been made with regard to the PIV Card command interface
test cases:
      +    The PIV Card being tested (IUT) is inserted into the contact reader or placed near a
           contactless reader.
      +    A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test system and an instance of the
           reader.
      +    No application is currently connected to the PIV Card Application.
      +    No other contactless card is within the proximity of the contactless reader.
5.4       PIV Data Objects Accessibility and Storage Test Assertions

The following assumptions have been made with respect to the PIV data object
representation test assertions:
      +    A PIV Card Application with a valid Application Identifier (AID) is resident on the
           card.
      +    The PIV Card Application is expected to have implemented all seven mandatory PIV
           data objects of the PIV data model on the card.
      +    The PIV Card Application is expected to have implemented both conditionally
           mandatory PIV data objects 3 of the PIV data model on the card.
      +    The presence of any one or more of the twenty-seven optional PIV data objects on the
           PIV Card is known from the vendor documentation.




3
    The two data objects that are conditionally mandatory, that is mandatory only if the cardholder has a
    government-issued email account at the time of credential issuance, are the X.509 Certificate for
    Digital Signature and the X.509 Certificate for Key Management.
