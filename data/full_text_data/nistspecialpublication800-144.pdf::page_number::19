   Staff Specialization. Cloud providers, just as other organizations with large-scale
    computing facilities, have an opportunity for staff to specialize in security, privacy, and
    other areas of high interest and concern to the organization. Increases in the scale of
    computing induce specialization, which in turn allows security staff to shed other duties
    and concentrate exclusively on security and privacy issues. Through increased
    specialization, there is an opportunity for staff members to gain in-depth experience and
    training, take remedial actions, and make improvements to security and privacy more
    readily than otherwise would be possible with a more diverse set of duties.

   Platform Strength. The structure of cloud computing platforms is typically more
    uniform than that of most traditional computing centers. Greater uniformity and
    homogeneity facilitate platform hardening and enable better automation of security
    management activities like configuration control, vulnerability testing, security audits,
    and security patching of platform components. Information assurance and security
    response activities also profit from a uniform, homogeneous cloud infrastructure, as do
    system management activities, such as fault management, load balancing, and system
    maintenance. Similarly, infrastructure homogeneity benefits management controls
    employed to protect privacy. On the other hand, homogeneity means that a single flaw
    will be manifested throughout the cloud, potentially impacting all tenants and services.
    Many cloud computing environments meet standards for operational compliance and
    certification in areas such as healthcare (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and
    Accountability Act (HIPAA)), finance (e.g., Payment Card Industry Data Security
    Standard (PCI DSS)), security (e.g., ISO 27001, Information Security Management
    Systems - Requirements), and audit (e.g., Standards for Attestation Engagements
    (SSAE) No. 16), and may attain formal certification or attestation from an independent
    third party, to impart a level of assurance with regard to some recognized and generally
    accepted criteria.

   Resource Availability. The scalability of cloud computing facilities allows for greater
    availability. Redundancy and disaster recovery capabilities are built into cloud
    computing environments and on-demand resource capacity can be used for better
    resilience when faced with increased service demands or distributed denial of service
    attacks, and for quicker recovery from serious incidents. When an incident occurs, an
    opportunity also exists to contain attacks and capture event information more readily,
    with greater detail and less impact on production. Availability can also bolster privacy
    through better opportunities for individuals to access and correct records and for records
    to be ready for use when needed for the purposes collected [CIO10b]. In some cases,
    however, such resiliency and capacity can have a downside. For example, an
    unsuccessful distributed denial of service attack can quickly consume large amounts of
    resources to defend against, which could inflict financial damage to an organization, if
    charges for increased usage in such situations are upheld. Access to vast amounts of
    inexpensive storage may also engender more information to be collected than needed or
    information to be retained longer than necessary.

   Backup and Recovery. The backup and recovery policies and procedures of a cloud
    provider may be superior to those of the organization and may be more robust. Data
