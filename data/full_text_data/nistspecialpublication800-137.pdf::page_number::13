ISCM is a tactic in a larger strategy of organization-wide risk management. 9 Organizations
increase situational awareness through enhanced monitoring capabilities and subsequently
increase insight into and control of the processes used to manage organizational security.
Increased insight into and control of security processes in turn enhances situational awareness.
Therefore, the process of implementing ISCM is recursive. ISCM informs and is informed by
distinct organizational security processes and associated requirements for input and output of
security-related information. Consider the following example:

Security-related information pertaining to a system component inventory is used to determine
compliance with CM-8 Information System Component Inventory. 10 The information is assessed
to determine whether or not the control is effective, (i.e., if the inventory is accurate). If found to
be inaccurate, an analysis to determine the root cause of the inaccuracy is initiated (e.g., perhaps a
process for connecting components to the network has been ignored or is out of date, asset
management tools are not operating as expected, or the organization is under attack). Based on
the analysis, responses are initiated as appropriate (e.g., responsible parties update inventory,
update relevant organizational processes, train employees, disconnect errant devices, etc.).
Additionally, security-related information pertaining to a system component inventory may be
used to support predefined metrics. More accurate system component inventories support
improved effectiveness of other security domains such as patch management and vulnerability
management.

This example illustrates how data collected in assessing a security control is leveraged to
calculate a metric and provide input into various organizational processes. It further illustrates
that a problem, once detected, can trigger an assessment of one or more controls across an
organization, updates to relevant security-related information, modifications to the organizational
security program plan and security processes, and improved compliance to the security program
and applicable system security plan. The end result is improved organization-wide risk
management and continual improvement limited only by the speed with which the organization
can collect information and respond to findings.

2.1     ORGANIZATION-WIDE VIEW OF IS CM
Maintaining an up-to-date view of information security risks across an organization is a complex,
multifaceted undertaking. It requires the involvement of the entire organization, from senior
leaders providing governance and strategic vision to individuals developing, implementing, and
operating individual information systems in support of the organizationâ€™s core missions and
business functions. Figure 2-1 illustrates a tiered approach to organization-wide ISCM in support
of risk management. Tier 1 governance, risk management goals, and organizational risk tolerance
drive the ISCM strategy. Organizational risk tolerance established by senior executives/leaders as
part of the risk executive (function)11 influences ISCM policy, procedures, and implementation
activities across all tiers. Data collection primarily occurs at the information systems tier. Metrics
are designed to present information in a context that is meaningful for each tier. For example,
ISCM data collected at Tier 3 may be aggregated to provide security status or risk scores for a
single system, for a collection of systems, across a core business process, or for the entire
organization. Policies, procedures, and tools may be established at any tier; however, when
