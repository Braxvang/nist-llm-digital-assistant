NIST SP 800-82r3                                         Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            Encryption can also be used on hard local storage to protect information
            at rest. Full disk encryption is recommended for portable laptops and
            devices. Organizations may also want to consider encrypting folders that
            contain sensitive files.
            Organizations must also consider that encryption can negatively impact
            other defense tools, such as network monitoring. For example, an IDS
            might not be able to determine whether an encrypted packet is malicious,
            resulting in either false-positive or false-negative alerts.
            Organizations should also create procedures to manage changes to
            control logic to protect against the risk that improperly tested or
            malicious changes to logic could disrupt the system.

       Additional Cybersecurity Architecture Considerations
Organizations should include considerations for supporting cyber-related safety, availability,
geographically distributed systems, environmental considerations, and regulatory requirements
into the security architecture designs and implementations for OT and IIoT environments. The
following subsections discuss these considerations in more detail.

5.3.1. Cyber-Related Safety Considerations
OT systems are generally designed with specific safety goals, depending on both the business
environment and regulatory requirements. Organizations should consider whether the additional
communication and cybersecurity requirements of safety systems (e.g., segmentation and the
isolation of safety systems from other OT systems) is required. Additionally, safety requirements
can influence the selection of security mechanisms. For example, safety considerations may
require that an organization use physical separation as opposed to logical separation.
OT systems typically employ fail-to-a-known-state design (i.e., fail-safe design) in the event of
an unexpected situation or a component failure. Fail-safe design considers placing the equipment
or process in a safe state that prevents injury to individuals or the destruction of property and
avoids cascading events or secondary hazards. Cyber-related events, such as the loss of network
communications, could trigger these fail-safe events. To minimize false positives, organizations
should define the thresholds at which OT components can operate with reduced or disrupted
capabilities, such as lost network communications.

5.3.2. Availability Considerations
Operational continuity management requires managing availability at multiple levels, including
data, applications, IT infrastructure, power, and other supporting utilities (e.g., HVAC, water,
steam, compressed air, etc.). The failure of these systems can have a cascading effect on OT
systems and can adversely impact the OT operation. Different availability considerations are
presented below.
