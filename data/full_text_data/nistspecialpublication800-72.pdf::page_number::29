                                                                          Guidelines on PDA Forensics



4. Procedures and Principles

       Investigations and incidents are handled in various ways depending upon the circumstances of
       the incident, the gravity of the incident, and the preparation and experience of the investigation
       team. Digital investigations are comparable to crime scenes where investigative techniques
       used by law enforcement have been applied as a foundation for the creation of procedures used
       when dealing with digital evidence. This section provides an overview of various procedural
       models and principles that have been proposed.

4.1   Roles and Responsibilities

       Whatever the type of incident, the various types of roles involved are similar. Planning for
       incidents should address how existing personnel fulfill these roles when responding and
       conducting an investigation. A generic set of roles and associated responsibilities can be
       identified. They include First Responders, Investigators, Technicians, Forensic Examiners,
       and Forensic Analysts. In a given situation, a single individual may perform more than one
       role. Nevertheless, distinguishing distinct roles and their associated responsibilities is useful.

       First Responders are trained personnel who arrive first on the scene of an incident, provide an
       initial assessment, and begin the appropriate level of response. The responsibilities of First
       Responders are to secure the incident scene, call for the appropriate support needed, and assist
       with evidence collection.

       Investigators plan and manage preservation, acquisition, examination, analysis, and reporting
       of electronic evidence. The Lead Investigator is in charge of making sure that activities at the
       scene of an incident are executed in the right order and at the right time. The Lead Investigator
       may be responsible for developing the evidence, preparing a case report, and briefing any
       findings and determinations to senior officials.

       Technicians carry out actions at the direction of the Lead Investigator. Technicians are
       responsible for identifying and collecting evidence and documenting the incident scene. They
       are specially trained personnel who seize electronic equipment and acquire digital images
       resident within memory. More than one technician is typically involved in an incident,
       because different skills and knowledge are needed. Sufficient expertise should be available at
       the scene to address all distinct digital apparatus involved in the incident.

       Evidence Custodians protect all evidence gathered that is stored in a central location. They
       accept evidence collected by Technicians, ensure it is properly tagged, check it into and out of
       protective custody, and maintain a strict chain of custody.

       Forensic Examiners are specially trained personnel who reproduce images acquired from
       seized equipment and recover digital data. Examiners make the information on the device
       visible. Examiners may also acquire more elusive data using highly specialized equipment,
       intensive reverse engineering, or other appropriate means unavailable to Forensic Technicians.

       Forensic Analysts evaluate the product of the Forensic Examiner for its significance and
       probative value to the case.
