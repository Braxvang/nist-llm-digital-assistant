      NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                                  Enrollment and Identity Proofing


425   4.    Identity Resolution, Validation, and Veriﬁcation
426   This section is normative.
427   This section provides and overview of the identity proofing and enrollment process as
428   well as requirements to support the resolution, validation, and verification of the identity
429   claimed by an applicant. It also provides guidelines on additional aspects of the identity
430   proofing process. These requirements are intended to ensure that the claimed identity
431   exists in the real world and that the applicant is the individual associated with that identity.
432   Collectively, the elements of the identity proofing process are designed to ensure that
433   attacks against a CSP’s identity service that affect a large number of enrolled subscribers
434   require greater time and cost than the value of the data being protected.
435   Additionally, these guidelines provide for multiple methods by which resolution,
436   validation, and verification can be completed as well as multiple types of identity
437   evidence that may support the identity proofing process. To the extent practical, CSPs
438   and organizations SHOULD enable optionality when implementing their identity proofing
439   services and processes to promote access for those with different means, capabilities,
440   and technology access. At a minimum, this SHOULD include accepting multiple types
441   and combinations of identity evidence, supporting multiple data validation sources,
442   enabling multiple methods for verifying identity (e.g., use of trusted referees), multiple
443   channels for engagement (e.g., in-person, remote), and offering assistance mechanisms
444   for applicants (e.g., applicant references).

445   4.1. Identity Prooﬁng and Enrollment
446   This document describes the common pattern in which an applicant undergoes an identity
447   proofing and enrollment process whereby their identity evidence and attributes are
448   collected, uniquely resolved to a single identity within a given population or context, then
449   validated and verified. See [SP800-63] for details on how to choose the most appropriate
450   IAL. A CSP can then bind these attributes to an authenticator (described in [SP800-63B]).
451   The objective of identity proofing is to ensure, to a stated level of certainty, the applicant
452   is who they claim to be. Identity proofing is not conducted to determine suitability or
453   entitlement to benefits. The identity proofing process involves the presentation and
454   validation of the minimum attributes necessary to accomplish identity proofing. There
455   can be many different sets of attributes that suffice as the minimum, so CSPs choose this
456   set by considering applicants’ privacy and the usability, as well as the likely attributes
457   needed in future uses of the digital identity. For example, such attributes, to the extent
458   they are the minimum necessary, could include:
459        1. Full name
460        2. Date of birth
461        3. Home address
