•   Documentation (e.g., text file) that guides the checklist user to manually configure software;

•   Documents that explain the recommended methods to securely install and configure a device;
    and

•   Policy documents that set forth guidelines for such activities as auditing, authentication
    security (e.g., passwords), and perimeter security.
Not all instructions in a security configuration checklist are for security settings. Checklists can
also include administrative practices for an IT product that go hand in hand with improvements to
the product's security. Often, successful attacks on systems are the direct result of poor
administrative practices such as not changing default passwords or failure to apply new patches.

A checklist comparison can also be performed as part of auditing and continuous monitoring of
deployed systems’ security, to ensure that the baseline configurations are maintained. It is not
normally sufficient to configure a computer once and assume that the settings will be maintained;
settings may change as software is installed, upgraded, and patched, or as computers are
connected and disconnected from domains. Users might also alter security settings, such as in the
case of a user who feels that a locking screen saver is inconvenient and hence turns the feature
off.

D.4 REFERENCE MODEL
Organizations can use the technologies, specifications, and reference data sources discussed in
Appendix D in an integrated manner to architect an ISCM technical implementation that
maximizes the use of security-related information and promotes consistency in the planning and
implementation of ISCM. Where possible, this ISCM technical implementation automates the
collection, aggregation and analysis, and reporting and presentation of data that is necessary to
support organization-defined metrics.

However, organizations face significant challenges in integrating these technologies to enable
ISCM. Organizations typically use a diverse set of security products from multiple vendors. Thus
it is necessary to extract security-related information (ideally in the form of raw system state data)
from these tools and to normalize that data so that it is comparable (at tier 3 level and at tiers 2
and 1). A tier 3 capability is created to enable querying and reporting on the data aggregated from
multiple tools covering multiple ISCM security automation domains. Since there are often many
local tier 3 repositories covering different parts of a large enterprise, the tier 3 ISCM repositories
regularly report data to tier 2 repositories, likely following a hierarchical architecture. The tier 2
repositories in turn report data to tier 1 repositories that may report data to even higher level
users. As this data is passed up the ISCM hierarchy, it is abstracted since it is not usually possible
or advisable to replicate all low level security-related information at all tiers in the hierarchy.
Higher tier users query the lower level tiers to retrieve data. One challenge is the need for a
technical mechanism to allow a higher tier query to be passed to lower tier ISCM instances for
fulfillment. Another challenge is that in conducting query fulfillment, the lower tier ISCM
instances may need to perform analysis of raw data to generate the results. These results may be
findings (comparison of raw data against policy) or scores (numerical evaluation of a set of
findings) and so a mechanism in the query by which to convey the desired analysis that is to be
performed is needed. Ideally, if the requested data is not available at tier 3, then the tier 3 ISCM
instance tasks its diverse security tools to collect the requested data.
