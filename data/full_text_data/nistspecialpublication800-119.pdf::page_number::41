                                                               GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6




                               Figure 3-9. IPv6 Extension Header Chaining9

Figure 3-9 illustrates further how the NH field in the IPv6 packet header points to the following header in
a chain of NHs, which defines the different parts of the payload in the packet. In this example, the NH
field of the last extension header in the packet contains the type of the upper-layer protocol, e.g., TCP
(value 6) or UDP (value 17). See Table 3-4 for the most common NH values. The IPv6 specification
(RFC 2460) defines six NH values or extension headers. Other extension headers such as the Mobility
Header are defined elsewhere.

        Hop-by-Hop Option header. NH value of 0 in the IPv6 base header. This header must occur
         first and is used to carry optional information that must be examined by every node along a
         packet’s delivery path. When the NH value is zero, then the node knows to examine the
         contents of one or more options contained in the extension header. An example is the
         Jumbogram IPv6 option, which allows IPv6 to transport packets larger than normal.
         Jumbograms are discussed in Section 4.5.
