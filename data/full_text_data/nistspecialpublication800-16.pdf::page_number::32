plan silent reading as well as lecturing, who include small group problem-solving, large group
debate, brainstorming, blackboard diagraming and other visual aids will have something for
everyone and in so doing will eliminate the "yawn factor." The implications for courseware
developers is that there is substantial benefit in using flexible presentation formats (e.g.,
multimedia, searchable databases, text, graphics, simulations, team teaching, decision trees and
interactive learning).   A training program as a whole should ideally include a range of delivery
approaches. These could include, in addition to classroom instruction and computer-based
instruction, such options as manuals and self-paced instruction books, videotapes, interactive
workshops with "hands-on" exercises, and one-on-one mentoring/coaching by senior staff.

Education and prior experience: Materials developers and trainers should consider the likely
education and experience of their target audience and adjust their presentation approach and
content accordingly. An individual with an advanced degree will perceive and learn new
material in a manner that is different from an individual without a degree but who has extensive
on-the-job experience. For example, individuals with more than 15 years of employment (e.g.,
an older audience) are less likely to be familiar with or comfortable with technology-oriented
teaching techniques. However, if the target audience primarily consists of individuals who have
recently graduated from college or high school (e.g., a younger audience), then increasing the
proportion of material delivered through multimedia or computer-based instruction may be
appropriate, as today's students are generally more experienced with these teaching approaches.
The actual job functions of the target audience should also be considered when developing
                                                                                                      ^
training materials and selecting teaching methodologies. For example, if instruction relating to
the IT security countermeasures of a network server is being presented to an audience of system
administrators, then a multi-day, hands-on approach might be most effective. If the same
material is to be presented to a group of system designers, then a 2-hour lecture may be
sufficient.


2.4.2 Additional Considerations for Adult Learning


Course developers and trainers should also be aware that adults have well established     —not
formative   — values, beliefs, and opinions. Individuals have individual learning style preferences
and adults may have had differing education, varying years of experience, and a wealth of
previously learned information which they bring to the learning venue. Adults relate new
information and knowledge to previously learned information, experiences, and
values   —sometimes   consciously, sometimes unconsciously    — ^thus, misperception and miscom-

munication can occur unless instructors make the effort to draw students out. This can be done
(at least in a classroom setting) by balancing the presentation of new material with student

sharing of relevant experiences. Instructors can help to make connections between various
student opinions and ideas, while focusing class effort on integration of the new knowledge or
skill with respect to its application.
