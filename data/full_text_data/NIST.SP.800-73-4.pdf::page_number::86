3.2       PIV Card Application Card Commands for Authentication

  3.2.1      VERIFY Card Command

The VERIFY card command initiates the comparison in the card of the reference data indicated by the
key reference with authentication data in the data field of the command.

Key reference '80' specific to the PIV Card Application (i.e., local key references) and, optionally, the
Global PIN with key reference '00', the OCC data (key references '96' and '97'), and pairing code (key
reference '98') are the only key references that may be verified by the PIV Card Application’s VERIFY
command. The PIV Card Application may allow other key references to be verified by the PIV Card
Application’s VERIFY command, if they are used for card management operations.

Key reference '80' shall be able to be verified by the PIV Card Application VERIFY command. If the PIV
Card Application does not contain the Discovery Object as described in Part 1, then no other key
reference shall be able to be verified by the PIV Card Application VERIFY command. If the PIV Card
Application contains the Discovery Object, then the ability of the PIV Card Application’s VERIFY
command to verify key references '00', '96', '97', and '98' shall be as specified by the first byte of the
Discovery Object’s PIN Usage Policy value:

      •    If Bit 6 is one, then key reference '00' shall be able to be verified by the PIV Card Application
           VERIFY command.

      •    If Bit 5 is one, then key references '96' and/or '97', as specified in the Biometric Information
           Templates Group Template, shall be able to be verified by the PIV Card Application VERIFY
           command.

      •    If Bit 4 is one, then key reference '98' shall be able to be verified by the PIV Card Application
           VERIFY command.

If any key reference value is specified that cannot be verified by the PIV Card Application, then the PIV
Card Application shall return the status word '6A 88'.

The VERIFY command may be submitted over the contact interface and, under some conditions, over the
contactless interface. The card command shall fail if:

      •    the key reference is '00' or '80' and the command is not submitted over either the contact interface
           or the VCI, or

      •    the key reference is '96', '97', or '98' and the command is submitted over the contactless interface
           without secure messaging.
