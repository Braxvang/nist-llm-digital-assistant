A zone transfer process has different security implications because it reveals a lot more information than a
normal DNS Query and because of the increased resource (bandwidth and response time) usage of the
message. The threats to a zone transfer transaction are discussed in Section 6.2. The protection
mechanisms are discussed in sections 8.1.2 and 8.2.5.

4.3       Dynamic Updates

As enterprises add, delete, and move around IP-network-based resources (i.e., database servers, Web
servers, mail servers, and even name servers), corresponding changes may need to be made to the zone
file that carries information about the domains where the resources are located. In the early days of the
DNS, DNS zone administrators made such changes manually. When such changes became larger in
volume and more frequent, however, the manual update process was found to be inadequate, and the
concept of dynamic updates was introduced. Apart from volume and frequency, there are some
applications that require instant automatic updates to the DNS zone file through application programs.
Examples of these applications include Certificate Authority (CA) servers, Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol (DHCP) servers, and Internet multicast address servers. Dynamic Updates are always made to
the zone file of the primary (master) name server.

In a few instances, the DNS server is used as a repository for public key certificates. In these instances, a
CA server receives a public key from a user, signs it with its private key to generate a certificate, and
stores this certificate as a CERT or TLSA [DANE] RR in a DNS server. A DHCP server dynamically
assigns an IP address to a requesting host, and then adds this information (host and newly assigned IP
address) as an A-type RR in the DNS authoritative name server. The DHCP server also deletes this A-
type RR after the IP address is returned by the host. An Internet multicast server selects a new multicast
IP address from the Internet multicast IP address space and assigns it to the newly generated multicast
group. Then the server adds this information (domain name of multicast group, newly selected multicast
address) as an A-type RR in the DNS database so that users can join the multicast group using a user
friendly domain name rather than an IP address.

RFC 2136 [RFC2136] outlines the roadmap for the dynamic update mechanism, which subsequently was
implemented in BIND 8 version and has continued in all versions since.

The dynamic update facility provides operations for addition and deletion of RRs in the zone file.
Because updates to the contents of an existing RR can be accomplished through deletion of the old record
and addition of the new record with the changed contents, no separate update operation is provided.

The suite of operations included in the dynamic update facility consists of the following:

      •    Add or delete individual RRs for an existing domain

      •    Delete specific RRsets (a set of resource records with the same owner name, class, and RRType
           [e.g., a set of RRs with RRType NS for the domain/owner name example.com with the common
           class IN of course]) for an existing domain

      •    Delete an existing domain (all resource records for a given domain name [e.g., all RRs for the
           domain example.com])

      •    Add a new domain (one or more RRs for a new domain [e.g., adding an A-type RR for a new
           domain NYBranch.example.com]).
