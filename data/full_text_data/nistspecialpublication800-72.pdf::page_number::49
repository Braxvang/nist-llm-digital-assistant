                                                                        Guidelines on PDA Forensics


               injection to overwrite the password with a known value or replace the authentication
               program with a version that always authenticates successfully [Kni02]. Similarly,
               flipping two bits in a data structure, which determine whether the start-up password is
               active and configured, may turn off the mechanism completely, as reported for the
               XDA PDA/phone hybrid device [Its].

               Infer information by monitoring physical device characteristics – Techniques that
               monitor power consumption or other device characteristics have been effective in
               systematically determining the password or PIN. For example, forensic specialists
               report that the passwords of some electronic organizers have been uncovered by
               determining the address area of the password and, as characters are entered,
               systematically monitoring the data and address bus of those memory locations to
               reveal the value one character at a time [Kni02]. Differential power analysis, which
               has been shown to be effective in gaining information from smart cards, is another
               technique that could be applied [Aig].

               Use automated brute force – If a password mechanism has no restrictions on the
               number of manual attempts made and the examiner had time to spare, a brute force
               dictionary attack could be attempted. Normally, this approach would be out of the
               question. However, with automated keystroke entry, it is plausible. For example, the
               Netherlands Forensic Institute developed, an automated password entry system for
               devices with a keyboard and screen. Equipped with a robot arm and video camera the
               unit can systematically enter passwords until the correct entry is detected or, in the
               worst case, the keys become damaged [Kni02].

6.3   Tangential Equipment

       Tangential equipment includes devices that contain memory and are associated with a PDA.
       The two main categories are memory cards and host computers to which a PDA has
       synchronized its contents. Surprisingly, USB memory drives, which are a common peripheral
       for host computers, are generally not a factor for PDAs because of interface issues.

       PDAs, especially higher end models, typically support Compact Flash (CF), Secure Digital
       (SD), Multi-Media Cards (MMC), and other types of removable media designed specifically
       for handheld devices, which can contain a significant amount of data. Like RAM and ROM,
       memory cards are typically semiconductor memory. They are normally used as auxiliary user
       file storage, backup of important PDA content, or a means to convey files to and from the
       device. The physical sizes of memory cards supported by handheld devices are noteworthy
       insofar as they are quite small, about the size of a coin, and easy to overlook. Therefore,
       investigators should take their time and thoroughly search the premises, when seizing material.
       Data can be acquired from removable media with the use of a media reader and a forensic
       application used to image hard drives.

       The data contained on a PDA is often present on a personal computer, due to the capability of
       a PDA to synchronize or otherwise share information among one or more host computers.
       Such personal computers or workstations are referred to as synched devices. Because of
       synchronization, a significant amount of valuable evidence on a PDA, if not all, may also be
       present on the suspect’s laptop or personal computer, and recovered using a conventional
       computer forensic tool for hard drive acquisition and examination.
