Special Publication 800-73-4         Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification – Part 1: PIV
                                  Card Application Namespace, Data Model and Representation

The VCI security condition supports two different configurations for the establishment of the VCI. In
the default (and recommended) configuration, the VCI is only established after both secure messaging
has been established and the pairing code has been presented to the card using secure messaging. In
the non-default configuration, the VCI is established by the establishment of secure messaging,
without any further steps.

The VCI security condition is

       (command is submitted over secure messaging) AND (the Discovery Object is present) AND
       (Bit 4 of the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy is one) AND ((the security status indicator
       associated with the pairing code is TRUE) OR (Bit 3 of the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy
       is one))

PIV Card Applications that support the VCI shall support the configuration in which Bit 3 of the first
byte of the PIN Usage Policy is set to zero (i.e., the configuration in which submission of the pairing
code to the PIV Card Application is required to establish the VCI) and may additionally support the
configuration in which Bit 3 of the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy is set to one. Card management
systems (CMS) shall be configured to set Bit 3 of the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy to zero by
default whenever the Discovery Object is present.

Requiring that the pairing code be submitted to the PIV Card Application in order to establish the
VCI protects the previously contact-restricted X.509 certificates from skimming 19 and also protects
PIN-based card activation from being blocked. While it is recommended that the default
configuration of CMSs remain unchanged, the configuration of a CMS may be changed to set Bit 3 of
the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy to one (i.e., to configure PIV Cards to establish VCIs without
the submission of a pairing code) if the configuration change is approved by the Designated
Approving Authority (DAA) and if compensating controls are implemented to ensure personally
identifiable information (i.e., name, email address, and organization) cannot be skimmed from the
PIV Card when in close proximity when the card is outside of its protective sleeve.

A DAA’s decision to approve the issuance of PIV Cards that implement the VCI without requiring
the pairing code shall be based on a risk assessment that weighs the perceived benefit against the risk
of unauthorized disclosure of cardholder data exposing previously contact-restricted X.509
certificates to skimming. The previously contact-restricted X.509 certificates include information
about the cardholder such as name and email address. Compensating controls shall be captured in the
appropriate system security plan. 20 Systems that accept external issued PIV Cards shall be able to
accept PIV Cards with either VCI configuration.

5.6    Status Words

A Status Word (SW) is a 2-byte value returned by a card command at the card edge. The first byte of
a status word is referred to as SW1 and the second byte of a status word is referred to as SW2.

Recognized values of all SW1-SW2 pairs used as return values on the card command interface and
their interpretation are given in Table 6. The descriptions of individual card commands provide
additional information for interpreting returned status words.

19 Skimming is when data is surreptitiously obtained from a contactless card, using a hidden reader that powers, commands,

and reads from the card within the maximum read distance (reported as about 25 cm with ISO/IEC 14443 smart cards like
the PIV Card).
