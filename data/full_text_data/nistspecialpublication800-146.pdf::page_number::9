                                                              CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



Executive Summary

Cloud computing allows computer users to conveniently rent access to fully featured applications, to
software development and deployment environments, and to computing infrastructure assets such as
network-accessible data storage and processing.

This document reprises the NIST-established definition of cloud computing, describes cloud computing
benefits and open issues, presents an overview of major classes of cloud technology, and provides
guidelines and recommendations on how organizations should consider the relative opportunities and
risks of cloud computing. Cloud computing has been the subject of a great deal of commentary.
Attempts to describe cloud computing in general terms, however, have been problematic because cloud
computing is not a single kind of system, but instead spans a spectrum of underlying technologies,
configuration possibilities, service models, and deployment models. This document describes cloud
systems and discusses their strengths and weaknesses.

Depending on an organization's requirements, different technologies and configurations are appropriate.
To understand which part of the spectrum of cloud systems is most appropriate for a given need, an
organization should consider how clouds can be deployed (deployment models), what kinds of services
can be provided to customers (service models), the economic opportunities and risks of using cloud
services (economic considerations), the technical characteristics of cloud services such as performance
and reliability (operational characteristics), typical terms of service (service level agreements), and the
security opportunities and risks (security).

Deployment Models. A cloud computing system may be deployed privately or hosted on the premises of
a cloud customer, may be shared among a limited number of trusted partners, may be hosted by a third
party, or may be a publically accessible service, i.e., a public cloud. Depending on the kind of cloud
deployment, the cloud may have limited private computing resources, or may have access to large
quantities of remotely accessed resources. The different deployment models present a number of
tradeoffs in how customers can control their resources, and the scale, cost, and availability of resources.

Service Models. A cloud can provide access to software applications such as email or office productivity
tools (the Software as a Service, or SaaS, service model), or can provide an environment for customers to
use to build and operate their own software (the Platform as a Service, or PaaS, service model), or can
provide network access to traditional computing resources such as processing power and storage (the
Infrastructure as a Service, or IaaS, service model). The different service models have different strengths
and are suitable for different customers and business objectives. Generally, interoperability and
portability of customer workloads is more achievable in the IaaS service model because the building
blocks of IaaS offerings are relatively well-defined, e.g., network protocols, CPU instruction sets, and
legacy device interfaces.

Economic Considerations. In outsourced and public deployment models, cloud computing provides
convenient rental of computing resources: users pay service charges while using a service but need not
pay large up-front acquisition costs to build a computing infrastructure. The reduction of up-front costs
reduces the risks for pilot projects and experimental efforts, thus reducing a barrier to organizational
flexibility, or agility. In outsourced and public deployment models, cloud computing also can provide
elasticity, that is, the ability for customers to quickly request, receive, and later release as many resources
as needed. By using an elastic cloud, customers may be able to avoid excessive costs from over-
provisioning, i.e., building enough capacity for peak demand and then not using the capacity in non-peak
periods. Whether or not cloud computing reduces overall costs for an organization depends on a careful
analysis of all the costs of operation, compliance, and security, including costs to migrate to and, if
necessary, migrate from a cloud.
