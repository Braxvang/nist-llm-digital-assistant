GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



          –    WSC (Windows Script Component)

          –    WSF (Windows Script File)

          –    WSH (Windows Script Host Settings File)
 On Windows hosts, configure them to display full file extensions (this ensures that an email
  attachment such as iloveyou.txt.vbs is displayed instead of iloveyou.txt).
 Install an anti-virus application and configure it to automatically scan all incoming messages and any
  attachments as they are opened. 50 Also, install and use an anti-spyware application if the anti-virus
  software does not offer robust anti-spyware capabilities. Section 6.2.1 contains a detailed explanation
  of malware scanning at the client, server, and network layers.
 Install a personal firewall to protect the computer from unauthorized communications, unless the
  computer is already sufficiently protected by existing network security devices (e.g., network
  firewalls).
 Ensure that the operating system enforces the concept of least privilege, because malicious code runs
  in the security context on which it was launched (i.e., the user’s access level). For example, users
  should only read and compose email using accounts without administrator-level privileges.
 Ensure that critical components of the operating system are protected from malicious code. 51
 Use a file encrypting application to protect the email stored locally on the user’s hard drive (this is
  especially important for laptop computers and other mobile devices, which are more likely to be
  stolen).
 Configure the operating system to automatically lock the current OS session after a fixed period of
  inactivity.
8.2     Secure Message Composition

Encryption should be used to securely send email messages containing sensitive information. Two
primary methods for encrypting email are S/MIME and OpenPGP, which were discussed in detail in
Section 3. Both offer similar levels of protection, but their inherent architectures are different. Most mail
clients support S/MIME natively, whereas OpenPGP usually comes in the form of a plug-in. Ultimately,
the choice comes down to which solution meets the requirements of the organization. 52 As a general rule,
unencrypted email should be treated as a postcard – anyone can read and modify.

Securing messages using S/MIME or OpenPGP involves obtaining digital certificates for both the sender
and recipient. A digital certificate has several components, including the name and email address of the
person to whom the certificate was issued, a public key and its expiration date, information about the CA
that issued the certificate (including its digital signature), and the serial number of the certificate. When
the sender has both the sender and receiver’s digital certificates, the sender can digitally sign and encrypt
email messages to the recipient. Digitally signing a message is important in three ways:

 Authenticity allows the recipient to be confident that the message is from the sender.
