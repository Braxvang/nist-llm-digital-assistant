       file had changed each day, then the media for the full backup and for each day’s incremental
       backups would be needed to restore the entire directory.
      Differential. A differential backup stores files that were created or modified since the last full
       backup. Therefore, if a file is changed after the previous full backup, a differential backup will
       save the file each time until the next full backup is completed. A differential backup takes less
       time to complete than a full backup. Restoring from a differential backup may require fewer
       media than an incremental backup because only the full backup media and the last differential
       media would be needed. As a disadvantage, differential backups take longer to complete than
       incremental backups because the amount of data since the last full backup increases each day
       until the next full backup is executed.

A combination of backup operations can be used depending on system configuration and recovery
requirements. For example, a full backup can be conducted on the weekend with differential backups
conducted each evening. In developing a system backup policy, the following questions should be
considered:

      Where and how will media be stored?
      What data should be backed up and how often should it be backed up?
      How quickly are the backups to be retrieved in the event of an emergency?
      Who is authorized to retrieve the media?
      Where will the media be delivered and what is the rotation schedule of backup media?
      Who will restore the data from the media?
      What is the media-labeling scheme?
      How long will the backup media be retained?
      When the media are stored onsite, what environmental controls are provided to preserve the
       media?
      What is the appropriate backup medium for the types of backups to be performed?

Certain factors should be considered when choosing the appropriate backup solution:

      Equipment interoperability. To facilitate recovery, the backup device must be compatible with
       the platform operating system and applications and should be easy to install onto different models
       or types of systems.
      Storage volume. To ensure adequate storage, the amount of data to be backed up should
       determine the appropriate backup solution.
      Media life. Each type of medium has a different use and storage life beyond which the media
       cannot be relied on for effective data recovery.
      Backup Software. When choosing the appropriate backup solution, the software or method used
       to back up data should be considered. In some cases, the backup solution can be as simple as a
       file copy using the operating system file manager; in cases involving larger data transfers, a third-
       party application may be needed to automate and schedule the file backup.
