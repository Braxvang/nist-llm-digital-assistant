8.      Implementing a Secure Network Infrastructure

The network infrastructure that supports the Web server plays a critical role in the security of the Web
server. In most configurations, the network infrastructure is the first line of defense between the Internet
and a public Web server. Network design alone, however, cannot protect a Web server. The frequency,
sophistication, and variety of attacks perpetrated today lend support to the idea that Web security must be
implemented through layered and diverse protection mechanisms (defense-in-depth). This section
discusses those network components that can support and protect Web servers to further enhance their
overall security. Although security issues are paramount, network infrastructure considerations are
influenced by many factors other than security, including cost, performance, and reliability.

8.1     Network Composition and Structure

Firewalls and routers are devices or systems that control the flow of network traffic between networks.
They can protect Web servers from vulnerabilities inherent in the TCP/IP suite and help reduce the
security issues associated with insecure applications and OSs. However, an organization has many
choices when determining a network environment for a Web server, and security may not be the principal
factor in deciding among those options. Network composition and structure are the first and in many
respects the most critical decisions that affect Web server security because they determine what network
infrastructure elements protect the Web server. For example, if the Web server is located before the
organization’s main firewall, then the firewall cannot be used to control traffic to and from the Web
server. Network composition and structure also determine what other portions of the network are
vulnerable if the Web server is compromised. For example, an externally accessible Web server located
on the internal production network subjects the internal network to attack if the Web server is
compromised. Also, an organization may choose not to have the Web server located on its network at all
and to outsource the hosting to a third party.

8.1.1    Inadvisable Network Layout

Some organizations choose to locate their public Web servers on their internal production networks. That
is, their Web servers reside on the same network as the internal users and servers. The principal weakness
of this layout is that it exposes internal network components to additional risks. Web servers are often
targets of attackers. If attackers manage to compromise a Web server, they will have access to the
internal network and will be able to more easily compromise internal hosts. Therefore, this layout is not
recommended.

Another network layout that is not generally recommended is placing the Web server before an
organization’s firewall or router that provides IP filtering. In this structure, the network provides little, if
any, protection for the Web server. Because the Web server itself has to maintain security, it provides a
single point of failure. To be even somewhat secure in this location, the Web server OS and application
have to be extremely well-hardened, with all unnecessary and insecure services disabled and all necessary
security patches applied. To maintain the security of the setup, the Web server administrator must stay up
to date on vulnerabilities and related patches. Another limitation of this structure is that providing any
sort of secure remote administration or content update capability is difficult.

8.1.2    Demilitarized Zone

A demilitarized zone (DMZ) describes a host or network segment inserted as a “neutral zone” between an
organization’s private network and the Internet. It prevents outside users of the Web server from gaining
direct access to an organization’s internal network (intranet). A DMZ mitigates the risks of locating a
Web server on an internal network or exposing it directly to the Internet. It is a compromise solution that
