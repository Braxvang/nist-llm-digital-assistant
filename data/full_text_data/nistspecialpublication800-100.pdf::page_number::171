Appendix B                                            Frequently Asked Questions


   System security plans provide an overview of the information security
   requirements and describe the security controls that are in place or planned for
   meeting those requirements. System security plans can include as references or
   attachments, other important security-related documents that are produced as
   part of an agencyâ€™s information security program (e.g., risk assessments,
   contingency plans, incident response plans, security awareness and training
   plans, information system rules of behavior, configuration management (CM)
   plans, security configuration checklists, privacy impact assessments, system
   interconnection agreements).

Q. What are the phases of the C&A process?
A. The security C&A process consists of four distinct phases:
       1. Initiation Phase. This phase will ensure that the authorizing official and
          senior agency information security officer agree with the contents of the
          system security plan before the certification agent begins assessing the
          security controls in the information system.
       2. Security Certification Phase. This phase will determine the extent to which
          the security controls in the information system are implemented correctly,
          operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to
          meeting the security requirements for the system.
       3. Security Accreditation Phase. This phase will determine whether the
          remaining known vulnerabilities in the information system (after the
          implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls) pose an
          acceptable level of risk to agency operations, agency assets, or
          individuals.
       4. Continuous Monitoring Phase. This phase will provide regular oversight
          and monitoring of the security controls in the information system and will
          inform the authorizing official when changes may impact the security of
          the system.

Q. What is included in a security accreditation package?
A. The security accreditation package contains the following documents: approved
   system security plan, the security assessment report, and the POA&M. After
   these documents are completed, the information system owner submits the final
   security accreditation package to the authorizing official or a designated
   representative.

Q. What is the Information Security Program Assessment Questionnaire?
A. To assist agencies in meeting their annual FISMA reporting requirements, the
   Information Security Program Assessment Questionnaire (Annex 11.A) provides
   questions on many of the areas typically required for inclusion in agency reports.

Q. Do all the 800-53 security controls need annual testing to satisfy the
   FISMA annual testing requirement?
A. All 800-53 security controls do not need to be tested to satisfy annual testing and
   evaluation requirements. Agencies should first prioritize testing on POA&M items
   that become closed. These newly implemented controls should be validated.
   Agencies should test against system related security control changes that
   occurred but did not constitute a major change necessitating a new C&A.
   Agencies should identify all security controls that are continuously monitored as
   annual testing and evaluation activities. Examples of this include (but are not



                                                                                 B-22
