548           webinars. Security literacy training is conducted at a frequency consistent with applicable laws,
549           directives, regulations, and policies. Updating literacy training content on a regular basis ensures
550           that the content remains relevant. Events that may precipitate an update to literacy training
551           content include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in
552           applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.
553           Potential indicators and possible precursors of insider threats include behaviors such as
554           inordinate, long-term job dissatisfaction; attempts to gain access to information that is not
555           required for job performance; unexplained access to financial resources; bullying or sexual
556           harassment of fellow employees; workplace violence; and other serious violations of the policies,
557           procedures, rules, directives, or practices of organizations. Organizations may consider tailoring
558           insider threat awareness topics to the role (e.g., training for managers may be focused on specific
559           changes in the behavior of team members, while training for employees may be focused on more
560           general observations).
561           Social engineering is an attempt to deceive an individual into revealing information or taking an
562           action that can be used to breach, compromise, or otherwise adversely impact a system. Social
563           engineering includes phishing, pretexting, impersonation, baiting, quid pro quo, threadjacking,
564           social media exploitation, and tailgating. Social mining is an attempt to gather information about
565           the organization that may be used to support future attacks. Security literacy training includes
566           how to communicate employee and management concerns regarding potential indicators of
567           insider threat and potential and actual instances of social engineering and data mining through
568           appropriate organizational channels in accordance with established policies and procedures.

572   3.2.2. Role-Based Training
573           REQUIREMENT: 03.02.02
574           a. Provide role-based security training to organizational personnel:
575               1. Before authorizing access to the system or CUI, before performing assigned duties, and
576                  periodically thereafter; and
577               2. When required by system changes or following [Assignment: organization-defined
578                  events].
579           b. Update role-based training content periodically and following [Assignment: organization-
580              defined events].

581           DISCUSSION
582           Organizations determine the content and frequency of security training based on the assigned
583           duties, roles, and responsibilities of individuals and the security requirements of the systems to
584           which personnel have authorized access. In addition, organizations provide system developers,
585           enterprise architects, security architects, software developers, systems integrators,
586           acquisition/procurement officials, system and network administrators, personnel conducting
587           configuration management and auditing activities, personnel performing independent verification
588           and validation, security assessors, and personnel with access to system-level software with
589           security-related technical training specifically tailored for their assigned duties.
