GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



encrypt it for all the individual recipients of the mailing list. Each recipient can then decrypt the email
and verify the original signature.

3.2     S/MIME

S/MIME, which was originally proposed in 1995 by RSA Data Security, Inc., is based on their
proprietary (although widely supported) Public Key Cryptography Standard (PKCS) #7 for data format of
encrypted messages, and the X.509 version 3 standard for digital certificates. 18 S/MIME version 2
achieved wide adoption throughout the Internet mail industry. Although it is not a recognized IETF
standard, it is specified by informational RFCs 2311, 2312, 2313, 2314, 2315, and 2268.

S/MIME version 3 was developed by the IETF S/MIME Working Group, which now coordinates all
development of the S/MIME standard, 19 and adopted as an IETF standard in July 1999. S/MIME version
3 is specified by the following RFCs:

 Cryptographic Message Syntax (RFC 3852)
 S/MIME Version 3 Message Specification (RFC 3851)
 S/MIME Version 3 Certificate Handling (RFC 3850)
 Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Method (RFC 2631)
 Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME (RFC 2634).
The most significant feature of S/MIME is its built-in and nearly “automatic” nature. Because of heavy
industry involvement from manufacturers, S/MIME functionality exists with default installations of
common mail clients such as Mozilla and Outlook Express.

The actual process by which S/MIME-enabled mail clients send messages is similar to that of
OpenPGP. 20 S/MIME version 3.1 supports two symmetric key encryption algorithms recommended by
FIPS PUB 140-2: AES, which is recommended but optional for compliant implementations to support,
and 3DES, which is mandatory for implementations to support. Organizations using S/MIME to protect
emails should use AES or 3DES (preferably AES, which is considered a stronger algorithm than 3DES).

As with OpenPGP, there are security gateway servers available that can use S/MIME to encrypt, decrypt,
sign, and verify signatures on email messages on behalf of users. These gateways are very similar to
those described in Section 3.1, and many of the gateways actually support both OpenPGP and S/MIME.

3.3     Key Management

Both OpenPGP and S/MIME use digital certificates to manage keys. A digital certificate identifies the
entity (e.g., a user) that was issued the certificate, the public key of the entity’s public key pair, and other
information, such as the date of expiration, signed by some trusted party. However, differences exist in
the key management models used by OpenPGP and S/MIME to establish trust using digital certificates.
