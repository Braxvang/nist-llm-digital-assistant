outside the scope of this guideline.] Other security management information, such as that
affecting Nuclear Regulatory Commission “SAFEGUARDS” or Internal Revenue Service
“Limited For Official Use Only” information is not national security information, but must be
treated as having high confidentiality impact.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The confidentiality impact level recommended for
most security management information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of security management information
may depend on the urgency with which the information is needed or the immediacy with which
the information is used. In cases of intrusion indications, security management information can
be time-critical.

The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of time-critical security
management information can reasonably be expected to result in physical security
vulnerabilities. The range of potential consequences is covered above in Confidentiality.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most security management information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the security management information.
Functions supported by most security management information are tolerant of delays. Typically,
disruption of access to security management information will have a limited adverse effect on
agency operations (including mission functions and public confidence in the agency), agency
assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Exceptions may include alarm and alert
communications and interconnections for security management systems and automated control
systems that support security management processes (e.g., door and gate operations in buildings
to which access is limited such as detention facilities and many Federal office buildings For
these exceptions, the data is time-critical. The availability impact level associated with
unauthorized modification or destruction of such alarm, alert, and automated process security
management information may be high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
security management information is low.
C.3.1.4 Travel Information Type

Travel involves the activities associated with planning, preparing, and monitoring of business
related travel for an organization’s employees. The following security categorization is
recommended for the travel information type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}
