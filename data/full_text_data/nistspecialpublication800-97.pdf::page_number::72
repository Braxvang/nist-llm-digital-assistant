ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I




                                    Figure 5-15. Group Key Handshake



After the Group Key Handshake is complete, the AP and STA are ready for operation. The Group Key
Handshake also may be used to distribute subsequent GTKs. The AP can use the handshake to update the
GTK in STAs under the following conditions:

       On disassociation or deauthentication of a STA
       Upon occurrence of an event on the STA that triggers an update, such as a configuration change
        in the STAâ€™s local security policy.
The GMK used to derive the GTK may be updated in the AP at a time interval configured into the system.
Periodic updating of the GMK may be included in the security policy for the WLAN. Organizations
should update the GMK to prevent exposure of subsequent traffic between STAs and the AP, if the GMK
is ever compromised.

5.6     Protected Data Exchange

The fourth phase in the operation of an RSN is the protected data exchange phase. Before this phase, the
AP and STA have already done the following:

       Become associated and negotiated a security policy (discovery phase)
       Mutually authenticated using EAP and derived a Master Session Key using the uncontrolled
        IEEE 802.1X port, or implicitly authenticated through a previously installed preshared key
        (authentication phase)
       Generated, distributed and confirmed the session keys through the 4-Way Handshake (KGD
        phase)
       Derived a pairwise transient key and unblocked the IEEE 802.1X ports (KGD phase).
These actions have prepared the AP and STA to communicate securely. During the protected data
exchange phase, the AP and STA may now share data securely. The traffic between the AP and STA is
