Appendix B. Glossary
Selected terms used in this publication are defined below. Source references are included for
certain definitions.
access control list
A mechanism that implements access control for a system resource by enumerating the identities of the system
entities that are permitted to access the resources. [RFC4949] (adapted)

actuator
A device for moving or controlling a mechanism or system. It is operated by a source of energy, typically electric
current, hydraulic fluid pressure, or pneumatic pressure, and converts that energy into motion. An actuator is the
mechanism by which a control system acts upon an environment. The control system can be simple (a fixed
mechanical or electronic system), software-based (e.g., a printer driver, robot control system), or a human or other
agent.

alarm
A device or function that signals the existence of an abnormal condition by making an audible or visible discrete
change, or both, so as to attract attention to that condition. [ANSI-ISA-5-1]

antivirus tools
Software products and technology used to detect malicious code, prevent it from infecting a system, and remove
malicious code that has infected the system.

attack
An attempt to gain unauthorized access to system services, resources, or information or an attempt to compromise
system integrity, availability, or confidentiality.

authentication
Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an
information system. [FIPS200]

authorization
The right or a permission that is granted to a system entity to access a system resource. [RFC4949] (adapted)

backdoor
An undocumented way of gaining access to a computer system. A backdoor is a potential security risk.

buffer overflow
A condition at an interface under which more input can be placed into a buffer or data holding area than the capacity
allocated, overwriting other information. Adversaries exploit such a condition to crash a system or to insert specially
crafted code that allows them to gain control of the system. [SP800-28v2]

cleartext
Information that is not encrypted.

communications router
A communications device that transfers messages between two networks. Common uses for routers include
connecting a LAN to a WAN and connecting MTUs and RTUs to a long-distance network medium for SCADA
communication.

confidentiality
Preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal
privacy and proprietary information. [USC44-3552] (adapted)

configuration (of a system or device)
Step in system design; for example, selecting functional units, assigning their locations, and defining their
interconnections.
