proprietary enterprise information, which may include self-developed internal mobile apps,
personnel data, and data that could include trade secrets.
EMM technology can be set up in different ways within the enterprise, and different
architectures are possible. The two primary methods focus on the location of the EMM and
associated technology. These methods are on-premises and cloud-based, sometimes referred to
as the software as a service (SaaS) model. These are described below.

5.3.1.1.       On-Premises Architecture
On-premises (on-prem) instances of EMM technology are less common than cloud-based ones.
Organizations install and configure the EMM themselves and pay for software licenses for any
underlying platforms or components. Some EMM vendors offer images and containers that can
help ease the burden of installation and configuration. Organizations are encouraged to double-
check the images or containers for commonplace software vulnerabilities. The primary benefit of
this model is that enterprise data resides within the organization except for the allowed devices
that can query and receive information that they are authorized to obtain. Enterprises can monitor
this traffic alongside the authentication from the EMM to other devices. Finally, physical
security of the EMM can be ensured for this model.
Below is a sample architecture that demonstrates an on-prem implementation of the mobile
security technologies. MTD technologies are typically cloud-based, even if the organizationâ€™s
management technology is on-prem. Fig. 5 shows the MTD as part of the cloud, although real-
world deployments may significantly differ. The EMM components are hosted via on-prem
servers owned and managed by the enterprise. This architecture requires considerable installation
and maintenance of the technologies by the enterprise but also provides the enterprise with more
control over how its data is transmitted and managed.
