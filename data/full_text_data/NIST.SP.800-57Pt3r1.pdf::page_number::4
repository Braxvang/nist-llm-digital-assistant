                   Reports on Computer Systems Technology

The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing
technical leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL
develops tests, test methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and
technical analyses to advance the development and productive use of information
technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the development of management,
administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective
security and privacy of other than national security-related information in Federal
information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative
activities with industry, government, and academic organizations.


                                       Abstract

NIST Special Publication 800-57 provides cryptographic key management guidance. It
consists of three parts. Part 1 provides general guidance and best practices for the
management of cryptographic keying material. Part 2 provides guidance on policy and
security planning requirements for U.S. government agencies. Finally, Part 3 provides
guidance when using the cryptographic features of current systems.
