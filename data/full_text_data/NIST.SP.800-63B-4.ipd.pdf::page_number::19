      NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                             Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                      Authentication and Lifecycle Management


456       • Single-factor cryptographic device (Sec. 5.1.7)
457       • Multi-factor cryptographic software (Sec. 5.1.8)
458       • Multi-factor cryptographic device (Sec. 5.1.9)

459   4.1.2. Authenticator and Veriﬁer Requirements
460   Cryptographic authenticators used at AAL1 SHALL use approved cryptography.
461   Software-based authenticators that operate within the context of an operating system
462    MAY , where applicable, attempt to detect compromise (e.g., by malware) of the user
463   endpoint in which they are running and SHOULD NOT complete the operation when such
464   a compromise is detected.
465   Communication between the claimant and verifier SHALL be via an authenticated
466   protected channel to provide confidentiality of the authenticator output and resistance
467   to adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks.
468   Verifiers operated by or on behalf of federal government agencies at AAL1 SHALL be
469   validated to meet the requirements of [FIPS140] Level 1.

470   4.1.3. Reauthentication
471   Periodic reauthentication of subscriber sessions SHALL be performed as described in
472   Sec. 7.2. At AAL1, reauthentication of the subscriber SHOULD be repeated at least once
473   per 30 days during an extended usage session, regardless of user activity. The session
474   SHOULD be terminated (i.e., logged out) when this time limit is reached.


475   4.1.4. Security Controls
476   The CSP SHALL employ appropriately tailored security controls from the baseline
477   security controls defined in [SP800-53] or equivalent federal (e.g., [FEDRAMP]) or
478   industry standard that the organization has determined for the information systems,
479   applications, and online services that these guidelines are used to protect. The CSP
480    SHALL ensure that the minimum assurance-related controls for the appropriate systems,
481   or equivalent, are satisfied.

482   4.1.5. Records Retention Policy
483   The CSP SHALL comply with its respective records retention policies in accordance
484   with applicable laws, regulations, and policies, including any National Archives and
485   Records Administration (NARA) records retention schedules that may apply. If the CSP
486   opts to retain records in the absence of any mandatory requirements, the CSP SHALL
487   conduct a risk management process, including assessments of privacy and security risks,
488   to determine how long records should be retained and SHALL inform the subscriber of
489   that retention policy.
