Sharing Environment [DCISE], Information Sharing and Analysis Centers [ISACs] for critical infrastructure sectors),
research and nongovernmental organizations (e.g. Carnegie Mellon University, Software Engineering Institute-CERT),
and security service providers). Organizations using external sources, consider the timeliness, specificity, and relevance
of threat information. Similar to sources of threat information, sources of vulnerability information can also be either
internal or external to organizations (see Table F-1). Internal sources can include, for example, vulnerability assessment
reports. External sources of vulnerability information are similar to the sources identified above for threat information.
As described in Table F-1, information about predisposing conditions can be found in a variety of sources including,
for example, descriptions of information systems, environments of operation, shared services, common infrastructures,
and enterprise architecture. As described in Table H-1, sources of impact information can include, for example,
mission/business impact analyses, information system component inventories, and security categorizations. Security
categorization constitutes a determination of the potential impacts should certain events occur which jeopardize the
information and information systems needed by the organization to accomplish its assigned missions, protect its assets,
fulfill its legal responsibilities, maintain its day-to-day functions, and protect individuals. Security categories are to be
used in conjunction with vulnerability and threat information in assessing the risk to organizational operations and
assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Security categories constitute an initial summary of impact in
terms of failures to meet the security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and are informed by the
types of harm presented in Table H-2.

IDENTIFY RISK MODEL AND ANALYTIC APPROACH
TASK 1-5: Identify the risk model and analytic approach to be used in the risk assessment.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations define one or more risk models for use in conducting risk assessments (see
Section 2.3.1) and identify which model is to be used for the risk assessment. To facilitate reciprocity of assessment
results, organization-specific risk models include, or can be translated into, the risk factors (i.e., threat, vulnerability,
impact, likelihood, and predisposing condition) defined in the appendices. Organizations also identify the specific
analytic approach to be used for the risk assessment including the assessment approach (i.e., quantitative, qualitative,
semi-quantitative) and the analysis approach (i.e., threat-oriented, asset/impact-oriented, vulnerability-oriented). For
each assessable risk factor, the appendices include three assessment scales (one qualitative and two semi-quantitative
scales) with correspondingly different representations. Organizations typically define (or select and tailor from the
appendices) the assessment scales to be used in their risk assessments, annotating with organizationally-meaningful
examples for specific values and defining break points between bins for semi-quantitative approaches. In addition,
mission/business owners can provide further annotations with mission/business-specific examples. Organizations can
identify different assessment scales to be used in different circumstances. For example, for low-impact information
systems, organizations could use qualitative values, while for moderate- and high-impact systems, the most granular
semi-quantitative values (0-100) could be used. As discussed in Special Publication 800-39, Task 1-1, Risk
Assumptions, organizations vary in the relative weights applied to risk factors. Therefore, this guideline does not
specify algorithms for combining semi-quantitative values. Organization-specific risk models include algorithms (e.g.,
formulas, tables, rules) for combining risk factors. If an organization-specific risk model is not provided in the risk
management strategy as part of the risk framing step, then part of this task is to specify the algorithms for combining
values. Algorithms for combining risk factors reflect organizational risk tolerance (see the supplemental guidance to
Task 2-4 for examples). Organization-specific risk models are refined as part of preparation for a risk assessment by: (i)
identifying the risk model and the rationale for using it (when multiple organization-specific risk models are provided);
(ii) providing additional examples for values of risk factors; and (iii) identifying any assessment-specific algorithms
(e.g., algorithms specific to the use of an attack graph analysis technique). In the absence of pre-existing organization-
specific risk models or analytic approaches defined in the organizational risk management strategy, the risk model and
analytic approaches to be used in the risk assessment are defined and documented in this task.



                    Summary of Key Activities – Preparing for Risk Assessments

       •    Identify the purpose of the risk assessment.
       •    Identify the scope of the risk assessment.
       •    Identify the assumptions and constraints under which the risk assessment is conducted.
       •    Identify sources of threat, vulnerability, and impact information to be used in the risk
            assessment (see Tables D-1, E-1, F-1, H-1, and I-1 as tailored by the organization).
       •    Define or refine the risk model, assessment approach, and analysis approach to be used in
            the risk assessment.
