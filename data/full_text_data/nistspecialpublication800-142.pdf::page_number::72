Appendix B - EMPIRICAL DATA ON SOFTWARE FAILURES

        One of the most important questions in software testing is "how much is enough"?
 For combinatorial testing, this question includes determining the appropriate level of
interaction that should be tested. That is, if some failure is triggered only by an unusual
combination of more than two values, how many testing combinations are enough to detect
all errors? What degree of interaction occurs in real system failures? This section
summarizes what is known about these questions based on research by NIST and others [4,
7, 34, 35, 36, 65].

        Table 1 below summarizes what we know from empirical studies of a variety of
application domains, showing the percentage of failures that are triggered by the interaction
of one to six variables. For example, 66% of the medical devices were triggered by a
single variable value, and 97% were triggered by either one or two variables interacting.
 Although certainly not conclusive, the available data suggest that the number of
interactions involved in system failures is relatively low, with a maximum from 4 to 6 in
the six studies cited below. (Note: TCAS study used seeded errors, all others are
"naturally occurring", * = not reported.)
