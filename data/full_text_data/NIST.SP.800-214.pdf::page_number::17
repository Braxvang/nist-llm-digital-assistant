The Privacy Engineering Program (PEP) works to provide trusted, rigorous tools and resources
that support innovation and privacy. PEP facilitates dialogues among stakeholders about
privacy risk management and promotes an organizational shift away from checklist-based legal
compliance to improve privacy measures. The following activities reflect progress made in FY
2020 toward three strategic PEP objectives: advancing the development of privacy engineering
and risk management guidelines and resources, positioning NIST as a leader in privacy research,
and advancing the development and deployment of privacy-enhancing technologies.
Privacy as a programmatic area intersects with each of the other priority focus areas, making
coordination and ongoing engagement critical across a range of technical domains. To advance
its strategic objectives, PEP collaborates with other NIST programs including the NCCoE, the
Cryptography Group, the FISMA program, and the Cybersecurity for IoT program, as reflected in
activities throughout this report.
Privacy Framework
In January 2020, NIST released the NIST Privacy Framework: A Tool for Improving Privacy through
Enterprise Risk Management (Privacy Framework). The Privacy Framework is a voluntary tool
to help organizations identify and manage privacy risks. This helps them provide innovative
products and services while protecting individuals’ privacy. Since its release, organizations have
adopted the Privacy Framework to improve privacy programs, drive alignment and collaboration
with security programs, and more effectively communicate about privacy risk management and
resource allocation with their leadership.
To support organizations’ use of the Privacy Framework, NIST launched an online, community-
driven Privacy Framework Resource Repository for collecting and sharing crosswalks, common
Profiles, guidelines, and tools that now contains more than forty resources. NIST also published a
