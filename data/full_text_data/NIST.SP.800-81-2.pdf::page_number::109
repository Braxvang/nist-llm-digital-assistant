                                                          SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



11.7.2 Deploying DNSSEC in the Ideal Solution Scenario

In the ideal case (i.e., separate internal zone), DNSSEC deployment can be done independently on both
the internal and external zones. The external zone can be signed and have a secure delegation from its
parent zone. The internal zone can be signed using a different set of DNSSEC keys (with the name of the
internal zone) but does not necessary need a signed delegation from its parent zone (which may not exist).
It would be sufficient to simply have the internal public key installed as a trust anchor in all the validators
of the organization. This would be similar to managing any other security credentials for the
organization.

Since the zones are independent, they can be managed independently. This means that the internal and
external zones can have different key rollover schedules if needed. However, as this can complicate
operations, it is recommended that the internal and external zones maintain the same rollover schedules to
ease operations.

11.7.3 Usual Solution: Same Zone Name with Different Files

In many already existing deployments, it is not possible to create a new subzone or new zone name for
internal use. There may be pre-established applications or too many users to make such a transition. In
these cases, the DNS administrator for the zone can still deploy DNSSEC on the external and internal
zone views, but must take steps in key management to prevent DNSSEC validation failures for internal
clients and information leakage to external attackers.

In this scenario, the zone and server configuration should be similar to the following. In the external
zone:

    •   Zone configuration: Similar to the previous scenario. The external zone file (or view) contains
        only externally accessible hosts such as web, mail and other servers.

    •   Server configuration: The server either has only the external zone file, or has the zone configured
        as a separate view that is accessible from the entire Internet.

Internal zone:

    •   Zone configuration: Again, similar to the previous scenario. The internal zone file (or view)
        contains only internal hosts and any internally accessible interfaces to external hosts.

    •   Server configuration: The server either has only the internal zone (or view) or has a separate
        view with an ACL restricting queries to only internal hosts.

11.7.4 Deploying DNSSEC in the Usual Solution Scenario

DNS administrators need to take some precautions when deploying DNSSEC in this scenario. The
administrator can choose to use the same key DNSSEC signing keys for both the internal and external
zones, or choose to use separate keys for both zone files. Either choice has its advantages and drawbacks
to consider.

If the same key is used for both the internal and external views, the management of they keys are
simplified (there is only one set). However, it is easier for an attacker, or mis-configured recursive server
to send back name error messages to internal client queries for valid internal hosts. If this happens, a
client will receive a valid error message for a host that exists, which will result in a denial of service.
