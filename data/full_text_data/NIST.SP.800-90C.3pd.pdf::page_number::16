      NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                                              Recommendation for RBG Constructions

386               RBG Security
387   Ideal randomness sources generate identically distributed and independent uniform random bits
388   that provide full-entropy outputs (i.e., one bit of entropy per output bit). Real-world RBGs are
389   designed with a security goal of indistinguishability from the output of an ideal randomness source.
390   That is, given some limits on an adversary’s data and computing power, it is expected that there is
391   no adversary that can reliably distinguish between RBG outputs and outputs from an ideal
392   randomness source.
393   Consider an adversary that can perform 2w computations (typically, these are guesses of the RBG’s
394   internal state) and is given an output sequence from either an RBG with a security strength of s
395   bits (where s ≥ w) or an ideal randomness source. It is expected that an adversary has no better
396   probability of determining which source was used for its random bits than
397                                                               1/2 + 2w−s−1 + ε,
398   where ε is negligible. In this Recommendation, the size of the output is limited to 264 output bits
399   and ε ≤ 2−32.
400   An RBG that has been designed to support a security strength of s bits is suitable for any
401   application with a targeted security strength that does not exceed s. An RBG that is compliant with
402   this Recommendation can support requests for output with a security strength of 128, 192, or 256
403   bits, except for an RBG3 construction (as described in Section 6), which can provide full-entropy
404   output.
405   A bitstring with full entropy has an amount of entropy equal to its length. Full-entropy bitstrings
406   are important for cryptographic applications, as these bitstrings have ideal randomness properties
407   and may be used for any cryptographic purpose. They may be truncated to any length such that the
408   amount of entropy in the truncated bitstring is equal to its length. However, due to the difficulty
409   of generating and testing full-entropy bitstrings, this Recommendation assumes that a bitstring has
410   full entropy if the amount of entropy per bit is at least 1 − ε, where ε is at most 2−32. NISTIR 8427 1
411   provides a justification for the selection of ε.

412               RBG Constructions
413   A construction is a method of designing an RBG or some component of an RBG to accomplish a
414   specific goal. Three classes of RBG constructions are defined in this document: RBG1, RBG2,
415   and RBG3 (see Table 1). Each RBG includes a DRBG from [SP800-90A] and is based on the use
416   of a randomness source that is validated for compliance with [SP800-90B] or SP 800-90C. Once
417   instantiated, a DRBG can generate output at a security strength that does not exceed the DRBG’s
418   instantiated security strength.
