SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


                           A Federal CKMS should support the following key and
PA:6.7
                           metadata management functions: generate a key, deactivate a
                           key, register an owner, revoke a key, associate a key with its
                           metadata, list key metadata, destroy a key and its metadata,
                           establish a key, validate a key, recover a key and its metadata,
                           and perform cryptographic functions using a key and its
                           metadata.
                           A Federal CKMS should support the following for all user
PA:6.8
                           requests for key-management services:
                              a) The authentication of the identity/role of the entity
                                  initiating the request, and
                               b) A verification of the requestorâ€™s authorization for
                                  receiving the service.

                           For Low impact-level systems, all sensitive data should be
PA:6.9
                           transferred by means of a trusted channel.

6.4.1 Generate a Key
When an entity requires a key, and it is not automatically provided by an FCKMS, the entity
should request that a key be generated by the FCKMS. The entity may need to specify the
type of key and other necessary information (e.g., the name of the key-generation technique),
including some metadata that needs to be associated with the key when requesting this
function. The function may not return the newly generated key, but could, for example,
return a key identifier that points to the key and its associated metadata.

Key-generation techniques typically depend on the cryptographic algorithm that will be used
with the key and the use of a random number generator. Different algorithms use keys that
have differing specifications (e.g., lengths and formats). Key generation for an asymmetric
algorithm results in the generation of a key pair, rather than a single key, which is the case
for symmetric algorithms. NIST has approved several random number generators (see [SP
800-90A], [SP 800-90B], [SP 800-90C] and [SP 800-131A]) and specifications for key
generation (see [SP 800-133]).

The key-generation function could provide, or require the input of, metadata that is to be
associated with the generated key.

FR:6.19 The CKMS design shall specify the key generation methods to be used in the
CKMS for each type of key.

FR:6.20 The CKMS design shall specify the underlying random number generators that are
used to generate symmetric and private keys.

                           A Federal CKMS shall support and use NIST-approved
PR:6.21
                           methods for key generation.
