Functions supported by mission-critical information or information systems (e.g., electrical
power generation, transmission, and/or distribution; petroleum or gas pipelines) are often
adversely impacted by lack of availability. Loss of availability of the information or
information system can result in severe impacts to the environment, service, major assets
and/or human safety. Consequently, the availability impact level associated with these types
of mission-critical processes/systems may be high.
Non mission-critical systems:
For information or information systems that do not directly impact mission-critical functions, the
availability impact level may be downgraded to low.
Recommended Availability Impact Level: In The availability impact level recommended for most
energy supply information is moderate.

D.7.2 Energy Conservation and Preparedness Information Type

Energy Conservation and Preparedness involves protection of energy resources from over-
consumption to ensure the continued availability of fuel resources and to promote environmental
protection. This mission also includes measures taken to ensure the provision of energy in the
event of an emergency. The recommended security categorization for the energy conservation
and preparedness information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of energy conservation
and preparedness information on the ability of responsible agencies to protect energy resources
from over-consumption to ensure the continued availability of fuel resources and to promote
environmental protection. In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of energy conservation and
preparedness information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or
individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In some cases, unauthorized
disclosure of preliminary findings or policies under consideration regarding proposed
conservation measures or the distribution of energy in the event of an emergency may result in
mobilization of special interests. These groups may successfully oppose necessary conservation
measures and be given an unfair advantage for specific commercial interests. Also, the
unauthorized disclosure may cause domestic or international loss of confidence in the Federal
government. In such cases, serious damage may result for energy conservation and preparedness
operations. Therefore, the confidentiality impact level may be moderate.

In other cases, unauthorized disclosure of information regarding measures taken to ensure the
provision of energy in the event of an emergency may facilitate malicious activities of terrorists.
Here, there is a potential for loss of human life resulting from extended outages, so the
confidentiality impact level may be high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most energy conservation and preparedness information is low.
