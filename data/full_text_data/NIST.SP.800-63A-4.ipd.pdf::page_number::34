      NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                            Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                              Enrollment and Identity Proofing


858      7. If the agency uses a third-party CSP, the agency SHALL be responsible for
859         conducting its own privacy risk assessments or doing due diligence before relying
860         on the CSP’s privacy risk assessment as part of its PIA process.
861      8. If the agency uses a third-party CSP, the agency SHALL incorporate the CSP’s
862         assessment of equity risks into its own assessment of equity risks.

863   5.1.6. Requirements for Enrollment Codes
864   Enrollment codes are used to confirm an applicant has access to a validated address. If
865   identity proofing and enrollment are not completed in a single session, an enrollment code
866   can also be used to re-establish an applicant’s binding to their enrollment record for the
867   purposes of completing the enrollment process.
868   The following requirements apply to all CSPs that employ enrollment codes at any IAL:
869      1. Enrollment codes SHALL be sent to a validated address (e.g., postal address,
870         telephone number, or email address).
871      2. The applicant SHALL present a valid enrollment code to complete the identity
872         proofing process.
873      3. Enrollment codes SHALL be comprised of one of the following:
874           a) A random six digit number generated by an approved random number
875              generator with at least 20 bits of entropy;
876           b) A secure link delivered to a uniquely identified address containing an
877              appropriately constructed session ID (at least 64 bits of entropy); or
878           c) A machine readable optical label (such as a QR code) that contains a random
879              secret with at least 20 bits of entropy.
880      4. Enrollment codes SHALL be valid for at most:
881           a) 21 days, when sent to a validated postal address within the contiguous United
882              States;
883           b) 30 days, when sent to a validated postal address outside the contiguous United
884              States;
885           c) 10 minutes, when sent to a validated telephone number (SMS or voice); or
886           d) 24 hours, when sent to a validated email address.
887      5. The enrollment code SHALL NOT be used as an authentication factor.
