9.      Guidelines for Securing DNS Query/Response

Section 6.1.4 describes the DNSSEC approach for protection of DNS query/response transactions through
data origin authentication, data integrity verification, and authenticated denial of existence capabilities.
This section describes the mechanisms involved in the DNSSEC approach, the operations those
mechanisms involve, and a secure way of performing those operations by using checklists. In other
words, this section provides guidelines for secure deployment of DNSSEC features through DNSSEC
operations that are supported in name server software. These guidelines are covered in Sections 9.3
through 9.7.

To ensure end-to-end protection of DNS query/response transactions, additional protection measures
(apart from what DNSSEC specification provides)—such as securing the communication path between
local DNSSEC-aware caching/resolving name servers and stub resolvers—are needed. These measures
are discussed in Section 9.8.

Zone administrators need to have an understanding of the logic of dynamic updates in the presence of
additional RRsets (especially the NSEC RRSet) introduced into the zone file by DNSSEC specification.
This logic is explained in Section 9.9.

9.1     Enabling DNSSEC processing in BIND & NSD

Before a DNSSEC signed zone can be deployed, a name server must be configured to enable DNSSEC
processing. In BIND, it is done by adding the following line to the options statement in the named
configuration file (named.conf)

         options {
              dnssec-enable yes;
              };

After restart, the name server will now perform DNSSEC processing for DNS query/response
transactions.

In NSD and Windows Server, this option statement is not necessary. If the zone file contains DNSSEC
Resource Records, they are loaded automatically and the server correctly sends DNSSEC enabled
responses when signaled by a client query.


Checklist item 15: Name servers that deploy DNSSEC signed zones or query signed zones should be
configured to perform DNSSEC processing.



9.2     DNSSEC Mechanisms and Operations

DNSSEC mechanisms involve two main processes: sign and serve, and verify signature. These processes
are described below.

9.2.1    Sign and Serve

The first task in this process is to generate digital signatures associated with every RR in the zone file.
Instead of generating a signature for every RR, DNSSEC specifies generation of a signature for an RRSet
