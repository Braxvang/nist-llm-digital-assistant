NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                               Guidelines for Media Sanitization


   Purge:         See Destroy. Most routers and switches only offer capabilities to Clear (and not Purge) the
                  data contents. A router or switch may offer Purge capabilities, but these capabilities are
                  specific to the hardware and firmware of the device and should be applied with caution.
                  Refer to the device manufacturer to identify whether the device has a Purge capability that
                  applies media-dependent techniques (such as rewriting or block erasing) to ensure that
                  data recovery is infeasible, and that the device does not simply remove the file pointers.


   Destroy:       Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:         For both Clear and (if applicable) Purge, refer to the manufacturer for additional information on
                  the proper Sanitization procedure.
                  Network Devices may contain removable storage. The removable media must be removed and
                  sanitized using media-specific techniques.

   Mobile Devices
   (If a device has removable storage – first check for encryption and unencrypt if so – then
   remove the removable storage prior to sanitization)

   Apple iPhone and iPad (current generation and future iPhones and iPads)

   Clear:         Select the full sanitize option (typically in the ‘Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and
                  Settings’ menu). (The sanitization operation should take only minutes as Cryptographic Erase is
                  supported. This assumes that encryption is on and that all data has been encrypted.) Sanitization
                  performed via a remote wipe should be treated as a Clear operation, and it is not possible to
                  verify the sanitization results.

   Purge:         Select the full sanitize option (typically in the ‘Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and
                  Settings’ menu). (The sanitization operation should take only minutes with Cryptographic Erase
                  being supported. This assumes that encryption is on and that all data has been encrypted.)

   Destroy:       Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:         Following the Clear/Purge operation, manually navigate to multiple areas of the device (such as
                  browser history, files, photos, etc.) to verify that no personal information has been retained on the
                  device. Before sanitizing the device, ensure that the data is backed up to a safe place.
                  Current iPhones have hardware encryption – turned on by default.

   Blackberry     (back up data on device before sanitization)

   Clear:         BB OS 7.x/6.x - Select Options > Security Options > Security Wipe , making sure to select all
                  subcategories of data types for sanitization. Then type “blackberry” in the text field, then click on
                  “Wipe” (“Wipe Data” in BB OS 6.x) BB OS 10.x (Decrypt media card before continuing) Select
                  Settings, Security and Privacy, Security Wipe . Type “blackberry” in the text field, then click on
                  “Delete Data”. The sanitization operation may take as long as several hours depending on the
                  media size. Sanitization performed via a remote wipe should be treated as a Clear operation,
                  and it is not possible to verify the sanitization results.

   Purge:         BB OS 7.x/6.x - Select Options > Security > Security Wipe, then make sure to select all
                  subcategories of data types for sanitization. Then type “blackberry” in the text field, then click on
                  “Wipe” (“Wipe Data” in BB OS 6.x). For BB OS 10.x Select Settings> Security and
                  Privacy>Security Wipe. Type “blackberry” in the text field, then click on “Delete Data”. The
