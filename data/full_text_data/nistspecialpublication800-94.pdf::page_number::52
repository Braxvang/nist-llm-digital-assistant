GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



with the ratification of the IEEE 802.11i amendment, the Wi-Fi Alliance introduced WPA2, its term for
interoperable equipment that is capable of supporting IEEE 802.11i requirements. WPA2 offers stronger
security controls than either WPA or WEP.

5.1.2    WLAN Components

IEEE 802.11 WLANs have two fundamental architectural components:

 Station (STA). A STA is a wireless endpoint device. Typical examples of STAs are laptop
  computers, personal digital assistants (PDA), mobile phones, and other consumer electronic devices
  with IEEE 802.11 capabilities.
 Access Point (AP). 28 An AP logically connects STAs with a distribution system (DS), which is
  typically an organization’s wired infrastructure. The DS is the means by which STAs can
  communicate with the organization’s wired LANs and external networks such as the Internet. Figure
  5-1 shows an example of how APs, STAs, and DSs are related.

Some WLANs also use wireless switches. A wireless switch is a device that acts as an intermediary
between APs and the DS. The purpose of the switch is to assist administrators in managing the WLAN
infrastructure. In WLANs without wireless switches, the APs connect directly to the DS.

The IEEE 802.11 standard also defines the following two WLAN architectures:

 Ad Hoc Mode. The ad hoc mode does not use APs. Ad hoc mode, also known as peer-to-peer mode,
  involves two or more STAs communicating directly with one another.
 Infrastructure Mode. In infrastructure mode, an AP connects wireless STAs to a DS, typically a
  wired network.

     Technically, APs are also STAs. Some literature distinguishes between AP STAs and non-AP STAs. In this document, the
     term STA refers to non-AP STAs only.
