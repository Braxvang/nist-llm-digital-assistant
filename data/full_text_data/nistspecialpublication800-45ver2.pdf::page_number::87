                                                             GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



Completed                                           Action
            Limit access to VPN clients and other remote access applications on mobile
            devices, or remove the clients/applications if they are not needed
            Configure authentication and access
            Enable secure authentication and access
            Disable ability of mail client to store username and passwords
            Configure client to use encryption (TLS) for SMTP, POP, and IMAP
            communications
            Set restrictions on the selection of email addresses, such as ensuring they are
            unrelated to user account names
            Secure the mail client host operating system
            Keep the OS updated to the most secure patch level
            Configure the OS to allow only the appropriate user(s) to access locally stored
            messages and mail client configuration files
            Secure or remove Windows Script Host (Windows hosts only)
            Change the default action on files associated with the Windows Script Host from
            execute to edit (Windows hosts only)
            Ensure that the OS is configured to show full file extensions (Windows hosts only)
            Install an anti-virus application and configure it to scan incoming messages and
            attachments; also install an anti-spyware application if the anti-virus software does
            not offer robust anti-spyware capabilities
            Install a personal firewall if needed to protect the computer from unauthorized
            communications
            Ensure the OS enforces the concept of least privilege, because malicious code
            runs in the security context on which it was launched (i.e., the user’s access level)
            Ensure that critical components of the operating system are protected from
            malicious code
            Use a file encrypting application to protect the email stored locally on the user’s
            hard drive (especially important for mobile devices)
            Configure the OS to automatically lock the current session after a fixed period of
            inactivity
            Secure message composition
            Provide security for email message content (e.g., S/MIME, OpenPGP)
            Use of plug-ins
            Enable and install only absolutely necessary plug-ins from trusted sources
            Access to Web-based mail systems
            Configure Web-based mail access to only use 128-bit SSL/TLS connections
            Make users aware of what they should do before granting them access to Web-
            based mail
