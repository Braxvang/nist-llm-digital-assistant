OT Discussion: The policy specifically addresses the unique properties and requirements of OT
and the relationship to non-OT systems. OT access by vendors and maintenance staff can occur
over a large facility footprint or geographic area and into unobserved spaces, such as mechanical
or electrical rooms, ceilings, floors, field substations, switch and valve vaults, and pump stations.

OT Discussion: In OT systems, physical security, personnel security, intrusion detection, or
auditing measures may support this control objective.
Control Enhancement: (1) (3) (4) No OT discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (2) OT Discussion: When the OT (e.g., field devices) cannot support
temporary or emergency accounts, this enhancement does not apply. Example compensating
controls include employing nonautomated mechanisms or procedures.
Control Enhancement: (5) OT Discussion: This control enhancement defines situations or
timeframes in which users log out of accounts in the policy. Automatic enforcement is not
addressed by this control enhancement. Organizations determine whether this control
enhancement is appropriate for the mission and/or functions of the OT system and define the
timeframe or scenarios. If no timeframe or scenarios apply, the organization-defined parameter
reflects as much.
Control Enhancement: (11) (12) No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (13) OT Discussion: Close coordination occurs between OT, HR, IT, and
physical security personnel to ensure the timely removal of high-risk individuals.
