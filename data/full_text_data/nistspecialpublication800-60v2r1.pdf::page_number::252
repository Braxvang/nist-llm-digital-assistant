Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for formula grants information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Formula grants
activities are not generally time-critical and multiple individuals in multiple organizations are
usually involved in the grants process. Therefore, the information maintained by all the
individuals/agencies is probably necessary to alter a grants decision. In most cases, the adverse
effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of formula grants information on agency
mission functions or public confidence in the agency will be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
formula grants information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to formula grants information. Formula
grants processes are generally tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of access to formula
grants information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
formula grants information is low.

D.25.2 Project/Competitive Grants Information Type

Project/Competitive Grants involves the funding, for fixed or known periods, of projects.
Project/Competitive grants can include fellowships, scholarships, research grants, training grants,
traineeships, experimental and demonstration grants, evaluation grants, planning grants,
technical assistance grants, survey grants, and construction grants. The general recommended
security categorization for the project/competitive grants information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of project/competitive
grants information on the ability of responsible agencies to award fellowships, scholarships,
research grants, training grants, traineeships, experimental and demonstration grants, evaluation
grants, planning grants, technical assistance grants, survey grants, and/or construction grants. In
most cases, unauthorized disclosure of project/competitive grants information will have only a
limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In some cases, project/competitive
grants information may be sensitive with moderate to high impact. In a few cases, details of
programs for which grants are awarded may be classified and outside the scope of this guideline.
