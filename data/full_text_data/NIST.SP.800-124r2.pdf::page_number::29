NIST SP 800-124r2                                                    Guidelines for Managing the Security
May 2023                                                              of Mobile Devices in the Enterprise

4.2.1.1.       General Policy Enforcement
EMM technology can enforce enterprise security policies on a mobile device, which can
configure or restrict the use of mobile functionality and security capabilities. EMM technology
can automatically monitor, detect, and report when policy violations occur and automatically
take action when possible and appropriate. General policy restrictions or configuration options
for mobile device security include:
   •   Manage wireless network interfaces (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC).
   •   Restrict user and app access to hardware (e.g., digital camera and removable storage) and
       device features (e.g., copy and paste).
   •   Detect changes to the approved security configuration baseline.
   •   Limit or prevent access to enterprise services based on the mobile device’s OS version
       (including whether the device has been rooted/jailbroken), vendor/brand, model, or
       mobile device management software client version (if applicable).
   •   Disable debugging or developer mode.

4.2.1.2.       User and Device Authentication
User and device authentication can be defined and enforced using EMM technology. Some basic
options and considerations include:
   •   Require a password or other authenticator to unlock the device (e.g., passcode,
       biometric).).
   •   Require a password/passcode and/or other authentication mechanism (e.g., token-based
       authentication, network-based device authentication, domain authentication, digital
       certificate) to access the organization’s resources. This includes basic parameters for
       password strength, a limit on the number of retries permitted without negative
       consequences (e.g., locking out the account, wiping the device), and password aging.
   •   Have the device automatically lock itself after it is idle for a period of time (e.g., 45
       seconds, 5 minutes).).
   •   Under the direction of an administrator, remotely lock the device if it is suspected that the
       device is lost or was left in an unlocked state in an unsecured location.
   •   Wipe the device after a certain number of incorrect authentication attempts or after a
       predetermined time interval without it checking into the EMM. Note that the ability to
       recover data via an EMM after it has been wiped is limited.

4.2.1.3.       Data Communication and Storage
Protections for data communications and on-device data storage can be defined and enforced
using EMM technology. Considerations for these data protections include:
