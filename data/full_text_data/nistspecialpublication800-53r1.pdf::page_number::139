FAMILY: SYSTEM AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY                                                CLASS: OPERATIONAL


SI-1      SYSTEM AND INFORMATION INTEGRITY POLICY AND PROCEDURES

          Control:The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a formal,
          documented, system and information integrity policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
          responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and
          compliance; and (ii) formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system
          and information integrity policy and associated system and information integrity controls.
          Supplemental Guidance:   The system and information integrity policy and procedures are consistent
          with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.
          The system and information integrity policy can be included as part of the general information
          security policy for the organization. System and information integrity procedures can be
          developed for the security program in general, and for a particular information system, when
          required. NIST Special Publication 800-12 provides guidance on security policies and procedures.
          Control Enhancements: None.

SI-2      FLAW REMEDIATION

          Control: The organization identifies, reports, and corrects information system flaws.

          Supplemental Guidance: The organization identifies information systems containing software
          affected by recently announced software flaws (and potential vulnerabilities resulting from those
          flaws). The organization (or the software developer/vendor in the case of software developed and
          maintained by a vendor/contractor) promptly installs newly released security relevant patches,
          service packs, and hot fixes, and tests patches, service packs, and hot fixes for effectiveness and
          potential side effects on the organizationâ€™s information systems before installation. Flaws
          discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or
          information system error handling are also addressed expeditiously. Flaw remediation is
          incorporated into configuration management as an emergency change. NIST Special Publication
          800-40, provides guidance on security patch installation and patch management. Related security
          controls: CA-2, CA-4, CA-7, CM-3, IR-4, SI-11.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization centrally manages the flaw remediation process and installs updates
                automatically.
          (2)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to periodically and upon demand determine the
                state of information system components with regard to flaw remediation.
