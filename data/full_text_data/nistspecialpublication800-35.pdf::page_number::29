appropriate service arrangement so as to support the business function. The next phase of the life cycle,
Assessment, is where it is determined whether the most appropriate service is one performed internally or
externally.

As one IT security services life cycle is initiated, it is likely another life cycle will be ending. To ensure a
smooth transition, managers should be aware of possible interactions and effects between the service that
is ending and the one that is beginning.

                         TABLE 4-1. IT SECURITY ISSUES AND SAMPLE LIFE CYCLE TRIGGERS
 Strategic/Mission            • Change in business model
                              • Investigating new service arrangements to better focus on the organization’s
                                  mission and business function

 Budgetary/Funding             •   Increased IT security budget, allowing greater security services
                               •   Decreased IT security budget warrants an investigation into ways to cut costs.

 Technical/ Architectural      •   New technology needs implemented
                               •   Upgrades to new technology

 Organizational                •   Current organizational environment and employee mix (if already using external
                                   service providers) not working well
                               •   Organization changing service arrangement approach

 Personnel                     •   Several functional experts leave the organization, creating a shortage of
                                   technical expertise in a security service area

 Policy/Process                •   Current policies or processes not meeting organization’s security needs




4.2   Phase 2: Assessment

Phase 2, Assessment, shown in Figure 4-3, follows the Initiation Phase. The steps in this phase include
baselining the existing environment, analyzing opportunities and barriers, and identifying options and
risks. To establish a baseline understanding of the existing environment, the decision makers will need to
use metrics and the principle of total cost of ownership (TCO) to ensure the most accurate data will be
used for decision-making purposes. This data will also set performance targets and cost estimates for
service agreements in later phases.
