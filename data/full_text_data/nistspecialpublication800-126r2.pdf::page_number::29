               The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



       iv. Use of the @name attribute in the <xccdf:check-content-ref> element is
           OPTIONAL. If present, it MUST reference an OCIL questionnaire in the designated OCIL
           source data stream component, otherwise see Section 4.5.2 for information on use of the
           @multi-check attribute.
        v. Follow the additional requirements in Appendix B of NIST Interagency Report (IR) 7692,
           Specifications for the Open Checklist Interactive Language (OCIL) Version 2.0 [OCIL].
If a check system that is not supported by SCAP is used in XCCDF content, this content SHALL NOT be
considered well-formed with regards to SCAP.

3.2.4.3 Use of a Patches Up-To-Date Rule
An OVAL source data stream component MAY be used to represent a series of checks to verify that
patches have been installed. Historically, an XCCDF convention has been used to identify such a
reference. An XCCDF benchmark MAY include a patches up-to-date rule that MUST reference an
OVAL source data stream component. When implementing a patches up-to-date XCCDF rule, the
following approach SHALL be used:
    1. The source data stream MUST include the OVAL source data stream component referenced by
       the patches up-to-date rule, which contains one or more OVAL patch class definitions.
    2. The <xccdf:Rule> element that references an OVAL source data stream component SHALL
       have the @id attribute value of “xccdf_NAMESPACE_rule_security_patches_up_to_date”, where
       NAMESPACE is the reverse DNS format namespace associated with the content maintainer.
    3. Each <xccdf:check-content-ref> element SHALL omit the @name attribute.
    4. The @multi-check attribute of the <xccdf:check> element SHOULD be set to “true”.
       This causes a separate <xccdf:rule-result> to be generated for each OVAL Definition.
       See Section 4.5.2 for more information.
Here is a patches up-to-date rule example:

<xccdf:Rule
   id="xccdf_gov.nist.fdcc.xp_rule_security_patches_up_to_date"
   selected="true">
   <xccdf:title>Security Patches Up-To-Date</xccdf:title>
   <xccdf:description>Keep systems up to current patch levels
   </xccdf:description>
   <xccdf:check system="http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5"
      multi-check="true">
      <xccdf:check-content-ref href="scap-win2000-patches.xml"/>
   </xccdf:check>
</xccdf:Rule>

3.2.4.4 CVSS and CCSS Scores
SCAP 1.0 required the inclusion of static CVSS scores in XCCDF vulnerability-related rules. However,
CVSS base scores sometimes change over time, such as when more information is available about a
particular vulnerability, and CVSS temporal and environmental scores are intended to change to reflect
current threats, security controls, and other factors. During scoring, current CVSS scores acquired
dynamically, such as from a data feed, SHOULD be used in place of the @weight attribute within
XCCDF vulnerability-related rules. Section 3.8 contains additional requirements for CVSS usage.
CCSS scores are more stable than CVSS scores, but they still may change over time. Accordingly, during
scoring, current CCSS scores acquired dynamically, such as from a data feed, MAY be used in place of
