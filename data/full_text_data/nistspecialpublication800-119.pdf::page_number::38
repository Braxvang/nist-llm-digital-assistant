assignment and reporting requirements that differ from those for IPv4. RFC 3177, IAB/IESG
Recommendations on IPv6 Address Allocations to Sites, documents an ongoing effort to provide the latest
information for the Internet community regarding current practices, status, and clarifications for IPv6
address allocations. ARIN18 will document its policy as well.

3.3       IPv6 Header Types, Formats, and Fields

The design of the IPv6 header is the culmination of lessons learned from more than 20 years of
experience with IPv4. Two primary design goals for the new header were efficiency and extensibility.
The IPv6 header is always 40 bytes long and contains only eight fields, whereas IPv4 headers may be as
short as 20 bytes or as long as 60 bytes and contain at least 12 different fields (some of which may be
unused). When comparing these attributes, it becomes apparent that the IPv6 header is simpler and more
efficient to process. Three examples are:

          The checksum has been removed, because error checking is usually performed in link layer
           and transport layer protocols.

          Fragmentation has been relegated to an extension header, the minimum MTU has been
           increased to 1280 bytes, and fragmentation and reassembly are only performed by endpoints.

          Routers have to examine more than the 40-byte header only when the Next Header (NH) field
           is zero.

The design also pays careful attention to alignment for 64-bit processors; for example, the addresses are
aligned on 64-bit boundaries.

The constant size of IPv6 headers makes the header length field found in IPv4 unnecessary. Routers and
intermediate nodes handling the packets are not required to accommodate variability in the length of the
headers, which expedites packet handling. The IPv6 header format is illustrated in Figure 3-6.

                                                 Source Address (128 bits)

                                             Destination Address (128 bits)

The fixed length of the IPv6 header does not preclude flexibility in favor of function. Options are
handled with extension headers, which are described in detail in the next section. The following are the
eight fields in the fixed IPv6 header:

          Version. This is the version of the protocol. This is a 4-bit value and must equal 6 (in binary,
           0110).
