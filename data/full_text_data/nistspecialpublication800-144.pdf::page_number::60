           Reaching agreement on the terms of service of a negotiated service agreement for public
           cloud services can be a complicated process fraught with technical and legal issues. If a
           negotiated service agreement is used, a legal advisor should be involved from the onset to
           address complicated legal issues that are likely to arise during negotiations.

          Assess Performance. Continual assessment of the performance of the cloud provider
           and quality of the services provisioned is needed to ensure all contract obligations and
           organizational requirements are being met, and is an essential part of the risk
           management process.26 The organization should analyze the state of the system regularly
           and as frequently as necessary to manage security and privacy risks adequately.
           Continual assessment allows the organization to take immediate corrective or punitive
           action for noted deficiencies and also provides a reference point or benchmark for
           improving the terms of the service agreement [All88, Gra03, Len03].

5.4       Concluding Activities
At the end of a project, when transitioning to another cloud provider, or for other reasons, the
organization can decide to enter the final stage of outsourcing and terminate use of the public
cloud services and close out the contract. Organizations should perform the following activities
preceding the termination of an outsourcing contract:

          Reaffirm Contractual Obligations. The organization should alert the cloud provider
           about any relevant contractual requirements that must be observed upon termination, such
           as non-disclosure of certain terms of the agreement and sanitization of organizational data
           from storage media [Len03].

          Eliminate Physical and Electronic Access Rights. If any accounts and access rights to
           an organization’s computational resources were assigned to the cloud provider as part of
           the service agreement, they should be revoked in a timely manner by the organization
           [All88, Len03]. Similarly, physical access rights of security tokens and badges issued to
           the cloud provider also need to be revoked, and any personal tokens and badges used for
           access need to be recovered [All88].

          Recover Organizational Resources and Data. The organization should ensure that any
           resources of the organization made available to the cloud provider under the terms of the
           service agreement, such as software, equipment, documentation, are returned or
           recovered in a usable form, as well as any data, programs, scripts, etc. owned by the
           organization and held by the cloud provider. If the terms of service require the cloud
           provider to purge data, programs, backup copies, and other cloud consumer content from
           its environment, evidence such as system reports or logs should be obtained and verified
