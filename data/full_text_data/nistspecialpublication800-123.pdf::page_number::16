                                                                          GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



 Psychological Acceptability—Users should understand the necessity of security. This can be
  provided through training and education. In addition, the security mechanisms in place should
  present users with sensible options that give them the usability they require on a daily basis. If users
  find the security mechanisms too cumbersome, they may devise ways to work around or compromise
  them. The objective is not to weaken security so it is understandable and acceptable, but to train and
  educate users and to design security mechanisms and policies that are usable and effective.

 Least Common Mechanism—When providing a feature for the system, it is best to have a single
  process or service gain some function without granting that same function to other parts of the
  system. The ability for the Web server process to access a back-end database, for instance, should not
  also enable other applications on the system to access the back-end database.

 Defense-in-Depth—Organizations should understand that a single security mechanism is generally
  insufficient. Security mechanisms (defenses) need to be layered so that compromise of a single
  security mechanism is insufficient to compromise a host or network. No “silver bullet” exists for
  information system security.

 Work Factor—Organizations should understand what it would take to break the system or network’s
  security features. The amount of work necessary for an attacker to break the system or network
  should exceed the value that the attacker would gain from a successful compromise.

 Compromise Recording—Records and logs should be maintained so that if a compromise does
  occur, evidence of the attack is available to the organization. This information can assist in securing
  the network and host after the compromise and aid in identifying the methods and exploits used by
  the attacker. This information can be used to better secure the host or network in the future. In
  addition, these records and logs can assist organizations in identifying and prosecuting attackers.
