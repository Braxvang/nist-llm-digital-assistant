NIST SP 800-82r3                                            Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

the remote access authentication mechanism will be used to identify, permit, and log individual
access before permitting the use of shared accounts.
Control Enhancement: (8) No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (12) OT Discussion: The acceptance of PIV credentials is only required
for federal organizations, as defined by OMB Memorandum M-19-17 [OMB-M1917]. Non-
federal organizations should refer to IA-2 (1) (2) for guidance on multi-factor authentication
credentials. Furthermore, many OT systems do not have the ability to accept PIV credentials and
will require compensating controls.

OT Discussion: OT devices may not inherently support device authentication. If devices are local
to one another, physical security measures that prevent unauthorized communication between
devices can be used as compensating controls. For remote communication, additional hardware
may be required to meet authentication requirements.
Control Enhancement: (1) (4) OT Discussion: For OT systems that include IIoT devices, these
enhancements may be needed to protect device-to-device communication.
Rationale for adding IA-3 to LOW baseline: Given the variety of OT devices and physical
locations of OT devices, organizations may consider whether OT devices that may be vulnerable
to tampering or spoofing require unique identification and authentication and for what types of
connections.

No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (4) OT Discussion: This control enhancement is typically implemented by
the organization rather than at the system level. However, to manage risk for certain OT
environments, identifiers (e.g., badges) may have different markings to indicate the status of
individuals, such as contractors, foreign nationals, and non-organizational users.
