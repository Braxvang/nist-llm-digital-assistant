202   3.1.3. Information Flow Enforcement
203           REQUIREMENT: 03.01.03
204           Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of CUI within the system and between
205           connected systems.

206           DISCUSSION
207           Information flow control regulates where CUI can transit within a system and between systems
208           (versus who can access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that
209           information. Flow control restrictions include keeping CUI from being transmitted in the clear to
210           the internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, restricting
211           requests to the internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information
212           transfers between organizations based on data structures and content.
213           Organizations commonly use information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to
214           control the flow of CUI between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals,
215           and devices) within systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on
216           characteristics of the information or the information path. Enforcement occurs in boundary
217           protection devices (e.g., encrypted tunnels, routers, gateways, and firewalls) that use rule sets or
218           establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering capability
219           based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability based on message content
220           (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics). Organizations also
221           consider the trustworthiness of filtering and inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and
222           software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement.
223           Transferring information between systems that represent different security domains with different
224           security policies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security
225           policies. In such situations, information owners or stewards provide guidance at designated policy
226           enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific
227           architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes
228           prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing information
229           access only), employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows, and
230           implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security
231           labels.

235   3.1.4. Separation of Duties
236           REQUIREMENT: 03.01.04
237           a. Identify the duties of individuals requiring separation.
238           b. Define system access authorizations to support separation of duties.

239           DISCUSSION
240           Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges and reduces the risk
241           of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of duties includes dividing mission functions
242           and support functions among different individuals or roles, conducting system support functions
