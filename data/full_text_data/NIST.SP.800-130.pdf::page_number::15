A metadata element may be implicitly known and therefore may not be specifically
recorded for certain keys within a CKMS. For example, if all keys within a device are
AES-128 keys, then a metadata element recording key sizes may not be required.
However, in many systems, there is a need to differentiate one key from another using
one or more explicitly recorded metadata elements. This CKMS framework focuses on
those metadata elements that are explicitly recorded and managed by the CKMS. The
term “metadata” is used in this context (i.e., the term “metadata” refers to explicitly
recorded and managed metadata elements).

There are many possible metadata elements for a given key. A trusted association,
between a key and selected metadata elements, is often needed by the CKMS in order to
perform key management functions. For example, it is desirable to have a trusted
association between a static public key and the owner’s identifier. When used in
conjunction with an owner registration process, the trusted association provides assurance
that the owner that is specified by the identifier is, or was, in possession of the
corresponding private key.

Metadata elements may be generated by the same entity that generates the key, or they
may be received from a trusted entity. Whenever metadata is received from a trusted
entity (whether or not the associated key is sent simultaneously) there must be a trusted
association between the metadata and the associated key. The trusted association
maintained during the distribution may be enforced by a cryptographic binding (binding)
of the key and metadata (e.g., a digital signature computed on the combination of the key
and metadata), or the association may be enforced by a trusted process (e.g., a face-to-
face handover of metadata from an entity who is known and trusted). A CKMS often
provides cryptographic binding and verification functions that are used in the key and
metadata distribution and management processes. The receiver obtains assurance that the
key and its metadata are properly associated, have come from a particular source, have
not been modified, and have been protected from unauthorized disclosure during transit.
Upon receipt of the metadata, the association between the key and metadata should be
verified. A cryptographic binding is verified by applying the appropriate cryptographic
verification function to the key and bound metadata elements. A non-cryptographic
trusted association is verified by assessing the trusted process (i.e., the trust in the
sending entity and the distribution process). See Figure 1 below.
