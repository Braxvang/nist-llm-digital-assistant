6.2       Server Backup Procedures

One of the most important functions of a server administrator is to maintain the integrity of the data on
the server. This is important because servers are often some of the most exposed and vital hosts on an
organization’s network. The server administrator needs to perform backups of the server on a regular
basis for several reasons. A server could fail as a result of a malicious or unintentional act or a hardware
or software failure. In addition, Federal agencies and many other organizations are governed by
regulations on the backup and archiving of server data. Server data should also be backed up regularly
for legal and financial reasons.

6.2.1      Server Data Backup Policies

All organizations need to create a server data backup policy. Three main factors influence the contents of
this policy:

 Legal requirements

      –    Applicable laws and regulations (Federal, state, and international)

      –    Litigation requirements

 Mission requirements

      –    Contractual

      –    Accepted practices

      –    Criticality of data to organization

 Organizational guidelines and policies.

Although each organization’s server backup policy will be different to reflect its particular environment,
it should address the following issues:

 Purpose of the policy

 Parties affected by the policy

 Servers covered by the policy

 Definitions of key terms, especially legal and technical

 Detailed requirements from the legal, business, and organization’s perspective

 Required frequency of backups
