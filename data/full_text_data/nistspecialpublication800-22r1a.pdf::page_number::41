2.8.5 Decision Rule (at the 1% Level)
If the computed P-value is < 0.01, then conclude that the sequence is non-random. Otherwise, conclude
that the sequence is random.

2.8.6 Conclusion and Interpretation of Results
Since the P-value obtained in step 4 of Section 2.8.4 is ≥ 0.01 (P-value = 0.274932), the conclusion is that
the sequence is random.

Note that for the 2-bit template (B = 11), if the entire sequence had too many 2-bit runs of ones, then: 1)
ν5 would have been too large, 2) the test statistic would be too large, 3) the P-value would have been
small (< 0.01) and 4) a conclusion of non-randomness would have resulted.

2.8.7 Input Size Recommendation
The values of K, M and N have been chosen such that each sequence to be tested consists of a minimum
of 106 bits (i.e., n ≥ 106). Various values of m may be selected, but for the time being, NIST recommends
m = 9 or m = 10. If other values are desired, please choose these values as follows:
        • n ≥ MN.
        • N should be chosen so that N • (min πi) > 5.
        • λ = (M-m+1)/2m ≈ 2
        • m should be chosen so that m ≈ log2 M
        • Choose K so that K ≈ 2λ. Note that the πi values would need to be recalculated for values of
              K other than 5.

2.8.8 Example
(input)    ε = the binary expansion of e up to 1,000,000 bits

(input)            n = 1000000, B = 111111111

(processing)       ν0 = 329; ν1 = 164; ν2 = 150; ν3 = 111; ν4 = 78; and ν5 = 136

(processing)       χ2(obs) = 8.965859

(output)           P-value = 0.110434

(conclusion)       Since the P-value ≥ 0.01, accept the sequence as random.
