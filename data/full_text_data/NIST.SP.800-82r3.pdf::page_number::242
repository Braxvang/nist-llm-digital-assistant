Terms used in this overlay are listed in the CSRC glossary.

F.7.   Detailed Overlay Control Specifications
This overlay is based on NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information
Systems and Organizations [SP800-53r5], which provides a catalog of security and privacy
controls, and NIST SP 800-53B, Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organizations
[SP800-53B]. The controls are customizable and implemented as part of an organization-wide
process that manages security and privacy risk. The controls address a diverse set of security and
privacy requirements across the Federal Government and critical infrastructure and are derived
from legislation, Executive Orders, policies, directives, regulations, standards, and mission and
business needs. The documents also describe how to develop specialized sets of controls or
overlays that are tailored for specific types of mission and business functions, technologies, or
environments of operation. Finally, the catalog controls address security from both a
functionality perspective (i.e., the strength of security and privacy functions and mechanisms
provided) and an assurance perspective (i.e., the measures of confidence in the implemented
capability). Addressing both functionality and assurance helps to ensure that component products
and the systems built from those products use sound system and security engineering principles
and are sufficiently trustworthy.
In preparation for selecting and specifying the appropriate controls for organizational systems
and their respective environments of operation, organizations should first determine the
criticality and sensitivity of the information to be processed, stored, or transmitted by those
systems. This process is known as security categorization. FIPS 199 [FIPS199] enables federal
agencies to establish security categories for both information and information systems. Other
documents, such as those produced by ISA and CNSS, also provide guidance for defining low,
moderate, and high levels of security based on impact. The security categories are based on the
potential impact on an organization or on people (i.e., employees and/or the public) should
certain events occur that jeopardize the information and systems needed by the organization to
accomplish its assigned mission, such as protecting its assets, fulfilling its legal responsibilities,
maintaining its day-to-day functions, and protecting individualsâ€™ safety, health, and life. Security
categories are to be used in conjunction with vulnerability and threat information to assess the
risk to an organization.
This overlay provides OT Discussions for the controls and control enhancements prescribed for a
system or an organization designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its
data and to meet a set of defined security requirements. Discussions for all controls and control
enhancements in Section 3 of NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 should be used in conjunction with the
OT Discussions in this overlay. This overlay contains a tailoring of the control baselines, and its
specification may be more stringent or less stringent than the original control baseline
specification. It is high-level, applicable to all OT environments, can be applied to multiple
systems, and may be used as the basis for more specific overlays. Use cases for specific systems
in specific environments may be separately published (e.g., as a NIST IR).
Figure 22 uses the AU-4 control as an example of the format and content of the detailed overlay
control specifications.
