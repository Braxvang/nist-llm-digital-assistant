Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1                Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________

SA-4      ACQUISITIONS

          Control: The organization includes security requirements and/or security specifications, either
          explicitly or by reference, in information system acquisition contracts based on an assessment of
          risk and in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
          and standards.
          Supplemental Guidance:
          Solicitation Documents
          The solicitation documents (e.g., Requests for Proposals) for information systems and services
          include, either explicitly or by reference, security requirements that describe: (i) required security
          capabilities (security needs and, as necessary, specific security controls and other specific FISMA
          requirements); (ii) required design and development processes; (iii) required test and evaluation
          procedures; and (iv) required documentation. The requirements in the solicitation documents
          permit updating security controls as new threats/vulnerabilities are identified and as new
          technologies are implemented. NIST Special Publication 800-36 provides guidance on the
          selection of information security products. NIST Special Publication 800-35 provides guidance on
          information technology security services. NIST Special Publication 800-64 provides guidance on
          security considerations in the system development life cycle.
          Information System Documentation
          The solicitation documents include requirements for appropriate information system
          documentation. The documentation addresses user and systems administrator guidance and
          information regarding the implementation of the security controls in the information system. The
          level of detail required in the documentation is based on the FIPS 199 security category for the
          information system.
          Use of Tested, Evaluated, and Validated Products
          NIST Special Publication 800-23 provides guidance on the acquisition and use of tested/evaluated
          information technology products.
          Configuration Settings and Implementation Guidance
          The information system required documentation includes security configuration settings and
          security implementation guidance. OMB FISMA reporting instructions provide guidance on
          configuration requirements for federal information systems. NIST Special Publication 800-70
          provides guidance on configuration settings for information technology products.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization requires in solicitation documents that appropriate documentation be provided
                describing the functional properties of the security controls employed within the information
                system with sufficient detail to permit analysis and testing of the controls.
          (2)   The organization requires in solicitation documents that appropriate documentation be provided
                describing the design and implementation details of the security controls employed within the
                information system with sufficient detail to permit analysis and testing of the controls (including
                functional interfaces among control components).
