Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of services acquisition
information on the ability of agencies to oversee and/or manage contractors and service
providers from the private sector. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most services
acquisition information are likely to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of
information associated with very large procurements can result in fraud, waste, abuse, and/or
legal proceedings that can have a serious effect on Federal government assets and operations.
Also, information associated with acquisition of some services (e.g., security or protection
services) can be of material use to criminals seeking to gain access to Federal facilities or
information in order to facilitate or perpetrate sabotage, murder, fraud, theft, or other criminal
enterprises. In these cases, unauthorized disclosure of information can have a serious adverse
effect on agency operations, agency assets, and/or individuals. The consequent confidentiality
impact will range from moderate to high. Additionally, some procurement information
associated with proposals is proprietary. In the case of competitive procurements, much
information associated with unsuccessful bids remains proprietary following award of the
contract (e.g., pricing information). Unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information can have
serious consequences for agencies and have at least a moderate confidentiality impact level.
Some services procurement information is classified. The classified information is national
security related and is outside the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most services acquisition information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of services acquisition information
usually depends on the urgency with which the information is needed or the immediacy with
which the information is used. In most cases, the information will not be needed urgently or
acted upon immediately. Also, unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting
external publication of services acquisition information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may
adversely affect public confidence in the agency. However, damage to the mission would
usually be limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of information relating to procurement actions (particularly proposal information) can result in
serious disruption of procurement processes and loss of availability of services that can be
important or even critical to agency operations. In such cases, the integrity impact level can be
moderate or even high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most services acquisition information is low.
