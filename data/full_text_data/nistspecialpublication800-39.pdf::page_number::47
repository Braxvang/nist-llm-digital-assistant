with different objectives and utility of the information produced. For example, risk assessments
conducted at Tier 1 or Tier 2 focus on organizational operations, assets, and individuals—whether
comprehensive across mission/business lines or only on those assessments that are cross-cutting
to the particular mission/business line. Organization-wide assessments of risk can be based solely
on the assumptions, constraints, risk tolerances, priorities, and trade-offs established in the risk
framing step (derived primarily from Tier 1 activities) or can be based on risk assessments
conducted across multiple mission/business lines (derived primarily from Tier 2 activities). Risk
assessments conducted at one tier can be used to refine/enhance threat, vulnerability, likelihood,
and impact information used in assessments conducted in other tiers. The degree that information
from risk assessments can be reused is shaped by the similarity of missions/business functions
and the degree of autonomy that organizational entities or subcomponents have with respect to
parent organizations. Organizations that are decentralized can expect to conduct more risk
assessment activities at Tier 2 and, as a result, may have a greater need to communicate within
Tier 2 to identify cross-cutting threats and vulnerabilities. Decentralized organizations can still
benefit from Tier 1 risk assessments and, in particular, the identification of an initial set of threat
and vulnerability sources. Organization-wide risk assessments provide some initial prioritization
of risks for decision makers to consider when entering the risk response step.

Organizations benefit significantly from conducting risk assessments as part of an organization-
wide risk management process. However, once risk assessments are complete, it is prudent for
organizations to invest some time in keeping the assessments current. Maintaining currency of
risk assessments requires support from the risk monitoring step (e.g., observing changes in
organizational information systems and environments of operation or analyzing monitoring
results to maintain awareness of the risk). Keeping risk assessments up to date provides many
potential benefits such as timely, relevant information that enables senior leaders/executives to
perform near real-time risk management. Maintaining risk assessments also reduces future
assessment costs and supports ongoing risk monitoring efforts. Organizations may determine that
conducting comprehensive risk assessments as a way of maintaining current risk assessments do
not provide sufficient value. In such situations, organizations consider conducting incremental
and/or differential risk assessments. Incremental risk assessments consider only new information
(e.g., the effects of using a new information system on mission/business risk), whereas
differential risk assessments consider how changes affect the overall risk determination.
Incremental or differential risk assessments are useful if organizations require a more targeted
review of risk, seek an expanded understanding of risk, or desire an expanded understanding of
the risk in relation to missions/business functions.

STEP 2: RISK ASSESSMENT

Inputs and Preconditions
Inputs to the risk assessment step from the risk framing step include, for example: (i) acceptable risk assessment
methodologies; (ii) the breadth and depth of analysis employed during risk assessments; (iii) the level of granularity
required for describing threats; (iv) whether/how to assess external service providers; and (v) whether/how to aggregate
risk assessment results from different organizational entities or mission/business functions to the organization as a
whole. Organizational expectations regarding risk assessment methodologies, techniques, and/or procedures are shaped
heavily by governance structures, risk tolerance, culture, trust, and life cycle processes. Prior to conducting risk
assessments, organizations understand the fundamental reasons for conducting the assessments and what constitutes
adequate depth and breadth for the assessments. Risk assumptions, risk constraints, risk tolerance, and priorities/trade-
offs defined during the risk framing step shape how organizations use risk assessments—for example, localized
applications of the risk assessments within each of the risk management tiers (i.e., governance, mission/business
process, information systems) or global applications of the risk assessments across the entire organization. Risk
assessments can be conducted by organizations even when some of the inputs from the risk framing step have not been
received or preconditions established. However, in those situations, the quality of the risk assessment results may be
affected. In addition to the risk framing step, the risk assessment step can receive inputs from the risk monitoring step,
