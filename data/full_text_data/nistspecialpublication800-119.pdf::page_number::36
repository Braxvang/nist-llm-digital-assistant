                                                                 GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


P1 assigns address space to its customers using leftmost bits:

1000 0000 : assigned to customer 1 (C1)
0100 0000 : assigned to customer 2 (C2)
1100 0000 : assigned to customer 3 (C3)
0010 0000 : assigned to customer 4 (C4)

C2 assigns address space to its customers (C2C1, C2C2, ….) using centermost bits:

0000 10000 : assigned to C2C1
0001 00000 : assigned to C2C2
0001 10000 : assigned to C2C3

Customer of C2 uses centermost bits for maximum flexibility and then the last aggregators (which should
be networks within a site) will be assigned using rightmost bits.

Putting all bits together for C2C3:

                     P1                                    C2               C2C3
         Hex         3ffe:0b00                             40               0C
         Binary      0011 1111 1111 1110 0000 1011         0100 0000        0000 1100 00
                                                                                           
                                                                          growing bits

By using this method, P1 will be able to expand the number of customers, and the customers will be able
to modify their first assumptions about the size of their own customers, until the reserved bits are
assigned.

Predicting future network requirements will always be a challenge with ever changing business needs and
unforeseen technological advances. Nonetheless, a strategy to account for organizational needs, possible
growth areas, and consideration to address assignment will provide as much downstream flexibility as
possible.

     3.2.2   Obtaining Globally Routable IPv6 Address Space

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)13 and IANA14 have delegated most
IPv6 address allocation to five Regional Internet Registries (RIR):

          Africa and the Indian Ocean (AfriNIC), http://www.afrinic.net/ or
           http://www.afrinic.net/registrationServices.htm

          Australia, Oceania, and most of Asia (APNIC), http://www.apnic.net/ or
           http://www.apnic.net/policy/ipv6-address-policy

          Europe, parts of Asia, and the Middle East (RIPE NCC), http://www.ripe.net/ or
           http://www.ripe.net/rs/index.html
