servers (called domain controllers) supporting file, print, and messaging services should also serve as the
ASs in the WLAN solution. This proposal suggested the use of PEAP with MS-CHAPv2 as the inner
method. MS-CHAPv2 is a challenge-response method with characteristics similar to MD5-Challenge but
with better security.

Unlike the IT support staff, the project manager and information security officer emphasized security over
administrative convenience. They wanted authentication to involve a client PKI certificate. The agency
was planning to deploy an enterprise PKI in six weeks, which would involve certificates on all agency-
owned computers, including desktops, laptops, handheld devices, and servers. The WLAN project was an
excellent application for the new PKI and would quickly demonstrate its value. The decision was made to
integrate the WLAN with the PKI, which would cause a short project delay, but one that was believed
well worth the slip in the schedule. This approach led to the decision that EAP-TLS would be the best
choice. Fortunately, the existing domain controllers could also serve as the ASs for the WLAN in this
configuration, so the IT support staff accepted this element of the design.

Once the project team completed the design documentation, the next step was to procure equipment. The
results of the site survey demonstrated a need for 24 enterprise APs (three for each of the large conference
rooms, and 18 for the remaining conference rooms). Based on the selected design, no need existed for
additional WLAN client software, switches, or AS infrastructure beyond what was already in-house. The
agency sought APs that were WPA2-Enterprise certified and FIPS-validated for the AES encryption
module used in the CCMP data confidentiality and integrity protocol. The agency also wanted a means
for physically securing the reset button on the APs to help prevent tampering. The search resulted in two
candidates, until a member of the project team realized that one of the two products was FIPS-validated
for the IPsec AES implementation on its wired interface, but not for the CCMP implementation on its
wireless interface. This attention to detail was critical in identifying appropriate WLAN components.

A member of the team created a network design diagram to help guide the subsequent implementation
process. The result of that effort is presented in Figure 9-1.
