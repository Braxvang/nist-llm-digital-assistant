3.      IDPS Technologies

This section provides an overview of IDPS technologies. The information presented in this section
applies to all types of IDPS products; additional information specific to each product type is presented in
Sections 4 through 7. This section first covers the major components of IDPS technologies and explains
the architectures typically used for deploying the components. It also provides a high-level description of
the security capabilities of the technologies, including the methodologies they use to identify suspicious
activity. The rest of the section discusses the management capabilities of the technologies, including
detailed recommendations for implementation and operation.

3.1     Components and Architecture

This section describes the major components of IDPS solutions and illustrates the most common network
architectures for these components.

3.1.1     Typical Components

The typical components in an IDPS solution are as follows:

 Sensor or Agent. Sensors and agents monitor and analyze activity. The term sensor is typically used
  for IDPSs that monitor networks, including network-based, wireless, and network behavior analysis
  technologies. The term agent is typically used for host-based IDPS technologies.
 Management Server. A management server is a centralized device that receives information from
  the sensors or agents and manages them. 7 Some management servers perform analysis on the event
  information that the sensors or agents provide and can identify events that the individual sensors or
  agents cannot. Matching event information from multiple sensors or agents, such as finding events
  triggered by the same IP address, is known as correlation. Management servers are available as both
  appliance and software-only products. Some small IDPS deployments do not use any management
  servers, but most IDPS deployments do. In larger IDPS deployments, there are often multiple
  management servers, and in some cases there are two tiers of management servers.
 Database Server. A database server is a repository for event information recorded by sensors,
  agents, and/or management servers. Many IDPSs provide support for database servers.
 Console. A console is a program that provides an interface for the IDPS’s users and administrators.
  Console software is typically installed onto standard desktop or laptop computers. Some consoles are
  used for IDPS administration only, such as configuring sensors or agents and applying software
  updates, while other consoles are used strictly for monitoring and analysis. Some IDPS consoles
  provide both administration and monitoring capabilities.
3.1.2     Network Architectures

IDPS components can be connected to each other through an organization’s standard networks or through
a separate network strictly designed for security software management known as a management network.
If a management network is used, each sensor or agent host has an additional network interface known as
a management interface that connects to the management network. Also, each sensor or agent host is
unable to pass any traffic between its management interface and any of its other network interfaces. The

      Because this publication focuses on enterprise IDPS deployment, it assumes that management servers are used with sensors
      and agents. However, some types of IDPS sensors and agents can be deployed standalone, and managed and monitored
      directly by administrators without using a management server.
