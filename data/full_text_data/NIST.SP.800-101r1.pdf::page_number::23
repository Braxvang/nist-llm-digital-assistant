maintaining a permanent IP address.7 With the original IP protocol, each time a mobile device
moved to a new Internet point of attachment, all active network connections had to be restarted
and the device possibly needed to be rebooted. Mobile IP instead allows a mobile user to move
about transparently while continuing to use the same IP address (the user's "home address"),
avoiding these problems and enabling new mobile applications. Mobile IP was designed to
support seamless and continuous Internet connectivity. Mobile IP is most often found in
wireless environments where users need to carry their mobile devices across multiple Local
Area Network (LAN) subnets. Examples of use are in roaming between overlapping wireless
systems e.g., Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Worldwide Interoperability for
Microwave Access (WiMAX), IP over Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) and Broadband
Wireless Access (BWA).8

Individuals requiring communication services from remote locations (e.g., aviation, emergency
services, government, military, etc.) are often equipped with satellite phones. Satellite phones
are mobile devices that establish connectivity with satellites rather than cellular towers.
Typically, satellite phones require a direct line of sight to the satellite without obstruction of
objects (e.g., buildings, trees, etc.) impacting the signal strength and quality of the call.
Depending on the service, coverage may range from a specific area all the way to the entire
earth. For example, the Iridium satellite constellation is made up of 66 Low Earth Orbiting
(LEO) satellites with spares, providing worldwide voice and data communications.

Satellite phones communicate by sending radio signals to a satellite that transmits a signal back
down to earth where a station routes the call to the PSTN. In some cases, the satellite phone
