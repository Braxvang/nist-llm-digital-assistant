 Risk Management                      The program and supporting processes to manage
 [NIST SP 800-39]                     information security risk to organizational operations
 [CNSSI No. 4009, adapted]            (including mission, functions, image, reputation),
                                      organizational assets, individuals, other organizations,
                                      and the Nation, and includes: (i) establishing the context
                                      for risk-related activities; (ii) assessing risk; (iii)
                                      responding to risk once determined; and (iv) monitoring
                                      risk over time.
 Risk Mitigation                      Prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the
 [CNSSI No. 4009]                     appropriate risk-reducing controls/countermeasures
                                      recommended from the risk management process. A
                                      subset of Risk Response.
 Risk Model                           A key component of a risk assessment methodology (in
                                      addition to assessment approach and analysis approach)
                                      that defines key terms and assessable risk factors.
 Risk Monitoring                      Maintaining ongoing awareness of an organizationâ€™s risk
 [NIST SP 800-39]                     environment, risk management program, and associated
                                      activities to support risk decisions.
 Risk Response                        Accepting, avoiding, mitigating, sharing, or transferring
 [NIST SP 800-39]                     risk to organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions,
                                      image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals,
                                      other organizations, or the Nation. See Course of Action.
 Risk Response Measure                A specific action taken to respond to an identified risk.
 [NIST SP 800-39]
 Root Cause Analysis                  A principle-based, systems approach for the identification
                                      of underlying causes associated with a particular set of
                                      risks.
 Security Authorization               See Authorization (to operate).
 (to Operate)
 Security Categorization              The process of determining the security category for
                                      information or an information system. Security
                                      categorization methodologies are described in CNSSI
                                      No.1253 for national security systems and in FIPS 199
                                      for other than national security systems.
 Security Control Assessment          The testing and/or evaluation of the management,
 [NIST SP 800-39]                     operational, and technical security controls to determine
 [CNSSI No. 4009, Adapted]            the extent to which the controls are implemented
                                      correctly, operating as intended, and producing the
                                      desired outcome with respect to meeting the security
                                      requirements for an information system or organization.
 Security Control Assessor            The individual, group, or organization responsible for
                                      conducting a security control assessment.
