depend on the maximum aggregate sensitivity and criticality of the information and processes
associated with the system.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: The Recommended Integrity Impact Level
may range from low to high to national security information (outside the scope of this
guideline).

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for most
system development information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to system development information.
Functions and processes supported by most system development information are not time-
critical. That is, temporary disruption of access to system development information will
usually have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations (including mission functions
and public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
system development information is low.
C.3.5.2 Lifecycle/Change Management Information Type

Lifecycle/Change Management involves the processes that facilitate a smooth evolution,
composition, and workforce transition of the design and implementation of changes to agency
resources such as assets, methodologies, systems, or procedures. The recommended security
categorization for the lifecycle/change management information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of lifecycle/change
management information on the ability of responsible agencies to execute processes that
facilitate a smooth evolution, composition, and workforce transition of the design and
implementation of changes to agency resources such as assets, methodologies, systems, or
procedures.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some
lifecycle/change management information can provide adversaries with intelligence information
that may be useful in efforts to compromise the system. This can result in assignment of a
moderate impact level to such information. Additionally, there are legislative mandates
prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets. Trade secrets will generally be assigned a
moderate confidentiality impact level.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for lifecycle/change management information is low.
