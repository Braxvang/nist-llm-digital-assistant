 5.2.4    TLS usage within SIP

         RFC 3261 mandates the use of TLS for proxies, redirect servers, and registrars to
         protect SIP signaling. Using TLS for UAs is recommended. TLS is able to protect
         SIP signaling messages against loss of integrity, confidentiality and against
         replay. It provides integrated key-management with mutual authentication and
         secure key distribution. TLS is applicable hop-by-hop between UAs/proxies or
         between proxies. The drawback of TLS in SIP scenarios is the requirement of a
         reliable transport stack (TCP-based SIP signaling). TLS cannot be applied to
         UDP-based SIP signaling. Just as secure HTTP is specified with the “https:”,
         secure SIP is specified with a Universal Resource Indicator (URI) that begins with
         “sips:”.

 5.2.5    IPsec usage within SIP

         IPsec may also be used to provide security for SIP signaling at the network layer.
         This type of security is most suited to securing SIP hosts in a SIP VPN scenario
         (SIP user agents/proxies) or between administrative SIP domains. IPsec works
         for all UDP, TCP and SCTP based SIP signaling. IPsec may be used to provide
         authentication, integrity and confidentiality for the transmitted data and supports
         end-to-end as well as hop-by-hop scenarios. At this time there is no default cipher
         suite for IPsec defined in SIP. Note that RFC 3261 does not describe a
         framework for the use of IPsec and no requirement is given as to how the key
         management is to be realized, or which IPsec header and mode is to be used. One
         accepted protocol for key management is Internet Key Exchange (IKE), a hybrid
         protocol based on the Internet Security Association and Key Management
         Protocol (ISAKMP), the Oakley Key Determination Protocol (RFC 2412) and the
         Secure Key Exchange Mechanism for the Internet (SKEME). The IKE protocol
         provides automated cryptographic key exchange and management mechanisms
         for IPsec. IKE is used to negotiate security associations (SAs) for use with its own
         key management exchanges (called Phase 1) and for other services such as IPsec
         (called Phase 2). IKE is particularly used in the establishment of VPNs.


 5.2.6    Security Enhancements for SIP

         Currently within the IETF several drafts concerning security are being discussed,
         with a view toward providing a general security solution to SIP scenarios.
         Several drafts have been produced concerning authentication, integrity, and
         confidentiality for SIP. The following subsections provide a short overview of
         Internet drafts, which may be of interest for a discussion of security enhancements
         for common SIP scenarios. This list of Internet drafts is not complete, as this is a
         continually evolving area, but the most significant drafts are considered here.
