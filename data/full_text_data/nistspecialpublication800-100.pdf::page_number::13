CHAPTER 2                                                  Information Security Governance


      – Conduct and submit to OMB privacy impact assessments for all new IT
        investments administering information in identifiable form collected from or
        about members of the public.
   Supporting these acts, three legislative documents emerge as the foundational
sources for specific information security governance requirements:
    • The Federal Information Security Management (FISMA) Act is the primary
      legislation governing federal information security programs, building upon
      earlier legislation through added emphasis on the management dimension of
      information security.
      – FISMA delegates to the National Institute of Standards and Technology
        (NIST) the responsibility to develop detailed information security standards
        and guidance for federal information systems, with the exception of national
        security systems.
      – FISMA designates to OMB the oversight of federal agencies’ information
        security implementation.
      – FISMA provides a comprehensive framework for securing federal government
        IT resources, including defining key federal government and agency roles
        and responsibilities, requiring agencies to integrate information security into
        their capital planning and enterprise architecture processes, requiring
        agencies to conduct annual information security reviews of all programs and
        systems, and reporting the results of those reviews to OMB. 2
    • OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, Appendix
      III, Security of Federal Automated Information Resources, establishes a
      minimum set of controls to be included in federal automated information
      security programs, assigns federal agency responsibilities for the security of
      automated information, and links agency automated information security
      programs and agency management control systems. 3
    • Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), released in August
      2004, specifies a "policy for a common identification standard for all Federal
      employees and contractors." 4 HSPD-12 intends to increase identification
      security and interoperability by standardizing the process to issue a Federal
      employee or contractor an identification credential, and also by specifying the
      electronic and physical properties of the credential itself. The HSPD-12
      credential is known as the Personal Identity Verification card.
   Figure 2-1 illustrates key roles of legislative, regulatory, and oversight bodies in
establishing governance and information security governance requirements for the
federal enterprise.
