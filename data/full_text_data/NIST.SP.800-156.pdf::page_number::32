NIST SP 800-156                                              REPRESENTATION OF PIV CHAIN-OF-TRUST
                                                                           FOR IMPORT AND EXPORT


4     Chain-of-trust Record Encryption in Transit

The confidentiality of the chain-of-trust record is to be protected at all times by both the
producing and consuming organizations. In addition to encrypting the chain-of-trust
record in accordance with XML encryption, as documented in Section 3.3 for
PIVChainOfTrustType, the chain-of-trust records should be encrypted in transit between
the chain-of-trust producer and the chain-of-trust consumer. Some example mechanisms
for chain-of-trust transmission include but are not limited to: FTPS, HTTPS secured web
services, and out of band mechanisms such as S/MIME secure email. The encryption
used shall be compliant with the [FIPS140] standard.
