       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                                                         Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

1282        2. The RBG1 components shall be successfully validated for compliance with [SP800-90A],
1283           SP 800-90C, [FIPS140], and the specification of any other approved algorithm used within
1284           the RBG1 construction, as applicable.
1285        3. The RBG1 construction shall not produce any output until it is instantiated.
1286        4. The RBG1 construction shall not include a reseed capability.
1287        5. The RBG1 construction shall not permit itself to be instantiated more than once. 17
1288        6. For a Hash_DRBG, HMAC_DRBG or CTR_DRBG (with a derivation function), 3s/2 bits
1289           shall be obtained from a randomness source (see Requirements 13 - 17), where s is the
1290           targeted security strength for the DRBG used in the RBG1 construction.
1291        7. For a CTR_DRBG (without a derivation function), s + 128 bits 18 shall be obtained from
1292           the randomness source (see Requirements 13 - 17), where s is the targeted security strength
1293           for the DRBG used in the RBG1 construction.
1294        8. The internal state of the RBG1 construction shall be maintained 19 and updated to produce
1295           output on demand.
1296        9. The RBG1 construction shall not provide output for generating requests that specify a
1297           security strength greater than the instantiated security strength of its DRBG.
1298        10. If the RBG1 construction is used to instantiate a sub-DRBG, the RBG1 construction may
1299            directly produce output in addition to instantiating the sub-DRBG.
1300        11. If the seedlife of the DRBG within the RBG1 construction is ever exceeded or a health test
1301            of the DRBG fails, the use of the RBG1 construction shall be terminated.
1302        12. If a health test on the RBG1 construction fails, the RBG1 construction and all of its sub-
1303            DRBGs shall be terminated.
1304   The non-testable requirements for the RBG1 construction are listed below. If these requirements
1305   are not met, no assurance can be obtained about the security of the implementation.
1306        13. An approved RBG2(P) construction with support for prediction resistance requests or an
1307            RBG3 construction must be used as the randomness source for the DRBG in the RBG1
1308            construction.
1309        14. The randomness source must fulfill the requirements in Section 5 (for an RBG(P)
1310            construction) or Section 6 (for an RBG3 construction), as appropriate.
1311        15. The randomness source must provide the requested number of bits at a security strength of
1312            s bits or higher, where s is the targeted security strength for the RBG1 construction.
1313        16. The specific output of the randomness source (or portion thereof) that is used for the
1314            instantiation of an RBG1 construction must not be used for any other purpose, including
1315            for seeding a different instantiation.


       17
          While technically possible to reseed the DRBG, doing so outside of very controlled conditions (e.g., “in the field”) might result in seeds with less
       than the required amount of randomness.
       18
          Note that s + 128 = keylen + blocklen = seedlen, as specified in SP 800-90A.
       19
          This means ever-changing but maintained regardless of access to power for its entire lifetime.
