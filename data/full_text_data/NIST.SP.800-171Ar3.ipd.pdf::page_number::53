1619   3.5.12. Authenticator Management
1620             REQUIREMENT: 03.05.12

1621             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
1622             Determine if:
1623             A.03.05.12.ODP[01]: events that trigger the change or refreshment of authenticators are
1624             defined.
1625             A.03.05.12.a: the identity of the individual, group, role, service, or device receiving the
1626             authenticator as part of the initial authenticator distribution is verified.
1627             A.03.05.12.b: initial authenticator content for any authenticators issued by the organization is
1628             established.
1629             A.03.05.12.c[01]: administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution are established
1630             and implemented.
1631             A.03.05.12.c[02]: administrative procedures for lost, compromised, or damaged authenticators
1632             are established and implemented.
1633             A.03.05.12.c[03]: administrative procedures for revoking authenticators are established and
1634             implemented.
1635             A.03.05.12.d: default authenticators are changed at first use.
1636             A.03.05.12.e: authenticators are changed and refreshed periodically or when the following
1637             events occur: <A.03.05.12.ODP[01]: events>.
