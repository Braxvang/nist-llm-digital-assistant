Special Publication 800-79-2                              Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



                 tasks to be accomplished; (ii) the resources required to accomplish the tasks; (iii)
                 scheduled completion dates for the tasks, and (iv) the person designated as
                 responsible for completing each of the tasks.

                 Subtask 5.4: Assemble the authorization submission package and submit to the
                 DAO.
                 Responsibility: OIMO
                 Guidance: The OIMO is responsible for the assembly and compilation of the
                 authorization submission package with inputs from the OIMO. The authorization
                 submission package shall contain: (i) the final assessment report; (ii) the CAP;
                 (iii) the revised operations plan; and (iv) the [SP 800-37-1] authorization letters
                 for all information systems used by the issuer. The OIMO may wish to consult
                 other key organization participants (e.g., the Assessor, PO) prior to submitting the
                 authorization submission package to the DAO. The authorization submission
                 package can be submitted in either paper or electronic form. The contents of the
                 authorization submission package must be protected in accordance with
                 organization policy.

5.3 Authorization Phase

The Authorization Phase consists of two tasks— (i) making an appropriate authorization
decision; and (ii) completing the authorization documentation. Upon completion of this phase,
the OIMO will have— (i) an authorization to operate the issuer’s services as defined in its
operations plan; (ii) an interim authorization to operate under specific terms and conditions; or
(iii) a denial of authorization to operate.

        Task 6: Authorization Decision
The authorization decision task determines if the assessment phase has been satisfactorily
completed so that a recommendation concerning the operation of the issuer can be made with
assurance. The DAO, working with the Assessor, reviews the contents of the assessment
submission package, the identified and uncorrected or un-correctable deficiencies, the potential
impacts on each organization using the issuer’s services, and the CAP in determining the final
risk to the organization(s) and the acceptability of that risk in light of the organization’s mission.

                 Subtask 6.1: Review the authorization decision package to see if it is complete
                 and that all applicable issuer controls have been fully assessed using the
                 designated assessment procedures.
                 Responsibility: DAO
                 Guidance: Coverage for all issuer controls and proper adherence to assessment
                 procedures and appropriate assessment methods helps to create confidence in
                 assessment findings and is the main objective of the assessment review. Part of
                 the assessment review also includes understanding the impact of the identified
                 deficiencies on the organization’s operations, assets, and individuals.
                 Subtask 6.2: Determine if the risk to the organization’s operations, assets, or
                 potentially affected individuals is acceptable.
