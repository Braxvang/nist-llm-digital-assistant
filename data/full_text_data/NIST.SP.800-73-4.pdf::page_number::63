D.1     Terms

Algorithm Identifier     A PIV algorithm identifier is a one-byte identifier that specifies a
                         cryptographic algorithm and key size. For symmetric cryptographic
                         operations, the algorithm identifier also specifies a mode of operation (i.e.,
                         ECB).

Application Identifier   A globally unique identifier of a card application as defined in ISO/IEC
                         7816-4.

Application Session      The period of time within a card session between when a card application is
                         selected and a different card application is selected or the card session ends.

Authenticable Entity     An entity that can successfully participate in an authentication protocol with
                         a card application.

BER-TLV Data Object A data object coded according to ISO/IEC 8825-2.

Card                     An integrated circuit card.

Card Application         A set of data objects and card commands that can be selected using an
                         application identifier.

Client Application       A program running on a computer in communication with a card interface
                         device.

Card Management          Any operation involving the PIV Card Application Administrator.
Operation

Card Verifiable          A certificate stored on the card that includes a public key, the signature of a
Certificate              certification authority, and further information needed to verify the
                         certificate.

Data Object              An item of information seen at the card command interface for which is
                         specified a name, a description of logical content, a format, and a coding.

Key Reference            A key reference is a one-byte identifier that specifies a cryptographic key
                         according to its PIV Key Type. The identifier is part of the cryptographic
                         material used in a cryptographic protocol, such as an authentication or a
                         signing protocol.

MSCUID                   An optional legacy identifier included for compatibility with Common
                         Access Card and Government Smart Card Interoperability Specifications.

Object Identifier        A globally unique identifier of a data object as defined in ISO/IEC 8824-2.
