                                                                   GUIDELINES ON FIREWALLS AND FIREWALL POLICY


    –   Are load balancing and failover functionally required to ensure high availability?

    –   Is hardware-based vs. software-based firewall preference a consideration?
 Integration

    –   Will the firewall require specific hardware to properly integrate within the organization’s network
        infrastructure (specific power capabilities, specific type of network interface card [NIC], specific
        backup device, etc.)?

    –   Does the firewall need to be compatible with other devices on the network that provide security
        or other services?

    –   Does the firewall’s logging interoperate with existing log management systems?

    –   Will installing a firewall require changes to other areas of the network?
 Physical Environment (generally a consideration for network firewalls, although it may also apply to
  the centralized components of host-based firewall implementations)

    –   Where will the firewall be physically located to ensure physical security and protection from
        disasters?

    –   Is there adequate shelf or rack space at the physical location where the firewall will be placed?

    –   Will additional power, backup power, air conditioning, and/or network connections be required at
        the physical location?
 Personnel

    –   Who will be responsible for managing the firewall?

    –   Will system administrators require training before the firewall is deployed?
 Future Needs

    –   Will the firewall meet the future needs of the organization (plans to move to IPv6, anticipated
        bandwidth requirements, compliance with regulations expected to be implemented, etc.)?
Other items to consider when purchasing and implementing host-based and personal firewalls include:

 Do workstations or servers meet the minimum system requirements of the firewall being evaluated?
 Will the firewall be compatible with other security software on the workstation or server (e.g.,
  antimalware software)?
 Can the firewall be centrally managed and allow policies that enforce the organization’s security
  policy to be pushed to clients?
 Can the firewall report policy violations to a central server?
 Can the firewall be locked down to prevent anyone but administrators from modifying its settings?
 Will the firewall conflict with host-based or personal firewalls built in to the hosts’ operating
  systems? If so, how easily can these conflicts be resolved?
