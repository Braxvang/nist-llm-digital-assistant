                                                               GUIDELINES ON ACTIVE CONTENT AND MOBILE CODE



Visual Basic Script (VBScript) is a programming language developed by Microsoft for creating scripts
that can be embedded in Web pages for viewing with the Internet Explorer browser. Alternative browsers
do not support VBScript. Like JavaScript, VBScript is an interpreted language able to process client-side
scripts. VBScript is a subset of the widely used Microsoft Visual Basic programming language and
works with Microsoft ActiveX controls. The language is similar to JavaScript and poses similar risks.

In theory, confining a scripting language to the boundaries of a Web browser should provide a relatively
secure environment. In practice, this has not been the case. Many browser-based attacks stem from the
use of a scripting language in combination with a security vulnerability. The main sources of problems
have been twofold: the prevalence of implementation flaws in the execution environment and the close
binding of the browser to related functionality such as an email client. Past exploits include sending a
user's URL history list to a remote site, and using the mail address of the user to forge email. The
increasing use of client scripting technologies at Web sites has opened new avenues for exploits.

JavaScript is one of the main components of AJAX, a collection of technologies that allows Web
developers to improve the user interaction and response times for rendering Web content [OAA07]. A
second key component is a new browser API that enables JavaScript and other downloaded active content
to issue requests to a Web server to convey XML or other well-formatted data. With this API, JavaScript
code can communicate with a Web server whenever needed and modify the contents of the Web
browserâ€™s page selectively as responses are received, instead of waiting for the Web server to respond
with an entire page of markup for each request issued. Since only the required data needs to be
transmitted, the total amount exchanged with the Web server is reduced. AJAX allows Web content to
behave more like traditional applications, but with increased complexity, which also increases the attack
surface of a Web application. Security concerns raised about AJAX include the following [SPI06]:

 AJAX increases the number of points where a client interacts with the application.
 AJAX may reveal details of internal functions within the Web application.
 Some AJAX endpoints may not require authentication, relying instead on the current state of the
  application.
While AJAX is more of a perspective on the architecture of web applications that employ certain
technologies, numerous AJAX frameworks also exist that provide developers with JavaScript functions to
send requests and process them at the server. A framework usually includes an AJAX engine that is
downloaded to the browser to render the user interface and communicate with the server. Selecting a
suitable AJAX framework requires ensuring that the security requirements of the application can be
satisfied through the architecture provided.

4.1.5   ActiveX

ActiveX is a set of technologies from Microsoft that provides tools for linking desktop applications to the
Web. ActiveX controls are reusable component program objects that can be attached to email or
downloaded from a Web site. Many ActiveX controls come preinstalled on Windows OSs. Web pages
invoke ActiveX controls using a scripting language or via a HTML OBJECT tag. It is possible to specify
a URL where the control may be obtained if it is not installed locally. Unlike Java, which is a platform-
independent programming language, ActiveX controls are distributed as executable binaries tailored for a
Windows operating environment. Web users normally encounter ActiveX technology in one of the
following forms:

 ActiveX controls, formerly known as Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) controls, are
  components (or objects) of prepackaged functionality that can be inserted into a Web page or other
