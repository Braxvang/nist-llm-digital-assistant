Special Publication 800-79-2                              Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



                 ensures that functions performed and processes managed by the external service
                 provider are considered during the authorization process. An organization may
                 want to include only those issuing facilities that are ready to operate; other
                 facilities can be assessed at a later date.

                 Subtask 2.3: Determine the resources and the time needed for the assessment of
                 the issuer, and prepare a plan for execution of the assessment.
                 Responsibility: OIMO; DAO
                 Guidance: The level of effort required for an assessment depends on numerous
                 factors— (i) the size of the issuer; (ii) the location and number of its facilities;
                 (iii) the level of outsourcing utilized by the issuer; and (iv) the number of cards
                 and/or derived credentials being, or to be issued. By examining factors that could
                 influence the complexity of the assessment, the organization can make informed
                 judgments about the size of the assessment team, the resources needed to support
                 the assessment, and the time-frame for completing it.

        Task 3: Operations Plan Analysis and Acceptance
The objectives of the operations plan analysis and acceptance task are: (i) determine if the
requirements of FIPS 201-2 have been implemented; (ii) evaluate the operations plan and revise
as needed; and (iii) obtain acceptance of the plan by the DAO prior to conducting an assessment
of the issuer controls.

                 Subtask 3.1: Review the list of required issuer controls documented in the
                 organization’s operation plan and then confirm that they have been implemented
                 properly.
                 Responsibility: DAO; OIMO
                 Guidance: Since the issuer controls serve as the basis for the assessment, review
                 the operations plan and supporting documentation to identify the controls that
                 must be implemented before investing time in assessment activities such as
                 interviews or testing. The operations plan must document each issuer control,
                 whether it is organization or facility specific, the owner of the issuer control, and
                 how the control is implemented.

                 Subtask 3.2: Analyze the operations plan to determine if there are deficiencies
                 in satisfying all the policies, procedures, and other requirements in FIPS 201-2
                 that could result in a Denial of Authorization to Operate (DATO) being issued.
                 After discussing the discovered deficiencies in the documentation and operations
                 plan with the OIMO, the organization may still want to continue with the
                 assessment, if it has determined that it can address all deficiencies within the time
                 period of the current assessment. In this situation, the DAO can either authorize
                 continuation of the assessment or terminate the assessment effort depending upon
                 the evaluation of the issuer’s ability to address the deficiencies.
                 Responsibility: DAO, OIMO
                 Guidance: The operations plan should adequately specify the policies,
                 procedures, and processes of the issuer so that, subsequent to an initial review,
                                                   34
