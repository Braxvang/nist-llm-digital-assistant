                                                                                         GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



4.3.4.5 Management

The organization should design a management policy to determine who will manage the SSL VPN device
and by what means. Some devices offer a partitioned or delegated management feature that allows
different aspects of the device to be managed by different groups or individuals. For example, a group
that manages IT for the sales department can control access control and endpoint security policies for
sales resources only. System administrators can manage endpoint security regarding the type and number
of patches that each client machine must have installed.

If multiple interfaces on the SSL VPN device are used, the management policy should also specify which
interface permits administrative access. Some devices provide flexibility in selectively enabling
administrative access on each interface, as well as permitting this access only from specific IP addresses.
Various forms of authentication for administrative access may also be supported, such as smart cards and
two-factor authentication. If the organization is using multiple interfaces, administrative access is
commonly only configured on the interface connected to the internal network for security reasons
(although allowing management from the external interface over an SSL-protected tunnel is also
considered secure). If administrative access is permitted on the external interface, a stronger form of
authentication than username and password should be used.

The management policy should also discuss the means of backing up and restoring the device
configuration. The specific procedures will vary by device but will include a means of transferring the
configuration to another computer for archiving, and of retrieving this configuration. Some devices also
support the ability to create a complete image of the operating system and configuration. This feature is
useful for restoring every aspect of the device’s functionality at a specific point in time.

4.3.4.6 Client Software Selection

Although SSL VPNs are described as clientless, some forms of SSL VPN access such as network
extension require dynamically downloaded agents to be run on the host. Even before login, the client
machine may have to execute a dynamically downloaded agent that performs host integrity checks. The
organization will have to ensure that these agents can run on client machines if the agents are required by
access control and endpoint security policies. Once logged in, users can use common Web browsers to
use the SSL VPN via proxy, but network extension requires particular browsers or versions of those
browsers because they require other downloadable agents that establish the virtual network connection. If
some systems such as public kiosks cannot download and execute these dynamically downloadable
agents, then the organization will have to make a decision about the level of access to offer to these
machines. Many SSL portal VPNs will work from all common Web browsers, but many SSL tunnel
VPNs require particular browsers, and particular versions of those browsers.

4.3.4.7 Portal Design

The organization should provide a portal for users so they can login to the SSL VPN and gain access to
internal resources. The portal can either be supplied by the SSL VPN device vendor or developed by the
organization itself. If the organization chooses to use the portal supplied by the SSL VPN device vendor,
it can customize it to match the appearance of the organization’s intranet.

Portal customization features vary widely by device, but the organization should be able to alter graphics,
colors, and possibly icons and the layout of the portal. The functionality of the portal will depend on the
type of access to the SSL VPN. For example, resources that rely on proxying and application translation
will require some sort of icon or hyperlink in the portal so users can access them. Access via network
extension also requires a hyperlink or icon on the portal to initiate the network extension process. Once
