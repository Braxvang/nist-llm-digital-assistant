                                                                                        SECTION 4: RFID RISKS



There are privacy risks from the perspective of the individual and from the perspective of the organization
implementing RFID technology. The privacy risk from the perspective of the individual is the
unauthorized revelation of personal information and the personal consequences of that breach. The
privacy risk from the perspective of the implementing organization might include:

 Penalties if the organization does not comply with privacy laws and regulations,
 Customer avoidance or boycott of the organization because of real or perceived privacy concerns
  about RFID technology,
 Being held legally liable for any consequences of the weak privacy protections, and
 Employees, shareholders and other stakeholders might disassociate with the organization due to
  concerns about corporate social responsibility.
Business objectives often conflict with privacy objectives. Organizations can benefit from the analysis
and sharing of personal information obtained with RFID technology. At the same time, these activities
may potentially violate the privacy rights or expectations of citizens and consumers. Similarly, methods
to protect personal privacy may pose a business process risk. For example, consumers may want tags to
be disabled at point-of-sale so that they cannot be used for tracking purposes afterwards. However, if it is
easy to disable a tag at point-of-sale, then it may also be easier for adversaries to disable tags prior to
point-of-sale, thereby disrupting the business process. Moreover, organizations may want to use tags
after point-of-sale for post-sale support, recalls, and other purposes.

Privacy risk may increase when an individual possesses tags from multiple organizations because
someone reading the tags can now combine and correlate information to profile individuals in ways that
none of the organizations alone might have anticipated. For example, if a consumer purchases a tagged
item and the tag is not disabled or removed, then the seller or someone else could subsequently use the tag
to reveal the presence of that person at a another location and time. The consumer may have purchased
the item with cash, presuming to remain anonymous in the transaction. However, if she also carries
another tag that reveals her identity, such as an RFID-enabled identification card, then someone may be
able to surreptitiously read both tags to establish an association between the purchased item and her
identity that had not previously existed. As people possess more tagged items and readers become more
prevalent in everyday life, the potential for more complex associations and inferences increases.

Other factors that impact the level of privacy risk include:

 Whether personal information is stored on tags,
 Whether the tagged items are considered personal (e.g., pharmaceuticals or devices that would reveal
  a medical condition, or a book that might reveal a political or religious affiliation),
 The likelihood that the tag will be in the proximity of compatible readers,
 The length of time records are retained in analytic or archival systems, and
 The effectiveness of RFID security controls, in particular:

        –    The efficacy of tag memory access control and authentication mechanisms,

        –    The ability of tags to be disabled after their use in a business process has been completed,
             and

        –    The ability of users to effectively shield tags to prevent unauthorized read transactions.
