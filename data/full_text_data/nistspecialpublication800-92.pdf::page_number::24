GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



cause a loss of log data availability. To meet data retention requirements, organizations might need to
keep copies of log files for a longer period of time than the original log sources can support, which
necessitates establishing log archival processes. Because of the volume of logs, it might be appropriate in
some cases to reduce the logs by filtering out log entries that do not need to be archived. The
confidentiality and integrity of the archived logs also need to be protected.

2.3.3     Log Analysis

Within most organizations, network and system administrators have traditionally been responsible for
performing log analysis—studying log entries to identify events of interest. It has often been treated as a
low-priority task by administrators and management because other duties of administrators, such as
handling operational problems and resolving security vulnerabilities, necessitate rapid responses.
Administrators who are responsible for performing log analysis often receive no training on doing it
efficiently and effectively, particularly on prioritization. Also, administrators often do not receive tools
that are effective at automating much of the analysis process, such as scripts and security software tools
(e.g., host-based intrusion detection products, security information and event management software).
Many of these tools are particularly helpful in finding patterns that humans cannot easily see, such as
correlating entries from multiple logs that relate to the same event. Another problem is that many
administrators consider log analysis to be boring and to provide little benefit for the amount of time
required. Log analysis is often treated as reactive—something to be done after a problem has been
identified through other means—rather than proactive, to identify ongoing activity and look for signs of
impending problems. Traditionally, most logs have not been analyzed in a real-time or near-real-time
manner. Without sound processes for analyzing logs, the value of the logs is significantly reduced.

2.4     Meeting the Challenges

Despite the many challenges an organization faces in log management, there are a few key practices an
organization can follow to avoid and even solve many of these obstacles it confronts. The following four
measures give a brief explanation of these solutions:

       Prioritize log management appropriately throughout the organization. An organization
        should define its requirements and goals for performing logging and monitoring logs to include
        applicable laws, regulations, and existing organizational policies. The organization can then
        prioritize its goals based on balancing the organization’s reduction of risk with the time and
        resources needed to perform log management functions.
       Establish policies and procedures for log management. Policies and procedures are beneficial
        because they ensure a consistent approach throughout the organization as well as ensuring that
        laws and regulatory requirements are being met. Periodic audits are one way to confirm that
        logging standards and guidelines are being followed throughout the organization. Testing and
        validation can further ensure that the policies and procedures in the log management process are
        being performed properly.
       Create and maintain a secure log management infrastructure. It is very helpful for an
        organization to create components of a log management infrastructure and determine how these
        components interact. This aids in preserving the integrity of log data from accidental or
        intentional modification or deletion, and also in maintaining the confidentiality of log data. It is
        also critical to create an infrastructure robust enough to handle not only expected volumes of log
        data, but also peak volumes during extreme situations (e.g., widespread malware incident,
        penetration testing, vulnerability scans).
