8.      Case Studies

This section presents two hypothetical case studies to illustrate how RFID security might be implemented
in practice. Although the case studies are fictional, they are intended to resemble real-world activities,
including how decision makers address common and expected RFID security problems and their
solutions. The case studies do not cover all of the aspects of RFID system engineering or operations that
an organization may encounter in its RFID implementation, but rather a representative sample of salient
issues. The two case studies are as follows:

 Case Study #1: Personnel and asset tracking in a health care environment, and
 Case Study #2: Supply chain management of hazardous materials.
In each case study, the fictional organization followed the information system development life cycle
introduced in NIST Special Publication 800-64, Security Considerations in the Information System
Development Life Cycle, and the practices discussed in Section 7.

8.1     Case Study #1: Personnel and Asset Tracking in a Health Care Environment

The Contagion Research Center (CRC) is a health care facility dedicated to the study of highly contagious
diseases—those transmitted through casual human contact. The Center has 40 beds for patient care, a
radiology unit with two rooms of sophisticated imaging equipment, and four laboratories with various
diagnostic and research capabilities. The Center confronts the same management issues as many
hospitals, including locating portable diagnostic equipment when needed and accounting for missing
assets. Another important concern is the ability to quickly locate patients and staff as they move about
the facility. Poor asset management results in higher costs, reduced efficiency, and lower quality of care.

The mission of the CRC also leads to specialized requirements. To prevent unnecessary outbreaks of
disease and to understand how transmission occurs, CRC needs to track the interactions among its staff,
patients, and visitors. These tracked interactions provide useful information to researchers about who
came into contact with whom and at what time. Additionally, CRC must alert caregivers of disease-
specific protocols when they are in close proximity to particular patients, including prohibiting staff
contact in some cases. It must track blood, urine, and stool samples from patient to laboratory. Finally,
CRC would like to track the history of in-house diagnostic equipment and trace how the equipment is
used to support patients throughout each day. Currently, paper processes are used to achieve these
objectives, but they are very labor-intensive and error-prone, sometimes with fatal consequences.

CRC executives tasked the CRC’s Chief Information Officer (CIO) to use RFID technology to improve
the CRC’s traditional asset management function, as well as meet its specialized requirements. Working
with the CRC executives, the CIO commissioned a project to reengineer CRC business practices using
RFID technology as a primary tool to improve organizational performance.

8.1.1    Phase 1: Initiation

The first step in the project was to conduct a risk assessment to help shape the final scope of the project
and identify the most appropriate uses of the RFID technology, as well as potential controls to mitigate
the accompanying risk. Some risks identified during the assessment were as follows:

 RFID systems could open a “backdoor” to the CRC computer network, which could result in the
  compromise of mission-critical systems and research archives.
