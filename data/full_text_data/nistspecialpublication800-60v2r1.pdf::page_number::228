recognition (e.g., grants, development contract, patent rights, and copyrights) can have a serious
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. In such cases, the
confidentiality impact associated with space exploration and innovation is moderate.

In some cases, the space exploration and innovation information is classified or otherwise
qualifies as national security information. This information is outside the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most space exploration and innovation information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of most space exploration and
innovation information can be seriously disruptive to the progress of research activities. The
effects on future funding can be quite serious and can have a serious adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals. Unauthorized modification or destruction of
information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely
affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would
usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
space exploration and innovation information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to space exploration and innovation
information. Most research and innovation processes are tolerant of delay. In most cases,
disruption of access to research and innovation information will have only a limited adverse
effect on government operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
space exploration and innovation information is low.

D.20 Knowledge Creation and Management
Knowledge Creation and Management involves the programs and activities in which the Federal
Government creates or develops a body or set of knowledge, the manipulation and analysis of
which can provide inherent benefits for both the Federal and private sector.

D.20.1 Research and Development Information Type

Research and Development involves the gathering and analysis of data, dissemination of results,
and development of new products, methodologies, and ideas. The sensitivity and criticality of
most research and development information depends on the subject matter involved. The
