     quantum and classical computers and can interoperate with existing communications
     protocols and networks.
     The question of when a large-scale quantum computer will be built is a complicated one.
     In the past, it was less clear that large quantum computers were a physical possibility,
     but many scientists now believe it to be merely a significant engineering challenge.
     Some engineers even predict that within the next 20 or so years, sufficiently large
     quantum computers will be built to break essentially all public key schemes currently
     in use. Historically, it has taken decades to deploy modern public-key cryptography
     infrastructure, so efforts to prepare information security systems that are resistant to
     quantum computing must begin now.
     NIST is in the process of soliciting, evaluating, and standardizing the needed quantum-
     resistant public-key cryptographic algorithms. The intent is for new public-key
     cryptography standards to specify one or more additional unclassified, publicly disclosed
     digital signature, public-key encryption, and key-establishment algorithms that are
     available worldwide and capable of protecting sensitive government information well
     into the foreseeable future, including after the advent of quantum computers.
     In FY 2019, NIST announced the result of its work to winnow the group of potential
     algorithms to 26. NIST mathematicians and computer scientists consider these
     algorithms to be the strongest candidates submitted to the Post-Quantum Cryptography
     Standardization project. The list includes 17 second-round candidates for public-key
     encryption and key-establishment algorithms as well as nine second-round candidates
     for digital signatures. (The complete list is available at https://csrc.nist.gov/news/2019/
     pqc-standardization-process-2nd-round-candidates and is described in NISTIR
     8240, Status Report on the First Round of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography
     Standardization Process [16].) This accomplishment represents several years of
     intensive research and industry collaboration. For the next year, NIST will work with the
     cryptographic community to focus on analyzing the performance of these algorithms to
     understand how they will perform in the real world.
     For several years, NIST has solicited public comments on draft minimum acceptability
     requirements, submission requirements, and evaluation criteria for candidate algorithms.
     The comments received are posted along with a summary of the changes made as
     a result of these comments. In FY 2019, submissions and comments continued and
     were shared with the cryptographic community. Additionally, NIST has participated in
     outreach events such as 2019 Second PQC Standardization Conference at the University
     of California, Santa Barbara.
     NIST extends its appreciation to all submitters and those providing public comments
     during the post-quantum algorithm evaluation process.
