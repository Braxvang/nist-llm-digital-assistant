                                              TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



should define the term incident and provide guidelines for determining whether or not an incident has
occurred. The plan should identify specific primary and alternate points of contact for the assessors,
generally the assessment team leader and assistant team leader, and the organization’s security group.
Guidelines should be included that clearly state actions to be taken by both the assessors and the
organization’s security group upon determination that an incident has occurred. For example, if the
assessors discover an actual intruder or an intruder’s footprints within the network, should testing stop? If
so, when can testing recommence—and by whose authority? The assessment plan should provide clear-
cut instructions on what actions assessors should take in these situations.

Some assessments use ROE in addition to or instead of an assessment plan. The ROE contains the same
information in an assessment plan, and also addresses testing activities that are usually prohibited by the
organization. For example, some activities that are often performed during penetration testing, such as
issuing attacks to compromise systems, are usually prohibited by an organization’s policies. The ROE
provides authorization for the assessors to conduct such activities as part of the assessment process.
Appendix B provides a sample template for an ROE.

Each organization should determine when assessment plans and/or ROEs should be used. Organizations
should also consider developing central assessment plans, or ROE templates or partial drafts, and
requiring their use to promote consistency.

6.6   Legal Considerations

An evaluation of potential legal concerns for an assessment should be addressed before the assessment
begins. While the involvement of legal advisors is at the discretion of the organization, it is
recommended that they always be involved for intrusive tests such as penetration testing. If an
organization authorizes an external entity to conduct an assessment, the legal departments of each
organization may be involved. These departments may assist in reviewing the assessment plan and
providing indemnity or limitation of liability clauses into contracts that govern security assessments—
particularly for types of tests that are deemed intrusive. The legal department may also require external
entities to sign nondisclosure agreements that prohibit assessors from disclosing any sensitive,
proprietary, or otherwise restricted information to unapproved entities.

The legal department should also address any privacy concerns that the organization may have. Most
organizations have warning banners or signed user agreements that disclose their systems are monitored,
warning that individuals consent to monitoring by their use of the system. However, not all organizations
have these in place, and the legal department should address potential privacy violations before the
assessment begins. In addition, captured data may include sensitive data that does not belong to the
organization—or personal employee data, which may create privacy concerns. Assessors should be
aware of these risks and conduct packet captures that follow any requirements set forth by the legal
department. The legal department may also determine data handling requirements to ensure data
confidentiality (e.g., vulnerabilities).

6.7   Summary

Information security assessment is a complex activity because of organizational requirements, the number
and type of systems within an organization, the technical techniques to be used, and the logistics
associated with assessments. Security assessments can be simplified and associated risks reduced through
an established, repeatable planning process. Accurate and timely planning of a security assessment can
also ensure that all factors necessary for assessment success are taken into account.

The core activities involved in planning for an assessment include:
