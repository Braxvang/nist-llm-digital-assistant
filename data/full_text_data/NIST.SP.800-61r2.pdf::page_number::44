3.3.1    Choosing a Containment Strategy

Containment is important before an incident overwhelms resources or increases damage. Most incidents
require containment, so that is an important consideration early in the course of handling each incident.
Containment provides time for developing a tailored remediation strategy. An essential part of
containment is decision-making (e.g., shut down a system, disconnect it from a network, disable certain
functions). Such decisions are much easier to make if there are predetermined strategies and procedures
for containing the incident. Organizations should define acceptable risks in dealing with incidents and
develop strategies accordingly.

Containment strategies vary based on the type of incident. For example, the strategy for containing an
email-borne malware infection is quite different from that of a network-based DDoS attack. Organizations
should create separate containment strategies for each major incident type, with criteria documented
clearly to facilitate decision-making. Criteria for determining the appropriate strategy include:

 Potential damage to and theft of resources
 Need for evidence preservation
 Service availability (e.g., network connectivity, services provided to external parties)
 Time and resources needed to implement the strategy
 Effectiveness of the strategy (e.g., partial containment, full containment)
 Duration of the solution (e.g., emergency workaround to be removed in four hours, temporary
  workaround to be removed in two weeks, permanent solution).
In certain cases, some organizations redirect the attacker to a sandbox (a form of containment) so that
they can monitor the attacker’s activity, usually to gather additional evidence. The incident response team
should discuss this strategy with its legal department to determine if it is feasible. Ways of monitoring an
