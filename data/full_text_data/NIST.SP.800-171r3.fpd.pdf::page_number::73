2136             CUI. Service-level agreements define the expectations of performance, describe measurable
2137             outcomes, and identify remedies, mitigations, and response requirements for instances of
2138             noncompliance. Information from external service providers regarding the specific functions,
2139             ports, protocols, and services used in the provision of such services can be useful when there is
2140             a need to understand the trade-offs involved in restricting certain functions and services or
2141             blocking certain ports and protocols. This requirement is related to 03.01.20.

2145           Supply Chain Risk Management

2146   3.17.1. Supply Chain Risk Management Plan
2147             REQUIREMENT: 03.17.01
2148             a. Develop a plan for managing supply chain risks associated with the research, development,
2149                design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations, maintenance, and
2150                disposal of the system, system components, or system services.
2151             b. Review and update the supply chain risk management plan periodically.
2152             c.   Protect the supply chain risk management plan from unauthorized disclosure.

2153             DISCUSSION
2154             Dependence on the products, systems, and services from external providers and the nature of the
2155             relationships with those providers present an increasing level of risk to an organization. Threat
2156             actions that may increase security risks include unauthorized production; the insertion or use of
2157             counterfeits; tampering; theft; the insertion of malicious software, firmware, and hardware; and
2158             poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain. Supply chain risks can be
2159             endemic or systemic within a system, component, or service. Managing supply chain risks is a
2160             complex, multifaceted undertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to
2161             build trust relationships and communicate with internal and external stakeholders.
2162             Supply chain risk management (SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks,
2163             determining appropriate risk response actions, developing SCRM plans to document response
2164             actions, and monitoring performance against the plans. The system-level SCRM plan is
2165             implementation-specific and provides policy implementation, requirements, constraints, and
2166             implications. It can either be stand-alone or incorporated into system security plans. The SCRM
2167             plan addresses the management, implementation, and monitoring of SCRM controls and the
2168             development or sustainment of systems across the system development life cycle to support
2169             mission and business functions. Because supply chains can differ significantly across and within
2170             organizations, SCRM plans are tailored to individual program, organizational, and operational
2171             contexts.
