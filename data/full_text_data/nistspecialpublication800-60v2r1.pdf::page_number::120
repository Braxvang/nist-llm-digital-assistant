applications software, platforms, networks, servers, printers, etc.). [See also Appendices C.3.5.5,
IT Security Information and C.3.5.7, Information Management Information.] IT infrastructure
maintenance also includes information systems configuration and security policy enforcement
information. Unauthorized disclosure of some IT infrastructure maintenance information can
lead to confidentiality compromise of information processed by the system (e.g., password files,
file access tables, cryptographic keying information, network access rules, and hardware and
software configuration settings, and documentation that may affect access to the information
system’s data, programs, and/or processes). As a result, the confidentiality impact associated
with this information is that of the highest impact information processed by the system. Also, a
higher confidentiality impact may be associated with information in aggregate than is associated
with any single element of information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Particularly in the case of passwords and
cryptographic keys, the provisional impact level recommended for IT infrastructure maintenance
information depends on the sensitivity and criticality of system information and processes.
Although an individual organization’s IT infrastructure maintenance information type base may
include data elements that will require a higher rating, the recommended provisional impact is
low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of IT infrastructure maintenance
information usually depends on the urgency with which the data processed in the IT
infrastructure is needed or the time-critical nature of the data. In most cases, it is unlikely that the
information will be needed urgently or acted upon immediately. In most cases, the consequences
of unauthorized modification of IT infrastructure maintenance information will result in limited
damage to agency operations or assets.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Exceptions may include incorrect
information used for emergency response aspects of disaster management, criminal
apprehension, air traffic control or other time-critical missions. In such cases, a moderate or
high integrity impact level might be considered.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for IT
infrastructure maintenance information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to IT infrastructure maintenance
information. Functions and processes supported by most IT infrastructure maintenance
information are not time-critical. Also, disruption of access will have a limited adverse effect
on agency operations (including mission functions and public confidence in the agency),
agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Exceptions may include emergency
response aspects of disaster management or other high load and time critical functions (e.g.,
some systems that support air traffic control functions). The effects of disruption of access to
