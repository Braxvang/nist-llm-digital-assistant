                                                                      GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



8.3   Checklist for Implementing a Secure Network Infrastructure

       Completed                                                 Action
                   Identify network location
                   Web server is located in a DMZ, or Web server hosting is outsourced
                   Assess firewall configuration
                   Web server is protected by a firewall; if it faces a higher threat or is more vulnerable, it is
                   protected by an application layer firewall
                   Firewall controls all traffic between the Internet and the Web server
                   Firewall blocks all inbound traffic to the Web server except TCP ports 80 (HTTP) and/or 443
                   (HTTPS), if required
                   Firewall blocks (in conjunction with the IDPS) IP addresses or subnets that the IDPS reports
                   are attacking the organizational network
                   Firewall notifies the network or Web server administrator of suspicious activity through an
                   appropriate means
                   Firewall provides content filtering (application layer firewall)
                   Firewall is configured to protect against DoS attacks
                   Firewall detects malformed or known attack URL requests
                   Firewall logs critical events
                   Firewall and firewall OS are patched to latest or most secure level
                   Evaluate intrusion detection and prevention systems
                   Host-based IDPS is used for Web servers that operate primarily using SSL/TLS
                   IDPS is configured to monitor network traffic to and from the Web server after firewall
                   IDPS is configured to monitor changes to critical files on Web server (host-based IDPS or
                   file integrity checker)
                   IDPS blocks (in conjunction with the firewall) IP addresses or subnets that are attacking the
                   organizational network
                   IDPS notifies the IDPS administrators or Web server administrator of attacks through
                   appropriate means
                   IDPS is configured to maximize detection with an acceptable level of false positives
                   IDPS is configured to log events
                   IDPS is updated with new attack signatures frequently (e.g., on a daily basis)
                   Host-based IDPS is configured to monitor the system resources available in the Web server
                   host
                   Assess network switches
                   Switches are used to protect against network eavesdropping
                   Switches are configured in high-security mode to defeat ARP spoofing and ARP poisoning
                   attacks
                   Switches are configured to send all traffic on network segment to network-based IDPS
                   Evaluate load balancers
                   Load balancers are used to increase Web server availability
                   Load balancers are augmented by Web caches if applicable
                   Evaluate reverse proxies
                   Reverse proxies are used as a security gateway to increase Web server availability
                   Reverse proxies are augmented with encryption acceleration, user authentication, and
                   content filtering capabilities, if applicable
