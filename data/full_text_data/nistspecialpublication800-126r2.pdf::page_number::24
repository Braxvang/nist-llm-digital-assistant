                  The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2


                                           Table 11 – ds:extended-component

Element Name: ds:extended-component
Element        This element holds content that does not fit within the other defined component types described in
Definition     Table 10. Authors SHOULD use this element as an extension point to capture content that is not
               captured in a regular component. The content of this element SHALL be an XML element in a
               namespace other than the SCAP source data stream namespace. Linking through a <ds:extended-
               component> element SHALL make the data stream non-conformant with SCAP.

id             literal – ID          1          The identifier for the component. This identifier MUST be globally unique
                                                (see Section 3.1.3).
timestamp      literal – dateTime    1          Indicates when the <ds:extended-component> was created or last
                                                updated.


3.1.2    Source Data Stream Collection Validation
The SCAP source data stream collection SHALL validate against the XML schema representation for the
source data stream, as well as all Schematron rules embedded within that schema. The SCAP components
referenced by each <ds:component> and <ds:extended-component> element SHALL validate
against the corresponding component schema and its embedded Schematron rules. All of the SCAP-
related schemas are referenced at http://scap.nist.gov/revision/1.2/#schema. See Table 22 in Appendix C
for a list of SCAP component schema and Schematron file locations.
Each SCAP source data stream component SHALL use one of the elements specified in Table 12 as its
document element. Each SCAP source data stream component SHOULD NOT use any constructs that are
deprecated in its associated specification. While Section 4.1 requires that products support deprecated
constructs, these constructs should be avoided to minimize the impact to content use when these
constructs are removed from future revisions of the associated specifications. Any component in a data
stream collection SHALL be referenced not more than once by any data stream in that collection.

NIST provides an SCAP Content Validation Tool, which is designed to help validate the correctness of
SCAP data streams.12 The SCAP Content Validation Tool is a command-line tool that will check that
SCAP source and result content is well-formed, cross references are valid, and required values are
appropriately set. Errors and warnings are returned in both XML and Hypertext Markup Language
(HTML) formats. Validation of each SCAP source data stream component SHALL be done in accordance
with the portions of this document that define requirements for the associated component specification.
If applicable, each component MUST validate against its associated Schematron stylesheet. For the SCAP
source data stream collection, it MUST validate against the version of the SCAP Schematron rules as
specified on the <ds:data-stream-collection> element’s @schematron-version attribute,
and it SHOULD also validate against the latest Schematron rules. NIST provides and maintains a set of
