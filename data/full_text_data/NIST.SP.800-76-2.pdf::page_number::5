                                                        Executive Summary

Scope: Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12, Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees
and Contractors [HSPD-12], called for new standards to be adopted governing interoperable use of identity credentials
to allow physical and logical access to Federal government locations and systems. The Personal Identity Verification
(PIV) standard for Federal Employees and Contractors, Federal Information Processing Standard 201, Personal Identity
Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors (FIPS 201), was developed to define procedures and
specifications for issuance and use of an interoperable identity credential. This document, Special Publication 800-76
(SP 800-76), is a companion document to FIPS 201. It describes technical acquisition and formatting specifications for
                                        1
the PIV system, including the PIV Card itself. It also establishes minimum accuracy specifications for deployed
biometric authentication processes.
Approach: The approach is to enumerate procedures and formats for collection and preparation of fingerprint, iris
and facial data, and to restrict values and practices included generically in published biometric standards. The primary
design objective behind these particular specifications is to enable high performance and universal interoperability.
The introduction of iris and face specifications into the current edition adds additional modalities for biometric
authentication and extends coverage to persons for whom fingerprinting is problematic. The addition of on-card
biometric comparison offers an alternative to PIN-mediated card activation as well as an additional authentication
method. For the preparation of biometric data suitable for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) background
check, SP 800-76 references the ANSI/NIST Fingerprint Standard [AN2011] and the FBI's Electronic Biometric
Transmission Specification [EBTS].

Domain of use: Recognizing that PIV specifications are sometimes leveraged in other identity management
applications, it should be noted that derivative programs should adopt these PIV-specifications with appropriate
deliberative technical augmentation. The biometric data elements contained in this standard are suitable for one-to-
one verification of document holders when other application-specific factors are maintained. But, for example, if the
fingerprint templates mandated here are used in conjunction with fingerprints captured on non-PIV compliant
fingerprint sensors, there may be systematic degradations in recognition accuracy. Similarly, while it would be
                                                                                                          2
appropriate to take the compressed iris specification defined here for use on a nation state's e-Passports , it would be
technically suboptimal to then copy those iris images to be the enrollment samples of an expedited traveler program
running in one-to-many single-factor mode (i.e., the mode of [NEXUS,UKIRIS]).

Biometric data used outside the PIV Data Model is not within the scope of this standard.




1
    A physical artifact (e.g., identity card, “smart” card) issued to an individual that contains a PIV Card Application which stores
    identity credentials (e.g., photograph, cryptographic keys, digitized fingerprint representations) so that the claimed identity of
    the cardholder can be verified against the stored credentials by another person (human readable and verifiable) or an automated
    process (computer readable and verifiable).
