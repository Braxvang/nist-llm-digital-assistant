SP 800-89                                                                    November 2006



            e. The TTP shall compare the value(s) of the regenerated key(s) with the
               key(s) currently held by the owner.
            f. If the regenerated and currently-held keys match:
               •   The TTP shall determine a trusted value for t2 (see Sections 6.2 and
                   6.3.1.2).
               •   Provided that t1 ≤ t2 ≤ t1+d, the TTP shall assign the assurance_time
                   and the initial assurance level (see Sections 6.3.2.1 and 6.3.2.2).
                   The TTP must know t1 and t2; the TTP must also be aware of the
                   method(s) used to determine their values.
               •   The TTP shall record the assurance_time, the initial assurance level,
                   and the value of d. These values should also be provided to the owner.

The TTP shall provide both the recorded assurance_time and the initial assurance level
associated with the assurance of private key possession provided by the owner in
response to a request by any relying party. In addition, the TTP may provide an
assessment of its level of assurance that the owner is/was in possession of the private key
at the time of the request for information (or any other time; see Sections 6.2 and 6.4).

Note that the values of a, b, c and d that are selected by the TTP may be different than the
values deemed acceptable by other parties seeking assurance from the TTP. If this is the
case, the third party should be prepared to (at least) provide an upper bound on the value
of t2 – t1 (e.g., d) to potential relying parties – as well as a description of the time sources
used – so that those parties can decide whether or not a TTP-provided assurance_time
has sufficient accuracy (and trustworthiness) to meet their needs.

6.5.3 Assurance Obtained by a Verifier
Assurance that the (claimed) signatory was in possession of the private key at the time
the signature was generated shall be obtained by the verifier prior to accepting a verified
digital signature as valid.
The initial assurance of a (claimed) signatory’s possession of the private key shall be
obtained by the verifier through interaction with either the (claimed) signatory or a TTP.
However, once the necessary actions have been taken, the assurance_time and the initial
assurance level obtained may be used as the basis for obtaining assurance of private key
possession by the same (claimed) signatory at other times (see Sections 6.2 and 6.4).
A verifier shall obtain assurance that a (claimed) signatory possesses the correct private
key using one or more of the following methods:
   1. Assurance obtained by verifying an assurance signature obtained by interaction
      with the (claimed) signatory.
            a. Determine the appropriate value of d. For example, d may be selected in
               accordance with the assurance of possession model described in Section
               6.2, along with appropriate values of a, b and c.
