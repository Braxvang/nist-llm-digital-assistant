NIST SP 800-156                                                 REPRESENTATION OF PIV CHAIN-OF-TRUST
                                                                              FOR IMPORT AND EXPORT


2         Chain-of-Trust Data Requirements and Namespaces

[FIPS201] recommends that the following data be included in the chain-of-trust:

          A log of activities that documents who took the action, what action was taken,
           when and where the action took place, and what identification data was collected.

          An enrollment data record that contains the most recent collection of each of the
           biometric data collected. The enrollment data record describes the circumstances
           of biometric acquisition including the name and role of the acquiring agent, the
           office and organization, time, place, and acquisition method. The enrollment data
           record may also document unavailable biometric data or failed attempts to collect
           biometric data. The enrollment data record may contain historical biometric data.

          The most recent unique identifiers (i.e., Federal Agency Smart Credential Number
           (FASC-N) and Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)) issued to the individual’s
           card. The record may contain historical unique identifiers.

          Information about the authorizing entity who has approved the issuance of a
           credential.

          Current status of the background investigation, including the results of the
           investigation once completed.

          The evidence of authorization if the credential is issued under a pseudonym.

          Any data or any subsequent changes in the data about the cardholder. If the
           changed data is the cardholder’s name, then the issuer should include the evidence
           of a formal name change.

The following sections provide an XML schema representation of the baseline data
included in the chain-of-trust.

This schema has been authored to address the broadest envisioned range of chain-of-trust
data to be able to transfer PIV Card enrollment records across federal agencies and to a
service provider. Users of this XML schema may extend the schema as needed.
Extending the XML schema will allow the exchange of additional elements to meet
requirements for specialized exchange of chain-of-trust data. However, extending the
XML schema will also result in custom exchange that is less interoperable.

2.1       Namespaces Declaration for Chain-of-Trust Schema

XML namespace prefixes are used throughout this specification to stand for their
respective namespaces as follows:
