                                                                                             locally-stored backup or to a recovery image downloaded from another source. In either case,
                                                                                             these guidelines specify using an Authenticated Update Mechanism (Section 4.2.1.1) to verify
                                                                                             the integrity and authenticity of the image prior to recovery.

                                                                                                   1) Firmware recovery mechanisms shall resist attacks which corrupt the active critical data
                                                                                                      or the primary firmware image, or subverts their protection mechanisms.
                                                                                                      a) The RTRec, CTRec and authentic recovery firmware image should be protected
                                                                                                         independently of the running firmware.
                                                                                                   2) The RTRec or CTRec shall be capable of obtaining an authentic device firmware image.
                                                                                                      a) If the authentic firmware image is stored locally in non-volatile memory, the image
                                                                                                         shall be protected from unauthorized modification.
                                                                                                   3) Updates to a locally stored authentic firmware image shall be by way of an Authenticated

                                                                                                   4) Non-local recovery mechanisms shall use an Authenticated Update Mechanism (Section
                                                                                                      4.2.1.1) to verify the integrity and authenticity of recovery images prior to restoring them.
                                                                                                   5) If the authentic firmware image is stored remotely, the recovery policies shall be
                                                                                                      configurable with the location of this image.

                                                                                                      provide its RTRec or CTRec, then the host device’s RTRec or CTRec shall invoke the
                                                                                                      host/symbiont Authenticated Update Mechanism during recovery operations.
                                                                                                   7) The device shall either implement its own recovery capability, or that device (a symbiont
                                                                                                      device) and another platform device (a host device) shall together implement the
