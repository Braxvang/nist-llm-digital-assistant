       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                       Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

2191           The requested_security_strength may be any value that is less than or equal to 256 (the
2192           instantiated security strength recorded in the DRBG’s internal state).
2193           Since prediction resistance cannot be provided in an RBG1 construction,
2194           prediction_resistance_request is set to FALSE. (Note that the prediction_resistance
2195           request input parameter could be omitted from the Generate_function call for this
2196           example).
2197           Any additional input is optional.
2198   The Generate_function returns an indication of the status. If status = SUCCESS, the
2199   requested_number_of_bits are provided as the returned_bits to the consuming application. If
2200   status = FAILURE, returned_bits is an empty (i.e., null) bitstring.

2201   B.3.    Example Using Sub-DRBGs Based on an RBG1 Construction
2202   This example uses an RBG1 construction to instantiate two sub-DRBGs: sub-DRBG1 and sub-
2203   DRBG2 (see Figure 21).

2205                             Fig. 21. Sub-DRBGs Based on an RBG1 Construction

2206   The instantiation of the RBG1 construction is discussed in Appendix B.2. The RBG1 construction
2207   that is used as the source RBG includes an HMAC_DRBG and has been instantiated to provide a
2208   security strength of 256 bits. The state handle for the construction is RBG1_state_handle.
2209   For this example, Sub-DRBG1 will be instantiated to provide a security strength of 128 bits, and
2210   Sub-DRBG2 will be instantiated to provide a security strength of 256 bits. Both sub-DRBGs use
2211   the same DRBG algorithm as the RBG1 construction.
2212   Neither the RBG1 construction nor the sub-DRBGs can be reseeded or provide prediction
2213   resistance.
2214   This example provides the following capabilities:
2215       •   Access to the RBG1 construction to provide output generated at a security strength of 256
2216           bits (see Appendix B.2 for the RBG1 example)
2217       •   Access to one sub-DRBG (Sub-DRBG1) that provides output for an application that
2218           requires a security strength of no more than 128 bits
