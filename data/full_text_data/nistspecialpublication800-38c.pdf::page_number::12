5      Preliminaries

The selection of a block cipher algorithm and secret key are discussed in Section 5.1. The two
cryptographic primitives that CCM requires for its operation are discussed in Section 5.2. The
data elements of CCM are discussed in Section 5.3. The formatting of valid data elements is
discussed in Section 5.4. Examples of operations and functions are given in Section 5.5.

5.1      Underlying Block Cipher Algorithm

The CCM algorithm depends on the choice of an underlying symmetric key block cipher
algorithm. The CCM algorithm is thus a mode of operation (mode, for short) of the symmetric
key block cipher. The underlying block cipher algorithm shall be approved, and a secret key for
the block cipher algorithm shall be generated uniformly at random, or close to uniformly at
random, i.e., so that each possible key is (nearly) equally likely to be generated. Moreover, the
key should be established for the parties to the information by an approved key establishment
method. The key shall be kept secret and shall only be used for the CCM mode. The total
number of invocations of the block cipher algorithm during the lifetime of the key shall be
limited to 261. Key establishment and key management are outside the scope of this
Recommendation.

For any given key, the underlying block cipher algorithm of the mode consists of two functions
that are inverses of each other. As part of the choice of the block cipher algorithm, one of the two
