                                                          SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



guidelines cover secure configuration and operation of all name servers in all civilian agencies of the U.S.
Federal Government. The target audience consists of zone (and to some extent, system) administrators
who are responsible for the configuration and operation of these name servers. The guidelines are equally
applicable, however, to any enterprise-level zone (e.g., mit.edu).

The security mechanisms to which the guidelines in this document apply conform to IETF’s DNSSEC
and TSIG specifications. The guidelines in this document cover policies, configuration options, and
checklists for the following DNS components/associated operations):

    •   DNS hosting environment

        –   Host platform (O/S, file system, communication stack)

        –   DNS software (name server, resolver)

        –   DNS data (zone file, configuration file)

    •   DNS transactions

        –   DNS query/response

        –   Zone transfers

        –   Dynamic updates

        –   DNS NOTIFY

    •   Security administration

        –   Choice of algorithms and key sizes (TSIG and DNSSEC)

        –   Key management (generation, storage, and usage)

        –   Public key publishing and setting up trust anchors

        –   Key rollovers (scheduled and emergency).
