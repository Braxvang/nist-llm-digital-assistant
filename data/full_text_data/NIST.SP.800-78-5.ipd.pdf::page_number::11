      NIST SP 800-78-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                 Cryptographic Algorithms
      September 2023                                                                 and Key Sizes for PIV

232       Application of Cryptography in FIPS 201-3
233   FIPS 201-3 employs cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate cardholders, secure information
234   stored on the PIV Card, and secure the supporting infrastructure. FIPS 201-3 and its supporting
235   documents specify a suite of keys to be stored on the PIV Card for personal identity verification,
236   digital signature generation, and key management. The PIV cryptographic keys specified in FIPS
237   201-3 and NIST SP 800-73 are:
238       •   The asymmetric PIV Authentication key,
239       •   An asymmetric Card Authentication key,
240       •   A symmetric Card Authentication key (deprecated),
241       •   An asymmetric digital signature key for signing documents and messages,
242       •   An asymmetric key management key that supports key establishment or key transport and
243           up to 20 retired key management keys,
244       •   A symmetric PIV Card Application Administration Key, and
245       •   An asymmetric PIV Secure Messaging key that supports the establishment of session
246           keys for use with secure messaging and supporting cardholder authentication using the
247           SM-AUTH authentication mechanism.
248   The cryptographic algorithms, key sizes, and parameters that may be used for these keys are
249   specified in Section 3.1. PIV Cards must implement private key computations for one or more of
250   the algorithms identified in this section.
251   Cryptographically protected objects specified in FIPS 201-3, NIST SP 800-73, and NIST SP
252   800-76 include:
253       •   The X.509 certificates for each asymmetric key on the PIV Card, except for the PIV
254           Secure Messaging key;
255       •   A secure messaging card verifiable certificate (CVC) for the PIV Secure Messaging key;
256       •   An Intermediate CVC for the public key needed to verify the signature on the secure
257           messaging CVC;
258       •   A digitally signed Card Holder Unique Identifier (CHUID);
259       •   Digitally signed biometrics using the Common Biometric Exchange Formats Framework
260           (CBEFF) signature block; and
261       •   The NISTSP 800-73 Security Object
                                             , which is a digitally signed hash table.
262   The cryptographic algorithms, key sizes, and parameters that may be used to protect these
263   objects are specified in Section 3.2. Certification authorities (CA) and card management systems
264   that protect these objects must support one or more of the cryptographic algorithms, key sizes,
265   and parameters specified in Section 3.2.
