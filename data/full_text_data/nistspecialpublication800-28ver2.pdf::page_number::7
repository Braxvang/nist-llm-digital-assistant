                                                               GUIDELINES ON ACTIVE CONTENT AND MOBILE CODE



Executive Summary

The private and public sectors depend heavily upon information technology (IT) systems to perform
essential, mission-critical functions. As existing technology evolves and new technologies are introduced
to provide improved capabilities and advanced features in systems, new technology-related vulnerabilities
often arise. Organizations implementing and using advanced technologies must be increasingly on guard.
One such category of technologies is active content. Broadly speaking, active content refers to electronic
documents that can carry out or trigger actions automatically without an individual directly or knowingly
invoking the actions. Exploits based on vulnerabilities in active content technologies can be insidious.
The following key guidelines are recommended to organizations for dealing with active content.

Organizations should understand the concept of active content and how it affects the security of
their systems.

The use of products with capabilities for producing and handling active content contributes to the
functionality of a system as a whole and thus is an important factor in IT procurement and
implementation decisions. Active content technologies allow code, in the form of a script, macro, or
other kind of portable instruction representation, to execute when the document is rendered. Like any
technology, active content can be used to deliver essential services, but it can also become a source of
vulnerability for exploitation by an attacker.

Examples of active content are Portable Document Format (PDF) documents, Web pages containing Java
applets, JavaScript instructions, or ActiveX controls, word processor files containing macros, Flash and
Shockwave media files, spreadsheet formulas, and other interpretable content. Active content may also
be distributed embedded in email or as executable mail attachments.

Email and Web pages accessed through the Internet provide efficient ways to convey active content, but
they are not the only means. Active content technologies span a broad range of products and services and
involve various computational environments, including those of the desktop, workstation, server, and
gateway devices. The knowledge required to understand their security ramifications is extensive.
Organizations are encouraged to draw needed technical information from the many information resources
that exist and gain a sound understanding of the security implications of active content.

Organizations should develop policy regarding active content.

Information security in any organization is largely dependent on the quality of the security policy and the
processes that an organization imposes on itself, including policy awareness and enforcement. As
appropriate to their situation, organizations should develop policy for the procurement and use of
products involving active content technologies. Active content should only be applied where it
specifically benefits the quality of the services delivered and not simply for show or because of its
availability within products. Both the consumption and production of active content should be addressed
by the policy. A badly implemented, poorly planned, or nonexistent security policy can have a serious
negative security impact. The policy should be stated clearly and consistently, and made known and
enforced throughout the organization. Putting an organizational security policy on active content in place
is an important first step in applying effective safeguards and mitigating the risks involved.
