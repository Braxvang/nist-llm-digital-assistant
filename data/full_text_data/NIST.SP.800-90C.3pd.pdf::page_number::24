645               •   Using Method 1 in Section 2.3, the amount of entropy in the concatenated bitstring
646                   is ES_entropyA + ES_entropyB.
647               •   Using Method 2 in Section 2.3, the amount of entropy in the concatenated bitstring
648                   is the sum of the entropies in the bitstrings (i.e., ES_entropyA + ES_entropyB +
649                   ES_entropyC).
650       9. Under certain conditions, the output of one or more entropy sources can be externally
651          conditioned to provide full-entropy output. See Section 3.3.2 and Section 6.3.1 for the use
652          of this assumption and [NISTIR8427] for rationale.
653   Furthermore,
654       10. The amount of entropy in a subset bitstring that is “extracted” from the output block of an
655           approved hash function or block cipher is a proportion of the entropy in that block, such
656           that
                                                          𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠_𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙
657                        𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = �                     � 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜_𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏
                                                          𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜_𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙
658           where subset_len is the length of the subset bitstring, output_len is the length of the output
659           block, entropyoutput_block is the amount of entropy in the output block, and entropysubset is the
660           amount of entropy in the subset bitstring.
661       11. Full entropy bits can be extracted from the output block of a hash function or block cipher
662           when the amount of fresh entropy inserted into the algorithm exceeds the number of bits to
663           be extracted by at least 64 bits. For example, if output_len is the length of the output block,
664           all bits of the output block can be assumed to have full entropy if at least output_len + 64
665           bits of entropy are inserted into the algorithm. As another example, if a DRBG is reseeded
666           at its security strength s, (s − 64) bits with full entropy can be extracted from the DRBG’s
667           output block.
668       12. To instantiate a DRBG at a security strength of s bits, a bitstring of at least 3s/2 bits long
669           is needed from a randomness source for an RBG1 construction, and a bitstring with at least
670           3s/2 bits of entropy is needed from an entropy source for an RBG2 or RBG3 construction.
671       13. One or more of the constructions provided herein are used in the design of an RBG.
672       14. All components of an RBG2 and RBG3 construction (as specified in Sections 5 and 6)
673           reside within the physical boundary of a single [FIPS140]-validated cryptographic module.
674       15. The DRBGs specified in [SP800-90A] are assumed to meet their explicit security claims
675           (e.g., backtracking resistance, prediction resistance, claimed security strength, etc.).
676   The following assumptions and assertions have been made for the subordinate DRBGs (sub-
677   DRBGs) that are seeded (i.e., initialized) using an RBG1 construction:
678       16. A sub-DRBG is considered to be part of the RBG1 construction that initializes it.
679       17. The assumptions and assertions in items 3, 10, and 14 (above) apply to sub-DRBGs.

680           General Implementation and Use Requirements and Recommendations
681   When implementing the RBGs specified in this Recommendation, an implementation:

                                                            11
