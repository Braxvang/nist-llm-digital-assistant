Proxy: Software that receives a request from a client, then sends a request on the clientâ€™s behalf to the
desired destination.

Remote Access Server: Devices, such as virtual private network gateways and modem servers, that
facilitate connections between networks.

Reporting: The final phase of the computer and network forensic process, which involves reporting the
results of the analysis; this may include describing the actions used, explaining how tools and procedures
were selected, determining what other actions need to be performed (e.g., forensic examination of
additional data sources, securing identified vulnerabilities, improving existing security controls), and
providing recommendations for improvement to policies, guidelines, procedures, tools, and other aspects
of the forensic process. The formality of the reporting step varies greatly depending on the situation.

Security Event Management Software: Software that imports security event information from multiple
data sources, normalizes the data, and correlates events among the data sources.

Slack Space: The unused space in a file allocation block or memory page that may hold residual data.

Steganography: Embedding data within other data to conceal it.

Subdirectory: A directory contained within another directory.

Volatile Data: Data on a live system that is lost after a computer is powered down.

Wiping: Overwriting media or portions of media with random or constant values to hinder the collection
of data.
