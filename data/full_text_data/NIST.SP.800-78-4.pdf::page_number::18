7        Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Testing Requirements

As noted in Section 4.2.2 of [FIPS201], the PIV Card shall be validated under [FIPS140] with an
overall validation of Level 2 and with Level 3 physical security. The scope of the Cryptographic
Module Validation Program (CMVP) validation shall include all cryptographic operations
performed over both the contact and contactless interfaces. Table 7-1 describes the
Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP) tests that are required, at the time of
publication, for each supported key and algorithm. If any changes are made to the CAVP
validation requirements, the changes, along with the deadlines for conformance with these
requirements, will be posted on NIST’s “Personal Identity Verification Program (NPIVP)” web
page at http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/npivp/index.html. 7

Terms used in this section are from the the corresponding algorithm validation list
at http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/validation.html.

  Many cryptographic operations listed in Table 7-1 require the use of a random bit generator (those operations that
include a prerequisite of “DRBG or RNG”). Please refer to [SP800-131A] for more information about approved
random bit generators.
