Executive Summary

The World Wide Web (WWW) is a system for exchanging information over the Internet. At the most
basic level, the Web can be divided into two principal components: Web servers, which are applications
that make information available over the Internet (in essence, publish information), and Web browsers
(clients), which are used to access and display the information stored on the Web servers. This document
focuses on the security issues of Web servers. 1

Unfortunately, Web servers are often the most targeted and attacked hosts on organizations’ networks.
As a result, it is essential to secure Web servers and the network infrastructure that supports them. The
following are examples of specific security threats to Web servers:

 Malicious entities may exploit software bugs in the Web server, underlying operating system, or
  active content to gain unauthorized access to the Web server. Examples of this unauthorized access
  include gaining access to files or folders that were not meant to be publicly accessible (e.g., directory
  traversal attacks) and being able to execute commands and/or install software on the Web server.

 Denial of service (DoS) attacks may be directed to the Web server or its supporting network
  infrastructure, denying or hindering valid users from making use of its services.

 Sensitive information on the Web server may be read or modified without authorization.

 Sensitive information on backend databases that are used to support interactive elements of a Web
  application may be compromised through command injection attacks (e.g., Structured Query
  Language [SQL] injection, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) injection, cross-site
  scripting [XSS]).

 Sensitive information transmitted unencrypted between the Web server and the browser may be
  intercepted.

 Information on the Web server may be changed for malicious purposes. Web site defacement is a
  commonly reported example of this threat.

 Malicious entities may gain unauthorized access to resources elsewhere in the organization’s network
  via a successful attack on the Web server.

 Malicious entities may attack external entities after compromising a Web server host. These attacks
  can be launched directly (e.g., from the compromised host against an external server) or indirectly
  (e.g., placing malicious content on the compromised Web server that attempts to exploit
  vulnerabilities in the Web browsers of users visiting the site).

 The server may be used as a distribution point for attack tools, pornography, or illegally copied
  software.

Web servers may also face indirect attacks to gain information from their users. In these attacks, the user
is persuaded or automatically directed to visit a malicious Web site that appears to be legitimate. The
identifying information that is harvested may be used to access the Web site itself or form the basis for
