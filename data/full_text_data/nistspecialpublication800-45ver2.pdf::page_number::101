Appendix A—Glossary

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) – A protocol used to obtain a node’s physical address. A client
station broadcasts an ARP request onto the network with the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the target
node it wishes to communicate with, and the node with that address responds by sending back its physical
address so that packets can be transmitted to it.

Body – The section of an email message that contains the actual content of the message.

Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) – A host or network segment inserted as a “neutral zone” between an
organization’s private network and the Internet.

Header – The section of an email message that contains vital information about the message, including
origination date, sender, recipient(s), delivery path, subject, and format information. The header is
generally left in clear text even when the body of the email message is encrypted.

Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) – A mailbox access protocol defined by IETF RFC 3501.
IMAP is one of the most commonly used mailbox access protocols. IMAP offers a much wider command
set than POP.

Local Delivery Agent (LDA) – A program running on a mail server that delivers messages between a
sender and recipient if their mailboxes are both on the same mail server. An LDA may also process the
message based on a predefined message filter before delivery.

Mail Server – A host that provides “electronic post office” facilities. It stores incoming mail for
distribution to users and forwards outgoing mail. The term may refer to just the application that performs
this service, which can reside on a machine with other services, but for this document the term refers to
the entire host including the mail server application, the host operating system and the supporting
hardware.

Mail Server Administrator – The mail server equivalent of a system administrator. Mail server
administrators are system architects responsible for the overall design and implementation of mail servers.

Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) – A program running on a mail server that receives messages from mail
user agents or other MTAs and either forwards them to another MTA or, if the recipient is on the MTA,
delivers the message to the local delivery agent (LDA) for delivery to the recipient. Common MTAs
include Microsoft Exchange and sendmail.

Mail User Agent (MUA) – A mail client application used by an end user to access a mail server to read,
compose, and send email messages. Common MUAs include Microsoft Outlook and Mozilla
Thunderbird.

Malware – A program that is inserted into a system, usually covertly, with the intent of compromising
the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim’s data, applications, or operating system or of
otherwise annoying or disrupting the victim.

Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) – A protocol that makes use of the headers in an IETF
RFC 2822 message to describe the structure of rich message content.

Network Administrator – A person who manages a network within an organization. Responsibilities
include network security, installing new applications, distributing software upgrades, monitoring daily
