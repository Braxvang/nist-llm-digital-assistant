context of loss time frame is particularly important because the asset of interest has a life cycle 35
that is different from the system of interest. 36 For example, the asset of interest may be created,
configured, or modified outside of the scope of control of the system of interest yet be within the
scope of the engineering effort. The asset of interest, once within the scope of control of the
system of interest, may have differing protection needs associated with the state or mode of the
system (e.g., the system operational mode protection may differ from the system training mode).
Additionally, system life cycle assets (Section 3.8) may only exist within a development or
production system and their associated supporting environments. The effect of the loss for these
assets may transfer to a loss associated with the system of interest. Therefore, the context of loss
includes the life cycle of the asset, the state and mode of the system, and other time-based
periods or characteristics during which loss is addressed.


                                              TIME FRAME OF LOSS – AN EXAMPLE
               A financial portfolio (i.e., an asset or collection of assets) with specific investment
               objectives and risk acceptance considerations may be created by a financial advisor
               for a client, funded by the client, and subsequently managed using multiple systems
               across one or more institutional investment firms throughout the portfolio’s life
               cycle. Each asset of interest within the portfolio may have differing protection needs
               at different times depending on the type of asset, market conditions, regulatory
               jurisdiction, risk position, and other asset management factors that are imposed on
               the system.




The significance of loss is the adverse effect (consequence) on the asset of interest or the
resultant adverse effect associated with the asset. The significance of loss is best described as an
experience that is to be avoided, thereby warranting an investment to protect against the loss
occurring and to minimize the extent of the adverse effect should the loss occur. The significance
of loss is determined and assessed as an effects-based judgment. That is, it is determined without
any consideration of how or why the loss occurs, the probability or likelihood of the loss
occurring, and any intent or the absence of intent related to the loss. 37

The significance of loss answers the following questions:
•    What are the ramifications, effects, and problems that result from suffering a loss of the asset
     of interest?
•    What is the severity of those ramifications, effects, and problems?



35
   The lifetime of an asset may be different from the lifetime of the system. Assets may predate the system and may persist after the system’s
retirement from use. The significance of the loss of an asset can have ramifications that are independent of the system, system function, and
business and mission objectives.
36
   The asset life cycle is the same as the system life cycle when the asset of interest is the system of interest. The asset life cycle may be the same
or shorter than the system life cycle for those assets created by the system of interest and only required while the system of interest is operating.
37
   Determining the significance of loss is not a determination of risk.
