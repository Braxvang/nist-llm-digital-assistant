supports. The following list is a summary of good information security governance
practices that are critical for ensuring the security of enterprise information assets:
    • Information security activities should be governed based on relevant
      requirements, including laws, regulations, and organizational policies.
    • Senior managers should be actively involved in establishing information
      security governance framework and the act of governing the agency’s
      implementation of information security.
    • Information security responsibilities must be assigned and carried out by
      appropriately trained individuals.
    • Individuals responsible for information security within the agency should be
      held accountable for their actions or lack of actions.
    • Information security priorities should be communicated to stakeholders of all
      levels within an organization to ensure a successful implementation of an
      information security program.
    • Information security activities must be integrated into other management
      activities of the enterprise, including strategic planning, capital planning, and
      enterprise architecture.
    • Information security organization structure should be appropriate for the
      organization it supports and should evolve with the organization, if the
      organization undergoes change.
    • Information security managers should continuously monitor the performance of
      the security program/effort for which they are responsible, using available tools
      and information.
    • Information discovered through monitoring should be used as an input into
      management decisions about priorities and funding allocation to effect the
      improvement of security posture and the overall performance of the
      organization.
