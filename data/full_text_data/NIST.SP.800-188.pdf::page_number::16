results in a manner that is consistent with the agency’s mission and legal authority. One way
that agencies can manage this risk is by creating a formal Disclosure Review Board (DRB)
that consists of legal and technical privacy experts, stakeholders within the organization,
and representatives of the organization’s leadership. The DRB evaluates applications for
data release that describe the confdential data, the techniques that will be used to minimize
the risk of disclosure, the resulting protected data, and how the effectiveness of those tech-
niques will be evaluated. The DRB’s work complements other parts of the organization,
such as the Chief Information Security Offcer (CISO), who is responsible for technical
controls, as well as the parts of the organization responsible for adopting administrative or
organizational controls and written data-sharing agreements.
Establishing a DRB may seem like an expensive and complicated administrative under-
taking for some agencies. However, a properly constituted DRB and the development of
consistent procedures regarding data release should enable agencies to lower the risks as-
sociated with each data release, which is likely to save agency resources in the long term.
Agencies can create or adopt standards to guide those performing de-identifcation and re-
garding the accuracy of de-identifed data. If accuracy goals exist, then techniques such
as differential privacy can be used to make the data suffciently accurate for the intended
purpose but not unnecessarily more accurate, which can limit the amount of privacy loss.
However, agencies must carefully choose and implement accuracy requirements. If data
accuracy and privacy goals cannot be well-maintained, then releases of data that are not
suffciently accurate can result in incorrect scientifc conclusions and policy decisions.
Agencies should consider performing de-identifcation with trained individuals using soft-
ware specifcally designed for that purpose. While it is possible to perform de-identifcation
with off-the-shelf software like a commercial spreadsheet or fnancial planning program,
such programs typically lack the key functions required for sophisticated de-identifcation.
As a result, they may encourage the use of simplistic de-identifcation methods, such as
deleting columns that contain sensitive data categories and manually searching and remov-
ing individual data cells that appear sensitive.2 This may result in a dataset that appears
de-identifed but still contains signifcant disclosure risks.
Finally, different countries have different standards and policies regarding the defnition and
use of de-identifed data. Information that is regarded as de-identifed in one jurisdiction
may be regarded as being identifable in another. This may be especially relevant in the case
of international scientifc collaborations and illustrates the need for agencies that perform
de-identifcation to create mechanisms for data scientists, attorneys, and policymakers to
coordinate on these topics.
