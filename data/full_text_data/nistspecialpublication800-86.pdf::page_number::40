GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



that media.35 Software write-blockers are installed on the analyst’s forensic system and currently are
available only for MS-DOS and Windows systems. (Some OSs [e.g., Mac OS X, Linux] may not require
software write-blockers because they can be set to boot with secondary devices not mounted. However,
attaching a hardware write-blocking device will ensure that integrity is maintained.) MS-DOS–based
software write-blockers work by trapping Interrupt 13 and extended Interrupt 13 disk writes. Windows-
based software write-blockers use filters to sort interrupts sent to devices to prevent any writes to storage
media.36

In general, when using a hardware write-blocker, the media or device used to read the media should be
connected directly to the write-blocker, and the write-blocker should be connected to the computer or
device used to perform the backup or imaging. When using a software write-blocker, the software should
be loaded onto a computer before the media or device used to read the media is connected to the
computer. Write-blockers may also allow write-blocking to be toggled on or off for a particular device.
It is important when write-blocking is used, that it be toggled on for all connected devices.37 Write-
blockers also should be tested routinely to ensure that they support newer devices. For example, a new
device might make use of reserved or previously unused functions or placeholders to implement device-
specific functions that might ultimately write to the device and alter its contents.

After a backup or imaging is performed, it is important to verify that the copied data is an exact duplicate
of the original data.38 Computing the message digest of the copied data can be used to verify and ensure
data integrity. 39 A message digest is a hash that uniquely identifies data and has the property that
changing a single bit in the data will cause a completely different message digest to be generated. There
are many algorithms for computing the message digest of data, but the two most commonly used are
MD5 and Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1). These algorithms take as input data of arbitrary length and
produce as output 128-bit message digests. Because SHA-1 is a Federal Information Processing
Standards (FIPS)–approved algorithm and MD5 is not, Federal agencies should use SHA-1 instead of
MD5 for message digests.40

When a bit stream image is performed, the message digest of the original media should be computed and
recorded before the image is performed. After the imaging, the message digest of the copied media
should be computed and compared with the original message digest to verify that data integrity has been
preserved. The message digest of the original media should then be computed again to verify that the
imaging process did not alter the original media, and all results should be documented. The process
should be used for logical backups, except that message digests should be computed and compared for

     Examples of hardware write-blockers are FastBloc (http://www.guidancesoftware.com/lawenforcement/ef_index.asp),
     NoWrite (http://www.mykeytech.com/nowrite.html), and SCSIBlock
     (http://www.digitalintelligence.com/products/scsiblock/). Additional tools are referenced in the Web sites listed in

     An example of a software write-blocker is PDBlock (http://www.digitalintelligence.com/software/disoftware/pdblock/).
     Additional tools are referenced in the Web sites listed in Appendix F.

     These are only general guidelines for using write-blockers. Analysts should refer to the operating procedures for a specific
     write-blocker product for instructions on proper usage.

     If a backup is performed on a live system, it is likely that some files will change between the time the backup was initiated
     and the time it is completed and verified.
39
     Message digests should be used to ensure the integrity of all data that is acquired during forensic activity, including log files
     and logical backups.

     Federal agencies must use FIPS-approved encryption algorithms contained in validated cryptographic modules. The
     Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) at NIST coordinates FIPS testing; the CMVP Web site is located at
     http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval/. FIPS 180-2, Secure Hash Standard, is available at
     http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-2/fips180-2withchangenotice.pdf. NIST has announced that Federal agencies
     should plan to transition from SHA-1 to stronger forms of SHA (e.g., SHA-224, SHA-256) by 2010. For more information,
     see NIST comments from August 2004 posted at http://csrc.nist.gov/hash_standards_comments.pdf, as well as
