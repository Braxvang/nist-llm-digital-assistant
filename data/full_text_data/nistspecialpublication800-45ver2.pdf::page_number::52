GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



mail server software is likely to include mechanisms to provide additional file, device, and resource
access controls specific to its operation. It is important to set identical permissions for both the operating
system and mail server application; otherwise, too much or too little access may be granted to users. Mail
server administrators should consider how best to configure access controls to protect information stored
on their public mail server from two perspectives:

 Limit the access of the mail server application to a subset of computational resources
 Limit the access of users through additional access controls enforced by the mail server, where more
  detailed levels of access control are required.
The proper setting of access controls can help prevent the disclosure of sensitive or restricted information
that is not intended for public dissemination. In addition, access controls can be used to limit resource use
in the event of a DoS attack against the mail server.

Typical files to which access should be controlled are as follows:

 Application software and configuration files
 Files directly related to security mechanisms:

    –   Password hash files and other files used in authentication

    –   Files containing authorization information used in controlling access

    –   Cryptographic key material used in confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation services
 Server log and system audit files
 System software and configuration files.
Ensure that the mail server application executes only under a unique individual user and group identity
with very restrictive access controls. Thus, new user and group identities to be used exclusively by the
mail server software need to be established. The new user and new group should be independent and
unique from all other users and groups. This is a prerequisite for implementing the access controls
described in the following steps. Although the server may initially have to run with root (Unix) or
administrator/system (Windows) privileges to bind to the necessary TCP ports, do not allow the server to
continue to run at this level of access.

In addition, use the mail server operating system to limit files accessed by the mail service processes.
These processes should have read-only access to those files necessary to perform the service and should
have no access to other files, such as server log files. Use mail server host operating system access
controls to enforce the following:

 Temporary files created by the mail server application are restricted to a specified and appropriately
  protected subdirectory (if possible).
 Access to any temporary files created by the mail server application is limited to the mail server
  processes that created these files (if possible).
It is also necessary to ensure that the mail server cannot save files outside the specified file structure
dedicated to the mail server. This may be a configuration choice in the server software, or it may be a
choice in how the server process is controlled by the operating system. Ensure that such directories and
