Q. What must be considered when managing a security services project?
A. The importance of systematically managing the information security services
   process cannot be underestimated because of the potential impact on the
   organization if the many issues involved are not properly considered and the
   organizational risks are not managed. Information security decision makers must
   think about not only the costs involved and the underlying security requirements,
   but also the impact of their decisions on the organizational mission, operations,
   strategic functions, personnel, and service provider arrangements.

Q. What are the steps in the security services life cycle?
A. The information security services life cycle provides a framework around which
   the various information security decision makers can organize their information
   security efforts—from initiation to closeout. The steps for the life cycle are:
       1.   Initiation Phase: Determining the need;
       2.   Assessment Phase: Identifying viable solutions;
       3.   Solution Phase: Specifying the right solution;
       4.   Implementation Phase: Engaging the right source;
       5.   Operations Phase: Ensuring operational success; and
       6.   Closeout Phase: Ensuring successful closure.

Q. What should take place before selecting a security service?
A. Before selecting specific services, organizations should review the current status
   of their security programs and the security controls that are planned or in place
   to protect information and information systems. Organizations should use the
   risk management process to identify the most effective mix of management,
   operational, and technical security controls that will mitigate risk to an acceptable
   level. The number and type of appropriate security controls and their
   corresponding information security services may vary throughout a particular
   system’s services life cycle. The relative maturity of an organization’s security
   architecture may influence the types of appropriate security controls.

Q. Are there security services categories?
A. Yes. Security services are divided into three categories: management,
   operational, and technical services. Characteristics of each service are listed
   below:
   • Management Services are techniques and concerns normally addressed by
     management in the organization’s computer security program. They focus on
     managing the computer security program and the risk within the organization.
