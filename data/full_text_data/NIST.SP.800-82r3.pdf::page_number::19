NIST SP 800-82r3                                         Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

OT cybersecurity programs should always be part of broader OT safety and reliability programs
at both industrial sites and enterprise cybersecurity programs because cybersecurity is essential
to the safe and reliable operation of modern industrial processes. Threats to OT systems can
come from numerous sources, including hostile governments, terrorist groups, disgruntled
employees, malicious intruders, complexities, natural disasters, malicious actions by insiders,
and unintentional actions such human error or failure to follow established policies and
procedures. OT security objectives typically prioritize integrity and availability, followed by
confidentiality, but also must consider safety as an overarching priority.
Possible incidents that an OT system may face include:
   •   Blocked or delayed flow of information through OT networks, which could disrupt OT
       operation, including loss of view and loss of control
   •   Unauthorized changes to instructions, commands, or alarm thresholds that could damage,
       disable, or shut down equipment, create environmental impacts, and/or endanger human
       life
   •   Inaccurate information sent to system operators, either to disguise unauthorized changes
       or to cause operators to initiate inappropriate actions that could have various negative
       effects
   •   Modified OT software or configuration settings or OT software infected with malware,
       which could have various negative effects
   •   Interference with the operation of equipment protection systems, which could endanger
       costly and difficult-to-replace equipment
   •   Interference with the operation of safety systems, which could endanger human life
Major security objectives for an OT implementation should include the following:
   •   Restrict logical access to the OT network, network activity, and systems. This may
       include using unidirectional gateways, utilizing a demilitarized zone (DMZ) network
       architecture with firewalls to prevent network traffic from passing directly between the
       corporate and OT networks, and having separate authentication mechanisms and
       credentials for users of the corporate and OT networks. The OT system should also use a
       network topology that has multiple layers, with the most critical communications
       occurring in the most secure and reliable layer.
   •   Restrict physical access to the OT network and devices. Unauthorized physical access
       to components can seriously disrupt the OT’s functionality. A combination of physical
       access controls should be used, such as locks, card readers, and/or guards.
   •   Protect individual OT components from exploitation. This includes deploying security
       patches in as expeditious a manner as possible after testing them under field conditions,
       disabling all unused ports and services and ensuring that they remain disabled, restricting
       OT user privileges to only those that are required for each user’s role, tracking and
       monitoring audit trails, and using security controls such as antivirus software and file
       integrity checking software where technically feasible to prevent, deter, detect, and
       mitigate malware. Keys of OT assets like programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and
