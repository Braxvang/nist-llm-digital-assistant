          Completed                                                Action
                          Configure content filtering to block or tag suspicious messages (e.g., phishing,
                          spam)
                          Configure content filtering to strip suspicious active content from messages
                          Configure lexical analysis if required
                          Take steps to prevent address spoofing, such as blocking emails from external
                          locations using internal “From” addresses
                          Create a security policy that addresses content filtering
                          Have the security policy reviewed by appropriate legal, privacy, and human
                          resources authorities
                          Add a legal disclaimer to emails, if required
                          Educate users on the dangers of malware and how to minimize those dangers
                          Notify users when an outbreak occurs
                          Block spam-sending servers
                          Configure mail gateways or firewalls to use LDAP lookup to confirm the
                          existence of email recipients
                          Configure mail server to block email from open relay blacklists or DNS blacklists,
                          if required
                          Configure mail server to block email from specific domains, if required
                          Use authenticated mail relay
                          Configure authenticated mail relay on the server
                          Secure access to the mail server
                          Configure mail server to use encrypted authentication
                          Enable Web access to email
                          Configure mail server to support Web access only via SSL/TLS and only if such
                          access is deemed necessary



Implementing a Secure Network Infrastructure

          Completed                                                Action
                          Network location
                          Mail server is located on the internal network and protected by a mail gateway
                          and/or firewall, or
                          Mail server is located in a DMZ
                          Firewall configuration
                          Mail server is protected by a firewall
                          Mail server, if it faces a higher threat or if it is more vulnerable, is protected by an
                          application layer firewall
                          Firewall controls all traffic between the Internet and the mail server
                          Firewall blocks all inbound traffic to the mail server except the necessary ports,
                          such as TCP ports 25 (SMTP), 110 (POP3), 143 (IMAP), 398 (LDAP), 636
                          (secure LDAP), 993 (secure IMAP), and 995 (secure POP)
