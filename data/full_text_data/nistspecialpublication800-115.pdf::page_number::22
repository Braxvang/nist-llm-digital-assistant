modifications. A file integrity checker capability is usually included with any commercial host-based
IDS, and is also available as a standalone utility.

Although an integrity checker does not require a high degree of human interaction, it must be used
carefully to ensure its effectiveness. File integrity checking is most effective when system files are
compared with a reference database created using a system known to be secure—this helps ensure that the
reference database was not built with compromised files. The reference database should be stored offline
to prevent attackers from compromising the system and covering their tracks by modifying the database.
In addition, because patches and other updates change files, the checksum database should be kept up-to-
date.

For file integrity checking, strong cryptographic checksums such as Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1)
should be used to ensure the integrity of data stored in the checksum database. Federal agencies are
required by Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) PUB 140-2, Security Requirements for
Cryptographic Modules 11 , to use SHA (e.g., SHA-1, SHA-256).

Risks are associated with each technique and their combinations. To ensure that all are executed safely
and accurately, each assessor should have a certain baseline skill set. Table 3-2 provides guidelines for
the minimum skill set needed for each technique presented in Section 3.
