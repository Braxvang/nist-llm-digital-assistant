                                                                   Generation Using Deterministic RBGs




                   Figure 3: DRBG Mechanism Functions within a Single Device
Figure 4 provides an example of DRBG mechanism functions that are distributed across multiple
devices. In this case, each device has a DRBG mechanism sub-boundary that contains the DRBG
mechanism functions implemented on that device, and the DRBG mechanism sub-boundary is
contained within a cryptographic module boundary, as is further discussed in [SP 800-90C]. The
boundary around the entire DRBG mechanism includes the aggregation of sub-boundaries
providing the DRBG mechanism functionality. Each sub-boundary may be contained within a
different cryptographic module boundary, or multiple sub-boundaries may be contained within
the same cryptographic module boundary.
The use of distributed DRBG-mechanism functions may be convenient for restricted
environments (e.g., smart card applications) in which the primary use of the DRBG does not
require repeated use of the instantiate or reseed functions.
Each DRBG mechanism boundary or sub-boundary shall contain a health test function to test the
“health” of other DRBG-mechanism functions within that boundary. In addition, a boundary or
sub-boundary that contains an instantiate function shall contain an uninstantiate function in order
to terminate an instantiation.
