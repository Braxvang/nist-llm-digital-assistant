                   The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



                The source attribute SHALL be defined using either “http://cve.mitre.org” (preferred
                method) or “CVE”.
           b. Definitions that are directly or indirectly extended SHALL be limited to inventory and
              vulnerability classes.

3.4      Open Checklist Interactive Language (OCIL)
This section lists recommendations for using the Open Checklist Interactive Language (OCIL) to express
an OCIL component of an SCAP source data stream (see Table 12).
OCIL content SHOULD be used for checking rules that cannot be fully automated with OVAL. For
example, a particular software product may not have an application programming interface (API) that
supports OVAL use. Another example is performing a check that requires user interaction, such as asking
the user to look up information within a management console or to report a serial number affixed to a
computing device. OCIL can also be used to collect a user’s own information, such as whether the user
participated in a recent security training session.
If an <ocil:questionnaire> element maps to one or more CCE, CVE, and/or CPE identifiers, it
SHOULD include <ocil:reference> elements that reference those identifiers using the
corresponding following format:
      <ocil:reference href="http://cce.mitre.org">CCE_identifier</ocil:reference>

      <ocil:reference href="http://cve.mitre.org">CVE_identifier</ocil:reference>

      <ocil:reference href="http://cpe.mitre.org">CPE_identifier</ocil:reference>

3.5      Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)
This section lists requirements and recommendations for using Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) to
express a CPE component of an SCAP source data stream (see Table 12).
The Official CPE Dictionary data feed15 MAY be used by SCAP components to reference CPE names. If
use of the Official CPE Dictionary is impractical, a subset of the dictionary MAY be used instead.
Creating the reduced official dictionary involves first identifying every CPE in <xccdf:platform>
and <cpe2:fact-ref> elements contained within referenced <cpe2:platform-
specification> elements in every benchmark in the data stream. Then these CPEs MUST be
matched against every entry in the Official CPE Dictionary using the CPE name matching algorithm
[CPE-M]. All CPEs matched in the official dictionary with a result of EQUAL or SUPERSET MUST be
included in the reduced official dictionary.
One or more third-party dictionaries MAY be included in a data stream as well. All such third-party
dictionaries SHOULD follow the requirements of the CPE Dictionary specification [CPE-D]. If including
an entire third-party dictionary is impractical, a subset of the dictionary MAY be used instead. The
reduced dictionary MUST be created using the same procedure outlined for creating a subset of the
official dictionary.
In all cases, a dictionary component MAY be remote to the data stream collection.
Each CPE name [CPE-N] in an <xccdf:platform> or <cpe2:fact-ref> element within an
XCCDF document SHALL match at least one CPE entry in a dictionary referenced by the data stream. A
match is considered an EQUAL or SUPERSET result when matching the CPE name to a dictionary entry,
