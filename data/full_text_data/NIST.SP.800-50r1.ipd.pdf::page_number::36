 970   An organization-wide All-User phishing exercise is a typical type of practical exercise. In a
 971   phishing exercise, a “tricky” email is sent to users to see whether the user can spot a phishing
 972   attempt or if they can be tricked into clicking on a link to a malicious website or opening an
 973   infected attachment. Since phishing emails can target specific roles in the organization, such as
 974   leadership or known administrators, the phishing exercises can also target specific roles.
 975   Phishing exercises offer opportunities to collect metrics and measurements, which are usually
 976   referred to as click-through or reported measurements. These types of measurements indicate
 977   whether the user reported the email as a phishing attempt or whether they clicked on a link or
 978   opened an attachment. Some organizations include “report phishing” capabilities on their email
 979   platform (e.g., a button on the platform’s menu) to encourage best practices. It can be important
 980   to consider the context of the employee’s work when creating or deploying a phishing test. 10
 981   Be sure to include the organization’s legal team in the design review of planned phishing
 982   exercises to avoid negative impacts, such as using legitimate brands or naming federal
 983   organizations in the phishing “bait,” which could result in emails or calls to those entities. In
 984   addition, since employees may not like being tricked, it is important to tell employees that the
 985   organization is conducting phishing exercises on a random basis and that the results will be used
 986   to guide future learning activities. These activities should not be punitive, nor should any
 987   employee be called out for their response. When viewed as learning opportunities, the phishing
 988   exercises can provide important data on vulnerabilities and which employees may need
 989   additional learning support.
 990   Other practical exercises may be better suited for those with significant cybersecurity or privacy
 991   responsibilities (e.g., role-based training) or, if well-designed, could apply to any user group.
 992   These exercises might include table-top exercises and contingency plan scenarios. Additional
 993   examples may be found in the 2006 NIST SP 800-84, “Guide to Test, Training, and Exercise
 994   Programs for IT Plans and Capabilities”[4].

 995   2.7.3. Training
 996   Training is a broad term that includes the Learning Program content designed to increase or
 997   improve job-related knowledge and skills. Some of the techniques that an organization can
 998   employ include:
 999        •     Synchronous training: Instructors and students participate together, whether in a virtual
1000              or a physical classroom-based learning environment.
1001        •     Asynchronous training: The learner is able to access material individually and on-
1002              demand. This is sometimes called “self-paced” because the learner accesses content
1003              based on their schedule.
1004        •     Virtual led: Instruction occurs in a virtual or simulated environment and is presented or
1005              facilitated by an instructor in real time.
1006        •     Cyber range: Instruction takes place in a safe web-based practice environment (i.e.,
1007              sandbox) and delivers hands-on realistic training, scenarios, challenges, and exercises.
