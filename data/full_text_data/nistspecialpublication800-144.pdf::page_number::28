           additional risks or benefits [Eis05]. Technical, physical and administrative safeguards,
           such as access controls, often apply. For example, European data protection laws may
           impose additional obligations on the handling and processing of data transferred to the
           U.S. [DoC00]. These concerns can be alleviated if the cloud provider has some reliable
           means to ensure that an organization’s data is stored and processed only within specific
           jurisdictions.

          Electronic Discovery. Electronic discovery involves the identification, collection,
           processing, analysis, and production of Electronically Stored Information (ESI) in the
           discovery phase of litigation [Daw05]. Organizations also have other incentives and
           obligations to preserve and produce electronic documents, such as complying with audit
           and regulatory information requests, and for government organizations, complying with
           Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. ESI includes not only electronic mail,
           attachments, and other data objects stored on a computer system or storage media, but
           also any associated metadata, such as dates of object creation or modification, and non-
           rendered file content (i.e., data that is not explicitly displayed for consumers).

           The capabilities and processes of a cloud provider, such as the form in which data is
           maintained and the electronic discovery-related tools available, affect the ability of the
           organization to meet its obligations in a cost effective, timely, and compliant manner
           [Mcd10]. For example, a cloud provider’s archival capabilities may not preserve the
           original metadata as expected, causing spoliation (i.e., the intentional, reckless, or
           negligent destruction, loss, material alteration, or obstruction of evidence that is relevant
           to litigation), which could negatively impact litigation. The cloud provider’s electronic
           discovery capabilities and processes must not compromise the privacy or security of the
           data and applications of the organization in satisfying the discovery obligations of other
           cloud consumers, and vice versa.

4.3       Trust
Under the cloud computing paradigm, an organization relinquishes direct control over many
aspects of security and privacy, and in doing so, confers a high level of trust onto the cloud
provider. At the same time, federal agencies have a responsibility to protect information and
information systems commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from
unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction, regardless of
whether the information is collected or maintained by or on behalf of the agency; or whether the
information systems are used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency or other
organization on behalf of an agency [HR2458].

          Insider Access. Data processed or stored outside the physical confines of an
           organization, its firewall, and other security controls bring with it an inherent level of
           risk. The insider security threat is a well-known issue for most organizations and, despite
           the name, applies as well to outsourced cloud services [Ash10, Cap09, Kow08]. Insider
           threats go beyond those posed by current or former employees to include contractors,
           organizational affiliates, and other parties that have received access to an organization’s
           networks, systems, and data to carry out or facilitate operations. Incidents may involve
           various types of fraud, sabotage of information resources, and theft of sensitive
