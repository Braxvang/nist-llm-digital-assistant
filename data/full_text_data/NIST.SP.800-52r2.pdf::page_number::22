    4. CRL from the CRL Distribution Points extension in the client certificate.

When the local store does not have the current or a cogent 16 CRL or OCSP response and the
OCSP responder and the CRL distribution point are unavailable or inaccessible at the time of
TLS session establishment, the server will either deny the connection or accept a potentially
revoked or compromised certificate. The decision to accept or reject a certificate in this situation
should be made according to agency policy.

3.2.3    Server Public-Key Certificate Assurance

The policies, procedures, and security controls under which a public-key certificate is issued by a
CA are documented in a certificate policy. The use of a certificate policy that is designed with
the secure operation of Public Key Infrastucture (PKI) in mind and adherence to the stipulated
certificate policy mitigates the threat that the issuing CA can be compromised or that the
registration system, persons, or process can be compromised to obtain an unauthorized certificate
in the name of a legitimate entity and thus compromise the clients. With this in mind, the CA
Browser Forum, a private-sector organization, has carried out some efforts in this area by writing
requirements for issuing certificates from publicly trusted CAs in order for those CAs and their
trust anchor to remain in browser trust stores [16]. Under another effort, the CA Browser Forum
has written guidelines for issuing Extended Validation Certificates [17].

Several concepts are under development that further mitigate the risks associated with the
compromise of a CA or X.509 certificate registration system, process, or personnel. These
include the Certificate Transparency project (see Section 3.4.2.15) and other emerging concepts,
which are discussed in Appendix E.

The policy under which a certificate has been issued may optionally be represented in the
certificate using the certificatePolicies extension, specified in [19] and updated in [72]. When
used, one or more certificate policy object identifiers (OID) are asserted in this extension, with
each OID representing a specific certificate policy. Many TLS clients (e.g., browsers), however,
do not offer the ability to accept or reject certificates based on the policies under which they
were issued. Therefore, it is generally necessary for TLS server certificates to be issued by CAs
that only issue certificates in accordance with a certificate policy that specifies adequate security
controls.

When an agency is obtaining a certificate for a TLS server for which all the clients are under the
agency’s control, the agency may issue the certificate from its own CA if it can configure the
clients to trust that CA. In other cases, the agency should obtain a certificate from a publicly-
trusted CA (a CA that clients that will be connecting to the server have already been configured
to trust).



16 A CRL is considered “cogent” when the “CRL Scope” [19] is appropriate for the certificate in question.
