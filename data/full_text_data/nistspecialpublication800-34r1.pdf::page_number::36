Although major disruptions with long-term effects may be rare, they should be accounted for in the
contingency plan. Thus, for all FIPS 199 moderate- or high-impact systems, the plan should include a
strategy to recover and perform system operations at an alternate facility for an extended period.
Organizations may consider FIPS 199 low-impact systems for alternate site processing, but that is an
organizational decision and not required. In general, three types of alternate sites are available:

           Dedicated site owned or operated by the organization;
           Reciprocal agreement or memorandum of agreement with an internal or external entity; and
           Commercially leased facility.

Regardless of the type of alternate site chosen, the facility must be able to support system operations as
defined in the contingency plan. The three alternate site types commonly categorized in terms of their
operational readiness are cold sites, warm sites, or hot sites. 26 Other variations or combinations of these
can be found, but generally all variations retain similar core features found in one of these three site types.
Progressing from basic to advanced, the sites are described below.

           Cold Sites are typically facilities with adequate space and infrastructure (electric power,
            telecommunications connections, and environmental controls) to support information system
            recovery activities.
           Warm Sites are partially equipped office spaces that contain some or all of the system hardware,
            software, telecommunications, and power sources.
           Hot Sites are facilities appropriately sized to support system requirements and configured with
            the necessary system hardware, supporting infrastructure, and support personnel.
As discussed above, these three alternate site types are the most common. There are also variations, and
hybrid mixtures of features from any one of the three. Each organization should evaluate its core
requirements in order to establish the most effective solution. Two examples of variations to the site
types are:

           Mobile Sites are self-contained, transportable shells custom-fitted with specific
            telecommunications and system equipment necessary to meet system requirements.
           Mirrored Sites are fully redundant facilities with automated real-time information mirroring.
            Mirrored sites are identical to the primary site in all technical respects.

There are obvious cost and ready-time differences among the options. In these examples, the mirrored
site is the most expensive choice, but it ensures virtually 100 percent availability. Cold sites are the least
expensive to maintain, although they may require substantial time to acquire and install necessary
equipment. Partially equipped sites, such as warm sites, fall in the middle of the spectrum. In many
cases, mobile sites may be delivered to the desired location within 24 hours, but the time necessary for
equipment installation and setup can increase this response time. The selection of fixed-site locations
should account for the time and mode of transportation necessary to move personnel and/or equipment
there. In addition, the fixed site should be in a geographic area that is unlikely to be negatively affected
by the same hazard as the organization’s primary site.
