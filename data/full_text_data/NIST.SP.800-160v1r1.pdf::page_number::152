NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                 Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems

H.10.3.        Security Activities and Tasks
TR-1   PREPARE FOR TRANSITION
       TR-1.1 Define the security aspects of the transition strategy.
       Note: The transition strategy includes all security-relevant activities, from site delivery and
       installation through the deployment and commissioning of the system, as well as all security-
       relevant stakeholders, including human operators. The strategy also includes security roles and
       responsibilities, facility security considerations, secure shipping and receiving, contingency back
       out plans, security training, security aspects of installation acceptance demonstration tasks,
       secure operational readiness reviews, secure operations commencement, transition security
       success criteria, rights of secure access, data rights, and integration with other plans. System
       commissioning is considered along with the secure decommissioning of the old system when
       one exists. In this case, the Transition and Disposal processes are used concurrently.
       TR-1.2 Identify and define any security-relevant facility or site changes needed.
       TR-1.3 Identify the security-relevant constraints and objectives from the security aspects of
              transition to be incorporated into the system requirements, architecture, and design.
       TR-1.4 Identify and arrange the security training of operators, users, and other stakeholders
              necessary to the system utilization and support.
       TR-1.5 Identify the security aspects for enabling systems or services needed to support
              transition.
       TR-1.6 Identify and plan for enabling systems or services needed to support the security
              aspects of transition.
       TR-1.7 Obtain or acquire access to the security aspects of enabling systems or services to be
              used in transition.
       TR-1.8 Identify security aspects, and arrange for the secure shipping and receiving of system
              elements and enabling systems.

TR-2   PERFORM TRANSITION
       TR-2.1 Prepare the site of operation in accordance with secure installation requirements.
       TR-2.2 Securely deliver the system for installation at the correct location and time.
       Note: Secure delivery considers the various forms, means, and methods that accomplish the
       end-to-end transport of system elements to ensure that they are not tampered with during
       transport. Items and packages are delivered only to the intended recipient, which may mean
       shipping with more lead time to account for additional security.
       TR-2.3 Install the system in its operational environment in accordance with the secure
              installation strategy, and establish secure interconnections to its environment.
       TR-2.4 Demonstrate trustworthy secure system installation.
       Note: The installation and connection procedures are to be properly verified to provide
       confidence that the intended system configuration across all system modes and states is
