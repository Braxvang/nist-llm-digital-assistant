FR:3.6 The CKMS design shall specify how COTS products are configured and
augmented to meet the CKMS goals.

3.3 Conformance to Standards
Much can be learned about a CKMS by examining the extent to which it utilizes
applicable standards. Designs that comply with standards have the benefit of the
experience and wisdom of those who developed the standards. In addition, if the
standards have validation programs that measure compliance, there is increased
confidence that the CKMS has been correctly implemented. See Appendix A for a list of
appropriate standards with a brief description of each.

Standards specify how something shall or should be done. Multiple vendors can build to
the same standard and, thereby, foster interoperability and competition. In addition, the
use of standards often increases confidence in the product or implementation. There is
increased confidence in a standard that was developed and reviewed by multiple parties
working together. Complying with standards may also reduce the time-to-production for
a product or the time-to-operation for an implementation, since the essential concepts do
not have to be re-invented. Conformance-testing laboratories are useful in that errors in
implementations may be found and eliminated before products are available in the
marketplace.

FR:3.7 The CKMS design shall specify the Federal, national, and international standards
that are utilized by the CKMS.

The availability of commercial products that conform to one or more standards in a
CKMS architecture can greatly reduce the time and cost of producing a CKMS. The up-
front cost of a conformance-tested product is likely to be more than offset by the saved
costs of not having to adapt a non-conforming product or to build a similar product from
scratch.

FR:3.8 For each standard utilized by the CKMS, the CKMS design shall specify which
CKMS devices implement the standard.

FR:3.9 For each standard utilized by the CKMS, the CKMS design shall specify how
conformance to the standard was validated (e.g., by a third party testing program).

3.4 Ease-of-use
Possibly the most significant constraint to the use of a CKMS is the difficulty that some
systems present to the untrained user. Since most users are not cryptographic security
experts, and security is often a secondary goal for them, the CKMS needs to be as
transparent as possible. User interfaces that adapt to the expertise of the user can guide a
new and less-trained user, while permitting an expert to use efficient short cuts and to
bypass step-by-step guidance.
