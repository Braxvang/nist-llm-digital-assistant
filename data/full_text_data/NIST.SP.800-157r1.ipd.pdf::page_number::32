      NIST SP 800-157r1 ipd                           Derived PIV Credentials (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


865   B.1.4.1. Derived PIV Application Key References and Security Conditions of Use
866   Key references are assigned to keys and secrets of the derived PIV application. Table
867   6-1 of [SP800-78] and Table 4 of [SP800-73] Part 1 define the key reference values that
868   SHALL be used on the derived PIV application interfaces with the following mappings:

                                   Table 2. Mapping of Key Types

               Derived PIV Key Type                     PIV Key Type
               Derived PIV Activation Secret            PIV Card Application PIN
               Activation Secret Unblocking Key         PIN Unblocking Key
               Derived PIV Authentication Key           PIV Authentication Key
               Derived PIV Token Management Key         Card Management Key
               Digital Signature Key                    Digital Signature Key
               Key Management Key                       Key Management Key
               Retired Key Management Key               Retired Key Management Key
               Derived PIV Secure Messaging Key         PIV Secure Messaging Key


869   The key reference specifications in Sec. 5.1 of [SP800-73] Part 1 are applicable to the
870   corresponding keys included in the derived PIV application (mapped per Table 2), except
871   for the following:
872       • References to “PIV Card application” are replaced with “derived PIV application.”
873       • References in the “Security Condition for Use” column to “PIN or OCC” are
874         replaced with “derived PIV activation secret.”

875   B.1.4.2. Derived PIV Application Cryptographic Algorithm and Mechanism Identiﬁers
876   The algorithm identifiers for the cryptographic algorithms that MAY be recognized on
877   the derived PIV application interfaces are the symmetric and asymmetric identifiers
878   specified in Table 6-2 and Table 6-3 of [SP800-78]. The cryptographic mechanism
879   identifiers that MAY be recognized on the derived PIV application interfaces are those
880   specified in Table 5 of [SP800-73] Part 1.

881   B.1.4.3. Derived PIV Application Status Words
882   The status words that MAY be returned on the derived PIV application command
883   interface are as specified in Sec. 5.6 of [SP800-73] Part 1.

884   B.1.5. Derived PIV Authentication Mechanisms
885   The derived PIV application supports the following validation steps:
886       • Credential validation (CredV) is established by verifying the certificates retrieved
887         from the derived PIV application and checking the validity and revocation status of
888         these certificates.
