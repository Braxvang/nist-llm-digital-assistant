                   Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


Plan of Action     A document that identifies tasks needing to be accomplished. It
and                details resources required to accomplish the elements of the plan, any
Milestones         milestones in meeting the tasks, and scheduled completion dates for
[OMB               the milestones.

Potential Impact   The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be
[FIPS 199]         expected to have: (i) a limited adverse effect (FIPS 199 low); (ii) a
                   serious adverse effect (FIPS 199 moderate); or (iii) a severe or
                   catastrophic adverse effect (FIPS 199 high) on organizational
                   operations, organizational assets, or individuals.
Privacy Impact     An analysis of how information is handled: (i) to ensure handling
Assessment         conforms to applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements
[OMB               regarding privacy; (ii) to determine the risks and effects of collecting,
Memorandum         maintaining, and disseminating information in identifiable form in an
03-22]             electronic information system; and (iii) to examine and evaluate
                   protections and alternative processes for handling information to
                   mitigate potential privacy risks.
Protective         Wire line or fiber optic system that includes adequate safeguards
Distribution       and/or countermeasures (e.g., acoustic, electric, electromagnetic, and
System             physical) to permit its use for the transmission of unencrypted
                   information.
Records            The recordings of evidence of activities performed or results
                   achieved (e.g., forms, reports, test results), which serve as a basis for
                   verifying that the organization and the information system are
                   performing as intended. Also used to refer to units of related data
                   fields (i.e., groups of data fields that can be accessed by a program
                   and that contain the complete set of information on particular items).

Remote Access      Access by users (or information systems) communicating external to
                   an information system security perimeter.
Remote             Maintenance activities conducted by individuals communicating
Maintenance        external to an information system security perimeter.
Risk               The level of impact on agency operations (including mission,
[NIST SP 800-      functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, or individuals
30]                resulting from the operation of an information system given the
                   potential impact of a threat and the likelihood of that threat
                   occurring.
