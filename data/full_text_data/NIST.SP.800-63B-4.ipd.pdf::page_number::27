      NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                       Authentication and Lifecycle Management


692   Verifiers SHALL verify the entire submitted memorized secret (i.e., not truncate the
693   secret). For purposes of the above length requirements, each Unicode code point SHALL
694   be counted as a single character.
695   If Unicode characters are accepted in memorized secrets, the verifier SHOULD apply
696   the normalization process for stabilized strings using either the NFKC or NFKD
697   normalization defined in Sec. 12.1 of Unicode Normalization Forms [UAX15]. This
698   process is applied before hashing the byte string representing the memorized secret.
699   Subscribers choosing memorized secrets containing Unicode characters SHOULD be
700   advised that some characters may be represented differently by some endpoints, which
701   can affect their ability to authenticate successfully.
702   Memorized secret verifiers SHALL NOT permit the subscriber to store a hint that is
703   accessible to an unauthenticated claimant. Verifiers SHALL NOT prompt subscribers
704   to use specific types of information (e.g., “What was the name of your first pet?”, a
705   technique known as knowledge-based authentication (KBA) or security questions) when
706   choosing memorized secrets.
707   When processing requests to establish and change memorized secrets, verifiers SHALL
708   compare the prospective secrets against a blocklist that contains values known to be
709   commonly used, expected, or compromised. For example, the list MAY include, but
710   is not limited to:
711       • Passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses.
712       • Dictionary words.
713       • Repetitive or sequential characters (e.g. ‘aaaaaa’, ‘1234abcd’).
714       • Context-specific words, such as the name of the service, the username, and
715         derivatives thereof.
716   If the chosen secret is found in the blocklist, the CSP or verifier SHALL advise the
717   subscriber that they need to select a different secret, SHALL provide the reason for
718   rejection, and SHALL require the subscriber to choose a different value. Since the
719   blocklist is used to defend against brute-force attacks and unsuccessful attempts are
720   rate limited as described below, the blocklist SHOULD be of a size sufficient to prevent
721   subscribers from choosing memorized secrets that attackers are likely to guess before
722   reaching the attempt limit. Excessively large blocklists SHOULD NOT be used because
723   they frustrate subscribers’ attempts to establish an acceptable memorized secret and do
724   not provide significantly improved security.
725   Verifiers SHALL offer guidance to the subscriber to assist the user in choosing a strong
726   memorized secret. This is particularly important following the rejection of a memorized
727   secret on the above list as it discourages trivial modification of listed (and likely very
728   weak) memorized secrets [Blocklists].
