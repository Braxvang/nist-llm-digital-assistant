APPENDIX H

RISK RESPONSE STRATEGIES
FROM BOUNDARY PROTECTION TO AGILE DEFENSES




O        rganizations develop risk management strategies as part of the risk framing step in the
         risk management process described in Chapter Three. The risk management strategies
         address how organizations intend to assess risk, respond to risk, and monitor risk—
making explicit and transparent the risk perceptions that organizations routinely use in making
both investment and operational decisions. As part of organizational risk management strategies,
organizations also develop risk response strategies. The practical realities facing organizations
today make risk response strategies essential—the realities of needing the mission/business
effectiveness offered by information technology, the lack of trustworthiness in the technologies
available, and the growing awareness by adversaries of the potential to achieve their objectives to
cause harm by compromising organizational information systems and the environments in which
those systems operate. Senior leaders/executives in modern organizations are faced with an
almost intractable dilemma—that is, the information technologies needed for mission/business
success may be the same technologies through which adversaries cause mission/business failure.
The risk response strategies developed and implemented by organizations provide these senior
leaders/executives (i.e., decision makers within organizations) with practical, pragmatic paths for
dealing with this dilemma. Clearly defined and articulated risk response strategies help to ensure
that senior leaders/executives take ownership of organizational risk responses and are ultimately
responsible and accountable for risk decisions—understanding, acknowledging, and explicitly
accepting the resulting mission/business risk.
As described in Chapter Two, there are five basic types of responses to risk: (i) accept; (ii) avoid;
(iii) mitigate; (iv) share; and (v) transfer.79 While each type of response can have an associated
strategy, there should be an overall strategy for selecting from among the basic response types.
This overall risk response strategy and a strategy for each type of response are discussed below.
In addition, specific risk mitigation strategies are presented, including a description of how such
strategies can be implemented within organizations.

H.1 OVERALL RISK RESPONSE STRATEGIES
Risk response strategies specify: (i) individuals or organizational subcomponents that are
responsible for the selected risk response measures and specifications of effectiveness criteria
(i.e., articulation of indicators and thresholds against which the effectiveness of risk response
measures can be judged); (ii) dependencies of the selected risk response measures on other risk
response measures; (iii) dependencies of selected risk response measures on other factors (e.g.,
implementation of other planned information technology measures); (iv) implementation timeline
for risk responses; (v) plans for monitoring the effectiveness of the risk response measures; (vi)
identification of risk monitoring triggers; and (vii) interim risk response measures selected for
implementation, if appropriate. Risk response implementation strategies may include interim
measures that organizations choose to implement. An overall risk response strategy provides an
organizational approach to selecting between the basic risk responses for a given risk situation. A
decision to accept risk must be consistent with the stated organizational tolerance for risk. Yet

79
  There is overlap between the basic risk responses. For example, a shared risk is one that is being accepted by each
party in the sharing arrangement, and avoiding risk can be thought of as mitigating risk to zero. Nonetheless, with this
understanding of overlap, there is value in addressing each of the five types of risk responses separately.
