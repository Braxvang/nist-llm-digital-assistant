GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



    been incorrectly labeled. Some mail clients allow users to configure filtering features such as
    creating lists of safe senders and senders to block.
There are additional issues specific to portable mail clients, such as those on cell phones and PDAs. The
use of portable mail clients has increased significantly in recent years. Users should be made aware that
the information that is stored on them is at risk, and that they need to take the necessary precautions in
case their devices are lost or stolen. Beyond the obvious physical security measures, users should also
reconfigure their devices, which are typically configured insecurely by default. Security features to
consider include the following:

 Requiring a password or a PIN to gain access to the device.
 Encrypting locally stored data, including messages and downloaded file attachments.
 Encrypting and/or signing messages, such as supporting S/MIME or OpenPGP and managing digital
  certificates.
 Encrypting communications between the mail client and the mail server, such as using SSL-based
  encryption to protect POP, IMAP, and SMTP communications.
 Remotely rendering the device useless or deleting its information if it is compromised.
 Changing the Bluetooth discovery PIN number on Bluetooth devices to prevent unauthorized access.
Organizations should also ensure that their security policy supports the protection of portable mail clients,
such as requiring that the devices have anti-virus software enabled on them if available and that wireless
functionality be turned off when not being used. Organizations that do not want certain types of devices
used to access email should specify the restriction in their security policy.

Many organizations configure mobile devices with VPN access to corporate networks or applications that
can connect remotely to servers. As a good security measure, limit access to these applications or remove
them if they are not being used. Also, do not store logins, passwords, or personal information on the
devices. If the device is stolen, an attacker could potentially use network login information with the VPN
to access internal network resources.

8.1.3   Configuring Authentication and Access

Early mail client applications did not require user authentication because mailbox access was restricted by
the local file system and the user owned the mailbox file. As MUAs evolved and provided the
functionality to access mailboxes remotely via POP and IMAP (see Section 2), user authentication
became a requirement. Typically, this was accomplished with users inputting a username and a password
when accessing their mailbox. To be more “user-friendly,” mail clients incorporated configuration files
that contained (e.g., “remembered”) usernames and passwords with which to access the mail server.
Although this provides ease of use for users, it introduces security weaknesses insofar as a remote or local
attacker having logical or physical access to the mail client host may gain access to the authentication
information and, in turn, the mailbox contents. In addition, if automatic completion of user input is
enabled, a local attacker may be able to use the feature to discover passwords systematically.

Disabling password recall functionality is an effective way to increase mail client security. If the
functionality cannot be disabled, then keeping these configuration files secure is important. Most
operating systems provide file permission and access control features that offer some means of protection.
With hosts that do provide these controls, ensure that the mail client configuration files are restricted for
accessibility by only the file owner. Additionally, ensure that the file is located in a directory controlled
