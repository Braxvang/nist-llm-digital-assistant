and published public draft FIPS 201-3. The draft standard expands the set of PIV authenticators
beyond the current practices (including the current smart card form factor) while addressing
interagency use of new types of PIV authenticators (i.e., derived PIV credentials) via federation.
The revision also aims to facilitate the issuance of PIV cards by enabling remote identity proofing.
These changes closely align with M-19-17. For FY 2021, the PIV team will actively work on
resolving comments on the public draft while continuing outreach to federal stakeholders.

Digital Identity Guidelines
The four-volume set of NIST SP 800-63-3, Digital Identity Guidelines, was published in
June 2017. Following three years of federal agency experience implementing the controls
and requirements and to help stay ahead of potential online identity attacks, the Information
Technology Laboratory (ITL) decided to revise and update all volumes of SP 800-63-3.

NIST ITL published the pre-draft Request for Comments for the revision of SP 800-63-3 on
June 8, 2020. The Request for Comments identified nine topics for potential update.
Additionally, NIST ITL provided numerous virtual conferences and presentations on the
targeted topics for potential revision and other aspects of the Digital Identity Guidelines to
improve and focus the development and submission of comments. More than 40 federal
agencies and industry organizations responded with over 300 comments. ITL published a
public roadmap for key activities, milestones, and target dates for the development of SP
800-63, Revision 4, and published all comments received by the comment closing date. As
indicated in the roadmap, ITL plans to complete adjudication of comments received in the first
quarter of FY 2021 and will post issues for potential revision on GitHub in the second quarter.

Implementation Resources for NIST SP 800-63, Digital Identity Guidelines
In June 2020, NIST ITL published resources for applying NIST SP 800-63. Based on requests
from federal agencies and industry and on recommendations from the U.S. General
Accountability Office (GAO), NIST developed and published materials to provide non-
normative guidance for the implementation of SP 800-63A, Enrollment and Identity
Proo ing; SP 800-63B, Authentication and Lifecycle Management; and SP 800-63C,
Federation and Assertions. The guidance addresses key topics and aspects of each volume
to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the requirements for all assurance
levels. ITL presented information for federal agencies and industry to promote the use of the
implementation resources and discuss key topics, requirements, and controls and how to
properly implement them.

Conformance Criteria for NIST SP 800-63A and 800-63B
OMB Policy Memorandum M-19-17 updated federal identity, credentials, and access
management policy and provided direction for federal agencies to enhance
associated capabilities. The OMB Policy Memo assigned NIST the responsibility for developing
conformance criteria for accreditation of products and services to meet the designated levels
of assurance in SP 800-63-3. In response, NIST ITL developed the criteria for NIST SPs
800-63A and 800-63B.
