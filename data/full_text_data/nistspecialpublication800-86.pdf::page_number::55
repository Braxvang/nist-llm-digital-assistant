                                                     GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



     ! Running Processes. All UNIX-based systems offer the ps command for displaying currently
       running processes. Although Windows offers a graphical user interface (GUI)â€“based process list
       utility, the Task Manager, it is usually preferable to have a text-based listing. Third-party utilities
       can be used to generate a text list of running processes for Windows systems.
     ! Open Files. All UNIX-based systems offer the lsof command for displaying a list of open files.
       Third-party utilities can be used to generate text lists of open files for Windows systems.
     ! Login Sessions. Some OSs have built-in commands for listing the currently logged on users,
       such as the w command for UNIX systems, which also lists the source address of each user and
       when the user logged onto the system. Third-party utilities are available that can list currently
       connected users on Windows systems.
     ! Operating System Time. There are several utilities available for retrieving the current system
       time, time zone information, and daylight savings time settings. On UNIX systems, the date
       command can be used to retrieve this information. On Windows systems, the date, time, and
       nlsinfo commands can be used collectively to retrieve this information.
In addition to the tools in the preceding list, it is often useful to include some general-purpose tools in the
forensic toolkit, such as the following:
     ! OS Command Prompt. This utility provides an OS command prompt through which the other
       tools in the toolkit can be executed, such as cmd on Windows systems.
     ! SHA-1 Checksum. A utility that can compute the SHA-1 message digest of data files is helpful
       in file verification. It may also be useful to include in the toolkit a list of SHA-1 message digests
       for system data files associated with the target OS to assist in file verification. Utilities are
       available for various OSs for this purpose.70
     ! Directory List. A utility for listing the contents of directories should be included for navigating
       a filesystem and seeing its contents. Practically all OSs include such a utility; for example, the ls
       command is used on UNIX systems, whereas on Windows systems, the dir command is used.
     ! String Search. A utility for performing a text string search can be useful in identifying data files
       of interest. UNIX systems offer the grep command for performing text string searches, and a
       third-party grep utility is also available on Windows systems. 71
     ! Text Editor. A simple text editor can be useful for viewing text files or composing notes.
       Numerous text editors are available, such as Notepad on Windows systems and vi on UNIX
       systems.
5.2.1.3 Prioritizing Data Collection

The types of volatile data that should be collected with the toolkit depend on the specific need. For
instance, if a network intrusion is suspected, it might be useful to collect network configuration
information, network connections, login sessions, and running processes to determine how someone
gained access to a system. If an investigation concerns identity theft, then the contents of RAM, the list
of running processes, the list of open files, network configuration information, and network connections
might reveal social security and credit card numbers, programs used to obtain or encrypt data, password
hashes, and methods that might have been used to obtain the information over a network. When in doubt,
it is usually a good idea to collect as much volatile data as possible because all opportunities to collect
