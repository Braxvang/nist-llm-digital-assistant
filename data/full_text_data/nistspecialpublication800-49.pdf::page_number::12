       Note: Newer versions of DSA will become available with support for key sizes greater
       than 1024 bits. New standards for D-H and AES usage are anticipated to require the use
       of the SHA-256 hash algorithm. The SHA-256 algorithm is now available in draft form.

Related recommendations on public key sizes:
       • If an implementation supports AES in conjunction with RSA, the implementation
           SHOULD also support RSA public key sizes greater than 1024 bits.
       • If an implementation supports AES in conjunction with D-H, the implementation
           SHOULD also support D-H public key sizes greater than 1024 bits.
       • If an implementation supports public key sizes greater than 1024 bits when using
           either DSA or RSA for digital signature, the implementation SHOULD also support
           SHA-256.

Additional algorithm suites will be identified in the future.

Note: The current Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) defined in [FIPS186-2] uses a key size of
at least 1024 bits. Future versions of FIPS 186 will be defined to allow for key sizes of 1024 bits
or longer.

Support of additional algorithm suites, especially using other FIPS approved algorithms (e.g., the
Elliptical Curve Digital Signature Algorithm ECDSA [ANSIX9.62]) or other FIPS approved
algorithms [FIPS140-1] or [FIPS140-2], is encouraged to promote interoperability and backward
compatibility.

However, some older and weaker algorithm suites should be avoided and not trusted. For
example, the MD2 message digest algorithm and 512 bit RSA are now considered to be weak by
many cryptographers.

Further information on cryptographic algorithm suites is provided in Appendix A.

2.1.1.3 Key Wrap Specifications
In S/MIME V3, management of symmetric cryptographic keys often leads to situations where
one symmetric key is used to encrypt (or wrap) another (e.g., sending enveloped data to several
recipients). In situations where Triple-DES [FIPS46-3] is used for symmetric key encryption
and key wrapping is required, the method for encoding the key wrap is as specified in
[RFC3217] (or its successor document) MUST be used. In situations where AES [FIPS197] is
used for symmetric key encryption and key wrapping is required, the method for encoding the
key wrap as specified in [RFC3394] MUST be used.

2.1.2 PKI Profile Conformance
In order to help ensure that S/MIME V3 implementations interoperate securely, it is useful to
adopt a profile of the X.509 standard. The most widely accepted PKI profile is the IETF Public
Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) profile developed by the PKIX working group. The
PKIX profile [RFC3280] identifies the format and semantics of certificates and CRLs for use on
the Internet. Procedures are described for processing and validating certification paths in the
Internet environment. The PKIX profile has also been adopted by the Federal PKI Technical
