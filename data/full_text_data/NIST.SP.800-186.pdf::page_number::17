   Recommended Curves for U.S. Federal Government Use
This section specifies the elliptic curves recommended for U.S. Federal Government use and
contains choices for the private key length and underlying fields. This includes elliptic curves
over prime fields (Section 3.2) and elliptic curves over binary fields (Section 3.3), where each
curve takes one of the forms described in Section 3 (referred to as ‚ÄúType‚Äù below).
Each recommended curve is uniquely defined by its domain parameters D, which indicate the
field GF(q) over which the elliptic curve is defined, the parameters of its defining equation, and
principal parameters, such as the cofactor h of the curve, the order n of its prime-order subgroup,
and a designated point G on the curve of order n (i.e., the ‚Äúbase point‚Äù). In the case ùëûùëû = 2ùëöùëö , the
domain parameters also include a description of the representation chosen for GF(q).
For details regarding the generation method of the elliptic curves, see Appendix C.

       Choices of Key Lengths, Underlying Fields, Curves, and Base Points

3.1.1. Choice of Key Lengths
The principal parameters for elliptic curve cryptography are the elliptic curve E and a designated
point G on E called the base point. The base point has order n, which is a large prime. The
number of points on the curve is h‚ãÖn for some integer h (the cofactor), which is not divisible by
n. For efficiency reasons, it is desirable for the cofactor to be small.
All of the curves given below have cofactors 1, 2, 4, or 8. As a result, the private and public keys
for a curve are approximately the same length.

3.1.2. Choice of Underlying Fields
For each key length, two kinds of fields are provided:
   1. A prime field is the field GF(p), which contains a prime number p of elements. The
      elements of this field are the integers modulo p, and the field arithmetic is implemented
      in terms of the arithmetic of integers modulo p.
   2. A binary field is the field GF(2m), which contains 2m elements for some m (called the
      degree of the field). The elements of this field are the bit strings of length m, and the field
      arithmetic is implemented in terms of operations on the bits.
The approximate security strengths for the elliptic curves specified in this document are given in
Table 1. The security strength of an elliptic curve is directly related to the order of the basepoint.
In general, if an elliptic curve has a basepoint of order n, then the security strength will be
approximately one half of the bit length of n.
