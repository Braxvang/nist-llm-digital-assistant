performance, and effectiveness. The objective is to limit uncertainty and thereby manage risk.
Systems engineering is outcome-oriented and leverages engineering processes to realize a system
while effectively managing complexity and serving as the principal integrating mechanism for
the technical, management, and support activities related to the engineering effort. Finally,
systems engineering is data- and analytics-driven to ensure that all decisions and trades are
guided and informed by data produced by analyses conducted with an appropriate level of
fidelity and rigor.

Systems engineering efforts are complex, system-specific, and context-dependent, 14 requiring
close coordination between the engineering team and stakeholders throughout the system life
cycle stages. 15 While systems engineering is typically considered in terms of its developmental
role as part of capability acquisition, systems engineering efforts and responsibilities do not end
once a system completes development and is transitioned to the operational environment for day-
to-day use. Stakeholders responsible for the system’s utilization, support, and retirement provide
data to the systems engineering team on an ongoing basis. This data captures the experiences,
problems, and issues associated with the operation, maintenance, and sustainment of the system.
Stakeholders also advise the engineering team on system enhancements and improvements made
or desired. In addition, field engineering provides on-site, full-system life cycle engineering
support for operations, maintenance, and sustainment organizations.

There are many additional resources available that provide more in-depth examinations of
systems engineering. 16 Such discussions are beyond the scope of this publication.

           Trust and Trustworthiness
The concepts of trust and trustworthiness are foundational to engineering trustworthy secure
systems, to the decisions made to grant trust, and to the extent that trust is granted based on
demonstrated trustworthiness. Trust is a belief that an entity meets certain expectations and can
be relied upon. The terms belief and can imply that trust may be granted to an entity whether the
entity is trustworthy or not. A trustworthy entity is one for which sufficient evidence exists to
support its claimed trustworthiness. Thus, trustworthiness is the demonstrated ability and,
therefore, the worthiness of an entity to be trusted to satisfy expectations, including satisfying
expectations in the face of adversity. Since trustworthiness is something demonstrated, it is based
on evidence that supports a claim or judgment of an entity being worthy of trust [2] [20] [21].

Since trust is not necessarily based on a judgment of trustworthiness, the decision to trust an
entity should consider the significance (i.e., consequences, effects, and impacts) of expectations
not being fulfilled because of non-performance – whether due to incompetence, deficiency, or

   The International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) notes in [14] that “systems engineering in application is specific to stakeholder
needs, solution space, resulting system solution(s), and context throughout the system life cycle” and "systems engineering influences and is
influenced by internal and external resource, political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal factors.”

   Nomenclature for stages of the system life cycle varies but often includes concept analysis; solution analysis; technology maturation; system
design and development; engineering and manufacturing development; production and deployment; training, operations, and support; and
retirement and disposal.

   INCOSE offers a systems engineering handbook [15] and Systems Engineering Book of Knowledge [13] as general resources. The National
Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) also offers systems engineering material as it is applied within the NASA community.
Publications include the NASA Systems Engineering Handbook [17] and two volumes of expanded systems engineering guidance [18] [19].
