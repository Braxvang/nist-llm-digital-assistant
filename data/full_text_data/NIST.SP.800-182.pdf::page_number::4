This publication has been developed by NIST in accordance with its statutory responsibilities under the Federal
Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, 44 U.S.C. § 3541 et seq., Public Law (P.L.) 113-283. NIST
is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements
for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems
without the express approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems. This
guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130.

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should these guidelines
be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of
the OMB, or any other federal official. This publication may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a
voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright in the United States. Attribution would, however, be appreciated
by NIST.
