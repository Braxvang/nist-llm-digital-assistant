The third component is developing and establishing quantifiable performance measures that are
designed to capture and provide meaningful performance data. To provide meaningful data,
quantifiable information security measures must be based on information security performance
goals and objectives, and be easily obtainable and feasible to measure. They must also be
repeatable, provide relevant performance trends over time, and be useful for tracking
performance and directing resources.

Finally, the information security measurement program itself must emphasize consistent periodic
analysis of the measures data. Results of this analysis are used to apply lessons learned, improve
effectiveness of existing security controls, and plan for the implementation of future security
controls to meet new information security requirements as they occur. Accurate data collection
must be a priority with stakeholders and users if the collected data is to be meaningful and useful
in improving the overall information security program.

The success of an information security program implementation should be judged by the degree
to which meaningful results are produced. A comprehensive information security measurement
program should provide substantive justification for decisions that directly affect the information
security posture of an organization. These decisions include budget and personnel requests and
allocation of available resources. An information security measurement program should assist in
the preparation of required reports relating to information security performance.

1.5       Relationship to Other NIST Documents

This document is a continuation in a series of NIST special publications intended to assist
information management and information security personnel in the establishment,
implementation, and maintenance of an information security program. It focuses on quantifying
information security performance based on the results of a variety of information security
activities. This approach draws upon many sources of data, including:

      •   Information security assessment and testing efforts such as those described in NIST SP
          800-53A, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems;
      •   Information security risk assessments efforts, such as those described in NIST SP 800-30,
          Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems; and
      •   Minimum security controls recommended in NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security
          Controls for Federal Information Systems.

NIST SP 800-55, Revision 1, differs from NIST SP 800-53A in that it provides a quantitative
approach to measuring and analyzing security controls implementation and effectiveness at the
information system and program levels, aggregated across multiple individual efforts. It also
provides an approach for aggregating information from multiple information systems to measure
and analyze information security from an enterprise-level perspective. NIST SP 800-53A
provides procedures for assessing if the security controls are implemented and operating as
intended according to the information system security plan for the system. The assessment data
produced as a result of applying NIST SP 800-53A assessment procedures can serve as a data
source for information security measurement.
