Appendix C—Glossary

Selected terms used in this publication are defined below.

Active Content: Electronic documents that can carry out or trigger actions automatically on a computer
platform without the intervention of a user.

Attack: The realization of some specific threat that impacts the confidentiality, integrity, accountability,
or availability of a computational resource.

Buffer Overflow: A condition at an interface under which more input can be placed into a buffer or data
holding area than the capacity allocated, overwriting other information. Attackers exploit such a
condition to crash a system or to insert specially crafted code that allows them to gain control of the
system.

Cookie: A piece of state information supplied by a Web server to a browser, in a response for a
requested resource, for the browser to store temporarily and return to the server on any subsequent visits
or requests.

Interpreter: A program that processes a script or other program expression and carries out the requested
action, in accordance with the language definition.

Macro Virus: A specific type of computer virus that is encoded as a macro embedded in some document
and activated when the document is handled.

Malicious Code: A program that is written intentionally to carry out annoying or harmful actions, which
includes Trojan horses, viruses, and worms.

Malware: A program that is inserted into a system, usually covertly, with the intent of compromising the
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim’s data, applications, or operating system or of
otherwise annoying or disrupting the victim.

Mobile Code: A program (e.g., script, macro, or other portable instruction) that can be shipped
unchanged to a heterogeneous collection of platforms and executed with identical semantics.

Risk: A measure of the likelihood and the consequence of events or acts that could cause a system
compromise, including the unauthorized disclosure, destruction, removal, modification, or interruption of
system assets.

Safeguard: An approved security measure taken to protect computational resources by eliminating or
reducing the risk to a system, which may include hardware and software mechanisms, policies,
procedures, and physical controls.

Script: A sequence of instructions, ranging from a simple list of operating system commands to full-
blown programming language statements, which can be executed automatically by an interpreter.

Scripting Language: A definition of the syntax and semantics for writing and interpreting scripts.

Spyware: A program embedded within an application that collects information and periodically
communicates back to its home site, unbeknownst to the user.
