      NIST SP 800-171Ar3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                 Assessing CUI Security Requirements
      November 2023

339   Assessment methods define the nature and extent of the assessor’s actions and are used to
340   facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence. The potential assessment
341   methods include examine, interview, and test. The examine method is the process of reviewing,
342   studying, inspecting, observing, or analyzing assessment objects. The interview method is the
343   process of holding discussions with individuals or groups about assessment objects. The test
344   method is the process of exercising assessment objects (i.e., activities, mechanisms) under
345   specified conditions to compare actual with expected behavior. Assessment methods include
346   attributes of depth and coverage, which define the rigor, scope, and level of effort for the
347   assessment as well as the degree of assurance that the security requirements have been satisfied.

348   The structure and content of a typical assessment procedure are provided in the example below:

349   3.1.8 Unsuccessful Logon Attempts                     Security Requirement Name

350         REQUIREMENT: 03.01.08

351         ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
352         Determine if:
353         A.03.01.08.ODP[01]: the number of consecutive invalid logon             Multi-Part Determination Statement
354         attempts by a user allowed during a time period is defined.             for Security Requirement and ODPs

355         A.03.01.08.ODP[02]: the time period to which the number of
356         consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user is limited is defined.
357         A.03.01.08: the number of consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user during
358         <03.01.08.ODP[02]: time period> is limited to <A.03.01.08.ODP[01]: number>.

359         ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
360         Examine
361         [SELECT FROM: access control policy and procedures; procedures for unsuccessful logon attempts;
362         system design documentation; system audit records; system configuration settings; system security plan;
363         other relevant documents or records]
364         Interview
365         [SELECT FROM: personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers; system
366         administrators]
367         Test
368         [SELECT FROM: mechanisms implementing access control policy for unsuccessful logon attempts]

371   Determination statements have alphanumeric identifiers. Each determination statement begins
372   with the letter “A” to indicate that it is part of an assessment procedure. The next sequence of
373   numbers and/or letters (e.g., 03.01.01.e or 03.01.01.f.02) indicates the security requirement
374   identifier from SP 800-171 (and the specific control item if it is a multi-part requirement) that is
375   the target of the assessment. Organization-defined parameters are indicated by the letters “ODP.”
376   If there are multiple ODPs in the determination statement, the ODP number is indicated in a
377   square bracket (e.g., A.03.01.08.ODP[01]). Square brackets are also used to denote when an
378   assessment procedure further decomposes a requirement into more granular determination
379   statements (e.g., A.03.01.12.a[01], A.03.01.12.a[02], A.03.01.12.a[03]).
