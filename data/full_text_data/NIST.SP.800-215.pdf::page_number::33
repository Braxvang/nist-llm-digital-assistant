NIST SP 800-215                                                            Guide to a Secure Enterprise
November 2022                                                                      Network Landscape

       applications, supply chain applications) and allocate routing priorities and WAN
       resources accordingly.
   •   Integration of security and networking functions: Use of appliances that contain a
       combination of networking and security functions (e.g., the presence of a firewall and
       secure web gateway [SWG] functions in a WAN router) [36]
   •   Centralized visibility and management capabilities: Includes the ability to recognize and
       authenticate newly connected appliances and bring them under the defined management
       workflows as nodes so as to configure a uniform set of policies that cover all components
   •   Integration with remote LAN locations: An additional preferred but non-essential feature
       is the integration of WAN and LAN functions in a single appliance (the latter going by
       the name SD-Branch), which can be managed using a single management console, thus
       providing better visibility into both components. This feature enables the connectivity of
       SD-WAN into the local LAN at the remote branch offices.

       Specific Requirements for SD-WANs for Cloud Access
Enterprises can gain cloud access in two ways: 1) through the VPN services provided by the
cloud providers or 2) by integrating their own SD-WAN with cloud providers’ private networks,
often called the cloud WAN. In both scenarios, it is possible for enterprises to enforce their
enterprise networking and security policies even though the endpoint resources are located in a
cloud provider’s private network.
   •   In the first scenario, cloud access is enabled by the availability of the feature provided by
       many CSPs for each subscriber to establish their own private subnets and a networking
       connection between two of those private subnets (e.g., VPC peering). It is then possible
       for resources (e.g., VM instances) in either of the private subnets to communicate with
       each other as if they are within the same network.
   •   In the second scenario (i.e., connectivity through SD-WAN), the same feature can be
       availed of once inside the CSP network. In addition, further orchestration of the cloud
       provider’s private network can be achieved by designing a customized overlay network
       on top of the cloud provider’s network with the latter as the underlay network. This
       feature is contingent upon CSPs offering API integrations for different SD-WAN
       offerings [38][39][40].
The overall advantages of being able to orchestrate the CSP private network for the subscriber
enterprise are:
   •   Complete end-to-end visibility between the “access endpoint” and IT resource
       (application or data) endpoint even though the latter is located in a cloud provider’s
       network
   •   Application of the network segmentation logic deployed for accessing on-premises
       resources to the cloud-based resources [37]
