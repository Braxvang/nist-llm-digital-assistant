Special Publication 800-157                                          Guidelines for Derived PIV Credentials


       authentication mechanism was completed, strong linkage (e.g., using a temporary secret) must be
       established between the two sessions. The issuer shall verify that the Derived PIV Credential is for
       the same Subscriber that authenticated using the PIV Card. The remote password reset shall be
       completed over a protected session (e.g., using TLS).

Removable hardware tokens shall support the password reset functionality as per Appendix B. At LOA-3
support for password reset is not required, and implementations may instead choose to issue a new
certificate following the initial issuance process if the password is forgotten.
