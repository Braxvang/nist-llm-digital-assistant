       NIST SP 800-63C-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                                       Federation and Assertions


1323   since the attacker would need to steal the bound authenticator as well as the assertion and
1324   be able to present them together. Furthermore, use of a bound authenticator protects the
1325   RP against malicious or compromised IdPs through the use of independent authentication.
1326   A bound authenticator SHALL be unique per subscriber at the RP such that two
1327   subscribers cannot present the same authenticator for their separate RP subscriber
1328   accounts. All bound authenticators SHALL be phishing resistant. Consequently,
1329   subscriber-chosen values such as a memorized secret cannot be used as bound
1330   authenticators. The RP SHALL accept authentication from a bound authenticator only in
1331   the context of processing an assertion. Consequently, the subscriber can not use a bound
1332   authenticator to log into the RP directly, bypassing the IdP in the process.
1333   A bound authenticator can be managed by either the IdP or the RP under different
1334   circumstances, as detailed in the sections below. An FAL3 assertion contains an
1335   indication of whether the IdP expects the subscriber to present a specific IdP-managed
1336   bound authenticator or an RP-managed bound authenticator at the RP to reach FAL3.

1337   6.1.2.1. IdP-Managed Bound Authenticators
1338   When the bound authenticator is managed by the IdP as in Fig. 9, a unique identifier for
1339   the authenticator (such as its public key) SHALL be included in the assertion presented to
1340   the RP. The RP SHALL prompt the subscriber to prove possession of the identified bound
1341   authenticator.
1342   An IdP-managed bound authenticator MAY be distinct from the primary authenticator
1343   the subscriber uses to authenticate to the IdP. Bound authenticators managed at the IdP
1344    SHALL be phishing resistant and SHALL be independently dereferenceable by the RP
1345   based on a mutually-trusted security framework, such as a public-key infrastructure.
1346   When processing an IdP-managed bound authenticator for the first time, the RP SHOULD
1347   verify whether the authenticator being presented is appropriate to be associated with
1348   the subscriber account, such as through account resolution from the attributes in the
1349   authenticator’s presented information.
1350   For example, a subscriber could have a smart card loaded with a certificate, which is a
1351   multi-factor cryptographic device. Since the certificate can be presented to both the IdP
1352   and the RP, the IdP can include an identifier for the certificate in the FAL3 assertion to the
1353   RP. The RP would then prompt the subscriber to present the certificate from their smart
1354   card in order to reach FAL3.
1355   “Holder of Key” (HoK) assertions are one example of IdP-managed bound authenticators,
1356   since the IdP knows the subscriber’s key to be used at the RP and includes the key
1357   information in the assertion presented to the RP.
