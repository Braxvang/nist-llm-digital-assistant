Spelling and punctuation should be checked when information is provided during the CSR generation
process. The URL that is supplied must exactly match the URL for which the certificate is used.
SSL/TLS clients are configured to generate an error if the URLs do not match. In some instances, a user
may acknowledge this error in an alert box and proceed.

Once the CSR has been generated, the organization submits it to a CA. The CA’s role is to fulfill the
CSR by authenticating the requesting entity and verifying the entity’s signature. If the request is valid,
the CA constructs an X.509 certificate from the domain name (DN) and public key; the issuer name (more
commonly referred to as the common name [CN]); and the CA’s choice of serial number, validity period,
or signature algorithm. Upon receiving a submitted CSR, the CA must verify the CSR and create a
signed X.509 certificate. At this point, most CAs will then alert the applicant by telephone, e-mail, etc.,
that the X.509 certificate is available. Once notified, applicants will be able to download their certificates
through an SSL/TLS-protected Web-based interface.

Figure 7-3 shows an X.509 certificate encoded in PEM format. Similar to the CSR, when supplying a
certificate to a configuration wizard or even saving it to a hard drive, the lines “BEGIN CERTIFICATE”
and “END CERTIFICATE” are vital. Without them, the Web server application will be unable to
interpret the encoded contents of the certificate.
