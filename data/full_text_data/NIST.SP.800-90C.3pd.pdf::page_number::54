       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                                                       Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

1483          2. For the Hash_DRBG, HMAC_DRBG and CTR_DRBG (with a derivation function),
1484             replace the Get_randomness-sourceinput call in the Reseed_function with the
1485             following: 26
1486                      a) If the consuming application requires full entropy in the returned bitstring, the
1487                         Get_randomness-source_input call is replaced by:
1488                                (status, Full_entropy_bitstring) = Get_conditioned_full_entropy_input(s).
1489                      b) If the consuming application does not require full entropy in the returned bitstring,
1490                         the Get_randomness-source_input call is replaced by:
1491                                                   (status, entropy_bitstring) = Get_ES_Bitstring(s).
1492                Validated physical and/or non-physical entropy sources shall be used to provide the
1493                requested entropy. For an RBG2(P) construction, the requested s bits of entropy shall be
1494                counted as specified in Method 1 27 of Section 2.3. For an RBG2(NP) construction, the
1495                requested s bits of entropy shall be counted as specified in Method 2 28 of Section 2.3.

1496                RBG2 Requirements
1497   An RBG2 construction has the following requirements in addition to those specified in [SP800-
1498   90A]:
1499          1. The RBG shall employ an approved and validated DRBG from [SP800-90A] whose
1500             components are capable of providing the targeted security strength for the RBG.
1501          2. The RBG and its components shall be successfully validated for compliance with [SP800-
1502             90A], [SP800-90B], SP 800-90C, [FIPS140], and the specification of any other approved
1503             algorithm used within the RBG, as appropriate.
1504          3. The RBG may include a reseed capability. If implemented, the reseeding of the DRBG
1505             shall be performed either a) upon request from a consuming application (either an explicit
1506             request for reseeding or a request for the generation of bits with prediction resistance); b)
1507             on a fixed schedule based on time, number of outputs, or events; and/or c) as sufficient
1508             entropy becomes available.
1509          4. Validated entropy sources shall be used to instantiate and reseed the DRBG. A non-
1510             validated entropy sources shall not be used for this purpose.
1511          5. The entropy sources used for the instantiation and reseeding of an RBG(P) construction
1512             shall include one or more validated physical entropy sources; the inclusion of one or more
1513             validated non-physical entropy sources is optional. A bitstring that contains entropy shall
1514             be assembled and the entropy in that bitstring determined as specified in Method 1 of
1515             Section 2.3 (i.e., only the entropy provided by validated physical entropy sources shall be
1516             counted toward fulfilling the amount of entropy in an entropy request).


       26
            See Sections 2.8.2.2 and 3.1 for discussions of the Get_ES_bitstring function.
       27
            Method 1 only counts the entropy provided by validated physical sources.
       28
            Method 2 counts the entropy provided by both physical and non-physical entropy sources.
