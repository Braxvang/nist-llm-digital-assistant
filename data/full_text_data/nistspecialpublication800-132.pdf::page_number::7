SP 800-132        Recommendation for Password-Based Key Derivation         December 2010



Key derivation         In this Recommendation, key derivation is the process of deriving
                       keying material from a key or password.
Keying material        A binary string, such that any non-overlapping segments of the
                       string with the required lengths can be used as symmetric
                       cryptographic keys.
Master key             In this Recommendation, a master key is the keying material that is
                       output from an execution of the PBKDF.
Message (Data)         A mechanism to provide assurance of the origin and integrity of a
authentication         message.
Message                A cryptographic checksum that is generated on data using a
authentication code    cryptographic algorithm that is parameterized by a symmetric key.
                       The message authentication code is designed to provide data origin
                       authentication and detect both accidental errors and the intentional
                       modification of the data. Also called an authentication tag.
Password               A character string known only by a specific entity (e.g., a user)
                       that is used to authenticate the identity of a computer system user
                       and/or to authorize access to system resources. In this
                       Recommendation, a password is used to derive keying material.
Passphrase             A collection of words (typically more than 20 characters), that is
                       used to authenticate the identity of a computer system user and/or
                       to authorize access to system resources. In this Recommendation,
                       when “passphrase” is not mentioned with “password”, the use of
                       “passphrase” is implied.
Protect data           To encrypt, authenticate, or both encrypt and authenticate data.
Pseudorandom           A function that can be used to generate output from a random seed
Function               and a data variable, such that the output is computationally
                       indistinguishable from truly random output.
Recover data           To decrypt ciphertext data and/or to verify the authenticity of data.
Salt                   A non-secret binary value that is used as an input to the key
                       derivation function PBKDF specified in this Recommendation to
                       allow the generation of a large set of keys for a given password.
Shall                  This term is used to indicate a requirement that must be fulfilled to
                       claim conformance to this Recommendation. Note that shall may
                       be coupled with not to become shall not.
