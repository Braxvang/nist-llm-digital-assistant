3.      PII Confidentiality Impact Levels

This publication focuses on protecting PII from losses of confidentiality. The security objective of
confidentiality is defined by law as ―preserving authorized restrictions on information access and
disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information.‖ 27

The security objectives of integrity and availability are equally important for PII, and organizations
should use the NIST Risk Management Framework28 to determine the appropriate integrity and
availability impact levels. Organizations may also need to consider PII-specific enhancements to the
integrity or availability impact levels. Accuracy is a required Fair Information Practice for most PII, and
the security objective of integrity helps to ensure accuracy. Integrity is also important for preventing
harm to the individual and the organization. For example, unauthorized alterations of medical records
could endanger individuals‘ lives, and medical mistakes based on inaccurate information can result in
liability to the organization and harm to its reputation.

The confidentiality of PII should be protected based on its impact level. This section outlines factors for
determining the PII confidentiality impact level for a particular instance of PII, which is distinct from the
confidentiality impact level described in Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication
199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems.29 The PII
confidentiality impact level takes into account additional PII considerations and should be used to
determine if additional protections should be implemented. The PII confidentiality impact level—low,
moderate, or high—indicates the potential harm that could result to the subject individuals and/or the
organization if PII were inappropriately accessed, used, or disclosed. Once the PII confidentiality impact
level is selected, it should be used to supplement the provisional confidentiality impact level, which is
determined from information and system categorization processes outlined in FIPS 199 and NIST Special
Publication (SP) 800-60, Volumes 1 and 2: Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information
Systems to Security Categories.30 Supplementation of the provisional confidentiality impact level should
be included in the documentation of the security categorization process.

Some PII does not need to have its confidentiality protected, such as information that the organization has
permission or authority to release publicly (e.g., an organization publishing a phone directory of
employees‘ names and work phone numbers so that members of the public can contact them directly). In
this case, the PII confidentiality impact level would be not applicable and would not be used to
supplement a system‘s provisional confidentiality impact level. PII that does not require confidentiality
protection may still require other security controls to protect the integrity and the availability of the
information, and the organization should provide appropriate security controls based on the assigned FIPS
199 impact levels.

3.1     Impact Level Definitions

The harm caused from a breach of confidentiality should be considered when attempting to determine
which PII confidentiality impact level corresponds to a specific set of PII. For the purposes of this
document, harm means any adverse effects that would be experienced by an individual whose PII was the
subject of a loss of confidentiality, as well as any adverse effects experienced by the organization that
maintains the PII. Harm to an individual includes any negative or unwanted effects (i.e., that may be
socially, physically, or financially damaging). Examples of types of harm to individuals include, but are
