For example, the SIM applications file system is composed of three types of elements: the root
of the file system (MF), subordinate directory files (DF), and files containing elementary data
(EF). Figure 3 illustrates the structure of the file system. The EFs under DFGSM and DFDCS1800
contain mainly network related information for different frequency bands of operation. The
EFs under DFTELECOM contain service related information.

Various types of digital evidence may exist in elementary data files scattered throughout the
file system and be recovered from a UICC. Some of the same information held in the UICC
may be maintained in the memory of the mobile device and encountered there as well. Besides
the standard files defined in the GSM specifications, a UICC may contain non-standard files
established by the network operator. Several general categories of data may be found in
standard elementary data files of a UICC are as follows:

       Service-related Information including unique identifiers for the UICC, the Integrated
        Circuit Card Identification (ICCID) and the International Mobile Subscriber Identity
        (IMSI)

       Phonebook and call information known respectively as the Abbreviated Dialing
        Numbers (ADN) and Last Numbers Dialed (LND)

       Messaging information including both Short Message Service (SMS) text messages
        and Enhanced Messaging Service (EMS) simple multimedia messages

       The USIM application supports the storage of links to incoming (EFICI) and outgoing
        (EFOCI) calls. The EFICI and EFOCI are each stored using two bytes. The first byte
