      also be protected depending on implementation. Nevertheless, the number of packets being
      exchanged can be counted.
 Access Control. IPsec and SSL endpoints can perform filtering to ensure that only authorized users
  can access particular network resources. IPsec and SSL endpoints can also allow or block certain
  types of network traffic, such as allowing Web server access but denying file sharing.
2.2     Virtual Private Networking (VPN)

A VPN is a virtual network, built on top of existing physical networks, that can provide a secure
communications mechanism for data and other information transmitted between networks. Because a
VPN can be used over existing networks, such as the Internet, it can facilitate the secure transfer of
sensitive data across public networks. This is often less expensive than alternatives such as dedicated
private telecommunications lines between organizations or branch offices. VPNs can also provide
flexible solutions, such as securing communications between remote telecommuters and the
organization’s servers, regardless of where the telecommuters are located. A VPN can even be
established within a single network to protect particularly sensitive communications from other parties on
the same network.

It is important to understand that VPNs do not remove all risk from networking. While VPNs can greatly
reduce risk, particularly for communications that occur over public networks, they cannot eliminate all
risk for such communications. One potential problem is the strength of the implementation. For
example, flaws in an encryption algorithm or the software implementing the algorithm could allow
attackers to decrypt intercepted traffic; random number generators that do not produce sufficiently
random values could provide additional attack possibilities. Another issue is encryption key disclosure;
an attacker who discovers a key could not only decrypt traffic but potentially also pose as a legitimate
user. Another area of risk involves availability. A common model for information assurance is based on
the concepts of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Although VPNs are designed to support
confidentiality and integrity, they generally do not improve availability, the ability for authorized users to
access systems as needed. In fact, many VPN implementations actually tend to decrease availability
somewhat, because they add more components and services to the existing network infrastructure. This is
highly dependent upon the chosen VPN architecture model and the details of the implementation.

The following sections describe the two primary types of SSL VPNs: SSL portal VPNs and SSL tunnel
VPNs. (There is a third type, SSL gateway-to-gateway VPNs, that is available in some implementations.
These are rarely used because they have very similar features to IPsec VPNs but less flexibility; they are
therefore not discussed in this document.) Both types of SSL VPNs are typically used to provide remote
users access to multiple services controlled and administered by the SSL VPN gateway.

SSL VPN gateways are sometimes single-purpose hardware systems that contain the software needed to
perform the SSL VPN tasks. In other cases, firewall and router hardware systems contain SSL VPN
capabilities and thus become SSL VPN gateways when those capabilities are turned on in the system’s
administrative interface.

It should be noted that, although there are standards for the TLS protocol, there are currently no standards
for any type of SSL VPN. 5 For example, SSL VPN features such as access control and endpoint security
have not been standardized. Thus, the descriptions here are based on common implementations of SSL
VPNs at the time this document was being prepared.
