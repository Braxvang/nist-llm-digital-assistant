GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



         an incorrect network configuration, resolving a functional problem with an application, and
         recording and reviewing the current OS and application configuration settings for a host.
    ! Log Monitoring. Various tools and techniques can assist in log monitoring, such as analyzing
      log entries and correlating log entries across multiple systems. This can assist in incident
      handling, identifying policy violations, auditing, and other efforts.
    ! Data Recovery. There are dozens of tools that can recover lost data from systems, including data
      that has been accidentally or purposely deleted or otherwise modified. The amount of data that
      can be recovered varies on a case-by-case basis.
    ! Data Acquisition. Some organizations use forensics tools to acquire data from hosts that are
      being redeployed or retired. For example, when a user leaves an organization, the data from the
      user’s workstation can be acquired and stored in case it is needed in the future. The workstation’s
      media can then be sanitized to remove all of the original user’s data.
    ! Due Diligence/Regulatory Compliance. Existing and emerging regulations require many
      organizations to protect sensitive information and maintain certain records for audit purposes.
      Also, when protected information is exposed to other parties, organizations may be required to
      notify other agencies or impacted individuals. Forensics can help organizations exercise due
      diligence and comply with such requirements.
Regardless of the situation, the forensic process comprises the following basic phases:4

    ! Collection. The first phase in the process is to identify, label, record, and acquire data from the
      possible sources of relevant data, while following guidelines and procedures that preserve the
      integrity of the data. Collection is typically performed in a timely manner because of the
      likelihood of losing dynamic data such as current network connections, as well as losing data
      from battery-powered devices (e.g., cell phones, PDAs).
    ! Examination. Examinations involve forensically processing large amounts of collected data
      using a combination of automated and manual methods to assess and extract data of particular
      interest, while preserving the integrity of the data.
    ! Analysis. The next phase of the process is to analyze the results of the examination, using legally
      justifiable methods and techniques, to derive useful information that addresses the questions that
      were the impetus for performing the collection and examination.
    ! Reporting. The final phase is reporting the results of the analysis, which may include describing
      the actions used, explaining how tools and procedures were selected, determining what other
      actions need to be performed (e.g., forensic examination of additional data sources, securing
      identified vulnerabilities, improving existing security controls), and providing recommendations
      for improvement to policies, guidelines, procedures, tools, and other aspects of the forensic
      process. The formality of the reporting step varies greatly depending on the situation.
A more in-depth discussion of the forensic process is presented in Section 3. Sections 4 through 7
provide additional information on collecting, examining, and analyzing different types of forensic data.

    There are many models for the forensic process. Although the exact phases of the models vary somewhat, the models reflect
    the same basic principles and the same overall methodology. Models differ primarily in how granular each phase of the
    process is and in the terms used for specific phases. The model presented in this guide offers a simple way of looking at the
    phases. Organizations should choose the specific forensic model that is most appropriate for their needs.
