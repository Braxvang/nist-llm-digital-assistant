9.        IDPS Product Selection

This section provides guidance on selecting IDPS products. It first discusses the identification of general
requirements that the IDPS products should meet. Next, it provides sets of criteria that can be used to
evaluate four aspects of IDPS technologies: security capabilities, performance, management, and life
cycle cost. Finally, the section concludes with a brief discussion of performing hands-on and paper
evaluations of products, and when each evaluation technique is most appropriate. This section assumes
that an organization has already determined that a particular type of IDPS technology—network-based,
wireless, network behavior analysis (NBA), or host-based—is needed. A comparison of the technology
types, which can be helpful for selecting the one most appropriate for a particular need, is provided in
Section 8.

Organizations should use risk management techniques to identify the security controls necessary to
mitigate risk to an acceptable level. Although it may be tempting to simply choose a product, using a risk
management process to choose the most effective blend of controls enhances an organization’s security
posture. An explanation of the risk management process is outside the scope of this document; NIST SP
800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems, contains additional information on
it.

9.1       General Requirements

Before evaluating IDPS products, organizations should first define the general requirements that the IDPS
solution and products should meet. The features provided by IDPS products and the methodologies that
they use vary considerably, so a product that best meets one organization’s requirements might not be
suitable for meeting another organization’s requirements. Also, a single IDPS product might not be able
to meet all of an organization’s requirements for a particular type of IDPS technology (e.g., network-
based), necessitating the use of multiple IDPS products of the same technology type. This is most
common for large environments and for environments in which IDPS technologies serve multiple
operational purposes.

9.1.1      System and Network Environments

Evaluators first need to understand the characteristics of the organization’s system and network
environments, so that an IDPS can be selected that will be compatible with them and able to monitor the
events of interest on the systems and/or networks. This knowledge is also needed to design the IDPS
solution and determine how many components (e.g., sensors, agents) will be needed and where they will
be deployed (e.g., which systems will run IDPS agents, which network segments will be monitored).
Characteristics to consider include the following:

 Technical specifications of the IT environment. Examples are as follows:

      –    Network diagrams and maps specifying the architecture (both logical and geographical) of the
           network, including all connections to other networks, and the number and locations of hosts

      –    The operating systems (OS), network services, and applications run by each host that might need
           to be protected by the IDPS 51

      –    The attributes of non-security systems with which the IDPS might need to be integrated, such as
           network management systems.

51
      In some cases, particularly for some host-based IDPSs, it may also be necessary to identify the application versions that
      need to be protected, so that it can be confirmed that the IDPS provides support for those versions.
