GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



activity, enforcing licensing agreements, developing a storage management program, and providing for
routine backups.

Open Pretty Good Privacy (OpenPGP) – A protocol defined in IETF RFCs 2440 and 3156 for
encrypting messages and creating certificates using public key cryptography. Most mail clients do not
support OpenPGP by default; instead, third-party plug-ins can be used in conjunction with the mail
clients. OpenPGP uses a “web of trust” model for key management, which relies on users for
management and control, making it unsuitable for medium to large implementations.

Operating System – The software “master control application” that runs the computer. It is the first
program loaded when the computer is turned on, and its principal component, the kernel, resides in
memory at all times. The operating system sets the standards for all application programs (such as the
mail server) that run in the computer. The applications communicate with the operating system for most
user interface and file management operations.

Patch – A “repair job” for a piece of programming; also known as a “fix”. A patch is the immediate
solution to an identified problem that is provided to users; it can sometimes be downloaded from the
software maker's Web site. The patch is not necessarily the best solution for the problem, and the product
developers often find a better solution to provide when they package the product for its next release. A
patch is usually developed and distributed as a replacement for or an insertion in compiled code (that is,
in a binary file or object module). In many operating systems, a special program is provided to manage
and track the installation of patches.

Phishing – Tricking individuals into disclosing sensitive personal information through deceptive
computer-based means.

Post Office Protocol (POP) – A mailbox access protocol defined by IETF RFC 1939. POP is one of the
most commonly used mailbox access protocols.

Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) – A protocol defined in IETF RFCs 3850
through 3852 and 2634 for encrypting messages and creating certificates using public key cryptography.
S/MIME is supported by default installations of many popular mail clients. S/MIME uses a classic,
hierarchical design based on certificate authorities for its key management, making it suitable for medium
to large implementations.

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) – An MTA protocol defined by IETF RFC 2821. SMTP is the
most commonly used MTA protocol.

Spam – Unsolicited bulk commercial email messages.

Spyware – Malware intended to violate a user’s privacy.

System Administrator – A person who manages a computer system, including its operating system and
applications. Responsibilities are similar to that of a network administrator.

Vulnerability – A security exposure in an operating system or other system software or application
software component. A variety of organizations maintain publicly accessible databases of vulnerabilities
based on the version numbers of software. Each vulnerability can potentially compromise the system or
network if exploited.
