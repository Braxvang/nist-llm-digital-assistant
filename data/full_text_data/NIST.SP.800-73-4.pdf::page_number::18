Special Publication 800-73-4        Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification – Part 1: PIV
                                 Card Application Namespace, Data Model and Representation

For PIV Card Applications, the PIV data objects exist in a namespace tightly managed by NIST and a
CCC discovery mechanism is not needed by client applications that are not based on GSC-IS.
Therefore, all mandatory data elements of the CCC, except for the data model number, may
optionally have a length value set to zero bytes (i.e., no value field will be supplied). Unused optional
data elements shall be absent. The content of the CCC data elements, other than the data model
number, are out of scope for this specification.

The Security Object enforces integrity of the CCC according to the issuer.

3.1.2    Card Holder Unique Identifier

The Card Holder Unique Identifier (CHUID) data object is defined in accordance with the Technical
Implementation Guidance: Smart Card Enabled Physical Access Control Systems (TIG SCEPACS)
[TIG SCEPACS]. For this specification, the CHUID is common between the contact and contactless
interfaces. For dual chip implementations, the CHUID is copied in its entirety between the two chips.

In addition to the requirements specified in TIG SCEPACS, the CHUID on the PIV Card shall meet
the following requirements:

    +    The optional Buffer Length TLV element is deprecated and will be eliminated in a future
         version of SP 800-73. This element is the length in bytes of the entire CHUID, excluding the
         Buffer Length element itself, but including the CHUID’s Asymmetric Signature element. The
         calculation of the asymmetric signature must exclude the Buffer Length element if it is
         present.

    +    The previously deprecated Authentication Key Map data element shall not be present in the
         CHUID. 3
    +    The Federal Agency Smart Credential Number (FASC-N) shall be in accordance with TIG
         SCEPACS [TIG SCEPACS] with the exception that credential series, individual credential
         issue, person identifier, organizational category, organizational identifier, and
         person/organization association category may be populated with all zeros.
         A subset of the FASC-N, the FASC-N Identifier, shall be the unique identifier as described in
         [TIG SCEPACS, Section 6.6]: “The combination of an Agency Code, System Code, and
         Credential Number is a fully qualified number that is uniquely assigned to a single
         individual.” The Agency Code is assigned to each department or agency by SP 800-87, Codes
         for Identification of Federal and Federally-Assisted Organizations [SP800-87]. The
         subordinate System Code and Credential Number value assignment is subject to department
         or agency policy, provided that the FASC-N identifier (i.e., the concatenated Agency Code,
         System Code, and Credential Number) is unique for each card. The same FASC-N value shall
         be used in all the PIV data objects that include the FASC-N. To eliminate unnecessary use of
         the SSN, 4 the FASC-N’s Person Identifier (PI) field should not encode the SSN. TIG
         SCEPACS also specifies PACS interoperability requirements in the 10th paragraph of [TIG
         SCEPACS, Section 2.1]: “For full interoperability of a PACS it must at a minimum be able to
         distinguish fourteen digits (i.e., a combination of an Agency Code, System Code, and
         Credential Number) when matching FASC-N based credentials to enrolled card holders.”
