      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines

887   4.4.2. Federation Protocols and Assertions
888   Federation protocols allow for the conveyance of assertions, authentication attributes,
889   and subscriber attributes across networked systems. In a federation scenario, as shown in
890   Figure 2, the CSP provides a service known as an identity provider, or IdP. The IdP acts as
891   a verifier for authenticators issued by the CSP. Using federation protocols, the IdP sends
892   a message, called an assertion, about this authentication event to the RP. Assertions are
893   verifiable statements from an IdP to an RP that represent an authentication event for a
894   subscriber. The RP receives and uses the assertion provided by the IdP, but the RP does
895   not verify authenticators directly.
896   Federation is generally used when the RP and the IdP are not a single entity or are not
897   under common administration, though this technology can be applied within a single
898   security domain for a variety of reasons. The RP uses the information in the assertion to
899   identify the subscriber and make authorization decisions about their access to resources
900   controlled by the RP.
901   Examples of assertions include:
902       • Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) assertions are specified using a
903         mark-up language intended for describing security assertions. They can be used
904         by a verifier to make a statement to an RP about the identity of a claimant. SAML
905         assertions may optionally be digitally signed.
906       • OpenID Connect claims are specified using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) for
907         describing security, and optionally, user claims. JSON user information claims may
908         optionally be digitally signed.
909       • Kerberos tickets allow a ticket-granting authority to issue session keys to two
910         authenticated parties using symmetric or asymmetric key establishment schemes.

911   4.4.3. Relying Parties
912   An RP relies on results of an authentication protocol to establish confidence in the
913   identity or attributes of a subscriber for the purpose of conducting an online transaction.
914   RPs may use a subscriber’s federated identity (pseudonymous or non-pseudonymous),
915   IAL, AAL, FAL, and other factors to make authorization decisions.
916   When using federation, the verifier is not a function of the RP. A federated RP receives an
917   assertion from the IdP, which provides the verifier function, and the RP ensures that the
918   assertion came from an IdP that is trusted by the RP. The RP also processes any additional
919   information in the assertion, such as personal attributes or expiration times. The RP is
920   the final arbiter concerning whether a specific assertion presented by a verifier meets the
921   RP’s established criteria for system access regardless of IAL, AAL, or FAL.
