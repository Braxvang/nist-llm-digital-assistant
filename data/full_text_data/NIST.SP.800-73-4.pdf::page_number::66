                               Card Application Namespace, Data Model and Representation

D.3     Notation

The sixteen hexadecimal digits shall be denoted using the alphanumeric characters 0, 1, 2, …, 9, A,
B, C, D, E, and F. A byte consists of two hexadecimal digits, for example, '2D'. The two hexadecimal
digits are represented in quotations '2D' or as 0x2D. A sequence of bytes may be enclosed in single
quotation marks, for example 'A0 00 00 01 16', rather than given as a sequence of individual bytes,
'A0' '00' '00' '01' '16'.

A byte can also be represented by bits b8 to b1, where b8 is the most significant bit (MSB) and b1 is
the least significant bit (LSB) of the byte. In textual or graphic representations, the leftmost bit is the
MSB. Thus, for example, the most significant bit, b8, of '80' is 1 and the least significant bit, b1, is 0.

All bytes specified as RFU shall be set to '00' and all bits specified as RFU shall be set to 0.

All lengths shall be measured in number of bytes unless otherwise noted.

The expression 'X' & 'Y' is a bitwise AND operation between bytes 'X' and 'Y'.

The symbol || means concatenation of byte strings. For example, if X is '00 01 02' and Y is '03 04 05',
then X || Y is '00 01 02 03 04 05'.

Data objects in templates are described as being mandatory (M), optional (O), or conditional (C).
'Mandatory' means the data object shall appear in the template. 'Optional' means the data object may
appear in the template. In the case of 'Conditional' data objects, the conditions under which they are
required are provided.

In other tables the M/O/C column identifies properties of the PIV Card Application that shall be
present (M), may be present (O), or are conditionally required to be present (C).

BER-TLV data object tags are represented as byte sequences as described above. Thus, for example,
0x4F is the interindustry data object tag for an application identifier and 0x7F61 is the interindustry
data object tag for the Biometric Information Templates Group Template.
