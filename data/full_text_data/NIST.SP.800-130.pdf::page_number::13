used by these systems requires protection when it is at rest, when it is being processed
within a protected facility, and also when it is transported from one location to another.

Cryptography is often used to protect information from unauthorized disclosure, to detect
unauthorized modification, and to authenticate the identities of system entities (e.g.,
individuals, organizations, devices or processes). Cryptography is particularly useful
when data transmission or entity authentication occurs over communications networks for
which physical means of protection (i.e., physical security techniques) are often cost-
prohibitive or even impossible to implement. Thus, cryptography is widely used when
business is conducted or when sensitive information is transmitted over the Internet.
Cryptography can also provide a layer of protection against insiders and hackers who
may have physical or possibly logical access to stored data, but not the authorization to
know or modify the data (e.g., maintenance personnel or CKMS users).

Cryptographic techniques use cryptographic keys that are managed and protected
throughout their lifecycles by a CKMS. Effectively implemented cryptography can
reduce the scope of the information management problem from the need to protect large
amounts of information to the need to protect only keys and certain metadata (i.e.,
information about the key and its authorized uses, such as the algorithm with which the
key is to be used, the security service to be provided using the key, etc.).

When designing a CKMS, the cryptographic techniques used to protect the keys managed
by the CKMS should offer a level of protection called the security strength that is
infeasible for a would-be attacker to bypass or subvert; the security strength of the
technique is the base 2 logarithm of the minimum number of operations required to
cryptanalyze the algorithm, and is often measured in bits of security. This design
principle is comparable to a design principle used in building safes and vaults: the
designer builds the vault to a standard that would discourage a rational attacker from
attempting entry; the only feasible way to open the safe is to open the safe door by trying
possible combinations until the correct combination is selected. Similarly, the only way
to decrypt previously encrypted data (without knowledge of the correct key) is to test
possible keys until, eventually, the correct key is used to decrypt the ciphertext to obtain
the correct plaintext. Just as the protection provided by a safe is dependent on the number
of its possible combinations, the strength of a cryptographic algorithm is dependent on
the number of possible keys.

Other means of gaining access to the contents of the safe or to the information that has
been encrypted may also exist. One can drill through the safe enclosure, and one can
attempt to find a shortcut method to cryptanalyze the cryptographic algorithm. Also, one
can attempt to steal the correct combination or key. Safe combinations and cryptographic
keys both require similar protection. The CKMS should be designed to provide the
necessary protection for keys and metadata.

Cryptography can be used to provide three major types of protection to data:
confidentiality, integrity, and source authentication.
