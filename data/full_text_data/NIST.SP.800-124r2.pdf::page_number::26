       Device-Side Management and Security Technologies
The following sections detail common on-device technologies used to enable management and
enhance enterprise security. Note that not all mobile devices share the same functions and
security capabilities.

4.1.1. Hardware-Backed Processing and Storage
Many mobile devices contain dedicated hardware components to protect cryptographic keys,
passwords, digital certificates, biometric templates, and other sensitive information. These
hardware components are also frequently used to support the encryption of user data on mobile
devices. Some mobile devices offer dedicated components to perform sensitive operations, such
as making security decisions (e.g., granting access to a privileged API) or performing
cryptographic operations on data. On some platforms, secure data storage and sensitive
operations are combined into a single SoC. iOS and Android devices both support hardware-
backed processing and storage [21], [22].
Although these components may exist on devices, they may not be used by default. Apps must
properly leverage the right APIs to fully utilize the security functions that are provided by the
platform. On some platforms, APIs may not be exposed to all developers. On other platforms,
small applications can be developed to run specifically within these restricted security
environments.
Finally, devices may use other security modules or elements dedicated to specific tasks. These
modules/elements are often meant to provide a secure implementation of a specific task. For
example, some mobile payment solutions use a chip specifically designed to handle certain
transactions and encrypt payment information stored within the chip.

4.1.2. Data Isolation Mechanisms
Mobile devices provide data isolation mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to user and
device data. Examples of data isolation mechanisms include encryption and application
sandboxing. Isolating data using encryption separates the data based on authorized access. This
mechanism means that only users who possess the appropriate cryptographic key can access the
encrypted data on the device. Mobile devices encrypt user data, but data may be encrypted with a
key that is managed by the OS and not the user, developer, or enterprise.
Sandboxing on a mobile device can be implemented in multiple ways. An app sandbox is
implemented by the mobile OSs, which generally keeps apps from interacting with each other.
Exceptions are made based on well-defined methods explicitly accepted by the user, such as
asking a user if they grant permission for an application to do a task. Also, if apps are made by a
common developer, they may be allowed to share information between one another because they
are signed by the same developer key. Additional sandboxes may exist at or below the user level
that provide an additional layer of data segmentation.
