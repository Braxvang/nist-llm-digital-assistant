       NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                       Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information

1119             e. Change or refresh authenticators periodically or when the following events occur:
1120                [Assignment: organization-defined events].
1121             f.    Protect authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification.

1122             DISCUSSION
1123             Authenticators include passwords, cryptographic devices, biometrics, certificates, one-time
1124             password devices, and ID badges. The initial authenticator content is the actual content of the
1125             authenticator (e.g., the initial password). In contrast, requirements for authenticator content
1126             contain specific characteristics. Authenticator management is supported by organization-defined
1127             settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics (e.g., password complexity and
1128             composition rules, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and the
1129             number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric authentication).
1130             The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be implemented by 03.15.03 for
1131             authenticators in the possession of individuals and by 03.01.01, 03.01.02, 03.01.05, and
1132             03.13.08 for authenticators stored in organizational systems. This includes passwords stored in
1133             hashed or encrypted formats or files that contain encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with
1134             administrator privileges. Actions can be taken to protect authenticators, including maintaining
1135             possession of authenticators, not sharing authenticators with others, and immediately reporting
1136             lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators. Developers may deliver system components with
1137             factory default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration.
1138             Default authentication credentials are often well-known, easily discoverable, and present a
1139             significant risk. Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking authenticators for
1140             temporary access when no longer needed. The use of long passwords or passphrases may
1141             obviate the need to periodically change authenticators.

1145         Incident Response

1146   3.6.1. Incident Response Plan and Handling
1147           REQUIREMENT: 03.06.01
1148           a. Develop an incident response plan that provides the organization with a roadmap for
1149              implementing its incident response capability.
1150           b. Implement an incident-handling capability for incidents that is consistent with the incident
1151              response plan and includes preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication,
1152              and recovery.
1153           c.     Update the incident response plan to address system and organizational changes or
1154                  problems encountered during plan implementation, execution, or testing.

1155           DISCUSSION
1156           It is important that organizations develop and implement a coordinated approach to incident
1157           response. Organizational mission and business functions determine the structure of incident
1158           response capabilities. Incident-related information can be obtained from a variety of sources,
1159           including audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, user and
