No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (1) (2) OT Discussion: Testing for reliability and integrity increases
confidence that the system can be restored after an incident and minimizes the impact associated
with downtime and outages. The ability to test backups is often dependent on the resources
needed to appropriately represent the environment, such as the availability of spare devices and
testing equipment. Testing backup and restoration on OT is often limited to systems with
redundancy or spare equipment. In certain cases, sampling will be limited to those redundant
systems. Compensating controls may include alternative methods for testing backups, such as
hash or checksum validations.
Control Enhancement: (3) (5) (8) No OT Discussion for this control.
