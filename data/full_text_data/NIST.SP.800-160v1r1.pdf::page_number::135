NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                  Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

SN-3   DEFINE STAKEHOLDER NEEDS
       SN-3.1 Define the rules capturing authorized and intended interactions, behaviors, and
              outcomes.
       Note: The life cycle concepts and their context inform the rules.
       SN-3.2 Identify stakeholder assets and asset classes.
       SN-3.3 Identify loss concerns for each identified asset and each asset class.
       SN-3.4 Prioritize assets based on the adverse consequences of asset loss.
       SN-3.5 Characterize adversities present in the environment.
       Note: Environments that expose the system to potential adversities include test, operational,
       maintenance, and logistical environments. Adversities need to be avoided when possible and
       protected against otherwise.
       SN-3.6 Identify uncertainty associated with each identified adversity.
       SN-3.7 Identify stakeholder protection needs.
       Note: Protection needs include their success criteria, such as measures of effectiveness (MOEs).
       SN-3.8 Prioritize and down-select the stakeholder protection needs.
       SN-3.9 Record the stakeholder protection needs and rationale.

SN-4   TRANSFORM STAKEHOLDER NEEDS INTO STAKEHOLDER REQUIREMENTS
       SN-4.1 Identify the security-relevant constraints on a system solution.
       SN-4.2 Define stakeholder requirements in a manner consistent with security aspects and
              protection needs.

SN-5   ANALYZE STAKEHOLDER NEEDS AND REQUIREMENTS
       SN-5.1 Analyze the set of stakeholder requirements with respect to the protection needs.
       Note: The stakeholder requirements are analyzed to determine whether the protection needs
       are accurately and comprehensively expressed in both individual requirements and the set of
       requirements. Potential analysis characteristics include that the requirements are (1) necessary,
       complete, succinct, and implementation-free and (2) comprehensively address the protection
       needs.
       SN-5.2 Define security-relevant performance and assurance measures that enable the
              assessment of technical achievement and their relative criticality.
       Note: Determining the relative criticality of measures (e.g., measures of effectiveness) captures
       technical achievements and reflects stakeholder priorities.
       SN-5.3 Provide feedback to applicable stakeholders from the analyzed requirements to validate
              that their protection needs and expectations have been adequately captured and
              expressed.
