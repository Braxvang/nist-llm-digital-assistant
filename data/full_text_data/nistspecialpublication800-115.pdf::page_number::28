Vulnerability scanners can be run against a host either locally or from the network. Some network-based
scanners have administrator-level credentials on individual hosts and can extract vulnerability information
from hosts using those credentials. Other network-based scanners do not have such credentials and must
rely on conducting scanning of networks to locate hosts and then scan those hosts for vulnerabilities. In
such cases, network-based scanning is primarily used to perform network discovery and identify open
ports and related vulnerabilities—in most cases, it is not limited by the OS of the targeted systems.
Network-based scanning without host credentials can be performed both internally and externally—and
although internal scanning usually uncovers more vulnerabilities than external scanning, testing from both
viewpoints is important. External scanning must contend with perimeter security devices that block
traffic, limiting assessors to scanning only the ports authorized to pass traffic.

Assessors performing external scanning may find challenges similar to those faced with network
discovery, such as the use of NAT or personal and host-based firewalls. To overcome the challenges of
NAT and conduct successful network-based scanning, assessors can ask the firewall administrator to
enable port forwarding on specific IP addresses or groups of addresses if this is supported by the firewall,
or request network access behind the device performing NAT. Assessors can also request that personal or
host-based firewalls be configured to permit traffic from test system IP addresses during the assessment
period. These steps will give assessors increased insight into the network, but do not accurately reflect
the capabilities of an external attacker—although they may offer a better indication of the capabilities
available to a malicious insider or an external attacker with access to another host on the internal network.
Assessors can also perform scanning on individual hosts.

For local vulnerability scanning, a scanner is installed on each host to be scanned. This is done primarily
to identify host OS and application misconfigurations and vulnerabilities—both network-exploitable and
locally exploitable. Local scanning is able to detect vulnerabilities with a higher level of detail than
network-based scanning because local scanning usually requires both host (local) access and a root or
administrative account. Some scanners also offer the capability of repairing local misconfigurations.

A vulnerability scanner is a relatively fast and easy way to quantify an organization's exposure to surface
vulnerabilities. A surface vulnerability is a weakness that exists in isolation, independent from other
vulnerabilities. The system’s behaviors and outputs in response to attack patterns submitted by the
scanner are compared against those that characterize the signatures of known vulnerabilities, and the tool
reports any matches that are found. Besides signature-based scanning, some vulnerability scanners
attempt to simulate the reconnaissance attack patterns used to probe for exposed, exploitable
vulnerabilities, and report the vulnerabilities found when these techniques are successful.

One difficulty in identifying the risk level of vulnerabilities is that they rarely exist in isolation. For
example, there could be several low-risk vulnerabilities that present a higher risk when combined.
Scanners are unable to detect vulnerabilities that are revealed only as the result of potentially unending
combinations of attack patterns. The tool may assign a low risk to each vulnerability, leaving the assessor
falsely confident in the security measures in place. A more reliable way of identifying the risk of
vulnerabilities in aggregate is through penetration testing, which is discussed in Section 5.2.

Another problem with identifying the risk level of vulnerabilities is that vulnerability scanners often use
their own proprietary methods for defining the levels. For example, one scanner might use the levels low,
medium, and high, while another scanner might use the levels informational, low, medium, high, and
critical. This makes it difficult to compare findings among multiple scanners. Also, the risk levels
assigned by a scanner may not reflect the actual risk to the organization—for example, a scanner might
