must address software in the approach to IPv6 transition.

The two main differences between an IPv6 pervasive deployment and an IPv6 sparse deployment are:

        The IPv6 pervasive deployment has a shorter lifecycle than an IPv6 sparse deployment.
        An IPv6 sparse deployment will take longer and make use of tunneling mechanisms.
Both deployment scenarios (IPv6 pervasive deployment and IPv6 sparse deployment) are covered by the
same general deployment plan. All phases of the lifecycle are the same regardless of approach.

Organizations that are not yet deploying IPv6 globally should implement the following recommendations:

        Blocking all IPv6 traffic, native and tunneled, at the organization's firewall. Both incoming
         and outgoing traffic should be blocked.

        Disabling all IPv6-compatible ports, protocols and services on all software and hardware.

        Beginning to acquire familiarity and expertise with IPv6, through laboratory experimentation
         and/or limited pilot deployments.

        Making organization web servers, located outside of the organizational firewall, accessible via
         IPv6 connections. This will enable IPv6-only users to access the servers and aid the
         organization in acquiring familiarity with some aspects of IPv6 deployment.



  6.9.1   Initiation Phase

The initiation phase is concerned with requirements gathering. It is important for an organization to
understand its current environment before deploying IPv6. By understanding the current environment,
the correct transition approach can be selected, and an organization can ensure that it maintains security
parity between its IPv4 and IPv6 environment.

An organization must also begin to plan for new IPv6 features. The transition to IPv6 gives an
organization an opportunity to fix problems in its current environment. IPv6 addressing will allow more
opportunities to aggregate addressing and simplify routing and access control rules if requirements are
collected early.

One of the key tasks in the initiation phase is to conduct an extensive inventory of the IP equipment and
services. RFC 4057, IPv6 Enterprise Network Scenarios, covers the types of questions that an
organization needs to answer to plan a successful IPv6 transition. These questions are broken out by
different scenarios, because each type of organization will have unique transition requirements.

What all organizations have in common are IPv4 assets that require transition to IPv6. In an effort to
understand the transition requirements, an organization must perform an asset discovery. While it is
feasible that asset discovery could populate a configuration management database (CMDB), the primary
purpose of asset discovery in an IPv6 transition plan is to gather transition requirements.

Transition requirements determine which assets will transition to IPv6, the order assets will transition, the
transition methods selected, and the security controls implemented. The type of information that can help
determine if an asset or service will transition to IPv6, require some other coexistence mechanism, or be
