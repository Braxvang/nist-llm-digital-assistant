1172   of the output from a multi-factor cryptographic software authenticator proves use of the
1173   activation factor.

1174   5.1.9. Multi-Factor Cryptographic Devices
1175   A multi-factor cryptographic device is a hardware device that performs cryptographic
1176   operations using one or more protected cryptographic keys and requires activation
1177   through a second authentication factor. Authentication is accomplished by proving
1178   possession of the device and control of the key. The authenticator output is provided
1179   by direct connection to the user endpoint and is highly dependent on the specific
1180   cryptographic device and protocol, but it is typically some type of signed message. The
1181   multi-factor cryptographic device is something you have, and it SHALL be activated by
1182   either something you know or something you are.

1183   5.1.9.1. Multi-Factor Cryptographic Device Authenticators
1184   Multi-factor cryptographic device authenticators use tamper-resistant hardware to
1185   encapsulate one or more secret keys unique to the authenticator that SHALL NOT
1186   be exportable (i.e., cannot be removed from the device). The secret key SHALL be
1187   accessible only through the presentation and verification of an activation factor, either
1188   a biometric characteristic or an activation secret as described in Sec. 5.2.11. The
1189   authenticator operates by using a secret key that was unlocked by the activation factor
1190   to sign a challenge nonce presented through a direct interface between the authenticator
1191   and endpoint (e.g., a USB port or secured wireless connection) as specified in Sec. 5.2.12.
1192   Alternatively, the authenticator could be a suitably secure processor integrated with the
1193   user endpoint itself (e.g., a hardware TPM).
1194   The secret key and its algorithm SHALL provide at least the minimum security
1195   length specified in the latest revision of [SP800-131A] (112 bits as of the date of this
1196   publication). The challenge nonce SHALL be at least 64 bits in length. Approved
1197   cryptography SHALL be used.
1198   Cryptographic device authenticators differ from cryptographic software authenticators
1199   because of the greater protection afforded to the embedded authentication secrets by
1200   cryptographic devices. In order to be considered a cryptographic device, an authenticator
1201    SHALL either be a separate piece of hardware or an embedded processor or execution
1202   environment, e.g., secure element, trusted execution environment (TEE), trusted platform
1203   module (TPM). A cryptographic device authenticator SHALL be designed so as to
1204   prohibit the export of the authentication secret to the host processor and SHALL NOT
1205   be capable of being reprogrammed by the host processor so as to allow the secret to be
1206   extracted. The authenticator is subject to applicable [FIPS140] requirements of the AAL
1207   at which the authenticator is being used.
