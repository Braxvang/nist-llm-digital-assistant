       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


1250   The IAL selection does not mean the RP application owner will need to perform the
1251   proofing themselves since identity proofing is the function of the CSP.
1252   Not all RP applications will require identity proofing. If the RP application does not
1253   require any personal information to execute any digital transactions, the system can
1254   operate without identity proofing users of the RP application. If personal information
1255   is needed, the RP needs to determine if validated and verified attributes are required or
1256   if self-asserted attributes are acceptable. If there are insignificant potential harms from
1257   accepting self-asserted attributes, the system may also be able to operate without identity
1258   proofing users. In such cases, the identity proofing processes described in [SP800-63A]
1259   are not applicable to the system.
1260   If an organization determines that identity proofing is necessary, the initial IAL
1261    SHALL be assessed based on the potential impacts of identity proofing failures. As
1262   described in Sec. 5.1, potential impacts SHALL be considered from the perspective of
1263   the organization, individuals, other organizations, and the nation, for harms incurred
1264   through the use or operation of the RP application. While the organization may not be
1265   negatively impacted, the user could be significantly harmed, as could individuals whose
1266   privacy or other rights have been violated by the business practices of a service provider.
1267   Organizations SHOULD consider the worst-case when identifying the overall impact
1268   level of the RP application, but may use risk management processes to tailor their initial
1269   selection when there are differing impacts.
1270   When assessing the overall impact level of the RP application, the organization SHOULD
1271   consider impacts to mission delivery separately from other impact categories. Potential
1272   failures in the identity proofing process that could lead to harms in mission delivery
1273   should be assessed by the organization to determine if the associated impacts would
1274   be mitigated or exacerbated by the implementation of more rigorous identity proofing
1275   processes. As such, the organization MAY exclude the mission delivery category when
1276   initially identifying the overall impact level of the RP application, as these impacts will
1277   need to be considered in the tailoring process.
1278   The overall impact level assessed by the organization leads to a preliminary selection of
1279   the IAL from which further tailoring may be done:
1280       • Low impact: IAL1
1281       • Moderate impact: IAL2
1282       • High impact: IAL3
1283   The preliminary selection assumes that higher potential impacts of failures in the identity
1284   proofing process should be mitigated by higher assurance processes. While this is often
1285   the case, organizations should consider the specific failures, impact categories, and
1286   impacted entities identified as part of the impact analysis to determine if additional
1287   tailoring is warranted. For example, if a failure to enroll a legitimate applicant could lead

                                                    33
