Reverse Channel: See back channel

RF Subsystem: The portion of the RFID system that uses radio frequencies to perform identification and
related transactions. The RF subsystem consists of two components: a reader and a tag.

Semi-Active Tag: A tag that uses a battery to communicate but remains dormant until a reader sends an
energizing signal. Semi-active tags have a longer range than passive tags and a longer battery life than
active tags.

Semi-Passive Tag: A passive tag that uses a battery to power on-board circuitry or sensors but not to
produce back channel signals.

Shrinkage: Product loss or theft that results in declining revenue.

Singulation: A function performed by a reader to individually identify any tags in the reader’s operating
range.

Skimming: The unauthorized use of a reader to read tags without the authorization or knowledge of tag’s
owner or the individual in possession of the tag.

Smart Card: A plastic card containing a computer chip that enables the holder to purchase goods and
services, enter restricted areas, access medical, financial, or other records, or perform other operations
requiring data stored on the chip. 100

Supply Chain: The network of retailers, distributors, transporters, storage facilities, and suppliers that
participate in the sale, delivery, and production of a particular product. 101

Tag: An electronic device that communicates with RFID readers. A tag can function as a beacon or it
can be used to convey information such as an identifier.

Tag Talks First: An RF transaction in which the tag communicates its presence to a reader. The reader
may then send commands to the tag.

Traffic Analysis: The analysis of patterns in communications for the purpose of gaining intelligence
about a system or its users. Traffic analysis does not require examination of the content of the
communications, which may or may not be decipherable. For example, an adversary may be able to
detect a signal from a reader that could enable it to infer that a particular activity is occurring (e.g., a
shipment has arrived, someone is entering a facility) without necessarily learning an identifier or
associated data.

Transponder: See Tag
