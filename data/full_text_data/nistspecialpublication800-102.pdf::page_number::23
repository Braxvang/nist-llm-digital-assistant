       information may be omitted from the TSP2 data transmitted by TTA2:
           •   Any portion of the user_supplied_info2 may be omitted, since it is known
               by entity B.
           •   Any portion of TTA_supplied_info2 may be omitted if the information is
               already known or can be determined by entity B.
       However, even though they may be omitted from the transmitted TSP2 data,
       the entire user_supplied_info2 and the entire TTA_supplied_info2 shall be
       included in the timestamped_data2 that is used in the generation / verification of
               timestamp_signatureTTA2 = SIGTTA2 (timestamped_data2).
   7. Entity B then 1) checks that the transmitted portions of user_supplied_info2 are
      correct and 2) verifies timestamp_signatureTTA2 using TTA2’s public signature
      verification key.
In addition to what is known from step 4 of the appropriate scheme from Section 4.3, the
verification performed in step 7 provides entity B with evidence that the signature
SIGA(M, TSP1) was generated between the times indicated in timestamp1 and timestamp2.
This evidence (i.e., M, TSP1, SIGA(M, TSP1) and TSP2) can be presented to any third
party who also trusts the TTAs.
