consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of disaster monitoring and prediction
information usually depends on whether the information is time-critical. Unauthorized
modification or destruction of information affecting disaster monitoring and prediction
information may jeopardize public safety, disaster prevention, and/or emergency response
missions in a manner that results in unacceptable damage to critical infrastructures, damage to
key national assets, or loss of human life. For example, an integrity compromise that prevents
timely and accurate dissemination of tsunami and earthquake predictions can have life-
threatening consequences.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
disaster monitoring and prediction information is high.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to disaster monitoring and prediction
information. Generally, missions supported by disaster monitoring and prediction information
are not reliably tolerant of delays. Delays may cost lives and irreplaceable property, e.g.,
degradation in mission capability and resultant catastrophic consequences for critical
infrastructures, key national assets, and/or human life. For example, a loss of availability of
information that prevents timely and accurate dissemination of tsunami and earthquake
predictions can have life-threatening consequences.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
disaster monitoring and prediction information is high.

D.4.2 Disaster Preparedness and Planning Information Type

Disaster preparedness and planning involves the development of response programs to be used in
case of a disaster. This involves the development of emergency management programs and
activities as well as staffing and equipping regional response centers. The recommended
provisional categorization of the disaster preparedness and planning information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of disaster preparedness
and planning information on the ability of responsible agencies to develop response programs to
be used in case of a disaster. This involves the development of emergency management
programs and activities as well as staffing and equipping regional response centers. The
consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most disaster preparedness and planning information
would have, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The consequences of unauthorized
disclosure of some disaster preparedness and planning information may include revealing weak
or sensitive critical infrastructure characteristics or inadequate security of U.S. targets to
terrorists or other adversaries. Such information may reveal to an enemy the most effective
