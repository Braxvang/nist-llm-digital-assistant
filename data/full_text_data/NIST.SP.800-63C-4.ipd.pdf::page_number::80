       NIST SP 800-63C-4 ipd                                             Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                                     Federation and Assertions


2114   requirements are unlikely to have anticipated all potential equity problems. Potential
2115   equity problems also will vary for different applications. Accordingly, IdPs and RPs need
2116   to provide mechanisms for subscribers to report inequitable authentication requirements
2117   and to advise them on potential alternative authentication strategies.
2118   This guideline allows the binding of additional federated identifiers to an RP subscriber
2119   account to minimize the risk of IdP access loss (see Sec. 5.4). However, a subscriber
2120   might find it difficult to have multiple IdP accounts that are acceptable to the RP at the
2121   same time. This inequity can be addressed by having the RP having its own account
2122   recovery process that allows for the secure binding and unbinding of multiple federated
2123   identifiers from the RP subscriber account.
2124   RPs need to be aware that not all subscribers will necessarily have access to the same
2125   IdPs. The RPs can institute locally authenticated accounts for such subscribers, and later
2126   allow binding of those accounts to federated identifiers.
