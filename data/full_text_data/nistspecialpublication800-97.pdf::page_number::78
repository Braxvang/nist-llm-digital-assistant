ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



6.1     EAP Methods

EAP methods perform the authentication transaction and generate the key material used to protect
subsequent communications. Because of the extensible nature of EAP, dozens of EAP methods exist, and
others are being developed. The specifications for some of the EAP methods most commonly used in
WLAN environments are available publicly as peer-reviewed or privately submitted IETF Internet-Drafts
or RFCs. 59 This enables software developers from various organizations to write implementations of the
EAP methods for WLAN products. Once an EAP method is expected to be in common use, the Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) assigns it a method type code, which effectively adds it to a
universally accepted directory of EAP methods. 60 To date, IANA has allocated method type codes to
approximately 40 EAP methods. The EAP software on each device knows which method to invoke based
on the method type code in the incoming EAP packet.

EAP methods support a number of different types of authentication. For example, authentication might
involve a user-defined password entered into a dialog box, a one-time password read from a hardware
token, or a certificate stored on a smart card or USB device. Also, while authentication between a STA
and an AS is mutual, it is not necessarily symmetric. For example, the AS might authenticate to the STA
using a certificate, but the STA might authenticate to the AS with a user-supplied biometric. In all these
cases, the nature of the authentication depends on the EAP method employed.

To protect against certain types of attacks, EAP only allows one authentication method to be used in each
EAP conversation, but complex authentication architectures can still be supported within this framework.
EAP multiplexing is the ability of an EAP server to handle multiple EAP methods and distinguish
between each EAP conversation when more than one is occurring at the same time. EAP multiplexing
enables an organization to require different authentication methods for different applications or user
populations. EAP tunneling allows the nesting of one or more EAP methods within another EAP method,
which in effect requires one type of authentication to be dependent on another in the context of a single
EAP conversation. For example, through the use of EAP tunneling, a STA may use one or more
techniques to authenticate to the AS, while the AS uses another technique to authenticate to the STA. As
discussed later in this section, many of the leading EAP methods for WLAN are tunneled methods.

The remainder of this section discusses how EAP methods are used in practice and describes particular
EAP methods and their relative advantages and disadvantages. Section 6.1.1 reviews the EAP method
requirements for WLANs. Section 6.1.2 discusses the baseline EAP methods included in RFC 3748, and
Section 6.1.3 describes the EAP methods most commonly used in WLAN environments. Finally, Section
6.1.4 summarizes and compares the EAP methods discussed in Sections 6.1.2 and 6.1.3.

6.1.1     EAP Method Requirements for WLANs

EAP methods can support authentication in a wide range of environments, including dial-up networking
services and cellular telephony, but not all EAP methods are appropriate for IEEE 802.11 RSNs. This
section reviews EAP method requirements for WLANs. It is based largely on RFC 4017, Extensible
Authentication Protocol (EAP) Method Requirements for Wireless LANs, 61 which is expected to guide
industry development of new EAP methods for WLAN applications.

      Of the EAP methods commonly used with IEEE 802.11, only EAP-SIM has achieved RFC status (RFC 4186,
      http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4186.txt). The IETF EMU Working Group (http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/emu-charter.html)
      is developing an EAP-TLS Internet Draft.
