NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                         Guidelines for Media Sanitization


FIPS                    Federal Information Processing Standard.

Format                  Pre-established layout for data.

Hard Disk               A rigid magnetic disk fixed permanently within a drive unit and used
                        for storing data. It could also be a removable cartridge containing
                        one or more magnetic disks.

Incineration            A physically Destructive method of sanitizing media; the act of
                        burning completely to ashes.

Information             Meaningful interpretation or expression of data.

Magnetic Media          A class of storage device that uses only magnetic storage media for
                        persistent storage, without the assistance of heat (ie. heat assisted
                        magnetic recording (HAMR)) or the additional use of other
                        persistent storage media such as flash memory-based media.

Media                   Plural of medium.

Media Sanitization      A general term referring to the actions taken to render data written
                        on media unrecoverable by both ordinary and extraordinary means.

Medium                  Material on which data are or may be recorded, such as paper,
                        punched cards, magnetic tape, magnetic disks, solid state devices, or
                        optical discs.

Melting                 A physically Destructive method of sanitizing media; to be changed
                        from a solid to a liquid state generally by the application of heat.

Optical Disk            A plastic disk that is read using an optical laser device.

Overwrite               Writing data on top of the physical location of data stored on the
                        media.

Physical Destruction    A Sanitization method for media.

Pulverization           A physically Destructive method of sanitizing media; the act of
                        grinding to a powder or dust.

Purge                   A method of Sanitization by applying physical or logical techniques
                        that renders Target Data recovery infeasible using state of the art
                        laboratory techniques.

Read                    Fundamental process in an information system that results only in
                        the flow of information from storage media to a requester.

Read-Only Memory        ROM is a pre-recorded storage medium that can only be read from
