NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

   •   IT programs or tools may not be suitable or effective for OT systems.
   •   Compensatory measures may be an effective solution to securing an OT system without
       affecting system performance.
   •   Protecting OT systems is critical, and a cybersecurity incident on an OT system may have
       catastrophic consequences that affect human life and the environment.

       OT Cybersecurity Program Content
This section provides recommendations for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and
continually improving an OT cybersecurity program. These recommendations are independent,
which allows the organization to select the approaches and technologies that are most suitable to
its needs.
An OT cybersecurity program is typically tailored to a specific OT environment. An organization
may have multiple sites, each with multiple specific OT environments. In such situations, an
organizational-level OT security program should be defined with recommendations that cascade
down and adapt to the needs of individual sites and OT environments.
The effectiveness of an OT cybersecurity program is often enhanced through coordination or
integration with the organization’s processes and information security program. However,
information security programs typically focus on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability –
in that order – of information for the entire organization. Information security programs do not
necessarily address all of the specific security and operational needs of an OT environment,
which instead prioritizes safety, followed by availability, integrity, and confidentiality. This
difference in focus and priorities between IT and OT security programs should be kept in mind.
NIST SP 800-100, Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers [SP800-100],
provides a broad overview of information security program elements to assist in establishing and
implementing an information security program in an organization.
The lifespan of an OT system can exceed 20 years. As a result, many legacy systems may
contain hardware and software that are no longer supported by vendors and cannot be patched or
updated to protect against new vulnerabilities. In that case, the security program should be
tailored to the unique characteristics of the legacy system to determine whether the controls are
applicable. When security controls are not supported by the legacy OT system, compensating
controls should be considered. For example, anti-malware software may not be available for
systems such as PLCs and DCS, which means that malware protection requirements cannot be
applied to these endpoints. In this case, a compensating control should be considered, such as
using a firewall with a deep packet inspection capability that can monitor and block advanced
threats like malware.
The primary purpose of investing in a cybersecurity program is risk management. Risk to
operations exists because of the potential of threat actors exploiting the vulnerabilities in the
applications and infrastructures. Therefore, the most appropriate decision regarding what to
include in the scope of a cybersecurity program can be made if investments are viewed through
the lens of corporate risk management. To help design and drive a cybersecurity program with a
risk management perspective, NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 2 [SP800-37r2] describes the Risk
Management Framework, which defines the core tasks and processes for implementing a
