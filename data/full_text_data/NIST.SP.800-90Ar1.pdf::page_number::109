NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                            Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                   Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


   11. Section 9: A paragraph discussing the pseudocode used has been inserted at the
       beginning of the section, and modifications to the third and fourth paragraphs have been
       made for clarity; text has also been added to the next-to-last paragraph that discusses
       error codes more thoroughly. The last sentence in the third paragraph has been modified
       to only require that the entropy input and nonce be provided as discussed in Sections
       8.6.5 and 8.6.7 and in SP 800-90C. A paragraph has been added to discuss checking the
       status code. In Section 9.2, clarifying information has been inserted about the
       prediction_resistance_request parameter. In Sections 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3, returns to the
       consuming application have been modified for those cases where other than SUCCESS is
       appropriate as a status to be returned from the function (e.g., parameter errors, entropy
       unavailability or entropy source failure); this change was made to better accommodate
       the various Get_entropy_input constructions specified in SP 800-90C. In Section 9.1
       and 9.3.1, the item in the list referring to elliptic-curve parameters was removed, and the
       discussion of the status output has been modified for clarity.
   12. Section 10: Section 10 now includes a link to the DRBG test vectors on the NIST web
       site.
       Sections 10.1, 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 now include short discussions about selecting hash
       functions to support the DRBG's intended security strength.
       The Dual_EC_DRBG has been removed, and section numbers adjusted accordingly. In
       Section 10.2.1, a paragraph under Table 3 has been added for explanatory purposes. In
       Section 10.2.1.3.2, the first paragraph has been modified for clarity. Section 10.2 has
       been modified to allow the counter field to be a subset of the input block and to allow
       either derivation function specified in the document; this is indicated in step 2.1 of
       Section 10.2.1.2 and step 4.1 of Sections 10.2.1.5.1 and 10.2.1.5.2 (note that this change
       continues to allow the use of the entire input block as the counter field, as was specified
       in the previous versions of this document); Table 3 has been modified to include
       restrictions on the length of the counter field and to indicate the restrictions on the
       number of bits that can be requested during a single request as a function of the counter-
       field length and the previous restriction on the number of bits that could be requested.
       The first paragraphs of Sections 10.3 and 10.3.2 have been modified slightly for clarity.
       Step 11 in Section 10.3.2 has been respecified using the (new) select function.
   13. Section 11: The third paragraph has been added for clarity, and the last sentence of the
       next paragraph has been removed. In Section 11.1, the references to the
       Dual_EC_DRBG have been removed from the third and fifth bullet, and the wording of
       the next-to-last bullet has been modified to be conditional. In Section 11.2, additional text
       has been inserted to address validation testing. In Section 11.3, the health testing
       requirements have been modified.
   14. The previous Appendix A was removed; this appendix contained application-specific
       constants for the Dual_EC_DRBG.
   15. Appendix A now contains the conversion routines. Appendix A.5.4 (the old Appendix
       B.5.4), which contained the complex modular method for converting bits to numbers, has
       been removed because of an error in the specification.
