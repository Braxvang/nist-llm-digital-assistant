special-purpose software that removes data pertaining to particular applications, such as Web browsers, as
well as data in general locations, such as temporary directories. The use of most data concealment tools is
unlikely to be captured in logs. Analysts should be aware of the capabilities of these tools so that they
can identify such tools on a system and recognize the tools’ effects.

7.3     Collecting Application Data

As described in Section 7.1, application-related data may be located within filesystems, volatile OS data,
and network traffic. Sections 4.2, 5.2, and 6.3 contain specific information about collecting data from
these respective sources. The types of application data that these sources may contain are as follows:

      ! Filesystems. Filesystems may contain many types of files related to applications, including
        executable files and scripts, configuration files, supporting files (e.g., documentation), logs, and
        data files.
      ! Volatile OS Data. Volatile OS data may contain information about network connections used by
        applications, the application processes running on a system and the command line arguments used
        for each process, and the files held open by applications, as well as other types of supporting
        information.
      ! Network Traffic. The most relevant network traffic data involves user connections to a remote
        application and communications between application components on different systems. Other
        network traffic records might also provide supporting information, such as network connections
        for remote printing from an application, and DNS lookups by the application client or other
        components to resolve application components’ domain names to IP addresses.
Analysts often face a major challenge in determining which data should be collected. In many cases, the
analyst must first decide which application is of interest. For example, it is common to have multiple
Web browsers and e-mail clients installed on a single system. If analysts are asked to collect data
regarding an individual’s use of the organization’s e-mail services, they need to be mindful of all the ways
in which the individual could have accessed those services. The user’s computer could contain three
different e-mail clients, plus two Web browsers that could be used to access a Web-based e-mail client
provided by the organization. For the user’s computer, analysts could simply collect all data from the
computer and then determine during the examination process which clients were actually used for e-mail.
However, there are many potential data sources aside from the user’s computer, and these sources might
vary based on the client that was used. For example, use of the Web-based client might have been
recorded in Web server, firewall, IDS, and content monitoring software logs, as well as in Web browser
history files, Web browser caches, cookies, and personal firewall logs. In some situations, collecting the
necessary data might involve identifying all components of the application, deciding which were most
likely to be of interest (based on the details of the situation and the need), finding the location of each
component, and collecting data from those components. Section 8 contains examples that illustrate the
complexity of identifying components and prioritizing data collection for applications.

7.4     Examining and Analyzing Application Data

Examining and analyzing application data largely consists of looking at specific portions of application
data—filesystems, volatile OS data, and network traffic—using the tools and techniques described in
Sections 4.3 and 4.4, 5.3, and 6.4, respectively. Examination and analysis might be hindered if the
application were custom, such as a program written by the user; the analyst is unlikely to have any
knowledge of such an application. Another possible issue in examination involves use of application-
based security controls, such as data encryption and passwords. Many applications use such security
controls to thwart unauthorized access to sensitive data by authorized users.
