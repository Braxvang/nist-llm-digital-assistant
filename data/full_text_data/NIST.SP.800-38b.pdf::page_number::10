                                                                                             Given a positive integer s, 0s denotes the string that consists of s ‘0’ bits. For example, 08 =
                                                                                             00000000.

                                                                                             Given a real number x, the ceiling function, denoted x, is the least integer that is not less than x.
                                                                                             For example, 2.1 = 3, and 4 = 4.

                                                                                             The concatenation operation on bit strings is denoted ||; for example, 001 || 10111 = 00110111.

                                                                                             Given bit strings of equal length, the exclusive-OR operation, denoted ⊕, specifies the addition,

                                                                                             00110.

                                                                                             Given a bit string X, the functions LSBs(X) and MSBs(X) return the s least significant (i.e., right-

                                                                                             LSB3(111011010) = 010, and MSB4(111011010) = 1110.

                                                                                             Given a bit string X that consists of Xlen bits, the (single) left-shift function, denoted X << 1, is
                                                                                             LSBXlen(X || 0). For example, 1101110 << 1 = 1011100.

                                                                                             Given a positive real number x, its base 2 logarithm is denoted lg(x). For example, lg(210) = 10.

                                                                                             The CMAC algorithm depends on the choice of an underlying symmetric key block cipher. The

                                                                                             For any given key, the underlying block cipher of the mode consists of two functions that are

                                                                                             function, as in the specifications of the AES algorithm and TDEA in Ref. [3] and Ref. [10],

                                                                                             The forward cipher function is a permutation on bit strings of a fixed length; the strings are called
                                                                                             blocks. The bit length of a block is denoted b, and the length of a block is called the block size.
                                                                                             For the AES algorithm, b = 128; for TDEA, b = 64. The key is denoted K, and the resulting
                                                                                             forward cipher function of the block cipher is denoted CIPHK.
