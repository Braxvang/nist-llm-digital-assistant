1985   9.    Privacy Considerations
1986   These privacy considerations supplement the guidance in Sec. 4. This section is
1987   informative.

1988   9.1. Privacy Risk Assessment
1989   Sections 4.1.5, 4.2.5, and 4.3.5 require the CSP to conduct a privacy risk assessment for
1990   records retention. Such a privacy risk assessment would include:
1991        1. The likelihood that the records retention could create a problem for the subscriber,
1992           such as invasiveness or unauthorized access to the information.
1993        2. The impact if such a problem did occur.
1994   CSPs should be able to reasonably justify any response they take to identified privacy
1995   risks, including accepting the risk, mitigating the risk, and sharing the risk. The use of
1996   subscriber consent is a form of sharing the risk, and therefore appropriate for use only
1997   when a subscriber could reasonably be expected to have the capacity to assess and accept
1998   the shared risk.

1999   9.2. Privacy Controls
2000   Section 4.4 requires CSPs to employ appropriately tailored privacy controls. [SP800-53]
2001   provides a set of privacy controls for CSPs to consider when deploying authentication
2002   mechanisms. These controls cover notices, redress, and other important considerations for
2003   successful and trustworthy deployments.

2004   9.3. Use Limitation
2005   Section 4.4 requires CSPs to use measures to maintain the objectives of predictability
2006   (enabling reliable assumptions by individuals, owners, and operators about PII and its
2007   processing by an information system) and manageability (providing the capability for
2008   granular administration of PII, including alteration, deletion, and selective disclosure)
2009   commensurate with privacy risks that can arise from the processing of attributes for
2010   purposes other than identity proofing, authentication, authorization, or attribute assertion,
2011   related fraud mitigation, or to comply with law or legal process [NISTIR8062].
2012   CSPs may have various business purposes for processing attributes, including providing
2013   non-identity services to subscribers. However, processing attributes for other purposes
2014   than those specified at collection can create privacy risks when individuals are not
2015   expecting or comfortable with the additional processing. CSPs can determine appropriate
2016   measures commensurate with the privacy risk arising from the additional processing.
2017   For example, absent applicable law, regulation or policy, it may not be necessary to
2018   get consent when processing attributes to provide non-identity services requested by
2019   subscribers, although notices may help subscribers maintain reliable assumptions about
