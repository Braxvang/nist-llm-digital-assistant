1183      •   Chief Financial Officer – The Office of the Chief Financial Officer (or the organization
1184          or agency equivalent senior financial officer) is responsible for approving the CPLP and
1185          dispensing funding to the Learning Program Managers and must, therefore, be kept
1186          informed about program implementation and measurements.
1187      •   Chief Learning Officer – The Chief Learning Officer is responsible for learning in the
1188          organization and is an important ally for the CPLP. The CLO may provide the learning
1189          infrastructure, such as the Learning Management System (LMS) or other distribution
1190          platforms.
1191      •   Personnel – Create a communications strategy that allows for direct email messages to
1192          personnel, as well as a distributed system to their managers and supervisors. When
1193          creating communications materials about the CPLP for individual contributors, such as
1194          email blasts or the materials in the new hire orientation packages, focus efforts on
1195          enabling the individual contributor to see their part in the overall CPLP. It should include
1196          a schedule to ensure that users are notified in sufficient time before they are required to
1197          complete the learning activity.
