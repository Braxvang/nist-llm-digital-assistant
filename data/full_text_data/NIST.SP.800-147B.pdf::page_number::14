3.    BIOS Security Principles

The security principles presented in NIST SP 800-147 for client systems—update authentication, flash
region integrity, and non-bypassability—apply directly to server class machines. These security principles
are intended to mitigate threats targeting the system BIOS. The complexity of server architectures and the
multiple update paths for BIOS on servers require the extension of the guidelines in NIST SP 800-147.
This section enumerates the requirements for servers to assert the security principles for BIOS update.
The principles use the terms authorize and authenticate in the following context. Authentication of an
image assures the integrity and origin of the image. It is typically rooted at the firmware or server
manufacturer. Authentication is performed cryptographically using digital signatures. Authorization is
permission for an update to be performed by the system. Authorization of updates is typically rooted in
the server administrator.

3.1   BIOS Update Authentication

Authenticated BIOS update mechanisms shall be implemented in an RTU (see Section 2.5). These
mechanisms employ digital signatures to ensure the authenticity and integrity of BIOS update images.
The Verification Component of the RTU shall contain the digital signature verification algorithm and a
key store. The key store shall include the public key needed to verify the signature of the BIOS update
image or an approved cryptographic hash [FIPS180-4] of the key. In the latter case, the update
mechanism shall hash the public key provided with the BIOS update image and ensure that it matches a
hash which appears in the key store before using the provided public key to verify the signature on the
BIOS update image.

BIOS images shall be signed in conformance with NIST SP 800-89, Recommendation for Obtaining
Assurances for Digital Signature Applications [SP800-89], using an approved digital signature algorithm
as specified in NIST FIPS 186-4, Digital Signature Standard (DSS) [FIPS186-4], that provides at least
112 bits of security strength, in accordance with NIST SP 800-131A, Transitions: Recommendation for
Transitioning the Use of Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Lengths [SP800-131A].

Authenticated update mechanisms shall ensure that BIOS update images have been digitally signed and
that the digital signature can be verified using a key stored or verified by the RTU before updating the
BIOS. These mechanisms may also verify digital signatures over BIOS code in flash memory prior to
execution, particularly if the BIOS flash is not protected (see Section 3.3). Recovery mechanisms should
also use an authenticated update mechanism, unless the recovery process meets the guidelines for a secure
local update.

The system should provide mechanisms capable of preventing unauthorized update of the BIOS to an
earlier authentic version. This limitation of the rollback mechanism may be accomplished, for example,
by verifying that the version number of the BIOS image is higher than the currently installed BIOS
image’s version number. Appropriate rollback protections will depend upon the environment in which
the server is used and the security and availability needs of the organization operating the server. The
system may allow administrators to authorize rollback to an earlier version, disable these mechanisms, or
otherwise configure these mechanisms based on their needs.


3.2   Secure Local Update

Servers may optionally include a secure local update mechanism that updates the system BIOS without
using the authenticated update mechanism. Secure local update mechanisms shall authorize and
authenticate the BIOS update image by requiring that an administrator be physically present at the server
