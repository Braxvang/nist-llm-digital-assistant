                                 GUIDE TO MALWARE INCIDENT PREVENTION AND HANDLING FOR DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS


4.1.3    Acquiring Tools and Resources

Organizations should also ensure that they have the necessary tools (hardware and software) and
resources to assist in malware incident handling. See Section 4.2.4 for more information on malware
analysis toolkits, systems, and other related resources.

4.2     Detection and Analysis

Organizations should strive to detect and validate malware incidents rapidly to minimize the number of
infected hosts and the amount of damage the organization sustains. Because malware can take many
forms and be distributed through many means, there are many possible signs of a malware incident and
many locations within an organization where the signs might be recorded or observed. It sometimes takes
considerable analysis, requiring extensive technical knowledge and experience, to confirm that an
incident has been caused by malware, particularly if the malware threat is new and unknown. After
malware incident detection and validation, incident handlers should determine the type, extent, and
magnitude of the problem as quickly as possible so that the response to the incident can be given the
appropriate priority. Sections 4.2.1 through 4.2.4 provide guidance on identifying the characteristics of
incidents, identifying infected hosts, prioritizing incident response efforts, and analyzing malware,
respectively.

4.2.1    Identifying Malware Incident Characteristics

Because no indicator is completely reliable—even antivirus software might miscategorize benign activity
as malicious—incident handlers need to analyze any suspected malware incident and validate that
malware is the cause. In some cases, such as a massive, organization-wide infection, validation may be
unnecessary because the nature of the incident is obvious. The goal is for incident handlers to be as
certain as feasible that an incident is caused by malware and to have a basic understanding of the type of
malware threat responsible, such as a worm or a Trojan horse. If the source of the incident cannot easily
be confirmed, it is often better to respond as if it were caused by malware and to alter response efforts if it
is later determined that malware is not involved. Waiting for conclusive evidence of malware might have
a serious negative impact on response efforts and significantly increase the damage sustained by the
organization.

As part of the analysis and validation process, incident handlers typically identify characteristics of the
malware activity by examining detection sources. Understanding the activity’s characteristics is very
helpful in assigning an appropriate priority to the incident response efforts and planning effective
containment, eradication, and recovery activities. Incident handlers should collaborate with security
administrators in advance to identify data sources that can aid in detecting malware information and to
understand what types of information each data source may record. In addition to the obvious sources of
data, such as antivirus software, intrusion detection system (IDS), and security information and event
management (SIEM) technologies, incident handlers should be aware of and use secondary sources as
appropriate. See Section 4.2 for more information on possible sources of malware characteristic
information.

Once incident handlers have reviewed detection source data and identified characteristics of the malware,
the handlers could search for those characteristics in antivirus vendors’ malware databases and identify
which instance of malware is the most likely cause. If the malware has been known for some time, it is
likely that antivirus vendors will have a substantial amount of information on it, such as the following:
