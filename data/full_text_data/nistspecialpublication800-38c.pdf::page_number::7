1   Purpose

This publication is the third Part in a series of Recommendations regarding modes of operation
of symmetric key block cipher algorithms.


2   Authority

This document has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements,
for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such
standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent
with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section
8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of
Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by federal agencies. It may be used by
nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright. (Attribution
would be appreciated by NIST.)

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made
mandatory and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory
authority. Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing
authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.

Conformance testing for implementations of the mode of operation that is specified in this Part
of the Recommendation will be conducted within the framework of the Cryptographic Module
Validation Program (CMVP), a joint effort of NIST and the Communications Security
Establishment of the Government of Canada. An implementation of a mode of operation must
adhere to the requirements in this Recommendation in order to be validated under the CMVP.
The requirements of this Recommendation are indicated by the word “shall.”


3   Introduction

This Recommendation specifies an algorithm, Counter with Cipher Block Chaining-Message
Authentication Code [1], abbreviated CCM, that can provide assurance of the confidentiality and
authenticity of data. CCM is based on an approved symmetric key block cipher algorithm whose
block size is 128 bits, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm currently
specified in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Pub. 197 [2]; thus, CCM cannot be
used with the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm [3], whose block size is 64 bits. CCM can be
considered a mode of operation of the block cipher algorithm. As with other modes of operation,
