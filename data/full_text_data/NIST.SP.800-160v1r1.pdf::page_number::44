     part of the system structure and are, therefore, embodied in the architecture of the system.
     For example, the functional architecture may segment system functions (including security
     functions) into different subsystems, reducing the possibility of interference among functions
     as well as limiting the propagation of erroneous behavior. Passive aspects inherently reduce
     the susceptibility of the system to exposure, hazard, and vulnerability, thereby limiting if not
     eliminating the potential for loss scenarios. The employment of passive aspects generally
     enables greater confidence in the protection capability of the system.
•    Active aspects of the security function exhibit behavior (i.e., are functional in nature). They
     include engineered features and devices, referred to as controls, countermeasures, features,
     inhibits, mechanisms, overrides, safeguards, or services. The active aspects are employed or
     allocated within the system architecture, have a specific design, and have capabilities and
     limitations that affect their suitability and effectiveness relative to their intended use.

Passive and active aspects of security function factor into trades, as discussed in Section D.4.4.
Active aspects may also require additional hardware or loads on existing hardware; increasing
demands for size, weight, and power (SWaP); and making active aspects a challenge for SWaP-
restricted systems (e.g., satellites).

Life cycle assets are associated with the system but are not engineered into or delivered with the
system. Their association with the system means that they can be the direct cause of loss or a
conduit/means through which a loss can occur. Life cycle assets have several types:
•    Systems that interact with the system of interest, including conceptual systems
•    Intellectual property in various forms, including proprietary algorithms, technologies, and
     technology solutions
•    Data and information associated with the system
•    Developmental, manufacturing, fabrication, and production capabilities and systems used to
     utilize, operate, and sustain the system 42

           Demonstrating System Security
Demonstrating that a system is adequately secure (Section 3.2) assures stakeholders that their
objectives, needs, concerns, and associated constraints have been addressed. Such demonstration
must consider the system as an emergent 43 whole that consists of:
•    The required capability it delivers
•    The protection capability



42
   Examples include software and hardware development tools and suites; modeling and simulation environments and tools; maintenance and
diagnostics devices, components, and suites; simulators and test-case scenario generators; and training systems. While these assets are not
necessarily within the scope of engineering the system of interest, behaviors and outcomes of these systems have security implications that must
be addressed in the secure design of the system of interest. The behaviors and outcomes to consider include how they might directly or indirectly
enable, interface, interact, and interoperate with the system of interest.
43
   An emergent property is a property exhibited by entities that is meaningful only when attributed to the whole, not to any individual constituent
element [27]. Emergent properties of systems include its capability, safety, security, reliability, resilience, survivability, agility, maintainability,
and availability. Appendix D discusses emergence in greater detail.
