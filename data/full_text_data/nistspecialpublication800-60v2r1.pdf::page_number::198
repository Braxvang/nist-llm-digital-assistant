Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for disclosure of health care research and practitioner education information is
low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Unauthorized
modification or destruction of information affecting external communications that contain health

adversely affect operations and public confidence in the agency and also the agency mission.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
health care research and practitioner education information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish health care research and practitioner education.
Health care research and practitioner education information are generally tolerant of delay.
Typically, disruption of health care research and practitioner education information can be
expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
health care research and practitioner education information is low.
