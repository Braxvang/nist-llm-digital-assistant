of the tag, and the method by which the tag is affixed to and removed from its associated object. Tags
typically vary in size from smaller than a postage stamp to about the size of a common document stapler.
Active tags typically are significantly larger and heavier than passive tags because they have an onboard
power supply. Tags that integrate environmental sensors are also larger and heavier than those without
this functionality. While increasing the computing functionality of a tag increases its cost and power
requirements, it may not have an impact on its form factor because the microchip on a passive tag is one
of the tag’s smallest components. On most passive tags, the largest component on the tag is its antenna.

Tags can be attached to items using an adhesive or can be embedded within the item. The primary
concern when a tag is attached to an item is how easily it might be detached, whether accidentally or
maliciously. Tags attached to items also are more vulnerable to harsh environmental conditions such as
dust, debris, humidity, precipitation, and extreme temperatures. However, the vulnerability is intentional
in some cases. For example, RFID tags known as frangible tags allow users to deactivate tags by tearing
the tag’s antenna from its circuitry. Organizations can create frangible tags on-site using a printer similar
to the one shown in Figure 2-2. Tags that are embedded in objects (e.g., smart cards, animal tissue,
plastic housing) are less vulnerable to tampering and environmental conditions.

2.3.2   Reader Characteristics

The tag and the reader must comply with the same standard in order to communicate. If a tag is based on
a proprietary design, a reader must support the same communication protocol to communicate with that
tag. In many cases, if proprietary tags are used, only proprietary RFID readers from the same vendor can
be used. Reader characteristics that are independent of tag characteristics include:

 Power output and duty cycle,
 Enterprise subsystem interface,
 Mobility, and
 Antenna design and placement.
These reader characteristics are discussed in Sections 2.3.2.1 through 2.3.2.4.
