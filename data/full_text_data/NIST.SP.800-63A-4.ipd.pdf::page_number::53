       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                             Digital Identity Guidelines

1335   8.   Privacy Considerations
1336   This section is informative.
1337   These privacy considerations provide additional information in implementing the
1338   requirements set forth in Sec. 5.1.2.

1339   8.1. Collection and Data Minimization
1340   The guidelines permit the collection of only the PII necessary to validate the existence
1341   of the claimed identity and associate the claimed identity to the applicant, based on
1342   best available practices for appropriate identity resolution, validation, and verification.
1343   Collecting unnecessary PII can create confusion regarding why information not being
1344   used for the identity proofing service is being collected. This leads to invasiveness or
1345   overreach concerns, which can lead to loss of applicant trust. Further, PII retention can
1346   become vulnerable to unauthorized access or use. Data minimization reduces the amount
1347   of PII vulnerable to unauthorized access or use, and encourages trust in the identity
1348   proofing process.

1349   8.1.1. Social Security Numbers
1350   These guidelines permit the CSP collection of the SSN as an attribute for use in identity
1351   resolution. However, over-reliance on the SSN can contribute to misuse and place the
1352   applicant at risk of harm, such as through identity theft. Nonetheless, the SSN may
1353   facilitate identity resolution for CSPs, in particular federal agencies that use the SSN
1354   to correlate an applicant to agency records. This document recognizes the role of the SSN
1355   as an attribute and makes appropriate allowance for its use. Knowledge of the SSN is not
1356   sufficient to serve as identity evidence.
1357   Where possible, CSPs and agencies should consider mechanisms to limit the proliferation
1358   and exposure of SSNs during the identity proofing process. This is particularly pertinent
1359   where the SSN is communicated to third party providers during attribute validation
1360   processes. To the extent possible, privacy protective techniques and technologies should
1361   be applied to reduce the risk of an individualâ€™s SSN being exposed, stored, or maintained
1362   by third party systems. Examples of this could be the use of attribute claims (e.g., yes/no
1363   responses from a validator) to confirm the validity of a SSN without requiring it to be
1364   unnecessarily transmitted and stored by the third party. As with all attributes in the
1365   identity proofing process, the value and risk of each attribute being processed is subject
1366   to a privacy risk assessment and for federal agencies the PIA and SORN. The SSN
1367   should only be collected where it is necessary to support resolution associated with the
1368   applications assurance and risk levels.

1369   8.2. Notice and Consent
1370   The guidelines require the CSP to provide explicit notice to the applicant at the time of
1371   collection regarding the purpose for collecting and maintaining a record of the attributes
