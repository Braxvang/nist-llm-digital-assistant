The legal, moral, and ethical reviews of each of these dimensions are independent of the
others. In practice, this might mean that the project is safe (the proposed use of the appro-
priate), the people are safe (e.g., the researchers are noted academics with respected histo-
ries of collaborative work), the data are safe (i.e., there is no disclosure risk in the data),
and the output is safe (i.e., it will not disclose personal information). However, because the
setting is not safe (perhaps the facility has poor internal security), the project should not go
forward. In this example, the Five Safes framework would provide a decision-maker with
the tools to separate each of these dimensions and resolve the problems so that the project
can proceed.
One of the positive aspects of the Five Safes framework is that it forces data controllers to
consider many different aspects of data release when evaluating data access proposals. It is
common for data owners to “focus on one, and only one, particular issue (such as the legal
framework surrounding access to their data or [Information Technology] (IT) solutions).”
With the Five Safes, people who may be specialists in one area are forced to consider (or to
explicitly not consider) aspects of privacy protection with which they may not be familiar
and might otherwise overlook.
The so-called evidence-based, default-open, risk-managed, user-centered (EDRU) approach [73,
136], which provides tools for putting these decisions into context and weighing potential
risks against potential benefts.
Agencies should determine if a framework such as The Five Safes is appropriate for de-
signing access systems, evaluating existing systems, communication, and training.

3.6.   Disclosure Review Boards
Disclosure Review Boards (DRBs), also known as Data Release Boards, are administra-
tive bodies created within an organization that are charged with ensuring that intended
disclosures meet the policy and procedural requirements of that organization. DRBs pro-
vide organizations with a structured approach for identifying, managing and documenting
risks associated with data publishing in a systematic, consistent and accountable manner.
DRBs can act as a center to keep records and release reports. DRBs also allow for the
accumulation of disclosure avoidance expertise within an organization and can serve as
centers of training and advocacy for proper disclosure handling practices. As such, DRBs
can be a powerful tool to allow agencies and their Chief Data Offcers to comply with the
legal requirements of the Evidence Act and with its implementation memorandum M-19-
23. [168]23

23 OMB Memorandum M-19-23, “Phase 1 Implementation of the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policy-

 making Act of 2018: Learning Agendas, Personnel, and Planning Guidance” [168] requires that agencies
 undertake learning agenda activities that are “in accordance with applicable law governing the collection,
 use and disclosure of data and information.” (p. 19) It also requires that Chief Data Offcers have “strong
 business acumen and familiarity with data science approaches, cloud computing, cyber security, privacy,
 confdentiality, data analytics, statistical methods, policy analysis, information quality standards set out in
