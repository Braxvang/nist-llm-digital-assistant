                                    ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



Executive Summary

A wireless local area network (WLAN) enables access to computing resources for devices that are not
physically connected to a network. WLANs typically operate over a fairly limited range, such as an
office building or building campus, and usually are implemented as extensions to existing wired local area
networks to enhance user mobility. This guide seeks to assist organizations in better understanding the
most commonly used family of standards for WLANs—Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
(IEEE) 802.11—focusing on the security enhancements introduced in the IEEE 802.11i amendment. In
particular, this guide explains the security features and provides specific recommendations to ensure the
security of the operating environment.

Before IEEE 802.11i was finalized, IEEE 802.11 relied on a security method known as Wired Equivalent
Privacy (WEP), which has several well-documented security problems. The IEEE 802.11i amendment
introduces a range of new security features that are designed to overcome the shortcomings of WEP. It
introduces the concept of a Robust Security Network (RSN), which is defined as a wireless security
network that allows the creation of Robust Security Network Associations (RSNA) only. RSNAs are
wireless connections that provide moderate to high levels of assurance against WLAN security threats
through use of a variety of cryptographic techniques. This guide describes the operation of RSNs,
including the steps needed to establish an RSNA and the flows of information between RSN components.
The three types of RSN components are stations (STA), which are wireless endpoint devices such as
laptops and wireless handheld devices (e.g. PDAs, text messaging devices and smart phones); access
points (AP), which are network devices that allow STAs to communicate wirelessly and to connect to
another network, typically an organization’s wired infrastructure; and authentication servers (AS), which
provide authentication services to STAs. STAs and APs are also found in pre-RSN WLANs, but ASs are
a new WLAN component introduced by the RSN framework.

NIST recommends that Federal agencies implement the following recommendations to assist in
establishing and maintaining robust security for their IEEE 802.11i-based WLANs. Personnel
responsible for their implementation and maintenance should read the corresponding sections of the
document to ensure they have an adequate understanding of important related issues.

This publication covers IEEE 802.11i-based wireless LANs only. It does not replace NIST Special
Publication (SP) 800-48, Wireless Network Security: 802.11, Bluetooth and Handheld Devices, which
addresses IEEE 802.11b and 802.11g-based wireless LANs, Bluetooth implementations, and wireless
handheld devices (e.g., text messaging devices, PDAs, smart phones). Organizations with existing IEEE
802.11b or 802.11g implementations should continue to use the recommendations in SP 800-48 to secure
them; they should also review this publication to understand the new IEEE 802.11i technology and how it
addresses the shortcomings of the Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol used to secure IEEE
802.11b and 802.11g networks. Organizations that are considering the deployment of new wireless LANs
should be evaluating IEEE 802.11i-based products and following the recommendations for IEEE 802.11i
implementations in this publication.

Organizations should ensure that all WLAN components use Federal Information Processing
Standards (FIPS)-approved cryptographic algorithms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of
WLAN communications.

The IEEE 802.11i amendment defines two data confidentiality and integrity protocols for RSNAs:
Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) and Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message
Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP). This guide discusses both protocols at length, as well as the
cryptographic keys created and used by these protocols. Federal agencies are required to use
