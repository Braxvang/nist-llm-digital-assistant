Choose K + 1 classes or cells for U, i.e., {U = 0},{U = 1},…,{U = K −1},{U ≥ K } . The theoretical
probabilities π 0 , π 1,…, π K +1 of these cells are found from the above formulas. A reasonable choice
could be K = 5, λ = 2,η = 1. €

After U1, …, UN are found, evaluate  the frequencies ν 0 ,ν1,…,ν K of each cell, ν 0 + ν1 + … + ν K = N ,

The expression for the P-value is the same as that used in Section 3.7. The interpretation is that for very
small P-values, the sequence shows irregular occurrences of m-runs of ones.

3.9 Maurer’s “Universal Statistical” Test
Ueli Maurer of the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University introduced this test in 1992.
Maurer's test statistic relates closely to the per-bit entropy of the stream, which its author asserts is “the
correct quality measure for a secret-key source in a cryptographic application.” As such, the test is
claimed to measure the actual cryptographic significance of a defect because it is “related to the running
time of [an] enemy's optimal key-search strategy,” or the effective key size of a cipher system.

The test is not designed to detect a very specific pattern or type of statistical defect. However, the test is
designed “to be able to detect any one of the very general class of statistical defects that can be modeled
