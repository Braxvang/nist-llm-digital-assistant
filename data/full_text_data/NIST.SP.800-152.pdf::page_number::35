SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


security of the module and to protect sensitive data, including secret and private plaintext
keys and sensitive metadata. The cryptographic module security policy includes
specifications for controlling access to the keys and metadata, the physical security provided
to protect the module’s storage and processing capabilities, and the mitigation of other
attacks specified in the policy. See [FIPS 140] for further information.

4.6   Other Related Security Policies

An FCKMS Security Policy could include or rely on other security policies or provisions,
such as a Physical Security Policy, a Communications Security Policy, and/or a Computer
Security Policy. Organizations typically develop their own physical security policies, and
computer systems are often built to their own computer security policies. An organization
should organize these policies in a logical structure that assigns roles for managing and
enforcing the policies to appropriate parts of the organization.

FR:4.4 The CKMS design shall specify other related security policies that support the
CKMS Security Policy.

                           Federal CKMS service-using organizations should coordinate
PA:4.2
                           with their service-providing organization in defining and
                           supporting security policies for providing key-management
                           services for their users.
                           A Federal CKMS service provider should have a Computer
PA:4.3
                           Security Policy.
                           A Federal CKMS service-using organization should create a
PA:4.4
                           Computer Security Policy that identifies:
                               a) The information that is processed, communicated, and
                                  stored within its computer systems that requires
                                  protection,
                               b) The threats that are to be protected against, and
                               c) The detailed rules for protecting the information by
                                  computers, communication systems, and computer
                                  users.
                           A Federal CKMS should use and support applications using
PA:4.5
                           computer operating systems that provide security in
                           accordance with the FCKMS service-using organization’s
                           Computer Security Policy.

4.7   Interrelationships among Policies

The Information Management Policy, Information Security Policy, FCKMS Security Policy,
FCKMS Module Security Policy, Cryptographic Module Security Policy and other related
security policies typically form a top-down layered set of policies in which a lower-layer
policy supports the policy/policies at the higher layers. For example, an Information
Management Policy for protecting certain categories of information from unauthorized
                                             25
