security categorization in accordance with FIPS 199. 20 The tailored security control baseline
(i.e., the appropriate control baseline from Appendix D tailored in accordance with the guidance
in Section 3.3) serves as the starting point for organizations in determining the appropriate
safeguards and countermeasures necessary to protect their information systems. Because the
baselines are intended to be broadly applicable starting points, supplements to the tailored
baselines (see Section 3.4) will likely be necessary in order to achieve adequate risk mitigation.
The tailored baselines are supplemented based on organizational assessments of risk and the
resulting controls documented in the security plans for the information systems.

Appendix D provides a listing of baseline security controls. Three sets of baseline controls have
been identified corresponding to the low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact levels
defined in the security categorization process in FIPS 199 and derived in Section 3.2. Each of the
three baselines provides an initial set of security controls for a particular impact level associated
with a security category. 21 Appendix F provides the complete catalog of security controls for
information systems, arranged by control families. The catalog represents the entire set of
security controls defined at this time. Chapter 3 provides additional information on how to use
security categories to select the appropriate set of baseline security controls, how to apply the
tailoring guidance to the baseline controls, and how to supplement the tailored baseline in order to
achieve adequate risk mitigation.


                                                  Implementation Tip
     Since the baseline security controls represent the minimum controls for low-impact, moderate-impact,
     and high-impact information systems, respectively, there are additional controls and control
     enhancements that appear in the catalog that are found in only higher-impact baselines or not used in
     any of the baselines. These additional security controls and control enhancements for the information
     system are available to organizations and can be used in supplementing the tailored baselines to
     achieve the needed level of protection in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk.
     Moreover, security controls and control enhancements contained in higher-level baselines can also be
     used by organizations to strengthen the level of protection provided in lower-level baselines, if deemed
     appropriate. At the end of the security control selection and specification process, the agreed-upon set
     of security controls documented in the security plan, must be sufficient to provide adequate security for
     the organization and mitigate risks to its operations, assets, and individuals.



2.3 COMMON SECURITY CONTROLS
An organization-wide view of an information security program facilitates the identification of
common security controls that can be applied to one or more organizational information systems.
Common security controls can apply to: (i) all organizational information systems; (ii) a group of
information systems at a specific site; or (iii) common information systems, subsystems, or
applications (i.e., common hardware, software, and/or firmware) deployed at multiple operational
sites. Common security controls have the following properties:
â€¢      The development, implementation, and assessment of common security controls can be
       assigned to responsible organizational officials or organizational elements (other than the

20
  FIPS 199 security categories are based on the potential impact on an organization or individuals should certain events
occur which jeopardize the information and information systems needed by the organization to accomplish its assigned
mission, protect its assets, fulfill its legal responsibilities, maintain its day-to-day functions, and protect individuals.
21
  The baseline security controls contained in Appendix D are not necessarily absolutes in that the tailoring guidance
described in Section 3.3 provides the organization the ability to eliminate certain controls or specify compensating
controls under strict terms and conditions.
