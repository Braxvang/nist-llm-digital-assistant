CHAPTER 8                                                         Security Planning


    The objective of system security planning is to improve the protection of
information system resources. All federal systems have some level of sensitivity and
require protection as part of good management practice. The protection of a system
must be documented in a system security plan. The completion of system security
plans is a requirement of the OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal
Information Resources, Appendix III, Security of Federal Automated Information
Resources, and Title III of the E-Government Act, FISMA.
   For the plans to adequately reflect the protection of the resources, a senior
management official must authorize a system to process information or operate. This
authorization provides an important quality control. By authorizing processing in a
system, the manager accepts its associated risk.
    Management authorization should be based on an assessment of management,
operational, and technical controls. Since the system security plan establishes and
documents the security controls, it should form the basis for the authorization,
supplemented by the assessment report and the POA&Ms. In addition, a periodic
review of controls should also contribute to future authorizations. Reauthorization
should occur prior to a significant change in processing, but at least every three
years.
