The preemptive aspect recognizes the conditions under which loss may occur and addresses the
scenarios before loss occurs (i.e., what can happen). If the loss does occur, the results are limited
due to system features and actions taken in advance. The preemptive aspect is independent of
any specific knowledge of attacks and attacker objectives, instead focusing on what is possible in
the systemâ€™s life cycle. The reactive aspect recognizes the limits of certainty about what can
happen, and that new, unanticipated, and otherwise unforeseen adverse consequences will occur
despite proactive planning and instituting of means and methods to control loss and the extent of
its consequences. The reactive aspect promotes informed operational decision-making after the
system is in use and a loss condition occurs, proactively providing an operations capability to
address the loss condition and handle the loss. The reactive aspect complements the preemptive
