Datagram Protocol (UDP) as well as IP. The most powerful firewalls are application layer or proxy
firewalls that are able to understand and filter Web content. 67

A common misperception about firewalls (and routers acting as firewalls) is that they eliminate all risk
and can protect against misconfiguration of the Web server or poor network design. Unfortunately, this is
not the case. Firewalls and routers themselves are vulnerable to misconfiguration and software
vulnerabilities. In addition, many firewalls have limited insight into the application layer where many
attacks occur. Thus, Web servers in particular are vulnerable to many attacks, even when located behind
a secure, well-configured firewall.

A firewall (or router acting as a firewall) that is protecting a Web server should be configured to block all
access to the Web server from the Internet except the necessary ports, such as TCP ports 80 (HTTP) and
443 (HTTPS). A firewall is the first line of defense for a Web server; however, to be truly secure,
organizations need to implement layered protection for their Web servers (and networks). Most
importantly, organizations should strive to maintain all systems in a secure posture and not depend solely
on firewalls, routers, or any other single component to stop attackers.

A modern enterprise router is able to function as a network and transport layer filter (e.g., a basic
firewall). A router functioning as a network/transport layer firewall can provide filtering based on several
pieces of information [NIST02a], including the following:

 Source IP address

 Destination IP address

 Traffic type

 TCP/UDP port number and state.

The strength of routers is in their cost. Most organizations already have a border router that can be
configured to provide network/transport layer firewall capabilities.

The weaknesses of routers include the following:

 Susceptibility to application layer attacks (e.g., cannot examine Web content for embedded malicious
  code)

 Susceptibility to attacks via allowed ports

 Difficulty of configuration and administration

 Limitations in logging capabilities

 Processing capabilities that may be more limited and overtaxed by complex rule sets (i.e., access
  control lists)

 Insufficient rule set expressiveness and filtering capabilities.
