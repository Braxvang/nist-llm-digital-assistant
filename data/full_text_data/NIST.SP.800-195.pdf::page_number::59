      Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP)                                 2016.
     The Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP)
was developed to support the federal user communities for
strong, independently tested, and commercially available
cryptographic modules. Through this program, the CMVP
works with international government, public and private
sectors as a part of the cryptographic community to
achieve standards-based security and assurance of correct
implementation. The goal is to provide federal agencies
with a security metric to use in procuring and deploying
cryptographic modules, and promote the use of validated
modules by industry and the public. The testing performed
by independent third-party laboratories accredited by
the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program
(NVLAP), and the validations performed by the CMVP
program provide this metric. Federal agencies, industry,
and the public can choose cryptographic modules and/or
products containing cryptographic modules from the CMVP
Validated Modules List and have confidence in the claimed
level of security and assurance of correct implementation.
     Cryptographic module testing and validation are
based on published NIST standards. Since federal agencies                             Figure 17: FY 2016 CMVP Certificates by Security Level
