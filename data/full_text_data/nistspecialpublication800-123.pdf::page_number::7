                                                                          GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



Executive Summary

An organization’s servers provide a wide variety of services to internal and external users, and many
servers also store or process sensitive information for the organization. Some of the most common types
of servers are Web, email, database, infrastructure management, and file servers. This publication
addresses the general security issues of typical servers.

Servers are frequently targeted by attackers because of the value of their data and services. For example,
a server might contain personally identifiable information that could be used to perform identity theft.
The following are examples of common security threats to servers:

 Malicious entities may exploit software bugs in the server or its underlying operating system to gain
  unauthorized access to the server.

 Denial of service (DoS) attacks may be directed to the server or its supporting network infrastructure,
  denying or hindering valid users from making use of its services.

 Sensitive information on the server may be read by unauthorized individuals or changed in an
  unauthorized manner.

 Sensitive information transmitted unencrypted or weakly encrypted between the server and the client
  may be intercepted.

 Malicious entities may gain unauthorized access to resources elsewhere in the organization’s network
  via a successful attack on the server.

 Malicious entities may attack other entities after compromising a server. These attacks can be
  launched directly (e.g., from the compromised host against an external server) or indirectly (e.g.,
  placing malicious content on the compromised server that attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in the
  clients of users accessing the server).

This document is intended to assist organizations in installing, configuring, and maintaining secure
servers. More specifically, this document describes, in detail, the following practices to apply:

 Securing, installing, and configuring the underlying operating system

 Securing, installing, and configuring server software

 Maintaining the secure configuration through application of appropriate patches and upgrades,
  security testing, monitoring of logs, and backups of data and operating system files.

The following key guidelines are recommended to Federal departments and agencies for maintaining a
secure server.

Organizations should carefully plan and address the security aspects of the deployment of a server.

Because it is much more difficult to address security once deployment and implementation have occurred,
security should be carefully considered from the initial planning stage. Organizations are more likely to
make decisions about configuring computers appropriately and consistently when they develop and use a
detailed, well-designed deployment plan. Developing such a plan will support server administrators in
making the inevitable tradeoff decisions between usability, performance, and risk.
