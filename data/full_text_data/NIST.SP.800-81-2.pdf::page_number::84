SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



    •   Publication of the public key by incorporation of the DNSKEY RR in the zone file

    •   Generation of digital signatures for zone data (zone signing).
Additional tasks are involved for a chained secure zone. To be part of the chain of trust, the zone has to
inform its parent of its public key (KSK-public) securely (through out-of-DNS channel means). The
parent then creates a hash of the public key of its child and stores it in the parent zone in a new RR called
a DS RR [RFC4034]. Or the child zone can generate its own DS RRset and upload that to its parent zone
for inclusion in the parent zone. It also signs this DS RR by generating a RRSIG RR. Practical conditions
dictate, however, that the keys periodically have to be changed because any key can be broken with
sufficient computing power. In a chained secure zone, whenever a zone changes its KSK, its parent has to
be notified of the new key. The parent then has to add or generate a new DS RR and sign it again. To
reduce the administrative burden involved, a common strategy is to use another key pair, the KSK. The
KSK is used for signing only the DNSKEY RRSet; all of the other authoritative RRsets in the zone file
are signed with the ZSK. The KSK is the key that is published to the parent. The parent will generate (or
simply add) the DS RR and a RRSIG RR using the parent’s own ZSK. The KSK is used less frequently to
only sign the DNSKEY RRset and hence needs to be changed less frequently. There may be situations,
however, in which either because of the manageable frequency of key rollovers (key change) or the
criticality of DNS information served by the zone, administrators may not use two distinct key pairs for
the ZSK and KSK.

In summary, the additional tasks that take place in a chained secure zone are as follows:

    •   Secure transmission of the KSK or DS by a secure zone to its parent. This transmission is
        accomplished out of band and may not involve any DNS transactions.

    •   The parent stores the child’s KSK in a special keyset file directory, generates a hash of the key,
        and stores the hash in a DS RR. The parent also generates the digital signature (RRSIG RR) for
        this DS RR and includes it with the other delegation information. OR The parent adds the DS to
        its zone database after the child uploads the DS RRset.
The zone whose signed response needs to be verified (i.e., the target zone) is the leaf node of the chain of
trust. The pre-requisite for this operation is to establish trust in the ZSK of the zone. The trust in a zone’s
ZSK is established through the following operations:

    •   Authenticated referral from the parent

    •   Authenticating the KSK of the child zone.
To understand authenticated referral from the parent, it is necessary to look at the normal DNS referral
process. In the normal DNS query, a zone that does not have authoritative information pertaining to a
query for a domain name in a child zone provides a hint or referral by providing the NS RRSet and
associated additional information (RRs that contain the IP addresses for servers provided in the NS
RRSet). In normal DNS query processing, following this referral is an acceptable processing step. This
process is insufficient, however, from the point of view of establishing a chain of trust; the information
about the NS RRSet and associated glue RRs (or any other additional information) cannot be considered
authentic because they are not signed with the public key of the authoritative source (i.e., the child zone).
To enable authentication of this referral information, the parent provides the cryptographic hint through
the DS RR.
