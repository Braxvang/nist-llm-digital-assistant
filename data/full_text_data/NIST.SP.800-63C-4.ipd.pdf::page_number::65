1695   8.   Security
1696   This section is informative.
1697   Since the federated authentication process involves coordination between multiple
1698   components, including the CSP which now acts as an IdP, there are additional
1699   opportunities for attackers to compromise federated identity transactions. This section
1700   summarizes many of the attacks and mitigations applicable to federation.

1701   8.1. Federation Threats
1702   As in non-federated authentication, attackersâ€™ motivations are typically to gain access
1703   (or a greater level of access) to a resource or service provided by an RP. Attackers may
1704   also attempt to impersonate a subscriber. Rogue or compromised IdPs, RPs, user agents
1705   (e.g., browsers), and parties outside of a typical federation transaction are potential
1706   attackers. To accomplish their attack, they might intercept or modify assertions and
1707   assertion references. Further, two or more entities may attempt to subvert federation
1708   protocols by directly compromising the integrity or confidentiality of the assertion data.
1709   For the purpose of these types of threats, any authorized parties who attempt to exceed
1710   their privileges are considered attackers.
