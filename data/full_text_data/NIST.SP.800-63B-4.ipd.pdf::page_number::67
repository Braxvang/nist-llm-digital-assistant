        Theft                  Use multi-factor authenticators   4.2.1, 4.3.1
                               that need to be activated
                               through a memorized secret
                               or biometric.
                               Use a combination of              4.2.1, 4.3.1
                               authenticators that includes a
                               memorized secret or biometric.
