CHAPTER 14                                              Configuration Management


Step 2: Evaluate Change Request
   After initiating a change request, the effects that the change may have on the
system or other interrelated systems must be evaluated. An impact analysis of the
change should be conducted using the following as a guideline:
   • Whether the change is viable and improves the performance or the security of
     the system;
   • Whether the change is technically correct, necessary, and feasible within the
     system constraints;
   • Whether system security will be affected by the change;
   • Whether associated costs for implementing the change were considered; and
   • Whether security components are affected by the change.

Step 3: Implementation Decision
   Once the change has been evaluated and tested, one of the following actions
should be taken:
   • Approve. Implementation is authorized and may occur at any time after the
     appropriate authorization signature has been documented.
   • Deny. Immediate denial of the request regardless of circumstances and
     information provided.
   • Defer. Immediate decision is postponed until further notice. In this situation,
     additional testing or analysis may be needed before a final decision can be
     made.

Step 4: Implement Approved Change Request
   Once the decision to implement the change has been made, it should be moved
from the test environment into production. If required, the personnel updating the
production environment should be separate from those individuals that developed
the change to provide a greater assurance that unapproved changes do not get
implemented into production.

Step 5: Continuous Monitoring
    The CM process calls for continuous system monitoring to ensure that it is
operating as intended and that implemented changes do not adversely impact either
the performance or security posture of the system. Agencies can achieve the goals
of continuous system monitoring by performing configuration verification tests to
ensure that the selected configuration for a given system has not been altered
outside of the established CM process. In addition to configuration verification tests,
agencies can also perform system audits. Both configuration verification tests and
system audits entail an examination of characteristics of the system and supporting
documentation to verify that the configuration meets user needs and ensure that the
current configuration is the approved system configuration baseline.
    As part of the overall CM process, agencies should also perform patch
management activities during this step. Patch management assists in the process of
lowering the potential risk to a network by “patching” or repairing known
vulnerabilities in any of the network or system environments. Increasingly, vendors
are proactive in developing and releasing to the public fixes (or antidotes) to known
vulnerabilities, and agencies must remain vigilant to ensure that they capture all
relevant fixes as they are released, test their implementation for adverse effects, and
