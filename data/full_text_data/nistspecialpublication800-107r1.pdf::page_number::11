4.2    Strengths of the Approved Hash Algorithms
Table 1 provides a summary of the security strengths for the hash function security
properties (discussed in the previous section) of the approved hash functions.

As mentioned in Section 4.1, the expected collision resistance strength of any approved
hash function is, in general, half the length of its hash value. This is currently believed to
be true for all the approved hash functions except SHA-1. The latest cryptanalytic results
for SHA-1 [SHA1 Attack] indicate that it may have a collision resistance strength that is
considerably less than its expected strength of 80 bits.
The expected preimage resistance strengths of the approved hash functions are provided
in the above table. At the time that this Recommendation was written, there had been no
known short cuts for finding preimages of the hash values generated by the approved
hash algorithms.
Except for SHA-384, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256, the second preimage resistance
strengths of the approved hash functions depend not only on the functions themselves,
but also on the sizes of the messages that the hash functions process [Second Preimage
Attack]. In Table 1, the low end of each range applies to the situation where the length of
