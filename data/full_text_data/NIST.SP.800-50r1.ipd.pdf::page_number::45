1277   authentication on their devices when accessing the organization’s systems, and they will be
1278   informed of the cybersecurity or privacy benefits and purpose of the methodology. Those with
1279   significant cybersecurity and privacy responsibilities will be trained to add this capability to
1280   authentication systems and assist personnel at the organization’s helpdesk. Senior leadership will
1281   participate because they are crucial to ensuring that the goal is well-communicated and supported
1282   throughout the organization.

1283   3.1.2.1.       Identify Learning Needs
1284   The most important step in initiating a new phase in the CPLP is to establish the learning needs.
1285   For example, the organization may be about to introduce new technology, legislation may have
1286   been passed that requires personnel to acquire new knowledge or skills, or a new privacy or
1287   cybersecurity risk may have emerged that requires the organization to introduce a new learning
1288   module. Identifying and prioritizing learning needs will allow the Learning Program Manager to
1289   focus their attention on the issues of greatest importance to the organization.
1290   The following techniques can help define the learning needs:
1291      •   Identify what knowledge or skills are needed in the organization through a learning needs
1292          assessment
1293      •   Review existing work or job analysis reports
1294      •   Identify any regulatory or other requirements for learning programs
1295      •   Review cybersecurity or privacy risks. All organizations face operational risks. While the
1296          majority of risk considerations focus on responding to incidents that result in a failure to
1297          maintain cybersecurity, it is important to include an effective learning plan as a
1298          mitigation factor for risks
1299      •   Review lessons learned or after-action reports. After an incident, the Learning Program
1300          Manager may be engaged in an effort to educate personnel on corrective best practices.
1301          This is an important opportunity to truly learn from mistakes. New material should be
1302          developed that not only speaks to the specifics of the incident but may be able to shore up
1303          weak areas around it, such as identifying and reporting vulnerabilities

1304   3.1.2.2.       Determining the CPLP Audiences
1305   During the analysis phase, the Learning Program Manager will identify and define the audiences
1306   to be trained on the identified learning goals. By coordinating with the organization’s
1307   cybersecurity and privacy learning function, supervisors may be helpful in determining whether
1308   personnel need additional training.
1309   Potential audiences for the CPLP include:
1310      •   New employees: This audience includes contractors, and the focus is usually on the
1311          important policies and rules of behavior for the systems that they will access. This
1312          training includes what is typically called “new employee orientation” or “on-boarding”
1313          and can be joint cybersecurity and privacy training. Some organizations may need to
