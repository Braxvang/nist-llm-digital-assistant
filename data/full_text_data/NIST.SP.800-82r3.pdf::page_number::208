systems to the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards.

D.1.5.4.     ISA-TR84.00.09, Cybersecurity Related to the Functional Safety
   Lifecycle
This document provides guidance for integrating the cybersecurity life cycle with the safety life
cycle as they relate to Safety Controls, Alarms, and Interlocks (SCAI), inclusive of safety
instrumented systems (SISs). This scope includes the work processes and countermeasures used
to reduce the risk involved due to cybersecurity threats to the industrial automation and control
system (IACS) network.

D.1.6. International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an independent, non-governmental
international organization with a membership of 165 national standards bodies. Through its
members, it brings together experts to share knowledge and develop voluntary, consensus-based,
and market-relevant international standards that support innovation and provide solutions to
global challenges. While the 27001/27002 standards are defined for IT systems and
environments, they still have many applications to OT security. The most recent versions of each
standard were released in 2013.
