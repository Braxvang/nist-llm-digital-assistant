SP 800-132          Recommendation for Password-Based Key Derivation        December 2010



    Recommendation for Password-Based Key Derivation
1       Introduction

The randomness of cryptographic keys is essential for the security of cryptographic
applications. In some applications, such as the protection of electronically stored data,
passwords may be the only input required from the users who are eligible to access the
data. Due to the low entropy and possibly poor randomness of those passwords, they are
not suitable to be used directly as cryptographic keys.

This Recommendation specifies a family of password-based key derivation functions
(PBKDFs) for deriving cryptographic keys from passwords or passphrases for the
protection of electronically-stored data or for the protection of data protection keys.

This publication has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal
Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347. NIST is
responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements
for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to
national security systems.

This Recommendation has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by
non-governmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright.
