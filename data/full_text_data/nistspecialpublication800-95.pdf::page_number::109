Document Type Definition (DTD): A document defining the format of the contents present between the
tags in an XML or SGML document, and the way they should be interpreted by the application reading
the XML or SGML document. [6]

Electronic Business XML (ebXML): Sponsored by UN/CEFACT and OASIS, a modular suite of
specifications that enable enterprises of any size and in any geographical location to perform business-to-
business transactions using XML. [7]

Extensible Markup Language (XML): A cross-platform, extensible, and text-based standard markup
language for representing structured data. It provides a cross-platform, software- and hardware-
independent tool for transmitting information. [35]

Federated Trust: Trust established within a federation, enabling each of the mutually trusting realms to
share and use trust information (e.g., credentials) obtained from any of the other mutually trusting realms.
[10]

Federation: A collection of realms (domains) that have established trust among themselves. The level
of trust may vary, but typically includes authentication and may include authorization. [10]

Framework: A layered structure indicating what kind of programs can or should be built and how they
would interrelate. Some computer system frameworks also include actual programs, specify
programming interfaces, or offer programming tools for using the frameworks. A framework may be for
a set of functions within a system and how they interrelate; the layers of an operating system; the layers of
an application subsystem; how communication should be standardized at some level of a network; and so
forth. A framework is generally more comprehensive than a protocol and more prescriptive than a
structure. [11]

Fuzz Testing: Similar to fault injection in that invalid data is input into the application via the
environment, or input by one process into another process. Fuzz testing is implemented by tools called
fuzzers, which are programs or script that submit some combination of inputs to the test target to reveal
how it responds. [12]

HyperText Transfer Protocol over SSL/TLS (HTTPS): HTTP transmitted over TLS. [13]

Interface: In a service-oriented architecture, a specification of the operations that a service offers its
clients. In WSDL 2.0 an interface component describes sequences of messages that a service sends or
receives. In WSDL 1.1 an interface is specified in a portType element. [14]

Intermediary Service: A component that lies between the Service Client (subscriber) and the Service
Provider (publisher). It intercepts the request from the Service Client, provides the service
(functionality), and forwards the request to the Service Provider. Similarly, it intercepts the response
from the Service Provider and forwards it to the Service Client. [15]

Kerberos: A means of verifying the identities of principals on an open network. Kerberos accomplishes
this without relying on the authentication, trustworthiness, or physical security of hosts while assuming
all packets can be read, modified and inserted at will. Kerberos uses a trust broker model and symmetric
cryptography to provide authentication and authorization of users and systems on the network. [16]

Message: The basic unit of data sent from one Web services agent to another in the context of Web
services. [1]
