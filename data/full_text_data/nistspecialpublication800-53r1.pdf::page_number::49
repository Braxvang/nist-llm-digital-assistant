Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1             Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


 System Security Plan                Formal document that provides an overview of the security
 [NIST SP 800-18, Rev 1]             requirements for the information system and describes the
                                     security controls in place or planned for meeting those
                                     requirements.
 Tailoring                           The process by which a security control baseline selected in
                                     accordance with the FIPS 199 security categorization of the
                                     information system is modified based on: (i) the application of
                                     scoping guidance; (ii) the specification of compensating security
                                     controls, if needed; and (iii) the specification of organization-
                                     defined parameters in the security controls, where allowed.
 Tailored Security Control           Set of security controls resulting from the application of the
 Baseline                            tailoring guidance to the security control baseline.
 Technical Controls                  The security controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) for an
 [FIPS 200]                          information system that are primarily implemented and executed
                                     by the information system through mechanisms contained in the
                                     hardware, software, or firmware components of the system.
 Threat                              Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact
 [CNSS Inst. 4009, Adapted]          agency operations (including mission, functions, image, or
                                     reputation), agency assets, or individuals through an information
                                     system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure,
                                     modification of information, and/or denial of service.
 Threat Source                       The intent and method targeted at the intentional exploitation of a
 [FIPS 200]                          vulnerability or a situation and method that may accidentally
                                     trigger a vulnerability. Synonymous with threat agent.
 Threat Assessment                   Formal description and evaluation of threat to an information
 [CNSS Inst. 4009]                   system.
 Trusted Path                        A mechanism by which a user (through an input device) can
                                     communicate directly with the security functions of the
                                     information system with the necessary confidence to support the
                                     system security policy. This mechanism can only be activated by
                                     the user or the security functions of the information system and
                                     cannot be imitated by untrusted software.
 User                                Individual or (system) process authorized to access an
 [CNSS Inst. 4009]                   information system.
 Vulnerability                       Weakness in an information system, system security procedures,
 [CNSS Inst. 4009, Adapted]          internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or
                                     triggered by a threat source.
 Vulnerability Assessment            Formal description and evaluation of the vulnerabilities in an
 [CNSS Inst. 4009]                   information system.
