typical issue is end users discovering and disabling the application whitelisting software. Many products
run in a stealth mode so that users cannot readily tell that they are running.

3.5     Management

The last phase of the planning and implementation model is the longest lasting. Managing the solution
involves operating the deployed solution and maintaining the application whitelisting architecture,
policies, software, and other solution components. Examples of typical actions include:

     Updating the whitelist to include new or updated applications;
     Testing and applying patches to the application whitelisting software;
     Deploying application whitelisting to additional platforms;
     Performing key management duties;
     Adapting policies as requirements change;
     Monitoring the components for operational and security issues;
     Periodically performing testing to ensure that application whitelisting is functioning properly; and
     Performing regular vulnerability assessments.
Organizations should pay particular attention to the ongoing whitelist updates. Although many, if not
most, whitelist updates can be automated, administrators should be prepared to make manual updates
quickly when needed, in order to identify emerging threats and correct false positives or negatives.
Organizations should also monitor any graylists and transfer their entries to whitelists or blacklists, as
appropriate.
