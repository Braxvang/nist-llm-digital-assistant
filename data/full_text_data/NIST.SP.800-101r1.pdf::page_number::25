                                                                  Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics


3. Forensic Tools

       The availability of forensic software tools for mobile devices is considerably different from
       that of personal computers. While personal computers may differ from mobile devices from a
       hardware and software perspective, their functionality has become increasingly similar.
       Although the majority of mobile device operating systems are open source (i.e., Android),
       feature phone OS’s are typically closed. Closed operating systems make interpreting their
       associated file system and structure difficult. Many mobile devices with the same operating
       system may also vary widely in their implementation, resulting in a myriad of file system and
       structure permutations. These permutations create significant challenges for mobile forensic
       tool manufacturers and examiners.

       The types of software available for mobile device examination include commercial and open
       source forensic tools, as well as non-forensic tools intended for device management, testing,
       and diagnostics. Forensic tools are typically designed to acquire data from the internal memory
       of handsets and UICCs without altering their content and to calculate integrity hashes for the
       acquired data. Both forensic and non-forensic software tools often use the same protocols and
       techniques to communicate with a device. However, non-forensic tools may allow unrestricted
       two-way flow of information and omit data integrity hash functions. Mobile device examiners
       typically assemble a collection of both forensic and non-forensic tools for their toolkit. The
       range of devices over which they operate is typically narrowed to: distinct platforms, a specific
       operating system family or even a single type of hardware architecture. Short product release
       cycles are the norm for mobile devices, requiring tool manufacturers to continually update
       their tools providing forensics examiners with an forensic solution. The task is formidable and
       tool manufacturers’ support for newer models may lag significantly behind the introduction of
       a device into the marketplace. Models of older functioning mobile devices, though out of date,
       can remain in use for years after their initial release. Mobile device models introduced into one
       national market may also be used in areas by exchanging the UICC of one cellular carrier with
       that from another carrier. The current state is likely to continue, keeping the cost of
       examination significantly higher than if a few standard operating systems and hardware
       configurations prevailed.

 3.1   Mobile Device Tool Classification System

       Understanding the various types of mobile acquisition tools and the data they are capable of
       recovering is important for a mobile forensic examiner. The classification system used in this
       section provides a framework for forensic examiners to compare the extraction methods used
       by different tools to acquire data. The objective of the tool classification system is to enable an
       examiner to easily classify and compare the extraction method of different tools. The tool
       classification system is displayed in Figure 6 [Bro08]. As the pyramid is traversed from the
       bottom, Level 1, to the top, Level 5, the methodologies involved in acquisition become more
       technical, invasive, time consuming, and expensive.

       Level 1, Manual Extraction methods involve recording information brought up on a mobile
       device screen when employing the user interface. Level 2, Logical Extraction methods are
       used most frequently at this time and are mildly technical, requiring beginner-level training.
       Methods for levels 3 to 5 entail extracting and recording a copy or image of a physical store
       (e.g., a memory chip), compared to the logical acquisitions used at level 2 involve capturing a
       copy of logical storage objects (e.g., directories and files) that reside on a logical store (e.g., a
