     -     Asset loss ramifications
     -     Asset protection suitability, effectiveness, and dependability

The stakeholder perspective is based on the assets that belong to stakeholders. Therefore, those
stakeholders determine the protection needs. The system perspective is based on the assets
necessary for the system to function. These assets are determined by system design decisions and
the criticality and priority 41 of the asset in providing or supporting the functions of the system.
Stakeholders are typically unaware of the existence of system assets and are not able to make
decisions about the protection needs for system assets. The protection of system assets is an
element of trustworthy secure system design.

Protection needs are continuously reassessed and adjusted as variances, changes, and trades
occur throughout the system life cycle. These include the maturation of the system design and
life cycle concepts, improved understanding of the operational environment (e.g., a more
thorough understanding of adversities), and changes in understanding of the consequences of
asset loss. Revisiting protection needs is a necessary part of the iterative nature of systems
engineering. Systems security engineering is necessary to ensure completeness in understanding
the problem space, exploring all feasible solutions, and engineering a trustworthy secure system.

           System Security Viewpoints
Three predominant viewpoints of system security include system function, security function, and
life cycle assets. These viewpoints shape the considerations that are used as trustworthy secure
design considerations for any system type, intended use, and consequence of system failure.

Every system is delivered to satisfy stakeholder capability needs. These needs constitute the
system function – the system’s purpose or role as fulfilled by the totality of the capability it
delivers combined with its intended use. The system function is the predominant viewpoint and
establishes the context for the security function and the associated system life cycle assets.

The stakeholder capability needs include the protection capability needs. The protection needs
parallel the concept of stakeholder capability needs and constitute the system’s security function
– the totality of the system’s purpose or role to securely satisfy stakeholder capability needs. The
security function enforces security-driven constraints as part of the overall system design. The
purpose of the constraints is to avoid, reduce, and tolerate susceptibilities, defects, weaknesses,
and flaws in the system that may constitute vulnerabilities that can be exploited or triggered.
These vulnerabilities can reside within the system’s structure or behaviors and can have the
effect of countering, defeating, or minimizing the ability of the system to effectively satisfy its
design intent to deliver the required capability. Thus, the constraints also enable the synthesis of
the security function within the system function in a non-conflicting manner.

The security function of the system has both passive and active aspects:
•    Passive aspects of the security function do not exhibit behavior (i.e., are non-functional in
     nature). They include the system architecture and design elements. The passive aspects are

 Criticality and priority based on asset valuation are typically used in decisions on protection needs. An asset with higher criticality and priority

would take precedence in providing protection should there be constraints that require choosing between the overall protection needs.
