       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                                 Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1295   7.   Threats and Security Considerations
1296   This section is informative.
1297   Effective protection of identity proofing processes requires the layering of security
1298   controls and processes throughout a transaction with a given applicant. To achieve this, it
1299   is necessary to understand where and how threats can arise and compromise enrollments.
1300   There are three general categories of threats to the identity proofing process:
1301        • Impersonation: where an attacker attempts to pose as another, legitimate,
1302          individual (e.g., identity theft)
1303        • False or Fraudulent Representation: where an attacker may create a false identity
1304          or false claims about an identity (e.g., synthetic identity fraud)
1305        • Infrastructure: where attackers may seek to compromise confidentiality,
1306          availability, and integrity of the infrastructure, data, software, or people supporting
1307          the CSPs identity proofing process (e.g., distributed denial of service, insider
1308          threats)
1309   This section focuses on impersonation and false or fraudulent representation threats,
1310   as infrastructure threats are addressed by traditional computer security controls (e.g.,
1311   intrusion protection, record keeping, independent audits) and are outside the scope of this
1312   document. For more information on security controls, see [SP800-53], Recommended
1313   Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations.
