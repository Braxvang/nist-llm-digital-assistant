                                     Figure 3-12. An XACML Request.

Once the PDP receives the request, it processes the request against the policy provided in Figure 3-11.
Because jsmith@users.example.com’s group attribute is “developers”, the resulting decision is “permit.”
This decision is sent to the PEP in the form of an XACML response as shown in Figure 3-13. The PEP
will then permit jsmith@users.example.com to read http://server.example.com/code/docs/guide.html.

    <Response>
      <Result>
        <Decision>Permit</Decision>
        <Status>
          <StatusCode Value=“urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:status:ok”/>
        </Status>
      </Result>
    </Response>

Access control policies are comprised of Targets and Rules. A Target defines a set of conditions for the
Subject, Resource, and Action that must be met for a PolicySet, Policy, or Rule to apply to a request. The
Target is used by the PDP to determine whether or not the request applies to this particular rule. Once an
applicable policy is found, the Rules are activated. Most Rules consist of an Effect and a Condition. The
Effect determines what the results of the Condition mean, while the Condition can test that any attribute
meets a certain requirement.

Attributes are used in XACML to aid in creating access control policies. In essence, attributes refer to
individual properties of the Subject, Resource, Action, or Environment that are applicable to the access
request, such as the Subject’s user name or the Environment’s current time. A Policy uses the
AttributeDesignator and the AttributeSelector to retrieve attributes from a request. The
AttributeDesignator specifies an attribute with a given name and type that the PDP will retrieve from the
request or some external source. AttributeSelectors provide an XPath query for resolving the values in
the request or elsewhere. The attributes received are used in Rules to determine whether or not to grant
access.
