     Systems Security Engineering Framework
The systems security engineering framework [29] provides a conceptual view of the key contexts
within which systems security engineering activities are conducted. It defines, bounds, and
focuses activities and tasks toward achieving stakeholder security objectives and presents a
coherent, well-formed, evidence-based case to support judgments about achievement of the
objectives. 50 The framework is independent of system type and engineering or acquisition
process model. It is not to be interpreted as a sequence of flows or steps but rather as a set of
interacting contexts, each with its own checks and balances. The systems security engineering
framework emphasizes an integrated, holistic security perspective across all system life cycle
stages and is applied to satisfy the milestone objectives of each life cycle stage.

The framework defines three contexts for conducting activities and tasks: (1) the problem
context, (2) the solution context, (3) and the trustworthiness context. The three contexts help to
ensure that the engineering is driven by a sufficiently complete understanding of the problem.
This understanding drives the effort to provide the solution and is supported by a set of activities
to design and realize the solution. It also demonstrates the worthiness of the solution in providing
adequate security across competing and often conflicting constraints.

While the framework appears to follow a sequential execution across the three contexts, it is
intended to be implemented in a closed loop iterative and recursive manner. This approach
facilitates a refinement of the problem statement, the proposed solution, and the trustworthiness
objectives as the design evolves from concept to the realized solution. The closed loop feedback
facilitates interactions among the three framework contexts and the requisite system security
analyses to continuously identify and address variances that are introduced into the engineering
effort. The feedback loop also helps to achieve continuous process improvement for the system,
including viewing the outputs of one life cycle phase (i.e., the solution to the phase) as the inputs
to the next phase (i.e., the problem for the next phase).

The three framework contexts share a common foundational base of system security analyses,
including system analyses with security interpretations of the analyses results (Section H.6).
System security analyses produce data to support engineering and stakeholder decision-
making. 51 Such analyses are differentiated for application within the problem, solution, and
trustworthiness contexts and employ a variety of concepts, principles, techniques, means,
methods, processes, practices, and tools. System security analyses:
•    Provide relevant data and technical interpretations of system issues from the system security
     perspective
•    Are differentiated in their application to align with the scope and objectives of where they are
     applied within the systems security engineering framework
