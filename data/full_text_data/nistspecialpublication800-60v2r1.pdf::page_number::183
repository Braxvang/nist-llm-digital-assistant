D.11.4 Space Operations Information Type

Space Operations involves the activities related to the safe launches/missions of passengers or
goods into aerospace and includes commercial, scientific, and military operations. The
recommended provisional security categorization for the space operations information type is as
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, High), (availability, High)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of space operations
information on the ability of responsible agencies to conduct safe launches/missions of
passengers or goods into space and includes commercial, scientific, and military operations. The
protection of space operations from deliberate attack involves military operations (D.1),
homeland security operations (D.2), and law enforcement operations (D.16). In most cases,
unauthorized disclosure of space operations information will have only a limited adverse effect
on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Civilian space operations are intended
to be conducted in the open. Administrative and business functions associated with space
operations may involve proprietary, procurement-sensitive, and Privacy Act information. The
Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and
Authentication information type. In such cases, the confidentiality impact resulting from
unauthorized disclosure can be moderate.

Some information regarding space operations (particularly military operations) is classified
national security information and is outside the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for space operations information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Space
operations are typically characterized by critical operational timing and safety parameters, and
low tolerance for error. Unauthorized modification or destruction of time-critical information
necessary to these functions may result in significant property loss and loss of human lives.
Communications management (e.g., frequency management) information also needs to be
included in integrity impact determination for space operations. Erroneous frequency
assignment information can result in loss of communications with spacecraft that can endanger
mission operations and human safety.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
space operations information is high.
