manufacturing information will result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals.

There are some cases for which manufacturing or product information includes classified or
other national security information. Such cases are outside the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for manufacturing information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of manufacturing information depends
primarily on the criticality of the information with respect to a manufacturing process and on the
volume and use of the end product. Typically, the effects of modification or deletion of
manufacturing information are generally limited with respect to agency missions or assets.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
manufacturing information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to manufacturing information. The nature
of most government manufacturing processes is tolerant of reasonable delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
manufacturing information is low.

D.22.2 Construction Information Type

Construction involves all programs and activities in which the Federal Government builds or
constructs facilities, roads, dams, etc. The following security categorization is recommended for
the construction information type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of construction
information on the abilities of responsible agencies to build or construct facilities, roads, dams,
etc. In most cases, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of construction information will
result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In some cases, construction details
can be of use to terrorists or other criminals who seek to penetrate or destroy government
installations. Unauthorized disclosure of some construction details (e.g., alarm designs, points of
vulnerability to the structural integrity of a dam or building) can result in danger to critical
