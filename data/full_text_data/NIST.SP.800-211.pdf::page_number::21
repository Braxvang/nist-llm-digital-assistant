STANDARDS AND VALIDATION
Network and data security are essential in today’s environment of increasingly open
and interconnected systems, networks, and mobile devices. Cryptographic standards,
algorithms, and methods for encryption, key establishment, and digital signatures
provide a critical foundation for mobile device conversations, secure e-Commerce
transactions, electronic lock access, and much more. Cryptography is a continually
evolving field that drives research and innovation. The Data Encryption Standard (DES)
was groundbreaking but today would fall far short of the necessary levels of protection.
The accomplishments below demonstrate NIST’s continued dedication to the role it has
fulfilled for nearly 50 years—leading public and private collaborations to foster continued
improvement and reliability in cryptographic techniques and technology.


Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)
In recent years, there has been a substantial amount of research on quantum
computers—machines that exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to solve
mathematical problems that are difficult or intractable for conventional computers.
When the capacity to build large-scale quantum computers exists, they will be able
to break many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use. This would seriously
compromise the confidentiality and integrity of digital communications on the internet
and elsewhere. The goal of post-quantum cryptography (also called quantum-resistant
cryptography) is to develop cryptographic systems that are secure against both
