                                                                 Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

        Much like Appleâ€™s iTunes Store, Android has a main application repository called the Google
        Play Store. Analysis of submitted applications for soundness in the store are much lower and
        have resulted in many rogue applications making their way into the mainstream application
        pool. Dozens of other Android application repositories exist as well. This has led to thousands
        of applications that may be encountered by the examiner.

        Most of the Android user and application data will be found in SQLite tables located in
        separate folders for each installed application. This may require the examiner to dump all data
        contained in all SQLite tables and perform a search of the resultant data searching for relevant
        material as less than 5% of the applications are supported by the majority of mobile forensic
        tools.

        Since the operating system is designed for touch screen use, the default protection scheme for
        the device is a gesture password lock. The lock presents a 3X3 grid for the user to trace his/her
        finger connecting several cells of the grid to form a pattern. Once the correct pattern is traced,
        the phone is unlocked. Some forensics tools exist to obtain the gesture.key file to unlock the
        device.

        Most of the access methods for a locked Android device rely on debug mode to be active on
        the device to begin the forensics extraction process. A few tools have been released that can
        enable debug mode from a locked device; however, the number of supported models is very
        small.

        Most Android based mobile devices have removable microSD memory cards. The data
        contained on the microSD Card should not be overlooked as they frequently contain a great
        deal of unencrypted and unprotected data. As best practice, the microSD card should be write-
        blocked and imaged using standard digital forensic techniques. The image may then be
        examined using traditional digital forensic tools, as the media is generally a single partition
        formatted using exFAT.

        Getting into locked devices is also possible using JTAG methods and tools to obtain all of the
        data from the memory of the handset. This bypasses the locked USB port (USB Debugging
        turned off) and probes Test Access Ports between the USB Port and the CPU. JTAG provides
        communication to NAND memory through the CPU allowing memory to be read.

        Many tools are able to parse much of the information presented in the Android OS however all
        tools suffer the same problem as iOS based devices -- multitudes of applications. Hundreds of
        applications are added every week. Understanding and reverse engineering each one of them
        one-at-a-time is a time consuming process. Many vendors have chosen to focus on parsing the
        data from the more popular communication applications (e.g., WhatsApp, FaceBook, etc.).
        The more advanced examiner should be aware of this shortcoming and be prepared to perform
        testing and reverse engineering for some cases where support for specific applications may not
        yet exist.

5.3.4   UICC Considerations

        Similar to a mobile device, to acquire data from a UICC, a connection must be established
        from the forensic workstation to the UICC, using a PC/SC reader. As before, the version of the
        tool being used should be documented, along with any applicable patches or errata from the
        manufacturer applied to the tool. Once the connection has been established, the forensic
        software tool may proceed to acquire data from the UICC.
