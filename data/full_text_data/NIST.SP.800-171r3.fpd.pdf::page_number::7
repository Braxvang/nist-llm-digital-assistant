NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
November 2023

Call for Patent Claims
This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use
would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information
Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or requirements may be
directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another publication. This call also
includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending U.S. or foreign patent applications
relating to this ITL draft publication and of any relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.

ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its behalf,
in written or electronic form, either:
    a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not hold
       and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
    b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available to
       applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the guidance
       or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:
           i.    under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
                 discrimination; or
          ii.    without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
                 demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.

Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make assurances
on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents subject to the
assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the assurance are binding on
the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of
future transfers with the goal of binding each successor-in-interest.

The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.

Such statements should be addressed to: 800-171comments@list.nist.gov
