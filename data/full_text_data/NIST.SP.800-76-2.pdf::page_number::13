2.1     Terms
       Term               Definition
       Fingerprint       Segmentation is the automated (and often manually reviewed) separation of an image of N fingers
       segmentation      into N images of individual fingers. N is usually four, for the index through little finger, and two for
                         a capture of two thumbs.
       Iris segmentation Segmentation is the automated (and possibly manually reviewed) detection of the iris-sclera and
                         iris-pupil boundaries. This localizes the iris texture that is used for actual recognition.
       One-to-many       Of or relating to biometric identification in which submitted feature data is compared with that of
                         all enrolled identities.
       One-to-one         Of or relating to biometric verification in which submitted feature data is compared with that of
                          one, claimed, identity.

      Other biometrics-related terms are defined and harmonized in [VOCABSTD].
