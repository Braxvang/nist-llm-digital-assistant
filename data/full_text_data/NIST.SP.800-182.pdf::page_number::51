     With system architecture and protocols defined, the
project team have engaged with industry and academia to                              CONTACTS:
obtain feedback on the approach and identify possibilities for                       Dr. Apostol Vassilev		        Mr. Harold Booth
collaborative approaches to solving important cybersecurity                          (301) 975-3221			             (301) 975-8441
challenges in the domains of cryptography and supply-chain                           apostol.vassilev@nist.gov		   harold.booth@nist.gov
management, e.g., integrated circuit counterfeiting.
     The project team have developed a working prototype                             Mr. Robert Staples
and demonstrated it at high-profile cybersecurity forums                             (301) 975-4578
and academic conferences. The team is continuing to                                  robert.staples@nist.gov
develop the system aiming to stand up a publicly accessible
NIST EaaS instance in the near future. In addition, the team is
also planning to publish the server and client code on GitHub
and invite the public to voluntarily adopt it. Related to this,
the project team is planning to work on developing public
criteria for reputable EaaS hosts.
