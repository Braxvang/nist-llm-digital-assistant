Appendix G. System Life Cycle Processes Overview
This appendix provides an overview of the system life cycle processes in [4], establishes the
basis for the in-depth coverage of those processes in subsequent appendices, and describes
relevant relationships among the various process groups and processes (Section G.2).

G.1.     Process Overview
The activities performed during the system life cycle are grouped into Technical Processes
(Appendix H), Technical Management Processes (Appendix I), Organizational Project-Enabling
Processes (Appendix J), and Agreement Processes (Appendix K) [4]. Appendices H, I, J, and K
describe the considerations and contributions to the system life cycle processes to achieve
trustworthy secure systems. Table 5 lists the four process groups and processes in each group [4].

The security-relevant considerations and contributions to the system life cycle are provided as
systems security engineering tasks. The tasks are aligned with the engineering viewpoints of the
life cycle processes and are based on the foundational security and trust principles and concepts
described in Chapter Two, Chapter Three, Chapter Four, Appendix C, Appendix D, Appendix E,
and Appendix F. The tasks use and leverage the principles, concepts, terms, and practices of
systems engineering to help facilitate consistency in their application as part of a systems
engineering effort.

The system life cycles processes, activities, and tasks are to be applied as needed. They are not
dependent on, oriented to, or presumed to be used or needed in any specific system development
methodology. By design, the processes and their activities and tasks can be applied concurrently,
