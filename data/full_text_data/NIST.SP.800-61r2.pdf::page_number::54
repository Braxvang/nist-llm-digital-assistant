4.    Coordination and Information Sharing

The nature of contemporary threats and attacks makes it more important than ever for organizations to
work together during incident response. Organizations should ensure that they effectively coordinate
portions of their incident response activities with appropriate partners. The most important aspect of
incident response coordination is information sharing, where different organizations share threat, attack,
and vulnerability information with each other so that each organization’s knowledge benefits the other.
Incident information sharing is frequently mutually beneficial because the same threats and attacks often
affect multiple organizations simultaneously.

As mentioned in Section 2, coordinating and sharing information with partner organizations can
strengthen the organization’s ability to effectively respond to IT incidents. For example, if an organization
identifies some behavior on its network that seems suspicious and sends information about the event to a
set of trusted partners, someone else in that network may have already seen similar behavior and be able
to respond with additional details about the suspicious activity, including signatures, other indicators to
look for, or suggested remediation actions. Collaboration with the trusted partner can enable an
organization to respond to the incident more quickly and efficiently than an organization operating in
isolation.

This increase in efficiency for standard incident response techniques is not the only incentive for cross-
organization coordination and information sharing. Another incentive for information sharing is the
ability to respond to incidents using techniques that may not be available to a single organization,
especially if that organization is small to medium size. For example, a small organization that identifies a
particularly complex instance of malware on its network may not have the in-house resources to fully
analyze the malware and determine its effect on the system. In this case, the organization may be able to
leverage a trusted information sharing network to effectively outsource the analysis of this malware to
third party resources that have the adequate technical capabilities to perform the malware analysis.

This section of the document highlights coordination and information sharing. Section 4.1 presents an
overview of incident response coordination and focuses on the need for cross-organization coordination to
supplement organization incident response processes. Section 4.2 discusses techniques for information
sharing across organizations, and Section 4.3 examines how to restrict what information is shared or not
shared with other organizations.

4.1   Coordination

As discussed in Section 2.3.4, an organization may need to interact with several types of external
organizations in the course of conducting incident response activities. Examples of these organizations
include other incident response teams, law enforcement agencies, Internet service providers, and
constituents and customers. An organization’s incident response team should plan its incident
coordination with those parties before incidents occur to ensure that all parties know their roles and that
effective lines of communication are established. Figure 4-1 provides a sample view into an organization
performing coordination at every phase of the incident response lifecycle, highlighting that coordination
is valuable throughout the lifecycle.
