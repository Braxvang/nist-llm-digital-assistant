                                 GUIDE TO MALWARE INCIDENT PREVENTION AND HANDLING FOR DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS


4.1     Preparation

Organizations should perform preparatory measures to ensure that they are capable of responding
effectively to malware incidents. Sections 4.1.1 through 4.1.3 describe several recommended preparatory
measures, including building and maintaining malware-related skills within the incident response team,
facilitating communication and coordination throughout the organization, and acquiring necessary tools
and resources.

4.1.1    Building and Maintaining Malware-Related Skills

In addition to standard incident response team skills as described in NIST SP 800-61, all malware
incident handlers should have a solid understanding of how each major category of malware infects hosts
and spreads. Also, incident handlers should be familiar with the organization’s implementations and
configurations of malware detection tools so that they are better able to analyze supporting data and
identify the characteristics of threats. Incident handlers doing in-depth malware analysis should have
strong skills in that area and be familiar with the numerous tools for malware analysis, as described in
Section 4.2.4.

Malware incident handlers should keep abreast of the ever-evolving landscape of malware threats and
technology. Besides conducting malware-related training and exercises, organizations should also seek
other ways of building and maintaining skills. One possibility is to have incident handlers temporarily
work as antivirus engineers or administrators so that they can gain new technical skills and become more
familiar with antivirus staff procedures and practices.

4.1.2    Facilitating Communication and Coordination

One of the most common problems during malware incident handling is poor communication and
coordination. Anyone involved in an incident, including users, can inadvertently cause additional
problems because of a limited view or understanding of the situation. To improve communication and
coordination, an organization should designate in advance a few individuals or a small team to be
responsible for coordinating the organization’s responses to malware incidents. The coordinator’s primary
goal is to maintain situational awareness by gathering all pertinent information, making decisions that are
in the best interests of the organization, and communicating pertinent information and decisions to all
relevant parties in a timely manner. For malware incidents, the relevant parties often include end users,
who might be given instructions on how to avoid infecting their hosts, how to recognize the signs of an
infection, and what to do if a host appears to be infected. The coordinator also needs to provide technical
guidance and instructions to all staff assisting with containment, eradication, and recovery efforts, as well
as giving management regular updates on the status of the response and the current and likely future
impact of the incident. Another possible role for the coordinator is interacting with external parties, such
as other incident response teams facing similar malware issues.

Organizations should also establish a point of contact for answering questions about the legitimacy of
malware alerts. Many organizations use the IT help desk as the initial point of contact and give help desk
agents access to sources of information on real malware threats and virus hoaxes so that they can quickly
determine the legitimacy of an alert and provide users with guidance on what to do. Organizations should
caution users not to forward malware alerts to others without first confirming that the alerts are legitimate.
