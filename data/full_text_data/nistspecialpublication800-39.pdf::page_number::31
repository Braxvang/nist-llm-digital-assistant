For example, requirements definition43 is a critical part of any system development process and
begins very early in the life cycle, typically in the initiation phase. The latest threat information
that is available to organizations, or current organizational assumptions concerning threat, may
significantly influence information system requirements and the types of solutions that are
deemed by organizations to be acceptable (from a technological and operational perspective) in
the face of such threats. Information security requirements are a subset of the functional
requirements levied on information systems and are incorporated into the system development
life cycle simultaneously with the other requirements. The information security requirements
define the needed security functionality44 for information systems and the level of trustworthiness
for that functionality (see Section 2.6 on the trustworthiness of information systems).

Organizations also address risk management issues during the development/acquisition phase of
the system development life cycle (e.g., system design, system development/integration, and
demonstration). Whether in response to specific and credible threat information or assumptions
about the threat, potential design-related vulnerabilities in organizational information systems can
be mitigated during this phase by choosing less susceptible alternatives. Supply chain risk during
the acquisition phase of the information system is also an area of concern for organizations. To
address supply chain risk during the development/acquisition phase, organizations implement
specific security controls as deemed necessary by the organization. Organizations also consider
risk from the standpoint of the environment in which the information systems are intended to
operate when selecting the most appropriate security controls. To be effective, controls must be
mutually supporting, employed with realistic expectations for effectiveness, and implemented as
part of an explicit, information system-level security architecture that is consistent with the
security architecture embedded in the organization’s enterprise architecture. For example, when
certain technical controls are less than effective due to achievable levels of trustworthiness in
organizational information systems, management and operational controls are employed as
compensating controls—thus providing another opportunity to manage risk.

Subsequent to initiation, development, and acquisition, the implementation phase of the system
development life cycle provides an opportunity for the organization to determine the effectiveness
of the selected security controls employed within or inherited by the information systems under
development prior to the commencement of actual operations. Expectations generated during this
phase can be compared with actual behavior as information systems are implemented. Given the
current threat information that is available to organizations and organizational assumptions about
the threat, the information discovered during effectiveness assessments, and the potential adverse
impacts on organizational missions/business functions, it may be necessary to modify or change
the planned implementation of the information system. Risk-related information can be developed
to justify the proposed changes.

Once approved for operation, information systems move into the operations/maintenance phase
of the system development life cycle. The monitoring of security control effectiveness and any
changes to organizational information systems and the environments in which those systems
operate ensure that selected risk response measures are operating as intended on an ongoing basis.
Ongoing monitoring is paramount to maintaining situational awareness of risk to organizational
missions and business functions—an awareness that is critical to making the necessary course

  Information security requirements can be obtained from a variety of sources (e.g., legislation, policies, directives,
regulations, standards, and organizational mission/business/operational requirements).

   Security functionality is the set of security controls employed within or inherited by an information system or the
environment in which the system operates. The security controls, described in NIST Special Publication 800-53, are
implemented by a combination of people, processes, and technologies.
