5.2.3.3.       Network Monitoring
Network monitoring involves reviewing alerts and logs and analyzing them for signs of possible
cybersecurity incidents. Tools and capabilities that support behavior anomaly detection (BAD),
security information and event management (SIEM), intrusion detection systems (IDS), and
intrusion prevention systems (IPS) can assist organizations with monitoring traffic throughout
the network and generate alerts when they identify anomalous or suspicious traffic. Some other
capabilities to consider for network monitoring include:
   •   Asset management, including discovering and inventorying devices connected to the
       network
   •   Baselining typical network traffic, data flows, and device-to-device communications
   •   Diagnosing network performance issues
   •   Identifying misconfigurations or malfunctions of networked devices
Organizations may also want to consider incorporating additional services and capabilities, such
as threat intelligence monitoring, to assist with establishing and maintaining an effective network
monitoring capability.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            OT system traffic is typically more deterministic (i.e., repeatable,
            predictable, and designed) than IT network traffic, which can leveraged
            to support network monitoring for anomaly and error detection.
            Organizations should understand the normal state of the OT network as a
            prerequisite for implementing network security monitoring to help
            distinguish attacks from transient conditions or normal operations within
            the environment. Implementing network monitoring in a passive (e.g.,
            listen or learning) mode and analyzing the information to differentiate
            between known and unknown communication may be a necessary first
            step in implementing network security monitoring.
            Organizations should consider the effects of encrypted network
            communications on their network monitoring capabilities and
            deployment strategies. For example, a BAD system or IDS may be
            unable to determine whether encrypted network communication is
            malicious and could generate false positive or negative alerts for the
            traffic. Changing the data collection point to capture network traffic
            before or after encryption (e.g., using host-based network monitoring
            tools) could help improve monitoring capabilities when encrypted
            communication is expected.
            IDS and IPS products are effective at detecting and preventing well-
            known internet attacks, and some IDS and IPS vendors have
            incorporated attack signatures for various OT protocols, such as Modbus,
            Distributed Network Protocol 3 (DNP3), and Inter-Control Center
            Communications Protocol (ICCP). An effective IDS/IPS deployment
            typically involves both host-based and network-based capabilities.
