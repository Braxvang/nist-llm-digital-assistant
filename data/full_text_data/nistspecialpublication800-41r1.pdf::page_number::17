                                                                   GUIDELINES ON FIREWALLS AND FIREWALL POLICY


such as simply blocking traffic based on its source or destination, they are typically deployed behind
traditional firewall platforms. Typically, a main firewall could accept inbound traffic, determine which
application is being targeted, and hand off traffic to the appropriate proxy server (e.g., email proxy). This
server would perform filtering or logging operations on the traffic, then forward it to internal systems. A
proxy server could also accept outbound traffic directly from internal systems, filter or log the traffic, and
pass it to the firewall for outbound delivery. An example of this is an HTTP proxy deployed behind the
firewallâ€”users would need to connect to this proxy en route to connecting to external web servers.
Dedicated proxy servers are generally used to decrease firewall workload and conduct specialized
filtering and logging that might be difficult to perform on the firewall itself.

In recent years, the use of inbound proxy servers has decreased dramatically. This is because an inbound
proxy server must mimic the capabilities of the real server it is protecting, which becomes nearly
impossible when protecting a server with many features. Using a proxy server with fewer capabilities than
the server it is protecting renders the non-matched capabilities unusable. Additionally, the essential
features that inbound proxy servers should have (logging, access control, etc.) are usually built into the
real servers. Most proxy servers now in use are outbound proxy servers, with the most common being
HTTP proxies.

Figure 2-2 shows a sample diagram of a network employing a dedicated HTTP proxy server that has been
placed behind another firewall system. The HTTP proxy would handle outbound connections to external
web servers and possibly filter for active content. Requests from users first go to the proxy, and the proxy
then sends the request (possibly changed) to the outside web server. The response from that web server
then comes back to the proxy, which relays it to the user. Many organizations enable caching of
frequently used web pages on the proxy to reduce network traffic and improve response times.

2.1.6   Virtual Private Networking

Firewall devices at the edge of a network are sometimes required to do more than block unwanted traffic.
A common requirement for these firewalls is to encrypt and decrypt specific network traffic flows
between the protected network and external networks. This nearly always involves virtual private
networks (VPN), which use additional protocols to encrypt traffic and provide user authentication and
integrity checking. VPNs are most often used to provide secure network communications across untrusted
networks. For example, VPN technology is widely used to extend the protected network of a multi-site
