      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                   Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

763   availability of the information) of the information system. Authorization in SP 800-79 and as
764   mandated by [HSPD-12] is concerned with the assessment of the “reliability” of an issuer to
765   perform its functions in accordance with [FIPS201]. The authorization of an issuer’s reliability
766   under SP 800-79 indicates that an organization official asserts that the issuer meets and has the
767   ability to operate within the control objectives outlined in [HSPD-12] for “secure and reliable
768   forms of identification” within an acceptable level of risk. However, in both cases, the
769   organization official (i.e., the authorizing official [AO] in [SP800-37] and the DAO in SP 800-
770   79) is fully accountable for any adverse impacts to the organization if a breach in security,
771   privacy, or policy occurs.
772   SP 800-79 focuses on the authorization of an organization’s capability and reliability but
773   depends on adequate security for all of the supporting information systems that have been
774   authorized under [SP800-37]. Therefore, before the DAO authorizes the issuer and its facilities,
775   all relevant PCI or DPCI information systems used must be authorized. In many cases,
776   authorization under [SP800-37] will be granted by an organization official other than the official
777   responsible for authorizing the issuer. The former is an organization official tasked with deciding
778   whether to authorize the operation of an information system based on its security posture. The
779   latter SHALL be someone specifically designated to authorize the operation of an issuer after it
780   has been assessed and determined to be compliant with [FIPS201] control objectives.

781           Preparing for the Assessment of an Issuer
782   To facilitate an assessment of an issuer in a timely, efficient, and thorough manner, it is essential
783   that the staff of the issuer and members of the assessment team understand their specific roles
784   and responsibilities and participate as needed. The issuer, its operation staff, and the team
785   responsible for performing the assessment must cooperate and collaborate to ensure the success
786   of the assessment. Specific responsibilities of the assessment team are listed below.

787   2.9.1. Issuer Duties
788   Before the assessment can begin, an assessor SHALL be designated. The assessor conducts the
789   assessment and oversees the assessment team. The assessment team MAY be made up of
790   employees from the organization or personnel from a public or private-sector entity contracted to
791   provide assessment services. Members of the assessment team should have capabilities to
792   perform the activities specified in this document. Assessment team members SHOULD work
793   together to prepare for, conduct, and document the findings of the assessment within the
794   authorization boundary. Each team SHALL be made up of individuals who collectively have the
795   knowledge, skills, training, and abilities to conduct, evaluate, and document assessments,
796   including those performed on the information systems being used by the issuer.
797   Once an assessment team is in place, the EIMO and other relevant personnel SHOULD begin the
798   preparation for the assessment. Thorough preparations by both the issuer and the assessment
799   team are important aspects of conducting an effective assessment. The issuer sets the stage for
800   the assessment by identifying all appropriate personnel and making them available during the
801   assessment. A fundamental requirement for authorization is for the assessment team to interview
802   all issuer personnel. Personnel, operators, and officials SHALL be notified of the pending
