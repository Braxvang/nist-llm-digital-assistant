        OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE WITH NIST
           ON CYBERSECURITY & PRIVACY

Collaborators and researchers are the driving force behind NIST’s programs. NIST
depends on developers, providers, and everyday users of cybersecurity and privacy
technologies and information to guide our priorities.
• Details on engaging with NIST on cybersecurity and privacy are available here.
• Many NIST projects are supported by guest researchers, both foreign and domestic.
• The Pathways Program supports federal internships for students and recent graduates.
• NIST funds industrial and academic research in several ways:
  • The Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) funds research and
    development proposals.
  • NIST offers grants to encourage work in the fields of precision measurement, fire
    research, and materials science. For general information on NIST’s grant programs, please
    contact Mr. Christopher Hunton via grants@nist.gov.
• The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) Speakers Bureau enables engagement with
  universities and colleges to raise student and faculty awareness about the exciting work
  going on at NIST and motivate them to consider pursuing opportunities to work with ITL.
• More information about our research, projects, publications, and events can be found on
  the NIST Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC) website.
