                   The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



component. NIST provides an SCAP Content Validation Tool, which is designed to help validate the
correctness of an SCAP source data stream.12 The SCAP Content Validation Tool is a simple command-
line tool that will check that SCAP content is well-formed, all cross references are valid, and required
values are appropriately set. All errors and warnings are returned in both XML and Hypertext Markup
Language (HTML) formats.

3.2     eXtensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF)

This section lists the eXtensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF) requirements and
recommendations. They are organized by the following categories: general, <xccdf:platform>,
<xccdf:Benchmark>, <xccdf:Profile>, <xccdf:Rule>, and check system usage.

3.2.1     General

The following general restrictions apply to SCAP XCCDF content:

      1. The use of the @xml:base attribute SHALL NOT be allowed. This attribute is not compatible
         with the SCAP data stream model.

      2. The <xccdf:Benchmark> element SHALL have an @xml:lang attribute.

      3. If an @xml:lang attribute is omitted within the content model, the @xml:lang attribute of the
         nearest ancestor element that has the attribute defined SHALL be consulted. Possible ancestor
         elements are <xccdf:Value>, <xccdf:Group>, <xccdf:Rule>, and
         <xccdf:Benchmark>.

XCCDF metadata is used by SCAP products to assist in the selection of the appropriate SCAP data
stream, ensure that the most recent or correct version of an XCCDF document is used, and provide
additional information about the document. The following metadata requirements and conventions apply
to the <xccdf:Benchmark>, <xccdf:Profile>, <xccdf:Value>, <xccdf:Group>, and
<xccdf:Rule> elements:

      1. One or more instances of the <xccdf:title> element SHALL be provided. Each instance
         MUST contain a text value that indicates the purpose of the containing element and MAY include
         the OPTIONAL @xml:lang attribute. If more than one <xccdf:title> element is
         provided, the @xml:lang attribute SHALL be provided.

      2. One or more instances of the <xccdf:description> element SHALL be provided. Each
         instance MUST contain text values that represent the purpose of the containing element and
         MAY include the OPTIONAL @xml:lang attribute. If more than one
         <xccdf:description> element is provided, the @xml:lang attribute SHALL be provided.

All remaining OPTIONAL elements in the XCCDF schema13 MAY be included at the authorâ€˜s discretion
unless otherwise noted in this document.
