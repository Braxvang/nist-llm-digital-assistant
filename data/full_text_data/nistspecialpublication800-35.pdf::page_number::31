gathering data by which the service levels and sourcing solutions will be selected. As current
stakeholders, they have an interest in the status quo, and their data-gathering techniques or reporting
methods may reflect this intentionally or unintentionally. Formal tools such as metrics and TCO will help
minimize any inadvertent biases in the data collection efforts. Additionally, a review of existing past
metrics and data will be helpful in removing any bias when baselining the current environment.

4.2.1.1 Metrics Creation, Gathering, and Analysis

Metrics provide decision makers with objective, quantifiable data. The importance of metrics starts in
this phase and continues throughout the life cycle.

Metrics creation starts with defining the “what” to measure: the metrics should map to the organization’s
overall functional and security goals and relate to the desired outcomes that the service will provide.
Metrics for any service should include data related to the following:

 Implementation Level—implementation-level metrics quantify the degree of completion of required
  and agreed-on activities and within agreed-on timeframes.
 Service Level—these metrics quantify the timeliness of service delivery (i.e., average time to restore
  operations or number of hours to reconfigure a firewall).
 Effectiveness—effectiveness metrics are outcome factors that describe how well the services were
  delivered and their efficacy (i.e., customer service ratings, security intrusion and blockage levels, and
  the number of systems affected by computer viruses).
 Business Impact—business impact metrics quantify the effect on business parameters such as
  financial and operational resources (i.e., dollars lost from virus attacks, work time lost from server
  outages).
Additional considerations for the development of metrics include:

 Consider only those metrics that are practical to collect
 Base metrics only on obtainable and quantifiable events
 Consider all IT security service aspects from technical functionality to problem resolution procedures
  to appropriateness of personnel
 Base metrics on business operation objectives
 Provide sufficient insight into assessing the level of IT security services provided/offered and allow
  for a relevant comparison between service options
 Gather metrics to assess the causes, not only results
 Gather metrics to track trends.
NIST SP 800-55, Security Metrics Guide for Information Technology Systems, provides more detail about
the characteristics of useful metrics, as well as the importance of having a mature (or maturing) metrics
program. The importance of a repeatable, consistent metrics approach to IT security will become
apparent in the IT security services life cycle as the organization sets targets, writes service agreements,
and monitors service provider performance in Phases 3, 4 and 5, respectively.
