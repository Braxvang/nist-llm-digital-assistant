7.3.3 X.509 Certificate for Key Management
[SP800-157] does not specify requirements on the key management key and certificate. The
requirements listed herein follow those from [FIPS201] for key management certificates that are
not issued by legacy PKIs, and thus do not actually apply to the X.509 Certificate for Key
Management stored within a Derived PIV Application, with the exception that certificates that
assert the id-fpki-common-policy, id-fpki-common-hardware, or id-fpki-common-High
certificate policy OID are required by the corresponding certificate policy to conform to [PROF].
