       August 2023                                                                 Privacy Learning Program

1715   4.1.4. Developing a Learning Program for Those With Significant Cybersecurity
1716          and Privacy Responsibilities
1717   The more customized and individualized nature of ongoing skills development and training for
1718   personnel with significant cybersecurity and privacy responsibilities will require a more detailed
1719   and nuanced Learning Program approach. For example, it may require multiple Requirements
1720   Documents for developing new Learning Program elements and identifying training that will
1721   satisfy learning objectives. The Learning Program Manager will partner and coordinate these
1722   efforts with the organization’s human capital office, Chief Learning Officer, training and
1723   curriculum developers, and the individual managers and supervisors for the personnel in this
1724   group.
1725   Various methods for developing or identifying role-based training for these users are available to
1726   the Learning Program Manager. They should ensure that the complexity of the training is
1727   commensurate with the role and needs of the people who will undergo the learning effort.
1728   Cybersecurity and privacy role-based training material can be developed at a beginning level for
1729   a person who is just learning a discipline. Material can be developed at an intermediate level for
1730   someone who has more experience and, therefore, more responsibility in their workplace.
1731   Advanced material can be developed for agency subject-matter experts whose jobs incorporate
1732   the highest level of trust and an accompanying high level of cybersecurity or privacy
1733   responsibilities.
1734      4.1.5 Conducting User Testing on new CPLP Elements
1735   Include a user testing phase for all new CPLP elements prior to implementation. Content should
1736   be assessed for each learning program participant group to ensure it meets their needs and is
1737   appropriate to their skill level. Additional user testing might include evaluating the intended
1738   element’s delivery method, the appropriateness of the language, the value to the learner, overall
1739   acceptance of the new element. Feedback from user testing should be iterative and incorporated
1740   at every step of the design effort, not just in the form of evaluations after implementation.

1741          Implementing New CPLP Elements
1742   Implementation refers to the actual distribution and delivery of the CPLP material. This phase
1743   focuses on the connection between the learner and the content. Once the plan for implementing
1744   the CPLP has been communicated to and accepted by management (see Section 2.11), the
1745   implementation phase can begin. Use a life cycle process when implementing the program to
1746   avoid a “one and done” scenario and periodically review the program for updates and
1747   corrections.

1748   4.2.1. Steps for Implementing a new CPLP Element
1749   The Learning Program Manager should implement a new Learning Program or a single element
1750   with the same repeatable steps. It is of the utmost importance that all of those involved in the
1751   implementation phase be included in a well-designed communications effort. This ensures that
1752   personnel and their managers or supervisors are well-informed about any upcoming CPLP
1753   opportunities that are relevant to their required learning plan. The implementation phase is also
