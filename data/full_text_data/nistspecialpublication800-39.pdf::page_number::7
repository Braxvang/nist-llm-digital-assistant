                                INTENDED SCOPE AND USE OF THIS PUBLICATION

  The guidance provided in this publication is intended to address only the management of information
  security-related risk derived from or associated with the operation and use of information systems or
  the environments in which those systems operate. The guidance is not intended to replace or subsume
  other risk-related activities, programs, processes, or approaches that organizations have implemented
  or intend to implement addressing areas of risk management covered by other legislation, directives,
  policies, programmatic initiatives, or mission/business requirements. Rather, the information security
  risk management guidance described herein is complementary to and should be used as part of a more
  comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program.
