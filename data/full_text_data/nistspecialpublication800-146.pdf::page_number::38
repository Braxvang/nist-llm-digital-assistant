                                                             CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



an exception that on premises IT support is still necessary to connect consumer browsers securely to the
network. Because SaaS providers implement new application features and provide the server side
hardware that runs them, SaaS providers also have advantages in managing the introduction of new
features while mitigating the need for consumers to upgrade their hardware systems to use the new
features.

5.3.5    Savings in Up-front Costs

Outsourced and public SaaS clouds allow a consumer to begin using an application without the up-front
costs of equipment acquisition, but potentially with a recurring usage fee. Additionally, cloud providers
should be able to provision their hardware, power, and other computing resources at scale and more
efficiently than individual consumers, which may reduce ongoing costs to consumers. This provides a
basis for cost savings to consumers (assuming a competitive marketplace). As with any buy vs. rent
decision, a careful analysis of all the cost considerations should be performed, including anticipated future
prices, before committing to a single approach.

5.4     Issues and Concerns

Compared with traditional computing and software distribution solutions, outsourced and public SaaS
clouds perform more application-level logic at provider facilities. For all scenarios, SaaS clouds place
significant reliance on consumer browsers to be both reliable and secure. These constraints raise a
number of issues and concerns, and affect the types of applications that are good fits for SaaS.

5.4.1    Browser-based Risks and Risk Remediation

Although browsers encrypt their communications with cloud providers, subtle disclosures of information
are still possible. For example, the very presence or absence of message traffic, or the sizes of messages
sent, or the originating locations may leak information that is indirect but still of importance to some
consumers. Additionally, even strong cryptography can be weakened by implementation mistakes; a
common mistake is to generate keys or passwords in a manner that reduces their strength, thus making the
cryptography vulnerable to brute-force guessing attacks. Furthermore, man-in-the-middle attacks on the
cryptographic protocols used by browsers [Mar09] can allow an attacker to hijack a consumer's cloud
resources. These risks apply to non-cloud environments as well; however in cloud computing, the
reliance upon safe, end-user, client applications and networking may be greater.

By relying on a consumerâ€™s browser for software application interfaces, the SaaS approach also raises a
risk that, if a consumer visits a malicious Web site and the browser becomes contaminated, subsequent
access to a SaaS application might compromise the consumer's data. Another risk is that data from
different SaaS applications might be inadvertently mixed on consumer systems within consumer Web
browsers. In Figure 9, for example, client C1 is concurrently running applications B and C. Depending on
the data processed by B and C, it may be important to keep them separated. Additionally, although
Figure 9 depicts applications B and C as being served by the same provider, in other scenarios they may
originate from different organizations and require careful separation. Prominent Web browsers provide
features, such as sandboxes to separate Web pages (and the interactive code that they contain) from one
another, but sandboxing relies on Web browsers' robust resistance to attack. Unfortunately, as is
evidenced by numerous competitions [Por10, Mar09], Web browsers are often vulnerable to malicious
Web sites. One work-around to this issue is for consumers to use multiple browsers and to dedicate
specific browsers to important SaaS applications and not to perform general-purpose Web surfing that
may expose them to attack. Another work-around is for consumers to use a virtual desktop when
connecting to cloud-hosted applications, which provides a secure, fully functional work platform that is
