Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
central fiscal operations information is normally low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the central fiscal operations
information. Central fiscal operations processes are usually tolerant of delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
central fiscal operations information is low.
C.2.8.2 Legislative Functions Information Type

Legislative functions include the service support activities associated with costs of the
Legislative Branch other than the Tax Court, the Library of Congress, and the Government
Printing Office revolving fund. The recommended security categorization for the legislative
service support information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of legislative functions
information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide service support activities associated
with costs of the Legislative Branch other than the Tax Court, the Library of Congress, and the
Government Printing Office revolving fund. The effects of loss of confidentiality of information
associated with legislative functions can be expected to have only a limited impact on Federal
government assets, operations, or personnel welfare.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for legislative functions information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.
Misunderstandings resulting from modified information that is actually exchanged can usually be
resolved and any resulting damage to the support function from modified information that is
exchanged would usually be limited.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external publication of
legislative service support information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect
inter-agency relationships, relations with Congress, or public confidence in the agency.
However, damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
legislative functions information is low.
