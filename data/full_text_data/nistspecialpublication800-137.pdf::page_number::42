Special Publication 800-137                              Information Security Continuous Monitoring for
                                                         Federal Information Systems and Organizations




•    Trend analyses of status reporting output;

•    New federal laws or regulations; and/or
•    Changes to reporting requirements.
Officials examine consolidated POA&M information to determine if there are common
weaknesses/deficiencies among the organization’s information systems and propose or request
solutions. The aggregate POA&M information is used to allocate risk mitigation resources
organization-wide and to make adjustments to the monitoring strategy. Similarly, status reports
and metrics are analyzed to determine if there are any security trends that suggest changes to the
monitoring strategy may be necessary. For instance, if weekly assessments of component
inventories over a six-month period indicate that very few changes are being made in a given
week and changes that were made are accurately reflected in the inventories, the organization
may wish to reduce the frequency of monitoring component inventories to biweekly or monthly.
Conversely, if biweekly audit record analyses over a six-month period indicate increases in
anomalous events, the organization may wish to increase the frequency of audit record reviews to
weekly.

An organization’s ISCM strategy also changes as the organization’s security program(s) and
monitoring capabilities mature. In a fully mature program, security-related information collection
and analysis are accomplished using standardized methods across the organization, as an integral
part of mission and business processes, and automated to the fullest extent possible. In this case,
the security program is mature enough to ensure that sufficient processes and procedures
effectively secure the enterprise architecture in accordance with organizational risk tolerances,
and to collect, correlate, analyze, and report on relevant security metrics. 43

ISCM is a recursive process in the sense that the monitoring strategy is continually refined as the
steps of the process repeat. Further, the organization-wide application of ISCM is accomplished
through smaller or more narrowly focused instances of the similar efforts at the mission/business
processes and systems tiers. In other words, the output of ISCM at Tier 3 is input to the
implementation of the ISCM programs at Tiers 1 and 2. Working from the top of the pyramid in
Figure 2-1 (Tier 1) to its bottom (Tier 3), upper-tier monitoring strategies set the parameters for
lower-tier monitoring programs, and observations made at the lower tiers may result in changes to
upper-tier monitoring strategies. The ISCM program itself must be monitored so that it can
evolve with changes in organizational missions and objectives, operational environments, and
threats.
