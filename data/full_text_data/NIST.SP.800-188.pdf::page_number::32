3.     Governance and Management of Data De-Identifcation

The decisions and practices regarding the de-identifcation and release of government data
can be integral to the mission and proper functioning of a government agency. As such,
these activities should be managed by an agency’s leadership in a way that ensures that
performance and results are consistent with the agency’s mission and legal authority. As
discussed above, the need for attention arises from the conficting goals of data trans-
parency and privacy protection. Although many agencies once assumed that it was rela-
tively straightforward to remove privacy-sensitive data from a dataset so that the remainder
could be released without restriction, history shows that this is not the case [66, §2.4, §3.6].
Given this history, there may be a tendency for government agencies to either over-protect
data or to simply avoid their release. Limiting the release of data clearly limits the privacy
risk that might result from a data release. However, it also creates costs and risks for other
government agencies, external organizations, and society. For example, in the absence of a
data release, external organizations may suffer the cost of recollecting the data (if it is even
possible to do so) or the risk of making poor decisions with insuffcient information.
This section begins with a discussion of why agencies may wish to de-identify data and
how they should balance the benefts of data release with risks to the data subjects. It then
discusses where de-identifcation fts within the data life cycle. It concludes by discussing
the options that agencies have for adopting de-identifcation standards.15

3.1.    Identifying the Goals and Intended Uses of De-Identifcation
Before engaging in de-identifcation, agencies should clearly articulate their goals regard-
ing transparency and disclosure limitation in making a data release. They should then
develop a written plan that explains how de-identifcation will be used to accomplish those
goals.
For example:
     • Federal statistical agencies collect, process, and publish data for use by researchers,
       business planners, and other purposes. These agencies are likely to have established
       standards and methodologies for de-identifcation. As these agencies evaluate new
       approaches for de-identifcation, they should document their rationale for adopting
       legacy versus new approaches, evaluate how successful their approaches have been
       over time, and address inconsistencies between data releases.
