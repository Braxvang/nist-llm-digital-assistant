GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



     ! Network Shares. A system may enable local resources to be shared across a network. On
       Windows systems, the SrvCheck utility can be used to list network shares.77 Third-party utilities
       can provide similar information for other OSs.
     ! Logs. Logs that are not stored in text files might necessitate use of log extraction utilities. For
       example, specialized utilities can retrieve information about recent successful and failed logon
       attempts on Windows systems, which are stored in binary format logs. Most log entries on Unix
       systems are stored in text files by syslog or in the /var/log directory, so special utilities are not
       needed to acquire information from the logs.78 Searching for filenames ending in .log should
       identify most log files.
Occasionally, analysts may need to collect data from the BIOS, such as system date and time or processor
type and speed. 79 Because the BIOS primarily contains information related to the system’s hardware
configuration, BIOS data collection is most likely to be needed when a system administrator is
troubleshooting operational issues. Typically, analysts who need BIOS data first collect any needed
volatile data and filesystems, then reboot the system and press the appropriate function key (generally
specified in the initial screen during boot) to display the BIOS settings. If the BIOS password is set, the
analyst might not be able to gain access to the BIOS settings easily and might have to attempt to guess
default passwords or circumvent the password protection. A variety of methods can be used to bypass
BIOS passwords, including finding the appropriate manufacturer backdoor password, using a password
cracker, moving the appropriate jumper on the motherboard, or removing the Complementary Metal
Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) battery (if possible). Systems vary, so analysts should first research the
particular characteristics of the system they are analyzing, as described in motherboard documentation, to
avoid harming a system unnecessarily. 80
5.2.3    Technical Issues with Collecting Data

Technical issues might also impede collection of OS data. Section 4 describes several filesystem-related
issues; this section focuses on additional collection issues and provides guidance on what, if anything, can
be done to mitigate them. The intent of this section is not to provide an exhaustive discussion of all
possible issues, but to provide some basic information on common ones.

     ! OS Access. Collecting volatile data can be difficult because the analyst might not be able to
       readily gain access to the OS. For instance, a user might run a password-protected screen saver
       or have the system locked. In these cases, the analyst will need to circumvent this protection or
       find another way to gain access to volatile OS data.81 If a password-protected screen saver is
       active, restarting the system might allow the analyst to bypass the screen saver, but would also
       cause all volatile OS data to be lost. If a host uses biometric-based authentication, such as a
       fingerprint reader, or another add-on authentication service, this could cause similar issues in
       accessing volatile OS data. There are third-party utilities for some OSs that claim to crack screen

     SrvCheck is available from the Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit.

     More information on the syslog protocol is available in RFC 3164, The BSD Syslog Protocol, available at
     http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3164.txt.
79
     Hard drive information presented in the BIOS might be inaccurate for larger hard drives. Many drives now use Logical
     Block Addressing, which causes the BIOS to display incorrect drive geometry information. Analysts should be able to
     acquire the correct information by examining the physical label on the hard drive itself.

81
     Several Web sites indicate ways to circumvent specific screen savers, such as taking advantage of known OS vulnerabilities.
     However, the screen saver bypass methods are of little use if the OS is unknown or the user has eliminated the
     vulnerabilities. General information regarding passwords is available from the Microsoft Knowledge Base article
     “Information About Unlocking a Workstation” (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q281250/) and the article titled “Password
     Information in Windows XP” (http://www.kellys-korner-xp.com/win_xp_passwords.htm).
