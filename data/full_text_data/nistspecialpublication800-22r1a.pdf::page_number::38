(5)         Compute P-value = igamc              ,             . Note that multiple P-values will be computed, i.e.,
                                               2       2      

            one P-value will be computed for each template. For m = 9, up to 148 P-values may be
            computed; for m = 10, up to 284 P-values may be computed.

                                                                        2 2.133333 
            For the example in this section, P-value = igamc             ,          = 0.344154.
                                                                       2      2    

2.7.5 Decision Rule (at the 1% Level)
If the computed P-value is < 0.01, then conclude that the sequence is non-random. Otherwise, conclude
that the sequence is random.

2.7.6 Conclusion and Interpretation of Results
Since the P-value obtained in step 5 of Section 2.7.4 is ≥ 0.01 (P-value = 0.344154), the conclusion is that
the sequence is random.

If the P-value is very small (< 0.01), then the sequence has irregular occurrences of the possible template
patterns.

2.7.7 Input Size Recommendation
The test code has been written to provide templates for m = 2, 3,…,10. It is recommended that m = 9 or
m = 10 be specified to obtain meaningful results. Although N = 8 has been specified in the test code, the
code may be altered to other sizes. However, N should be chosen such that N ≤ 100 to be assured that the
P-values are valid. Additionally, be sure that M > 0.01 • n and N = n/M.

2.7.8 Example
For a template B = 000000001 whose size is m = 9:

(input)              ε = 220 bits produced by the G-SHA-1 generator1

(input)              n = 220, B = 000000001

(processing)         µ = 255.984375 and σ2= 247.499999

(processing)         W1 = 259; W2 = 229; W3 = 271; W4 = 245; W5 = 272; W6 = 262;
                     W7 = 259; and W8 = 246
