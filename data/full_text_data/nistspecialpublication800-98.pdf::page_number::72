GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



Applicability: All RFID applications.

Benefits: Duplicating tag identifiers and data on a label provides a fallback in case of malicious or
accidental tag damage, reader malfunction, or enterprise subsystem network outage. The redundant data
can also be used to verify that tag data has not been altered improperly.

Weaknesses: This control has several potential weaknesses, including:

 Damage to the tag could render both the stored data and the printed data unusable. Similarly, many
  enterprise subsystem outages that would affect the RFID system would also affect its fallback
  alternative.
 The data stored on the label is visible, so it may be easier for unauthorized parties to gain access to it
  than it would be to read the data from the tag.
 The text label or bar code might not provide the same data capacity as RFID memory, although two-
  dimensional bar codes can encode at least as many bits as standards-based tag identifiers.
 Text labels and AIDC technologies are static, so they do not provide a complete fallback solution for
  applications in which tag data changes over time. However, some identification information is still
  likely to be better than none in most applications.
5.3   Technical Controls

There are a number of technical controls currently available for RFID systems, and many others are under
development in industrial and university research labs. This section focuses on technical controls that are
commercially available as of the publication date of this document. Supplementary information on
selected emerging security technologies is provided in footnotes. Many of the technical controls listed are
specified in standards, while others are available only in proprietary systems.

Many technical controls related to a tag require the tag to perform additional computations and to have
additional volatile memory. Accordingly, a tag that uses such technical controls requires a more
sophisticated microchip than those that do not use such controls. In the case of passive tags, the tags may
also need to be closer to readers to obtain the required power to perform these computations.
Alternatively, readers may need to operate at greater power levels, although this may not be feasible or
permitted in many cases. These inherent characteristics of passive tags can limit the use of certain
technical controls in some environments.

Technical controls exist for all components of RFID systems, including the RF, enterprise, and inter-
enterprise subsystems. This section focuses on technical controls for the RF subsystem. Many controls
also exist for the enterprise and inter-enterprise subsystems, but these typically apply to IT systems in
general rather than to RFID systems in particular. Readers are encouraged to read other NIST IT system
and network security guidelines, many of which are listed in Appendix D.

The general types of RF subsystem controls include controls to:

 Provide authentication and integrity services to RFID components and transactions,
 Protect RF communication between reader and tag, and
 Protect the data stored on tags.
