NIST SP 800-82r3                                                Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

   •   Communications. Communication protocols and media used by OT environments for
       field device control and intra-processor communication are typically different from IT
       environments and may be proprietary.
   •   Change management. Change management is paramount to maintaining the integrity of
       both IT and OT systems. Unpatched software represents one of the greatest
       vulnerabilities to a system. Software updates on IT systems, including security patches,
       are typically applied in a timely fashion based on appropriate security policies and
       procedures. In addition, these procedures are often automated using server-based tools.
       Software updates on OT cannot always be implemented on a timely basis. These updates
       need to be thoroughly tested by both the vendor and the end user of the industrial control
       application before being implemented. Additionally, the OT owner must plan and
       schedule OT outages days or weeks in advance. The OT may also require revalidation as
       part of the update process. Another issue is that many OT utilize older versions of OSs
       that are no longer supported by the vendor through patches. Change management is also
       applicable to hardware and firmware. The change management process requires careful
       assessment by OT experts (e.g., control engineers) working in conjunction with security
       and IT personnel.
   •   Managed support. Typical IT systems allow for diversified support styles, perhaps
       supporting disparate but interconnected technology architectures. For OT, service support
       is sometimes only available from a single vendor. In some instances, third-party security
       solutions are not allowed due to OT vendor licensing and service agreements, and service
       support can be lost if third-party applications are installed without vendor
       acknowledgement or approval.
   •   Component lifetime. Typical IT components have a lifetime on the order of three to five
       years due to the quick evolution of technology. For OT, where technology has been
       developed in many cases for specific uses and implementations, the lifetime of the
       deployed technology is often in the order of 10 to 15 years and sometimes longer.
   •   Component location. Most IT components and some OT components are located in
       business and commercial facilities that are physically accessible by local transportation.
       Remote locations may be utilized for backup facilities. Distributed OT components may
       be isolated, remote, and require extensive transportation effort to reach. The component
       location also needs to consider necessary physical and environmental security measures.
Table 1 summarizes some of the typical differences between IT and OT systems.
