NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                               Guidelines for Media Sanitization


Appendix E—Device-Specific Characteristics of Interest

Storage vendors implement a range of devices and media types that leverage the same
standardized command sets. Some examples of command sets include ATA, SCSI, and NVM
Express. There are likely to be differences in implementation between, for example, the
enhanced Security Erase command for ATA devices from different vendors. Some vendors may
have implementations ‘under the hood’ that apply techniques such as Cryptographic Erase, block
erase (for flash memory devices), or other techniques. It may be difficult or impossible for users
to know for sure how the sanitization action is being implemented.

In order to support informed decision making by users, vendors may choose to provide
information about how a specific device implements any dedicated sanitize commands supported
by the device. When reported by vendors, this information also helps purchasing authorities
make informed decisions about which storage devices to acquire based on the availability of
suitable sanitization functions and approaches. This vendor-reported information should address
the following:

      The media type (i.e., Legacy Magnetic, HAMR, magnetic shingle, SLC/MLC/TLC Flash
       Memory, Hybrid, etc.)

           o If the device contains magnetic media, the coercivity of the magnetic media (to
             support an informed decision about whether to attempt to degauss the media)

      Which sanitize commands are supported (if any)

      For each sanitize command supported:

           o A list of any areas not addressed by the sanitization command

           o The estimated time necessary for the command to successfully complete

           o The results of any validation testing, if applicable
