 Encryption and integrity protection. Encryption protects the confidentiality of data as it traverses
  the Internet, while integrity protection ensures that the data is not altered as it traverses the Internet.
  Both are inherent in SSL.
 Access control. Access control permits or restricts access to applications at a granular level, such as
  per-user, per-group, and per-resource.
 Endpoint security controls. Endpoint security controls validate the security compliance of the client
  system that is attempting to use the SSL VPN. For example, host integrity checks may verify that
  firewall, malware detection and antivirus software are enabled and running on the client system, and
  the host is up-to-date on its patches. Endpoint security controls also include security protection
  mechanisms, such as Web browser cache cleaners, that remove sensitive information from client
  systems.
 Intrusion prevention. Intrusion prevention involves inspecting the data after it has been decrypted
  in the SSL VPN for potential attacks. It may also include anti-malware functionality to detect
  viruses, worms, and other malicious payloads and block or change network access rights based on the
  results of such checks.
Sections 3.3.1 through 3.3.8 provide details and examples of the various SSL VPN features and security
services.

3.3.1   Manageability

SSL VPNs offer a variety of manageability features such as status reporting, logging, and auditing. Status
reporting includes identifying connected users and reporting usage data in a graphical format. Logging
includes the ability to export logs, debug logging, and automate log rollover. Auditing includes auditing
application access, RADIUS-based accounting, and persistent storage of auditing information. Another
manageability feature is the ability to terminate sessions as needed.

A manageability feature that is often overlooked is documentation. It is beneficial to have documentation
for SSL VPN usage, configuration, and troubleshooting. Documentation may also include context-
sensitive help within the management interface.

Another manageability feature that is beneficial for SSL VPNs is partitioned or delegated management.
This allows different aspects of the SSL VPN device to be managed by different groups or individuals.
This feature can be beneficial for service providers, collocation facilities, and organizations with different
groups sharing the SSL VPN device. It is also quite useful for an SSL VPN to be able to be managed
remotely, such as by a system administrator who is not on-site. Remote management requires greater
security to prevent attackers from watching and possibly altering the management sessions; in SSL VPNs,
this security is normally provided by running all remote management sessions under SSL.

3.3.2   High Availability and Scalability

Two other important features for SSL VPNs are high availability and scalability. High availability
solutions use two or more SSL VPN devices configured in either active/passive or active/active mode. In
an active/passive solution, one device actively services connections, while the other device is waiting in
standby mode. The two devices continuously exchange “heartbeat” messages to communicate their status
with one another. If the standby device does not receive a heartbeat message from the active device for a
preconfigured time period, it will assume that the active device is no longer operating and take over
servicing connections. In an active/active solution, both devices are actively servicing connections at the
