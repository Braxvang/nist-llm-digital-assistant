The conformance criteria present all normative requirements and controls of SP 800-63-3 by
designated assurance level, the control objectives for each criterion, recommended methods for
determining conformity, and supplemental guidance to assist implementers and assessors. The
criteria are intended for federal agencies and industry service providers for the implementation
of SP 800-63-3 and for conducting conformance and security assessments under the Federal
Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA). NIST provided virtual conferences and
presentations to explain how to apply and use the conformance criteria for implementation and
conformance assessment. Multiple federal agencies and industry organizations have developed
programs to incorporate the conformance criteria and take advantage of the guidance and
tools presented in the document.

Access Control System Guidance and Research for Cloud Systems
NIST developed SP 800-210, General Access Control Guide for Cloud Systems, to present
cloud access control characteristics and general access control guidance for cloud service
models: IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), and SaaS (Software
as a Service). The main focus is on the technical aspects of access control without considering
deployment models (e.g., public, private, hybrid clouds). It also focuses on trust and risk
management issues, which require different layers of discussions that depend on the security
requirements of the business function or the organization of deployment for which the cloud
system is implemented. NIST researched emerging technologies that can be applied to access
control mechanisms, such as the Natural Language Processing algorithm to automatically
generate access control policy from natural language documentation. Currently, studies of
experiment tools, user cases, and language features are the focus of the research work.

Access Control Policy Verification and Development Tools
Access control systems are among the most critical network security components. Faulty
policies, misconfiguration, or flaws in software implementation can result in serious
vulnerabilities. To address these issues, NIST developed and is improving the Access Control
Policy Tool (ACPT), which allows a user to compose, verify, test, and generate access control
policies. New user-interface features have been added to the improved version of ACPT. NIST
has also developed the Access Control Rule Logic Circuit (ACRLC) simulation technique, which
enables access control policy authors to detect a fault when the fault-causing access control
rule is added to the policy. This notification allows a fix to be implemented in real time before
adding other rules that further complicate the detecting effort.

In addition to software simulation, NIST worked on hardware implementation of ACRLC with
the University of Arkansas C omputer Science Department. The hardware version of ACRLC
enables the study of performance and real-world applications. NIST also researched theories
for applying quantum algorithms to limited access control systems (such as IoT devices). The
research results are presented in the paper Apply Quantum Search to the Safety C heck for
Mono Operational Attribute Based Protection Systems, which will be published in the
international C onference on Security, Privacy, and Anonymity in Computation,
Communication, and Storage.
