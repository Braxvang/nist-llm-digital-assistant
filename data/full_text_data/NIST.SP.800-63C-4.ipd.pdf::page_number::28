      NIST SP 800-63C-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                                      Federation and Assertions


708   vetting on each party in the federation to verify compliance with predetermined standards
709   that define the trust agreement. The level of vetting is unique to the use cases and models
710   employed within the federation. This vetting is depicted in the left side of Figure 2.
711   Federation authorities approve IdPs to operate at certain IALs, AALs, and FALs. This
712   information is used by relying parties, as shown in the right side of Figure 2, to determine
713   which identity providers meet their requirements.
714   Federation authorities SHALL establish parameters regarding expected and acceptable
715   IALs, AALs, and FALs in connection with the federated relationships they enable.
716   Federation authorities SHALL individually vet each participant in the federation to
717   determine whether they adhere to their expected standards.

718   Vetting of IdPs and RPs SHALL establish, as a minimum, that:
719       • Assertions generated by IdPs adhere to the requirements in Sec. 6.
720       • RPs adhere to requirements for handling subscriber attribute data, such as retention,
721         aggregation, and disclosure to third parties.
722       • RP and IdP systems use approved profiles of federation protocols.
723   Federation authorities MAY assist the technical connection and configuration process
724   between members, such as by publishing configuration data for IdPs or by issuing
725   software statements for RPs.
