                                           ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



         roaming. In such a case, all users can decrypt the traffic of other users, even if the network is
         protected from outsiders.

      Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting Key (AAAK). The AAA key, also known as
       the Master Session Key (MSK), is delivered to the AP through the Extensible Authentication
       Protocol (EAP) during the process of establishing an RSNA. Each time a user 32 authenticates to
       the WLAN, the AAA key changes; the new key is then used for the duration of the user’s session,
       which lasts until the key lifetime expires or the user reauthenticates. As discussed in Section 5,
       numerous authentication techniques can be used with EAP. Delivery of the AAA key relies on
       the key generation capability of the chosen EAP authentication method. All EAP authentication
       methods supporting IEEE 802.11 RSNs must have the ability to create the AAA key for RSN
       security features to function properly. Decisions on the appropriate EAP authentication methods
       are left to the implementers of STAs or the AS. As a result, organizations should carefully
       review any EAP authentication methods and AAA key generation approaches for possible
       vulnerabilities. 33

     There is a gap between design and practice. The IEEE 802.1X model really addresses device authentication. Some
     databases can store device information. In many real deployments, however, the mobile device proxies authentication
     credentials of the current user to allow reuse of the extensive user authentication databases already in place.
