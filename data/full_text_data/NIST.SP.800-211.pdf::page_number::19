The white paper represents an example of the SSE project described above, fostering
a subset of high-level practices that are based on established standards, guidance, and
secure software development practice documents. These practices, collectively called a
secure software development framework (SSDF), should be particularly helpful for the
target audiences to achieve security software development objectives. Such a framework
is advantageous because an organization in any sector or community, regardless of
size or cybersecurity sophistication, can integrate the framework into any existing
software development workflow and automated toolchain. It can be applied to typical IT
infrastructures as well as more unique models, such as industrial control systems (ICS),
cyber-physical systems (CPS), or IoT.


Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM)
Information and operational technology (IT/OT) rely on a complex, globally distributed
and interconnected supply chain ecosystem to provide highly refined, cost-effective, and
reusable solutions. This ecosystem is composed of various entities with multiple tiers of
outsourcing, diverse distribution routes, assorted technologies, laws, policies, procedures,
and practices—all of which interact to design, manufacture, distribute, deploy, use,
maintain, and manage IT/OT products and services.
Organizations are increasingly at risk of supply chain compromise, whether intentional or
unintentional. Many beneficial factors (e.g., low-cost, interoperability, rapid innovation, and
product variety) also increase the risk of a compromise to the cyber supply chain, which
may result in risks to the end user. Managing cyber supply chain risks requires ensuring
the integrity, security, quality, and resilience of the supply chain and its products and
services. Cyber supply chain risks may include the insertion of counterfeits, unauthorized
production, tampering, theft, and the insertion of malicious software and hardware as well
as poor manufacturing and development practices in the cyber supply chain.
An important NIST initiative is Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM), the
process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating the risks associated with the distributed
and interconnected nature of IT/OT product and service supply chains. C-SCRM is
integrated into Systems Security Engineering (described above) and covers the entire
system life cycle (including design, development, distribution, deployment, acquisition,
maintenance, and destruction) since supply chain threats and vulnerabilities may
(intentionally or unintentionally) compromise an IT/OT product or service at any stage.
SCRM work in FY 2019 included:
  •   Development of the draft NISTIR 8272, Impact Analysis Tool for Interdependent
      Cyber Supply Chain Risks, which describes a prototype solution for filling the gap
      between an organization’s risk appetite and supply chain risk posture by providing a
      basic measurement of the potential impact of a cyber supply chain event [14]. This
      tool does not represent a complete supply chain risk management solution, but it
      is intended to be integrated into or used in concert with tools such as third-party
      management, enterprise resource planning, and supply chain management efforts.              11
