 4.1 Information Decisions in the System Life Cycle

The need for, and methods to conduct, media sanitization should be identified and developed
before arriving at the Disposal phase in the system life cycle. At the start of system development,
when the initial system security plan is developed 17, media sanitization controls are developed,
documented, and deployed. One of the key decisions that will affect the ability to conduct
sanitization is choosing what media are going to be used within the system. Although this is
