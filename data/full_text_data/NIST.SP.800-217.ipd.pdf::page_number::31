      NIST SP 800-217 ipd                         Guidelines for PIV Federation (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


794   terminated PIV identity account will not be immediately reflected in associated certificate
795   revocation lists.

796   5.1.2. PIV Identity Account Identiﬁcation
797   The IdP SHALL issue a unique federated identifier for each PIV identity account
798   according to the requirements in Sec. 6.2.1, consisting of the logical combination of:
799       • A subject identifier for the PIV identity account that is locally unique for the
800         account at the IdP, and
801       • A globally unique identifier for the IdP.
802   To protect privacy, the IdP SHOULD use a cryptographically random value or a
803   cryptographically derived value for the subject identifier portion of the federated
804   identifier. The federated identifier SHALL NOT contain any personally identifiable
805   information or any personal identifiers, such as the cardholder UUID, in an unencrypted
806   or reversible form. The federated identifier SHOULD be stable over time for a PIV
807   identity account at an IdP.

808   5.1.3. Session Management
809   The IdP SHALL create a secure session with the subscriber after a successful
810   authentication event with a PIV credential using session management, as described in
811   [SP800-63B]. The IdP SHALL record the time of the last successful authentication event
812   for a subscriber within the session associated with that subscriber. This time is used to
813   calculate the authentication age of the session.
814   In managing the subscriber’s session at the IdP, the IdP SHALL follow all
815   reauthentication guidelines as established in [SP800-63B] and [SP800-63C].
816   When using PKI-based authenticators such as PIV authentication certificates, an IdP
817    SHOULD require presentation of the certificate for only a specific path that represents the
818   explicit authentication event. This configuration mirrors the verification process for other
819   forms of authenticators and enables the use of a secure session.

820   5.2. RP Requirements
821   PIV RPs SHALL follow all of the requirements for RPs enumerated in [SP800-63C].

822   5.2.1. Assertion Processing
823   The RP SHALL verify that all assertions received contain the requirements enumerated in
824   Sec. 6.2. The RP SHALL reject any assertion that does not meet these requirements.
