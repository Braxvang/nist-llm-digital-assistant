NIST SP 800-82r3                                                                   Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

     Introduction

          Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this document is to provide guidance for establishing secure operational
technology (OT) 2 while addressing OT’s unique performance, reliability, and safety
requirements. This document gives an overview of OT systems and typical system topologies,
identifies common threats and vulnerabilities for these systems, and recommends security
countermeasures to mitigate the associated risks. Additionally, it presents an OT-tailored security
control overlay based on NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Rev. 5 [SP800-53r5] that
customizes controls for the unique characteristics of the OT domain. The body of the document
provides context for the overlay, but the overlay is intended to stand alone.
Because there are many types of OT with varying levels of potential risk and impact, this
document provides a list of many methods and techniques for securing OT systems. The
document should not be used purely as a checklist to secure a specific system. Readers are
encouraged to perform a risk-based assessment on their systems and to tailor the recommended
guidelines and solutions to meet their specific security, business, and operational requirements.
The range of applicability of the basic concepts for securing OT systems presented in this
document continues to expand.

          Audience
This document covers details that are specific to OT systems. Readers of this document should
be acquainted with general computer security concepts and communication protocols, such as
those used in networking. The document is technical in nature. However, it provides the
necessary background to understand the topics that are discussed.
The intended audience is varied and includes the following:
     •    Control engineers, integrators, and architects who design or implement OT systems
     •    System administrators, engineers, and other information technology (IT) professionals
          who administer, patch, or secure OT systems
     •    Security consultants who perform security assessments and penetration testing of OT
          systems
     •    Managers who are responsible for OT systems
     •    Senior management who need to better understand the risks to OT systems as they justify
          and apply an OT cybersecurity program
     •    Researchers and analysts who are trying to understand the unique security needs of OT
          systems
     •    Vendors who are developing products that will be deployed as part of an OT system



2
 The acronym “OT” can stand for either “operational technology” or “operational technologies.” The context around the acronym, especially the
use of singular or plural words, will indicate which meaning is intended.
