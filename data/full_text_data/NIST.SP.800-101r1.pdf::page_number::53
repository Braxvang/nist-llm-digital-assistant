                                                               Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

      must be known in order to decrypt the key hierarchy protecting these select files and keychain
      elements, and also to disable the device’s GUI lock.

      The implementation of Data Protection has been criticized for a number of design flaws and
      was originally exploited as shown by Zdziarski in 2009 [Zdz12]. Due to the simplicity of four-
      digit PINs or short passwords, brute forcing the device passcode is often a computationally
      feasible task. In many cases, brute forcing a four-digit PIN has shown to take at most 20
      minutes.

      Nevertheless, this encryption scheme poses significant challenges to the forensic investigator.
      The forensic examiner should be aware of these issues as well as the impact that this
      encryption has on any iOS based device presented for examination. Supported devices include
      iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 (both GSM and CDMA models), first-gen iPad, and latest releases
      of iPod Touch (3rd and 4th generation). All of these devices have the option to perform a
      remote wipe of data contained within them. When activated, the UID is destroyed and 256 bits
      of the key are destroyed leaving the examiner with an extremely complex decryption problem.
      To avoid such scenarios, it is recommended that radio communications are blocked or disabled
      prior to an examination as well as during transportation to the lab for examination.

      When data protection is active, the file key is obliterated when the file is deleted, leaving
      encrypted and generally unrecoverable file contents in unallocated space, which render
      traditional carving techniques for deleted files useless. Data however can often be found
      residing inside allocated data containers (i.e., SQLite Tables) and should not be discounted or
      ignored as part of any examination. Recovery of such data can be challenging as SQLite data
      recovery may be somewhat automated (e.g., epilog), often manual recovery may be the only
      option. Fortunately for the forensic investigator, a significant portion of user data is stored
      within allocated data containers and garbage collection is not generally performed on these
      containers.

      Apple also offers a feature to users to encrypt all backup data when using iTunes (iOS 4 and
      later). This option, when used will only present encrypted files from some forensic extraction
      tools. These backups can be decrypted using a brute force attack. Tools exist to perform this
      attack using GPU acceleration to facilitate a faster brute force attack. The backup encryption
      feature only applies to data sent through the device’s backup service, however a number of
      other services run on the device that provide clear text copies of data, even if backup
      encryption is active. If the acquisition tool is capable of communicating to these other services,
      a significant amount of clear text data can be recovered, even if the backup password is not
      known.

5.3.3 Android Device Considerations

      Android is an operating system designed by Google primarily for mobile devices such as
      smartphones and some tablet computers. Android was first released in 2007 and the first
      Android based phone was released in October 2008. The Android operating system is open
      source and Google releases a major version about once per year.

      Each one of the different versions of the operating system requires slight modifications for
      each family of device for full support. This has led to hundreds (if not thousands) of different
      distributions in the wild.
