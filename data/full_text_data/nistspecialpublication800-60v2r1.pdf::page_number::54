Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: The effects of disruption of access to
continuity of operations information or information systems depend on the timing of the
disruption. If access to continuity of operations information is denied because of a power
outage, recovery may be delayed and the work of government agencies disrupted. The continuity
of operations planning process is usually tolerant of delays. In contrast, the continuity of
operations implementation process is not tolerant of delays. The consequences of disruption of
access to continuity of operations information depend on both the period of the outage and the
criticality of the disrupted processes. The consequent impact level will range from low to high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
continuity of operations information is moderate.
C.2.4.3 Service Recovery Information Type

Service recovery involves the internal actions necessary to develop a plan for resuming
operations after a catastrophe occurs, such as a fire or earthquake. The recommended provisional
security categorization for the service recovery information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of the unauthorized disclosure of service recovery
information on the ability of responsible agencies to develop plans for resuming operations after
a catastrophe occurs, such as a fire or earthquake. In the case of service recovery plans for
natural catastrophes, the information associated with service recovery planning is not
intrinsically sensitive. In the case of catastrophes caused by malicious activity, unauthorized
disclosure of service recovery information may inform an adversary regarding what facilities and
processes are considered to be critical. Such unauthorized disclosure may also equip an
adversary with the information necessary to attack a system in such a way that operations are
disrupted, and that recovery is impaired or even blocked. The purpose of most service recovery
information is to protect against natural catastrophes rather than against malicious attacks. In
most cases, the consequence of loss of confidentiality of service recovery information is not
likely to do serious harm to government assets, personnel, or missions.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of
background information that supports development of Federal service recovery plans can reveal
sensitive vulnerabilities, capabilities, intelligence assessments, intelligence sources, or methods
employed in anti-terrorism, law enforcement, or national security activities. Depending on the
information in question, the confidentiality impact can be moderate, high, or involve national
security information (outside the scope of this guideline). Also, some service recovery plans are
themselves national security information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for service recovery information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.
