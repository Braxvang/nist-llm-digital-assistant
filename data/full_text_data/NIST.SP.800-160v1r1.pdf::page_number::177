IM-2      PERFORM INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
          IM-2.1 Securely obtain, develop, or transform the identified information items.
          Note: Obtaining, developing, and transforming information items includes labeling the items by
          their protection needs (e.g., classifying).
          IM-2.2 Securely maintain information items and their storage records, and record the security
                 status of information.
          IM-2.3 Securely publish, distribute, or provide access to information and information items to
                 designated stakeholders.
          IM-2.4 Securely archive designated information.
          Note: The media, location, and protection of the information are selected in accordance with
          the specified storage and retrieval periods, agreements, legislation, and organizational security
          policy.
          IM-2.5 Securely dispose of unwanted, invalid, or unvalidated information.

I.7.1. Security Purpose
-      Collect, analyze, and report security-relevant data and information to support effective
       management and demonstrate the quality of the products, services, and processes.

I.7.2. Security Outcomes
-      Security-relevant information needs are identified.
-      An appropriate set of security measures are identified or developed based on security-
       relevant information needs and information security protection needs.
-      Required data is securely managed.
-      Security-relevant data is analyzed, and the results are interpreted.
-      Measurement results provide objective information that supports security-relevant decisions.
