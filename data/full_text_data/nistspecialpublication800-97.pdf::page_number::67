5.4.3   AS to AP Connections

As shown in Figure 5-4 and Figure 5-11, following the authentication phase of operation, the AS delivers
the AAA key to the AP. The data flows from the two network elements are depicted in Figure 5-11 by
the dashed rectangle labeled AS-AP Key Distribution. As described in Section 4.2.1, the AAA key is the
basis of the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK) and other keys (i.e., TK, EAPOL-KEK, and EAPOL-KCK).
The interface between the AS and the AP—to allow the distribution of the AAA key and support mutual
authentication—is not fully defined in the IEEE 802.11i specification. However, RADIUS and Diameter
are the protocols most likely to be used to support authentication traffic between an AS and AP.

Although the details of the communications interface between the AS and the AP are outside the scope of
the IEEE 802.11i amendment, the amendment does contain several requirements for the interface to
ensure that the security of an RSN is not compromised. Specifically, the communication link between the
AS and AP must provide the following:

     Robust, mutual authentication between the AS and AP
     An end-to-end channel between the AS and the authenticator for the mutual authentication
