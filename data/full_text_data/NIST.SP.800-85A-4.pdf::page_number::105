C.1.2           GET DATA card command

C.1.2.1          Contact Interface

 Purpose                Validates that the PIV Card accepts the GET DATA command
                        through the contact interface and with the access rule of each
                        container as specified in Table 2 of SP 800-73-4 Part 1. This test is
                        applicable to the mandatory data objects required by SP 800-73-4,
                        and the optional data objects, when supported by the card.
 Reference(s)           1. SP 800-73-4 Part 2, Section 3.1.2
                        2. AS02.03, AS05.01, AS05.12, AS05.12A, AS05.02
 Precondition(s)        1. The IUT is inserted into the contact reader.
                        2. There exists a valid PC/SC connection between the test system
                           and the contact reader.
                        3. No application is currently connected to the PIV Card
                           Application.
                        4. The optional containers supported by the card are recorded.
 Test Scenario          1.   Send SELECT card command with
                             • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 10 00 01 00'
                        2.   Send GET DATA command with
                             • Data field of the command containing the tag of the
                               Card Capability Container data object
                        3.   Send GET DATA command with
                             • Data field of the command containing the tag of the
                               CHUID data object
                        4.   Send GET DATA command with
                             • Data field of the command containing the tag of the
                               X.509 Certificate for PIV Authentication data object
                        5.   Send GET DATA command with
                             • Data field of the command containing the tag of the
                               Cardholder Fingerprints data object
                        6.   Send GET DATA command with
                             • Data field of the command containing the tag of the
                               Security Object
                        7.   Send GET DATA command with
                             • Data field of the command containing the tag of the
                               Cardholder Facial Image data object
