An example of a security domain is a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that issues public
key certificates (see [X.509]). The PKI operates under one or more documented
certificate policies, and each public key certificate contains the certificate policies for
which the certificate is valid. The relying entity (the certificate user) can examine the
certificate and determine if the certificate provides acceptable security. However, when
entities from different PKI domains wish to communicate, and hence use each otherâ€™s
certificates, the certificate policies of the two PKI domains should be examined and
verified as offering equivalent security before the certificate should be used.

4.9.1 Conditions for Data Exchange
When an entity wishes to securely send a key and/or metadata to another entity, certain
conditions must be satisfied:
    a) There must be a means of sending and receiving the information, called a
       communications channel,
    b) The two entities must have interoperable cryptographic capabilities (e.g.,
       functionally identical encryption/decryption algorithms that utilize identical key
       lengths),
    c) The two entities must subscribe to equivalent (though perhaps different) security
       policies, and
    d) The two entities must trust each other (and perhaps other entities in the network)
       to enforce their own security policies 2.

If the entities belong to the same security domain, there is a high likelihood that each of
these conditions can be met. But, if the entities do not belong to the same security
domain, then these conditions are less likely to be satisfied. In the remainder of this
section, assume that conditions a), b), and d) are met; the discussion will focus on
condition c).

FR:4.15 The CKMS design shall specify design features that allow for the exchange of
keys and metadata with entities in other security domains that are considered to offer
equivalent but different security protections.

4.9.2 Assurance of Protection
Protection assurances include protecting a key and/or metadata from unauthorized
disclosure, protecting the key and/or metadata from unauthorized modification, and
knowing the source and destination of a key and/or metadata as required by the
application. Suppose that entity A in security domain A wishes to send a cryptographic
key and/or metadata to entity B in security domain B, and that conditions a), b), and d)
above are satisfied. Suppose also that entity B wishes to receive the key and/or metadata
and treat the received key and/or metadata exactly as it treats its own keys and/or

2
 An entity receiving data previously protected by one or more entities must trust the other
entities to have properly enforced their own security policies.
