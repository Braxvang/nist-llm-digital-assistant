6.2.1.3.       Network Segmentation and Isolation (PR.AC-5)
As discussed in Section 5, a common architecture for supporting a defense-in-depth
cybersecurity approach involves the use of network segmentation or zoning to organize devices
by location or function. Network segmentation is typically implemented physically using
different network switches or logically using virtual local area network (VLAN) configurations.
When properly configured, network segmentation helps enforce security policies and segmented
traffic at the Ethernet layer and facilitates network isolation.
For network isolation, organizations typically utilize their mapped data flows to identify required
communications between segments. Network isolation devices, such as gateways (including
unidirectional gateways or data-diodes) and firewalls, are then configured to enforce these
communication restrictions by monitoring all communication traffic and only permitting
explicitly authorized communication between segments.
Supplemental guidance for access controls can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-41, Rev. 1, Guidelines on Firewalls and Firewall Policy
   •   NIST SP 800-207, Zero Trust Architecture

            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            The use of network segmentation and isolation should support an
            organization’s OT cybersecurity defense-in-depth architecture, as
            described in Section 5.
            While VLANs can be a cost-effective solution for OT network
            segmentation, organizations should consider utilizing physically separate
            switches for segmenting high-criticality devices, such as those that
            support safety systems.
            When configuring network isolation devices, organizations may find it
            difficult to determine which network traffic is necessary for proper OT
            operations. In these situations, organizations might consider temporarily
            allowing and recording all communication between the network
            segments. This can provide reviewable logs to identify and document
            authorized communication for implementing network isolation rules.
            This activity may also reveal previously unknown or undocumented
            communication that needs to be reviewed by the organization.
            Organizations should also consider whether regulatory requirements
            stipulate the type of network isolation devices required for OT
            environments or specific network segments. If organizations choose to
            utilize firewalls to support network isolation, modern firewalls should be
            considered, such as stateful and deep packet inspection devices and
            devices specifically designed to support OT environments. Organizations
            should enforce a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy where possible
            and also review the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure’s
