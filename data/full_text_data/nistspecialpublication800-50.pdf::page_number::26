                       Figure 3-3: Model 3 – Fully Decentralized Program Management




The needs assessment is conducted by each organizational unit, because in this model, the units determine
the strategy for the awareness and training program. Policy and budget are passed from the central
authority to the organizational units. Based on the strategy, the organizational units develop their own
training plans. The organizational units develop their awareness and training material, and determine the
method(s) of deploying the material within their own units.

As was the case in the centralized program management model (Model 1) and the partially decentralized
program management model (Model 2), communication between the central authority and the
organizational units travels in both directions in this model. The central authority communicates the
agency’s policy directives regarding IT security awareness and training, and the budget for each
organizational unit. The central authority may also advise the organizational units that they are
responsible for conducting their own needs assessment, developing their strategy, developing training
plans, and implementing the program. The
