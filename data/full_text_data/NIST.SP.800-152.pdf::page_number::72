                            A Federal CKMS shall verify the integrity of keys and

6.6    Cryptographic Key and Metadata Security: During Key Establishment

Keys and metadata can be established between entities needing to communicate securely
using key transport or key agreement methods. These methods are typically used to establish
keys over electronic communications networks, but some of these could also be used to
provide extra security (i.e., beyond physical protection) when keys are manually distributed.
[SP 800-56A] and [SP 800-56B] specify cryptographic schemes for automated key
establishment. PR:2.2 in Section 2.2 requires the use of NIST-approved key-establishment
schemes for automated key establishment.

6.6.1 Key Transport
When symmetric or private cryptographic keys and sensitive metadata are transported
(distributed) from one entity (the sender) to one or more other entities (the intended
receiver(s)), they must be protected. Symmetric keys and private keys require confidentiality
protection, and all keys require integrity protection. A trusted courier can physically protect a
manually transported key, while automated electronic-based transport must be protected
using cryptography. NIST-approved methods for automated key transport are provided in [SP
800-56A] and [SP 800-56B].

The receiver of a transported key typically needs assurance that the key came from the
expected, authorized key sender. When transported using automated methods, this assurance
may be provided by a cryptographic mechanism (which is part of the complete key-
establishment protocol) that authenticates the identity of the sender to the receiver; the
FCKMS should verify the sender’s authority to perform the transport. When a key is
transported manually, authenticating the identity of the courier, and verifying the courier’s
authorization to transport the key should be used to provide this assurance.

FR:6.80 The CKMS design shall specify the methods used to protect the confidentiality of
symmetric and private keys during their transport.

FR:6.81 The CKMS design shall specify the methods used to protect the integrity of
transported keys and how the keys can be reconstructed or replaced after detecting errors.

FR:6.82 The CKMS design shall specify how the identity of the key sender is authenticated
to the receiver of transported keying material.

                            When keys and metadata are received using a key-transport

                            scheme, a Federal CKMS shall support mechanisms to verify:
                                a) The authorization of the source,
                                b) The integrity of the received data, and
