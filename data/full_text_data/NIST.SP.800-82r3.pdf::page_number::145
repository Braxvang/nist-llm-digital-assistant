            should establish their OT alerting thresholds based on baselines of
            normal network traffic and data flows in addition to normal human and
            OT process behavior. Additionally, OT components are often physically
            remote and not continually staffed. Alerting thresholds may need to take
            into consideration the response time associated with the alert. For
            example, a temperature alert threshold may have to be set to alert earlier
            based on the expected response time to correct the situation in order to
            avoid an incident.
            Shared credentials are often used on OT systems. Anomalous behavior
            on shared accounts may be more difficult to determine, so organizations
            should consider whether additional controls are required, such as
            identifying the use of shared credentials using physical access
            monitoring.

6.3.2. Security Continuous Monitoring (DE.CM)
Organizations should implement continuous monitoring as part of the organizational risk
management strategy to monitor the effectiveness of protective measures. This includes
establishing the frequency for evaluating the implementation of the desired outcomes.
Continuous monitoring can be performed by internal or external resources to identify security
gaps within the environment. Peer reviews (i.e., cold eyes reviews) between sites of the same
organization are highly encouraged. When leveraging third-party services for security continuous
monitoring, it is important to understand and evaluate how the organization’s continuous
monitoring data is protected by the third party. A third party that aggregates continuous
monitoring information from multiple organizations may be a desirable target for adversaries.

            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations may find that automation within OT environments may
            not be possible due to the sensitivity of the systems or the resources
            required to support the automation. For example, some automated
            systems may utilize active scanning to support vulnerability or patch
            management or to validate device configurations. Solutions that perform
            active scanning or use local resources to support automation should be
            tested before deployment into the OT system.
