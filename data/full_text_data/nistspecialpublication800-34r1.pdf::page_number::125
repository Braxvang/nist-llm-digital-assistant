                                               CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



   The BIA process recommended in this guide is specifically designed to utilize the identify impact
   categories and values, determine recovery time objectives (RTOs), and prioritize system components
   for information systems. This BIA format uses FIPS 199 impact levels as a baseline to help
   determine the impact categories, values, and priorities and allows the organization to further
   customize the BIA to identify impact categories unique to the organization’s mission. The BIA in
   this guide is a recommended format for information systems; organizations may adapt the format to
   their needs or use a different process.

   The BIA process required by FCD-2 is designed to identify the threats, vulnerabilities, impacts, and
   mitigation strategies for the organization’s primary mission essential functions (PMEFs). BIAs for
   information systems that support PMEFs should use the FCD-2 BIA as input to the system-focused
   BIA.

9. How can I determine which contingency solutions I should implement to ensure availability of
   my information systems?

   The ISCP Coordinator can use the BIA results to determine contingency planning requirements and
   priorities. Results from the BIA should be appropriately incorporated into the analysis and strategy
   development efforts for the organization’s COOP, BCP, and DRP. The BIA should be performed
   during the Initiation phase of the SDLC. As the system design evolves and components change, the
   BIA may need to be conducted again during the Development/Acquisition phase of the SDLC.

   The BIA, which is the second step in the information system contingency planning process, is central
   to determining what recovery strategies should be implemented to ensure availability. The BIA
   enables the ISCP Coordinator to fully characterize the system components, supported
   mission/business processes, and interdependencies. The BIA should be developed with input from all
   associated system owners, end users, and interconnected system partners. Possible mission/business
   impacts attributed to the unavailability of the information system can then be determined, leading to
   the RTO, mean tolerable downtime (MTD), and sequencing recovery of information system
   components. Thus, recovery prioritizations will form the basis for developing appropriate
   contingency solutions.

10. What type of alternate site should I choose as a recovery strategy?

   The type of alternate site should be determined through the BIA with consideration of the FIPS 199
   impact level. The alternate site choice must be cost-effective and match the availability needs of the
   organization’s information systems. Thus, if a system requires near 100 percent availability, then a
   mirrored or hot site might be the right choice. However, if the system can allow for several days of
   downtime, then a cold site might be a better option.

11. When an event occurs, who should be notified?

   Notification procedures must be outlined in the ISCP. The ISCP Coordinator should determine who
   should be notified if a disruption occurs to the information system and in what sequence they should
   be contacted. Parties notified typically include the system owners, users, and interconnected
   information system points of contact. External entities that might be interconnected to the
   information system should also be included in the notification procedures. Design of a call tree will
   assist the sequence and responsibilities of executing notifications to appropriate contacts.
