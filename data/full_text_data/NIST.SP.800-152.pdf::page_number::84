SP 800-152                                                    A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


                AU-6        A Federal CKMS shall perform an audit of its personnel
PR:6.89
                PS-1        security actions after a personnel security compromise is
                            detected, and issue revisions to the FCKMS operations
                            documentation that would reduce the likelihood of similar
                            compromises.

                            A Federal CKMS should:
PA:6.27
                             a) Minimize the ability of personnel accessing the FCKMS
                                to hide any actions that could cause a security failure,
                             b) Maintain audit records that aid in determining who or
                                what caused the security failure, and
                             c) Mitigate the negative consequences of a failure due to a
                                personnel compromise.
                            A Federal CKMS should perform the following after
PA:6.28
                            detecting an actual or probable compromise of security:
                                a) Shut down the compromised system,
                                b) Activate a backup facility and system with new keys
                                    or uncompromised keys,
                                c) Notify current and potential users of the possible
                                    security compromise, and
                                d) Revoke compromised keys.

6.8.8 Physical Security Compromise Recovery
Physical security should be used to both prevent and detect security compromises. In
addition to the disclosure or destruction of keys, a physical security breach of an FCKMS
module could result in compromises to the integrity of any of its internal components. A
cryptographic module may be designed with adequate physical protections, but if security-
related logic resides outside of the cryptographic module, then the integrity of that logic also
needs protection. Techniques similar to those used by the cryptographic module should be
employed. An FCKMS should support both prevention and detection mechanisms against
physical compromises.

If the physical security of an FCKMS module is breached, all sensitive data within the
breached area should be suspected of being compromised. The FCKMS components
associated with the FCKMS module should be examined to detect any unauthorized
modification or replacement. Compromised components should be repaired or replaced to
prevent new keys and sensitive information from being compromised in the future.

FR:6.120 The CKMS design shall specify how all CKMS components and devices are
protected from unauthorized physical access.

FR:6.121 The CKMS design shall specify how the CKMS detects unauthorized physical
access.

FR:6.122 The CKMS design shall specify how the CKMS recovers from unauthorized
physical access to components and devices other than cryptographic modules.
