                                             GUIDE TO STORAGE ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES FOR END USER DEVICES



1.    Introduction

1.1   Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency
Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2   Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this document is to assist organizations in understanding storage encryption technologies
for end user devices and in planning, implementing, and maintaining storage encryption solutions. The
types of end user devices addressed in this document are personal computers (desktops and laptops),
consumer devices (e.g., personal digital assistants, smart phones), and removable storage media (e.g.,
USB flash drives, memory cards, external hard drives, writeable CDs and DVDs). This document
provides practical, real-world guidance for three classes of storage encryption techniques: full disk
encryption, volume and virtual disk encryption, and file/folder encryption. It also discusses important
security elements of a storage encryption deployment, including cryptographic key management and
authentication. It only discusses the encryption of data at rest (storage), and does not address the
encryption of data in motion (transmission).

1.3   Audience

This document has been created for information security program managers and staff, system
administrators, and others who are responsible for selecting, deploying, managing, and maintaining
storage encryption technologies for end user devices. This document does not assume that the reader has
previous experience with any storage encryption technologies, but it does assume that the reader has
experience with information security.

1.4   Document Structure

The remainder of this document is organized into three major sections.

 Section 2 provides an overview of the basic concepts of storage encryption for end user devices.
