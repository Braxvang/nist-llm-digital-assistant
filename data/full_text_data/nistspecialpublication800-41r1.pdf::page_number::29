                                                                 GUIDELINES ON FIREWALLS AND FIREWALL POLICY


    127.255.255.255 (also known as the localhost addresses) and 0.0.0.0 (interpreted by some operating
    systems as a localhost or a broadcast address). These have no legitimate use on a network. Also,
    traffic using link-local addresses (169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255) should be blocked.
 Traffic with an invalid source address for incoming traffic or destination address for outgoing traffic
  (an invalid “external” address) should be blocked at the network perimeter. This traffic is often
  caused by malware, spoofing, denial of service attacks, or misconfigured equipment. The most
  common type of invalid external addresses is an IPv4 address within the ranges in RFC 1918,
  Address Allocation for Private Internets, that are reserved for private networks. These ranges are
  10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8 in Classless Inter-Domain Routing [CIDR] notation),
  172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12), and 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16).
 Traffic with a private destination address for incoming traffic or source address for outgoing traffic
  (an “internal” address) should be blocked at the network perimeter. Perimeter devices can perform
  address translation services to permit internal hosts with private addresses to communicate through
  the perimeter, but private addresses should not be passed through the network perimeter.
 Outbound traffic with invalid source addresses should be blocked (this is often called egress
  filtering). Systems that have been compromised by attackers can be used to attack other systems on
  the Internet; using invalid source addresses makes these kinds of attacks more difficult to stop.
  Blocking this type of traffic at an organization’s firewall helps reduce the effectiveness of these
  attacks.

 Incoming traffic with a destination address of the firewall itself should be blocked unless the firewall
  is offering services for incoming traffic that require direct connections—for example, if the firewall is
  acting as an application proxy.
Organizations should also block the following types of traffic at the perimeter:

 Traffic containing IP source routing information, which allows a system to specify the routes that
  packets will employ while traveling from source to destination. This could potentially permit an
  attacker to construct a packet that bypasses network security controls. IP source routing is rarely used
  on modern networks, and valid applications are even less common on the Internet.

 Traffic from outside the network containing broadcast addresses that is directed to inside the network.
  Any system that responds to the directed broadcast will then send its response to the system specified
  by the source, rather than to the source system itself. These packets can be used to create huge
  “storms” of network traffic for denial of service attacks. Regular broadcast addresses, as well as
  addresses used for multicast IP, may or may not be appropriate for blocking at an organization’s
  firewall. Multicast and broadcast networking is seldom used in normal networking environments, but
  when it is used both inside and outside of the organization, it should be allowed through firewalls.

Firewalls at the network perimeter should block all incoming traffic to networks and hosts that should not
be accessible from external networks. These firewalls should also block all outgoing traffic from the
organization’s networks and hosts that should not be permitted to access external networks. Deciding
which addresses should be blocked is often one of the most time-consuming aspects of developing
firewall IP policies. It is also one of the most error-prone, because the IP address associated with an
undesired entity often changes over time.
