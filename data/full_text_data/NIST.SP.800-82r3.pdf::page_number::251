auditing for wireless access, limiting wireless access privileges to key personnel, or using AC-18
(5) to reduce the boundary of wireless access.
Control Enhancement: (3) (4) No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (5) Availability and interference for wireless signals may be a concern
within OT environments. Antennas and power levels should be designed to overcome and
achieve availability goals. Where confidentiality is concerned, antennas and power levels can
also be designed to minimize signal exposure outside of the facility.

OT Discussion: Organizations refine the definition of “external” to reflect lines of authority and
responsibility, the granularity of an organization entity, and their relationships. An organization
may consider a system to be external if that system performs different functions, implements
different policies, falls under different management authorities, or does not provide sufficient
visibility into the implementation of controls to allow the establishment of a satisfactory trust
relationship. For example, an OT system and a business data processing system may be
considered external to each other depending on the organization’s system boundaries.
Access to an OT for support by a business partner, such as a vendor or support contractor, is
another common example. The definition and trustworthiness of external systems is reexamined
with respect to OT functions, purposes, technology, and limitations to establish a clearly
documented technical or business case for use and an acceptance of the risk inherent in the use of
an external system.
Control Enhancement: (1) (2) No OT Discussion for this control.
