                                                                        GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



make it easier to choose the appropriate filtering software and determine the types of rules that need to be
configured.

Another effective way to decrease the number of unwanted messages reaching mail servers is using
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) lookup on a mail gateway or firewall as a filtering
mechanism. LDAP lookup allows the gateway or firewall to query the organization’s user directory
directly for user information. When an email is received by the gateway or firewall, it contacts the user
directory to see if the email is addressed to a user that actually exists. If the user is not in the directory,
the email is rejected and does not reach the mail server. Much of the spam sent to a domain is generated
using a database of common usernames. Most of these addresses do not exist for a particular domain, but
it is an easy method for spammers to get their messages to many users quickly. Using LDAP lookup
prevents these messages from slowing the mail server.

Many Internet service providers (ISP) and third-party companies offer malware scanning and content
filtering services, including spam filtering. These services can be helpful for organizations that wish to
add an extra layer of defense but do not want to implement or maintain the extra layer of protection
themselves. The services delete or tag messages before they reach an organization’s mail server,
therefore increasing its efficiency. Because these services may monitor emails for many organizations,
they can often identify new unwanted messages very quickly. Disadvantages of using such a service
include the following:

 Privacy. All of the organization’s incoming email is routed through the service provider’s servers
  and scanned by them.
 False Positives. The service provider’s filtering solution might automatically delete emails tagged as
  spam or might not provide a way for administrators to check the validity of email tagging.
 Availability. If the service becomes unavailable, the organization should be able to change the
  routing of email to prevent delays in mail delivery.
6.2.2.2 Content Filtering Issues

Although email content filtering is critical to most organizations’ security posture, a number of legal
implications should be addressed before deployment. Content filtering needs to be backed up by a clearly
defined written security policy. The email policy should include an explicit statement that email will be
monitored for compliance, a description of any administrative or disciplinary actions that could result if
the policy is violated, and a requirement for employees to acknowledge reading and understanding the
policy. Although the policy should outline the organization’s thinking, expectations, and restrictions
regarding security, due regard should also be given to employee and individual rights. For instance,
under some circumstances employees may have a right to privacy when it comes to their own
correspondence; however, when representing their organization, the organization may be held legally
responsible for what they say or do. Without an established policy, such issues often lead to
misunderstanding and problems that can be difficult to resolve.

Similarly, in some situations, email messages may be deemed to carry the same legal weight as written
documents, especially when digitally signed. This can mean having to store messages to comply with
record-keeping requirements, including employees’ personal messages. As such, all employees should be
made aware of the security policy. To the extent possible, the security policy should be broadly
distributed to employees [McKi01]. Moreover, it may be advisable to require employees to acknowledge
the policy as part of their contract of employment or as a condition of working on a contract, and to also
require employees to re-acknowledge the policy on a regular basis. Many email filter applications can
