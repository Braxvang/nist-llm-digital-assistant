      NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                             Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                      Authentication and Lifecycle Management


806   Verifiers SHALL store look-up secrets in a form that is resistant to offline attacks. Look-
807   up secrets having at least 112 bits of entropy SHALL be hashed with an approved one-
808   way function as described in Sec. 5.1.1.2. Look-up secrets with fewer than 112 bits
809   of entropy SHALL be salted and hashed using a suitable password hashing scheme,
810   also described in Sec. 5.1.1.2. The salt value SHALL be at least 32 bits in length and
811   arbitrarily chosen so as to minimize salt value collisions among stored hashes. Both the
812   salt value and the resulting hash SHALL be stored for each look-up secret.
813   For look-up secrets that have less than 64 bits of entropy, the verifier SHALL implement
814   a rate-limiting mechanism that effectively limits the number of failed authentication
815   attempts that can be made on the subscriber account as described in Sec. 5.2.2.
816   The verifier SHALL use approved encryption and an authenticated protected channel
817   when requesting look-up secrets in order to provide resistance to eavesdropping and AitM
818   attacks.

819   5.1.3. Out-of-Band Devices
820   An out-of-band authenticator is a physical device that is uniquely addressable and can
821   communicate securely with the verifier over a distinct communications channel, referred
822   to as the secondary channel. The device is possessed and controlled by the claimant and
823   supports private communication over this secondary channel, separate from the primary
824   channel for authentication. An out-of-band authenticator is something you have.
825   Out-of-band authentiction uses a short-term secret generated by the verifier. The secret’s
826   purpose is to securely bind the authentication operation on the primary and secondary
827   channel and establishes the claimant’s control of the out-of-band device.
828   The out-of-band authenticator can operate in one of the following ways:
829       • The claimant transfers a secret received by the out-of-band device via the secondary
830         channel to the verifier using the primary channel. For example, the claimant may
831         receive the secret (typically a 6-digit code) on their mobile device and type it into
832         their authentication session. This method is shown in Figure 1.
833       • The claimant transfers a secret received via the primary channel to the out-of-band
834         device for transmission to the verifier via the secondary channel. For example, the
835         claimant may view the secret on their authentication session and either type it into
836         an app on their mobile device or use a technology such as a barcode or QR code to
837         effect the transfer. This method is shown in Figure 2.
838         Note: A third method of out-of-band authentication involving the comparison
839         of secrets received from the primary and secondary channels and approving
840         on the secondary channel is no longer considered acceptable because it was
841         rarely implemented as described. It raised the likelihood that the claimant
842         would just approve without actually comparing the secrets. For example,

                                                  18
