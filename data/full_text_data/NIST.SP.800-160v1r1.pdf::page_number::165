Appendix I. Technical Management Processes
This appendix contains the Technical Management Processes from [4] with security-relevant
considerations and contributions for the purpose, outcomes, activities, and tasks.

I.1.        Project Planning
The purpose of the Project Planning process is to produce and coordinate effective and workable
plans.

I.1.1. Security Purpose
-      Determine and coordinate the security aspects of effective and workable plans.

I.1.2. Security Outcomes
-      Security objectives, security-specific plans, and security aspects of other plans are defined.
-      Security-relevant roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities within the project
       are defined.
-      Security aspects of performance and achievement criteria are defined.
-      The resources and services necessary to achieve the security objectives are committed.
-      Plans for the execution of the security aspects of the project are activated.

I.1.3. Security Activities and Tasks
PL-1      DEFINE THE PROJECT
          PL-1.1 Identify the security aspects of project objectives and constraints.
          Note: Objectives and constraints include strategic security, assurance, and trustworthiness
          goals, as well as loss thresholds and regulatory concerns. Each security-relevant objective is
          identified with a level of detail that permits selecting, tailoring, and implementing the
          appropriate processes and activities.
          PL-1.2 Define the security aspects of the project scope as established in agreements.
          Note: This includes the relevant activities required to satisfy the security aspects of decision
          criteria and complete the project successfully.
          PL-1.3 Define and maintain the security views of the project life cycle model that are
                 comprised of stages using the defined life cycle models of the organization.
          PL-1.4 Establish appropriate security aspects of the work breakdown structure.
          Note: Each security-relevant element of the work breakdown structure is described with a level
          of detail that is consistent with identified security risks and required visibility.
          PL-1.5 Define and maintain the security aspects of processes that will be applied to the project.
