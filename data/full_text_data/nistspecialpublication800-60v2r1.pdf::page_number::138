Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level associated with the executive information type is associated with
functions of the Executive Office of the President (EOP). The effects of loss of confidentiality
of policies and guidance during the formative stage can result in attempts by affected entities and
other interested parties to influence and/or impede the policy and guidance development process.
Premature public release of formative policies and guidance before internal coordination and
review can result in unnecessary damage to public confidence in the EOP. These consequences
may occur when the release includes unedited internal commentary and discussion.

Most of the information processed in and by the EOP is classified national security information
and is outside the scope of this guideline. Other information processed by the EOP is extremely
sensitive and applicable to homeland security and law enforcement. The unauthorized disclosure
of this extremely sensitive information can seriously imperil human life, key national assets, and
critical infrastructures.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Based on the catastrophic harm that can be suffered by
the nation due to unauthorized disclosure of executive information the provisional confidentiality
impact level recommended for executive functions information is high.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications that
contain EOP information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect public
confidence in the government. In the case of the EOP, the impact of such a loss of public
confidence may be at least moderate.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
executive information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the executive information. National
defense and critical infrastructure protection aspects of EOP functions are not generally tolerant
of delays. Excessive recovery delays can result in loss of coordination of critical defense and
public welfare processes.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
executive functions information is high.
