the very beginning of the planning process for each new data collection. By knowing in
advance how they intend to publish the data and for what purposes and by having a plan
for how disclosure limitation will be applied, agencies can tailor information collection
accordingly.
For example, if specifc identifers are not needed for maintenance, synthesis, and usage,
then those identifers should not be collected. If fully identifed data are needed within the
organization, the identifying information can be removed prior to the data being published,
shared, or archived. Applying de-identifcation throughout the data life cycle minimizes
privacy risk and signifcantly eases the process of public release. However, agencies should
be cognizant of the potential loss of future utility if identifers are permanently removed.
For this reason, agencies may wish to retain an identifed dataset or data-linking informa-
tion, as it may be diffcult to predict future needs.
Altman et al. [97] (Figures 3 and 4) propose a “modern approach to privacy-aware gov-
ernment data releases” that incorporates progressive levels of de-identifcation as well as
different kinds of access and administrative controls in line with the sensitivity of the data.
Agencies that perform de-identifcation should document that:
    • The techniques used to perform the de-identifcation are theoretically sound and gen-
      erally accepted.22
    • The software used to perform the de-identifcation is reliable for the intended task.
    • The individuals who performed the de-identifcation were suitably qualifed.
    • The tests that were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the de-identifcation were
      validated for that purpose.
    • Ongoing monitoring is in place to ensure the continued effectiveness of the de-
      identifcation strategy.


22 To determine that a technique is theoretically sound and generally accepted, agencies should adopt guid-

 ance that mirrors the language that the HHS November 26, 2012, Guidance Regarding Methods for De-
 identifcation of Protected Health Information in Accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and
 Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule [166] uses in its discussion of the Privacy Rule’s “expert deter-
 mination method,” which states on page 7:
 “A covered entity may determine that health information is not individually identifable health information
 only if:
  (1) A person with appropriate knowledge of and experience with generally accepted statistical and sci-
      entifc principles and methods for rendering information not individually identifable:
        (i) Applying such principles and methods, determines that the risk is very small that the informa-
            tion could be used, alone or in combination with other reasonably available information, by an
            anticipated recipient to identify an individual who is a subject of the information; and
       (ii) Documents the methods and results of the analysis that justify such determination;”
