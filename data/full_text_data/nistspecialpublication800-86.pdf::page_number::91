                                              GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



8.      Using Data from Multiple Sources

Sections 4 through 6 describe the collection, examination, and analysis of data from three data source
categories: data files, OSs, and network traffic. The techniques and processes for collecting, examining,
and analyzing the data in these categories are fundamentally different. Section 7 describes the collection,
examination, and analysis of application data, which brings together the three data source categories. For
example, many applications use data files, alter the configuration of OSs, and generate network traffic.
Many situations, such as computer security incidents, can be handled most effectively by analyzing
multiple types of data sources and correlating events across sources.

This section of the guide presents two examples of the use of multiple data sources during digital
forensics. Each example describes a scenario, indicates a specific need for forensic analysis, and presents
an explanation of how the forensic process might be performed. The explanations also illustrate how
complex the process can be. The examples presented in this section are as follows:

      ! Determining which worm has infected a system and identifying the worm’s characteristics
      ! Reconstructing the sequence of cyber events involving a threatening e-mail.
8.1     Suspected Network Service Worm Infection

An organization’s help desk receives several calls in a short time from users complaining about a
particular server providing slow responses. The help desk sends a trouble ticket to the monitoring group.
That group’s network IDSs have recently reported several unusual alerts involving the server, and the
analyst who reviewed the alerts believes that they may be accurate. The data in the alerts indicates that
some suspicious activity was directed at the server, and the server is now generating identical activity
directed at other systems. The intrusion detection analyst’s initial hypothesis is that a worm may have
attacked a vulnerable network service and infected the server, which is now attempting to infect other
systems. The monitoring group contacts the incident handler on duty to investigate the possible incident
on the server.

For the incident, this particular incident handler’s role is to determine the type of worm that has infected
the system and to identify the distinguishing characteristics of the worm. This information is critical to
the incident response team’s ability to effectively perform containment, eradication, and recovery
activities and to prevent other systems within the organization from becoming infected. If the incident
handler’s investigation shows that the incident was probably caused by something other than a worm, the
characteristics the handler identifies should be very helpful in determining what actually occurred.

Information regarding this incident may be recorded in several different places. The incident handler
should check the data sources that are most likely to have relevant information first, based on the
handler’s previous experience with the data sources and the initial information available regarding the
incident. For example, because network IDS sensors saw the suspicious activity, other network-based
data sources monitoring the same network segment might also contain relevant information. If the
organization uses security event management or network forensic analysis tool software, which bring
together data from many different sources, the incident handler may be able to gather all necessary
information just by running a few queries from the SEM or NFAT console. If a centralized source of data
is not available, the handler should check individual potential sources of attack characteristics, such as the
following:

      ! Network IDS. Because the initial reports of the incident were generated by network IDS sensors,
        it is very likely that the network IDS data contains information on the basic characteristics of the
