6.4.3. Response Analysis (RS.AN)
Cybersecurity incidents are analyzed to ensure effective response and recovery activities that are
consistent with the detection process and the response plan. Analysis includes reviewing
notifications, determining whether an investigation is required, understanding potential impacts,
performing forensics, categorizing the incident consistent with the response plan, and analyzing
disclosed vulnerabilities.
Supplemental guidance for the response analysis controls can be found in the following
document:
   â€¢   NIST SP 800-86, Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            When determining the overall impact of a cybersecurity incident,
            consider the dependencies of OT and its resulting impact on operations.
            For example, an OT system may be dependent on IT for business
            applications, such that an incident on the IT network results in an OT
            disconnect or shutdown.
            If an organization does not have adequate resources or capabilities to
            conduct OT forensics, consider engaging external organizations to
            perform forensic analysis.
            Organizations should identify and classify cyber and non-cyber incidents
            that affect the OT environment according to the incident response plan.
            When developing the OT incident response plan, potential classes of
            incidents could include accidental actions taken by authorized personnel,
            targeted malicious attacks, and untargeted malicious attacks.

6.4.4. Response Mitigation (RS.MI)
Mitigation activities are meant to prevent expansion of the incident, mitigate its effects, and
resolve the incident and should be consistent with the response plan.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            OT components are often physically remote and not continually staffed.
            For these cases, consider how the organization would respond during an
            incident and the additional time required to coordinate the response. The
            system may need to be designed with the capability to minimize impacts
            until personnel can arrive on-site (e.g., remote shutdown or disconnects).
            Cyber incident mitigation may involve process shutdowns or
            communication disconnects that impact operations. These impacts
            should be understood and communicated during incident mitigation.
