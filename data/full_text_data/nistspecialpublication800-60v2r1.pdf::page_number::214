crime prevention information might have a serious adverse effect on crime prevention operations
by eliminating uncertainty regarding surveillance patterns. Therefore, the confidentiality impact
might be moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for crime prevention information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Crime
prevention activities are not generally time-critical. In most cases, the adverse effects of
unauthorized modification or destruction of crime prevention information on agency mission
functions and/or public confidence in the agency would be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
crime prevention information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to crime prevention information. Most
crime prevention processes are tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of access to crime
prevention information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: In exceptional cases (e.g., orders
associated with deployment of officers to provide a crime-discouraging presence in developing
threat situations), loss of availability of information can have a serious adverse effect on crime
prevention operations. In such cases, the availability impact might be moderate.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
crime prevention information is low.

D.16.8 Trade Law Enforcement Information Type

Trade law enforcement refers to the enforcement of anti-boycott, international loan, and
general trade laws. The security categorization recommended for the trade law enforcement
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of trade law enforcement
information on the ability of responsible agencies to enforce various Customs laws.
Unauthorized disclosure of trade law enforcement information could potentially jeopardize
fulfillment of other trade law enforcement missions. Some information that has supported a
trade law enforcement process might be of higher sensitivity, and unauthorized disclosure of this
