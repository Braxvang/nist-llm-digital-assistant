      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022


577   to consider any potential or actual impact to the experiences and outcomes of these
578   populations, including disparities between populations, caused by the design or operation
579   of digital identity systems.
580   For federal agencies implementing these guidelines, EO 13985 directs federal agencies
581   to identify underserved communities for the programs and services that they provide and
582   to determine and address any systemic barriers to underserved communities to provide
583   equitable access to those programs and services. In alignment with the direction set
584   by EO 13985, federal agencies should determine potential barriers communities and
585   individuals may face to enrollment in and access to online benefits and services. They
586   should also identify whether programmatic changes may be necessary to advance equity.

587   2.3.4. Usability
588   Usability refers to the extent to which a system, product, or service can be used by
589   specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in
590   a specified context of use.
591   Similar to equity, usability requires an understanding of the people interacting with a
592   digital identity system or process, as well as their unique goals and context of use. To
593   provide an effective, efficient, and satisfactory experience, readers of this guidance should
594   take a holistic approach to considering the interactions that each user will engage in
595   throughout the process of enrolling in and authenticating to a service. Throughout the
596   design and development lifecycle of a digital identity system or process, it is important to
597   conduct usability evaluation with representative users performing realistic scenarios and
598   tasks in appropriate context of use.
599   Digital identity management processes should be designed and implemented so it is easy
600   for users to do the right thing, hard to do the wrong thing, and easy to recover when the
601   wrong thing happens.
