availability of these commands is impacted in some cases by system (i.e., BIOS/UEFI—Basic
Input-Output System/Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) characteristics, such as how and
when freeze lock commands are issued to a device. The use of a dedicated computer or
equipment to perform sanitization that facilitates leveraging these commands (such as a PC or
workstation, with an external drive bay that facilitates safely connecting a drive after the system
has been powered on) can help address this issue. The behavior and methods to bypass freeze
lock or other limitations on command availability vary between computers, so refer to the
computer manufacturer for details about the behavior of specific models. Alternative approaches
exist for addressing the issue, and will vary depending on the hardware, software, and firmware
of the computer. University of California San Diego (UCSD)’s Center for Magnetic Recording
Research (CMRR) has also developed some tools and documentation about work-arounds for
this issue (see Appendix C for details).

Some sanitization procedures feature additional optional methods. The choice regarding whether
to apply the optional components depends on the level of confidentiality of the data and
assurance of correct implementation of the non-optional portion of the sanitization procedure.
For example, an organization might decide that for PII, for example, that any method applied
with an available optional component should execute that optional component. The choice may
also be based on the time factor, as some procedures, including the optional method, can be
executed in a total of a matter of minutes. In that case, the organization might decide to include
the optional component even if the data is not in a higher confidentiality category.

   Hard Copy Storage

   Paper and microforms

   Clear:         N/A, see Destroy.

   Purge:         N/A, see Destroy

   Destroy:       Destroy paper using cross cut shredders which produce particles that are 1 mm x 5 mm
                  (0.04 in. x 0.2 in.) in size (or smaller), or pulverize/disintegrate paper materials using
                  disintegrator devices equipped with a 3/32 in. (2.4 mm) security screen.

                  Destroy microforms (microfilm, microfiche, or other reduced image photo negatives) by
                  burning.


   Notes:         When material is burned, residue must be reduced to white ash.

   Networking Devices

   Routers and Switches (home, home office, enterprise)

   Clear:         Perform a full manufacturer’s reset to reset the router or switch back to its factory default settings.
