NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                                Guidelines for Media Sanitization


strength of the cryptographic key or the strength of the cryptographic algorithm and mode of
operation used to encrypt the data.

If strong cryptography is used, sanitization of the target data is reduced to sanitization of the
encryption key(s) used to encrypt the target data. Thus, with CE, sanitization may be performed
with high assurance much faster than with other sanitization techniques. The encryption itself
acts to sanitize the data, subject to constraints identified in this guidelines document. Federal
agencies must use FIPS 140 validated encryption modules 12 in order to have assurance that the
conditions stated above have been verified for the SED.

Typically, CE can be executed in a fraction of a second. This is especially important as storage
devices get larger resulting in other sanitization methods take more time. CE can also be used as
a supplement or addition to other sanitization approaches.

      2.6.1 When Not To Use CE To Purge Media

         Do not use CE to purge media if the encryption was enabled after sensitive data was
          stored on the device without having been sanitized first.

         Do not use CE if it is unknown whether sensitive data was stored on the device without
          being sanitized prior to encryption.

      2.6.2 When to Consider Using CE

         Consider using CE when all data intended for CE is encrypted prior to storage on the
          media (including the data, as well as virtualized copies).

         Consider using CE when we know the location(s) on the media where the encryption key
          is stored (be it the target data's encryption key or an associated wrapping key) and can
          sanitize those areas using the appropriate media-specific sanitization technique, ensuring
          the actual location on media where the key is stored is addressed.

         Consider using CE when we can know that all copies of the encryption keys used to
          encrypt the target data are sanitized

         Consider using CE when the target data's encryption keys are, themselves, encrypted with
          one or more wrapping keys and we are confident that we can sanitize the corresponding
          wrapping keys.

         Consider using CE when we are confident of the ability of the user to clearly identifyand
          use the commands provided by the device to perform the CE operation.
