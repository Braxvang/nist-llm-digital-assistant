                                            ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



10.5 Life Cycle for IEEE 802.11 RSN Deployment

To be effective, WLAN security should be incorporated throughout the life cycle of WLAN solutions,
from policy to operations. The model described in this section is based on one introduced in NIST SP
800-64, Security Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle. Organizations may
follow a project management methodology or life cycle model that does not directly map to the phases in
the model presented in this guide, but the types of tasks in the methodology and their sequencing are
probably similar. The phases of the life cycle are the following:

       Deployment Phase 1: Initiation. This phase includes the tasks to be performed before starting
        the design of a WLAN solution. These include providing an overall vision for how the WLAN
        would support the mission of the organization, creating a high-level strategy for the WLAN’s
        implementation, developing a WLAN use policy, and specifying business and functional
        requirements for the solution.
       Deployment Phase 2: Acquisition/Development. For the purposes of this guide, the
        Acquisition/Development phase is split into the following two parts:

           –    Phase 2a: Planning and Design. In this phase, WLAN network architects specify the
                technical characteristics of the WLAN solution and related network components. These
                characteristics include the EAP method or methods used to support authentication; the
                protocols used to support communication between client, AP, and AS; access control lists
                and firewall rules to segregate WLAN traffic; and the nature of the supporting PKI. A site
                survey is typically conducted to help determine the architecture of the solution.

           –    Phase 2b: Procurement. This phase involves specifying the number and type of WLAN
                components that must be purchased, the feature sets they must support, and any certifications
                they must hold. It may also include procuring client upgrades to support the security policies
                to be enforced in the WLAN deployment.
       Deployment Phase 3: Implementation. In this phase, procured equipment is first configured to
        meet operational and security requirements, and then it is installed and activated on a production
        network. Implementation includes altering the configuration of other security controls and
        technologies, such as security event logging, network management, AAA server integration, and
        PKI.
       Deployment Phase 4: Operations/Maintenance. This phase includes security-related tasks that
        should be performed on an ongoing basis once the WLAN is operational, including log review
        and rogue AP detection.
       Deployment Phase 5: Disposition. This phase encompasses tasks that occur after a system or its
        components have been retired, including preserving information to meet legal requirements,
        sanitizing media, and disposing of equipment properly.
10.6 Additional WLAN Security Recommendations

In addition to the recommendations presented throughout Sections 3 through 7 of this document, Section
8 provides over 50 best practice recommendations for WLAN security, grouped by the life cycle phase
for which each recommendation is most relevant. 122 Organizations are strongly encouraged to adopt the
“best practice” recommendations. Failure to implement them significantly increases the risk of a WLAN

      For the sake of brevity, the recommendations are not duplicated in this section. Readers should consult Tables 8-1 through
      8-6 for the recommended best practices for each life cycle phase.
