                                                                                           GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



7.2.10 Client Software Selection

The prelogin sequence requires a remote access host to download and execute active content so the host
integrity checks can be performed. The desktop management policies for the organization-managed hosts
are configured to permit specific active content controls to run locally.

7.2.11 Portal Design

The organization uses the portal provided by the VPN appliance vendor. It provides some customization
such as altering the banner graphics to be consistent with the organization’s logo and colors. It also only
displays options that the user is authorized to access. For example, if a user is in the group that is only
allowed to view the HR Web sites, only those sites are listed on the user’s portal page.

7.2.12 Encryption Scheme

The organization requires FIPS 140-2 compliance for its SSL VPN solution. As a result, the organization
verifies the level of FIPS compliance of the system before purchasing it. The organization configures the
SSL VPN to only permit logins from client browsers that use SSL cipher suites with FIPS-approved
cryptography. The appliance is also configured to require browsers to support TLS 1.0 for SSL
connections.

7.3     Implementing a Prototype

After the organization designs the SSL VPN solution, it implements and tests a prototype of the design.
The prototype is initially configured and tested in a laboratory network and is moved later to a production
network so access to actual internal resources can be tested. The laboratory network replicates the
addresses of the corporate network, and thus needs to be completely unconnected to the corporate
network. The test network includes a firewall with the same configuration as the corporate firewall, and
example servers that have the same capabilities and the same addresses as the servers that will be
accessed through the SSL VPN.

The organization develops a test plan to evaluate functionality and connectivity. The plan is based on
Section 4.3 and includes tests for connectivity, authentication, access control, endpoint security, and client
interoperability. Users of multiple operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux, Macintosh), device types
(e.g., laptops, PDAs, smart phones) and Web browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, Mozilla, Safari)
must be able to access internal resources from outside the network. If users are using organization-
managed hosts, then they should be able to do everything they could do if they were located in their
offices. Multiple scenarios such as a user logging in from a public host or a host that has an out of date
virus database must be tested. The testers also validate that people with different types of RADIUS
credentials only get the expected type of access when they log in during the test.

7.3.1    Example configuration steps

Different SSL VPNs have different administrative interfaces. Many allow control through Web browsers,
while some use custom programs, and still others use old-style command line interfaces (CLI). In this
section, a fictitious SSL VPN that has a browser interface is described along with examples of steps that
might be taken to implement the rules from the scenario.

The interface has four major sections:
