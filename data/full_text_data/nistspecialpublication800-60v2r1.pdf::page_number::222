Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Where the life of a victim, witness, or
informant may be endangered, the integrity impact will be high. Also, where the consequences
of a miscarriage of justice are likely to endanger public safety (e.g., release of a terrorist or other
murderer), the integrity impact will be high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: Given the legal consequences of the unauthorized
modification or destruction of legal prosecution/litigation information, the provisional integrity
impact level recommended for legal prosecution/litigation information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to legal prosecution/litigation
information. Most legal prosecution/litigation processes are tolerant of delay even though the
delays can impact court schedules, cause significant taxpayer expense, and potentially jeopardize
legal proceedings (see C17.4.2). Typically, the disruption of access to legal
prosecution/litigation information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on
government operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: In exceptional cases (e.g., information
affecting a ruling regarding an impending execution), loss of availability of information can have
a severe adverse effect. The availability impact level recommended for this legal
prosecution/litigation information is high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
legal prosecution/litigation information is low.

D.17.5 Resolution Facilitation Information Type

Resolution facilitation involves all activities outside of a court of law that may be used in an
attempt to settle a dispute between two or more parties (government, citizen, corporation). The
general recommended security categorization for the resolution facilitation information type is as
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of resolution facilitation
information on the ability of responsible entities to settle a dispute between two or more parties
(government, citizen, corporation) outside of a court of law. While some information associated
with resolution facilitation is public, much of the information is private and/or proprietary.
Unauthorized disclosure of such information can disrupt or defeat the dispute resolution process.
The consequences typically depend on the nature of the dispute. Jeopardy to the resolution
process will not usually involve threats to critical infrastructures, key national assets, or human
life. Typically, the unauthorized disclosure of resolution facilitation information will have only a
limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.
