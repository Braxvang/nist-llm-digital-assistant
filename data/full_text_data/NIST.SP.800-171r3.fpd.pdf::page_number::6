NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                 Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
November 2023

Note to Reviewers
This update to NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-171, Revision 3 includes the changes made to
the initial public draft (ipd) in response to the public comments received. Many trade-offs have
been made to ensure that the technical and non-technical requirements have been stated clearly
and concisely while also recognizing the specific needs of federal and nonfederal organizations.
The following significant changes have been made to the initial public draft of NIST SP 800-
171, Revision 3:
    •   Eliminated the NFO control tailoring category
    •   Introduced a new control tailoring category for controls that are addressed by other
        related controls (ORC)
    •   Eliminated selected organization-defined parameters (ODPs) where the ODP
        specification did not significantly impact the security requirement
    •   Clarified the responsibility for assigning ODP values
    •   Combined security requirements (or parts of requirements) with other requirements for
        consistency and ease of use
    •   Added security requirements due to control categorization changes
    •   Sequenced the content in the discussion sections to align with the individual parts of the
        requirements
    •   Modified the tailoring categories of selected controls and control items (subparts of
        controls)
    •   Added leading zeros to security requirement numbers to achieve greater consistency with
        SP 800-171A numbering formats and to support automated tool usage

Information regarding the transition of security requirements from NIST SP 800-171, Revision 2
to Revision 3 can be found on the publication details web page.
