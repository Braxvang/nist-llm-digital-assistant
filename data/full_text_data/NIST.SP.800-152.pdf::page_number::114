SP 800-152                                               A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


scanner and verifier). However, low-cost mobile devices often do not have the built-in
tamper protection features of a fixed device. Therefore, the owner who carries and uses a
secure mobile device is responsible for protecting it against physical damage, loss, and
unauthorized use.

Mobile devices have the advantage that they may be easily replaced when they are
damaged.

Whether an FCKMS module is operated in a fixed or mobile facility, a backup facility or
capability should be available, and the FCKMS should support reporting and recovery
procedures in the event of damage to a primary FCKMS facility. FCKMS facilities
should be designed, implemented, and operated in a manner commensurate with the value
and sensitivity of the information being protected.

When a facility is damaged, secret and private keys and keys associated with sensitive
metadata that could have been disclosed should be immediately placed on Compromised
Key Lists or Certificate Revocation Lists and replaced.

FR:10.1The CKMS design shall specify the required environmental, fire, and physical
access control protection mechanisms and procedures for recovery from damage to the
primary and all backup facilities.
