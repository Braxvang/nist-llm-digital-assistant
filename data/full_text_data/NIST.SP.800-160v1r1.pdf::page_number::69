NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                           Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems

design characteristics
Design attributes or distinguishing features that pertain to a measurable description of a product or service. [24]

design margin
The margin allocated during design based on assessments of uncertainty and unknowns. This margin is often
consumed as the design matures. [17]

domain
A set of elements, data, resources, and functions that share a commonality in combinations of (1) roles supported,
(2) rules governing their use, and (3) protection needs. [24]
         Note: Security domains may reflect one or any combination of the following: capability, functional, or
         service distinctions; data flow and control flow associated with capability, functional, or service
         distinctions; data and information sensitivity; data and information security; or administrative,
         management, operational, or jurisdictional authority. Security domains that are defined in the context of
         one or more of these items reflect a protection-focused partitioning of the system that translates to
         relationships driven by trust concerns.

emergence
The behaviors and outcomes that result from how individual system elements compose to form the system as a
whole.
         Note: The behavior and outcomes produced by the system are not those of the individual system elements
         that comprise the system. Rather, the emergent system behavior and outcomes, or properties, result from
         the composition of multiple system elements.

enabling system
System that supports a system of interest during its life cycle stages but does not necessarily contribute directly to its
function during operation. [4]

engineered system
A system designed or adapted to interact with an anticipated operational environment to achieve one or more
intended purposes while complying with applicable constraints. [3]

engineering team
The individuals on the systems engineering team with security responsibilities, systems security engineers that are
part of the systems engineering team, or a combination thereof.

environment
Context determining the setting and circumstances of all influences upon a system. [71]

error
The difference between desired and actual performance or behavior of a system or system element.

event
Occurrence or change of a particular set of circumstances. [28]

evidence
Grounds for belief or disbelief; data on which to base proof or to establish truth or falsehood.
         Note 1: Evidence can be objective or subjective. Evidence is obtained through measurement, the results of
         analyses, experience, and the observation of behavior over time.
         Note 2: The security perspective places focus on credible evidence used to obtain assurance, substantiate
         trustworthiness, and assess risk.

facility
Physical means or equipment for facilitating the performance of an action (e.g., buildings, instruments, tools). [4]
