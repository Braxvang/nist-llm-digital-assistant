Compliant implementations process both “clear” and “opaque” signed messages. (“Opaque”
signed messages are encoded such that the recipient requires an S/MIME-enabled e-mail client to
automatically read the message.) Each implementation uses the Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol (LDAP) to obtain certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs) and checks that the
proper fields within each certificate match the sender’s name.

Compliant implementations must be able to encrypt messages for one or more recipients.


Optional Services

The profile identifies three optional cryptographic algorithm suites. These are desirable to
implement but not mandatory. These suites are:

       ALS3: {RSA [RFC 2313] for digital signature with SHA-1 hash algorithm [FIPS180-1],
       RSA [RFC 2313] for key transport, AES [FIPS197] for content encryption}

       ALS4: {DSA for digital signature [FIPS186-2] with SHA-1 hash algorithm [FIPS180-1],
       Diffie-Hellman [RFC2631] for key agreement, Triple-DES for content encryption
       [FIPS46-3].}

       ALS5: {DSA for digital signature [FIPS186-2] with SHA-256 hash algorithm [FIPS180-
       2], Diffie-Hellman [RFC2631] for key agreement, AES [FIPS197] for content
       encryption}
       Note: Newer versions of DSA are anticipated with support for key sizes greater than 1024
       bits. New standards for D-H and AES usage are anticipated to require the use of the
       SHA-256 hash algorithm. The SHA-256 algorithm is now available. [FIPS180-2]

Optional services in this profile include the ability to send and process e-mail with security labels
(as defined in the S/MIME V3 standards [RFC2634]). Another optional service is the ability to
securely bind sender’s certificates to their signatures through the signing certificate attribute (as
defined in [RFC2634]).

Mail list agent processing (also defined in [RFC2634]) is out-of-scope (i.e., will not be tested for
conformance) with respect to this protocol. However, S/MIME-enabled e-mail client software
MUST be able to properly process messages from secure mail list agents.
