information stored in flash memory. One challenge with these extraction methods is
the ability of a given tool to parse and decode the captured data. Providing the forensic
examiner with a logical view of the file system, and reporting on other data remnants
outside the file system that may be present are challenging. For example, all data
contained within a given flash memory chip may not be acquired, as many tools, such
as flasher boxes, may only be able to extract specific sections of memory [Bre07].
Methods used at this level require connectivity (e.g., cable or WiFi) between the
mobile device and the forensic workstation.

Hex Dumping – this technique is the more commonly used method by tools at this
level. This involves uploading a modified boot loader (or other software) into a
protected area of memory (e.g., RAM) on the device. This upload process is
accomplished by connecting the mobile device’s data port to a flasher box and the
flasher box is in turn connected to the forensic workstation. A series of commands is
sent from the flasher box to the mobile device to place it in a diagnostic mode. Once
in diagnostic mode, the flasher box captures all (or sections) of flash memory and
sends it to the forensic workstation over the same communications link used for the
upload. Some flasher boxes work this way or they may use a proprietary interface for
memory extractions. Rare cases exist where extractions can be accomplished using
WiFi (i.e., early Jonathan Zdziarski (JZ) Methods) [Zdz12].

JTAG – Many manufacturers support the JTAG standard, which defines a common
test interface for processor, memory, and other semiconductor chips. Forensic
examiners can communicate with a JTAG-compliant component by utilizing special
purpose standalone programmer devices to probe defined test points [Wil05]. The
JTAG testing unit can be used to request memory addresses from the JTAG-
compliant component and accept the response for storage and rendition [Bre06].
JTAG gives specialists another avenue for imaging devices that are locked or devices
that may have minor damage and cannot be properly interfaced otherwise. This
method involves attaching a cable (or wiring harness) from a workstation to the
mobile device’s JTAG interface and access memory via the device’s microprocessor
to produce an image [Bre07]. JTAG extractions differ mainly from Hex Dumping in
that it is invasive as access to the connections frequently require that the examiner
dismantle some (or most) of a mobile device to obtain access to establish the wiring
connections.

Flasher boxes are small devices originally designed with the intent to service or
upgrade mobile devices. Physical acquisitions frequently require the use of a flasher
box to facilitate the extraction of data from a mobile device. The flasher box aides the
examiner by communicating with the mobile device using diagnostic protocols to
communicate with the memory chip. This communication may utilize the mobile
device’s operating system or may bypass it altogether and communicate directly to the
chip [Jon10]. Flasher boxes are often accompanied by software to facilitate the data
extraction process working in conjunction with the hardware. Many flasher box
software packages provide the added functionality of recovering passwords from
mobile device memory as well in some configurations. Although acquisition methods
differ between flasher boxes, a general process is used [Bre07]. Limitations of the use
of flasher boxes include the following:
