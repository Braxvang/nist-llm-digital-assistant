 *
P n , may not be a complete block.

For each mode, the encryption process transforms every plaintext data block or segment into a
corresponding ciphertext data block or segment with the same bit length, so that the ciphertext is
a sequence of data blocks or segments. The ciphertext is denoted as follows: for the ECB and
                                                   #   #  #
CBC modes, C1, C2,…, Cn; for the CFB mode, C 1, C 2,…, C n; and, for the OFB and CTR modes,
                 *          *
C1, C2,…, Cn-1, C n, where C n may be a partial block.

The formatting of the plaintext, including in some cases the appending of padding bits to form
complete data blocks or data segments, is outside the scope of this recommendation. Padding is
discussed in Appendix A.

5.3   Initialization Vectors

The input to the encryption processes of the CBC, CFB, and OFB modes includes, in addition to
the plaintext, a data block called the initialization vector (IV), denoted IV. The IV is used in an
initial step in the encryption of a message and in the corresponding decryption of the message.

The IV need not be secret; however, for the CBC and CFB modes, the IV for any particular
execution of the encryption process must be unpredictable, and, for the OFB mode, unique IVs
must be used for each execution of the encryption process. The generation of IVs is discussed in
Appendix C.

5.4   Examples of Operations and Functions

The concatenation operation on bit strings is denoted | ; for example, 001 | 10111 = 00110111.

Given bit strings of equal length, the exclusive-OR operation, denoted ⊕, specifies the addition,
modulo 2, of the bits in each bit position, i.e., without carries. Thus, 10011 ⊕ 10101= 00110, for
example.

The functions LSBs and MSBs return the s least significant bits and the s most significant bits of
their arguments. For example, LSB3(111011010) = 010, and MSB4(111011010) = 1110.
                                                                                      m
Given a positive integer m and a non-negative (decimal) integer x that is less than 2 , the binary
representation of x in m bits is denoted [x]m. For example, [45]8 = 00101101.
