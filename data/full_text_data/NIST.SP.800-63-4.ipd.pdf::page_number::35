      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                                  Digital Identity Guidelines

922   5.    Digital Identity Risk Management
923   This section is normative.
924   This section provides details on the methodology for assessing digital identity risks for
925   each xAL. This process augments the risk management processes for information and
926   information system risk under NIST guidance for implementing Federal Information
927   Security Modernization Act [FISMA] requirements.
928   There are 4 steps to the digital identity risk management process:
929        1. Conduct Initial Impact Assessment: In this step, organizations evaluate their user
930           population and assess the impact of a failure of each function in the identity system
931           (i.e., proofing, authentication, and federation) for their protected application or
932           service against a defined set of impact categories. The outcome of this step is a
933           documented set of impact categories and associated impact levels.
934        2. Select Initial Assurance Levels: In this step, the impact categories and impact
935           levels are evaluated to determine the appropriate assurance levels to protect the
936           application. The outcome of this step is an identified initial level for each applicable
937           xAL.
938        3. Tailor and Document Assurance Level Determinations: In this step, detailed
939           privacy, equity, usability, and threat assessments are conducted to determine
940           the potential impact of the initially selected assurance level on the specific user
941           population and threat environment of the application. The initial assurance level
942           is tailored, compensating or supplemental controls are identified, and all decisions
943           are documented. The outcome is a Digital Identity Acceptance Statement (see
944           Sec. 5.3.4) with a defined implementable assurance level.
945        4. Continuously Evaluate & Improve: In this step, information is collected on
946           performance of the identity system across a diverse set of factors based on
947           organization needs and evolving threat vectors. This information is used to
948           determine if the selected assurance level and controls are meeting mission, business,
949           and security needs and to monitor for unintended harms that may have emerged.
950           The outcomes of this step are performance metrics, documented and transparent
951           processes for evaluation and redress, and ongoing improvements to the identity
952           system as needed.
953   While presented as a “stepwise” approach, there can be many points in the process that
954   require divergence from the sequential order, including the need for iterative cycles
955   between initial task execution and revisiting tasks. For example, the introduction of new
956   regulations or requirements while an assessment is ongoing may require organizations to
957   revisit a step in the process. Additionally new functionality, changes in data usage, and
958   changes to the threat environment may at any point require an organization to revisit steps
959   in the digital identity risk management process.
