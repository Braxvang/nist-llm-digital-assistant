           INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING MATRIX                              — Cell 3.2F
     Training Area: System Life Cycle Security           — Development
     Functional Specialty: Use

     Definition   —       The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an IT system
                          from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                          model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                          Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                          ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                          needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                          The development phase is the series of steps followed to ensure that
                          security requirements are considered, resolved, and incorporated as
                          information systems and technologies are developed or changed.

     Behavioral Outcome       —   Potential users are able to provide input to system development
                                  efforts to ensure that IT security safeguards are as transparent to the
                                  user as feasible and are balanced with ease of use.
