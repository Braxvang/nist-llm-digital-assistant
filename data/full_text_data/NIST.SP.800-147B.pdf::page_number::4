The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical leadership for the Nation’s
measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test methods, reference data, proof of
concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the development and productive use of
information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the development of management, administrative,
technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of other than
national security-related information in Federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series
reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its
collaborative activities with industry, government, and academic organizations.

Modern computers rely on fundamental system firmware, commonly known as the Basic Input/Output
System (BIOS), to facilitate the hardware initialization process and transition control to the hypervisor or
operating system. Unauthorized modification of BIOS firmware by malicious software constitutes a
significant threat because of the BIOS’s unique and privileged position within the PC architecture. The
guidelines in this document include requirements on servers to mitigate the execution of malicious or
corrupt BIOS code. They apply to BIOS firmware stored in the BIOS flash, including the BIOS code, the
cryptographic keys that are part of the Root of Trust for Update, and static BIOS data. This guide is
intended to provide server platform vendors with recommendations and guidelines for a secure BIOS
update process.
