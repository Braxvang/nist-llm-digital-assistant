Similarly, secure web servers have TLS server certificates, with certain specific
characteristics; note that, although federal users are required to use TLS rather than SSL,
the certificates are identical. The Subject Name in these certificates follows specific rules
so that the domain name of the server is included in the Subject Name field of the
certificate. Commercial CAs sell TLS certificates, and, where it is important to reach a
general population of non-government users, it may be desirable to get a TLS certificate
from a CA that has its root certificate widely distributed “out of the box” in the certificate
stores of Microsoft Windows, Macintosh OS X, and the various Mozilla browsers. This
will allow most users to verify the server certificate. However, it is important to review
the certificate policy and choices that may be available from the CAs selling TLS
certificates for use on federal agency web servers in order to ensure that the certificates
meet the requirements stated herein and in [SP 800-57 Part 1].
