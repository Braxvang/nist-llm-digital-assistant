Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the legislative service support
information. Legislative functions processes are usually tolerant of delays.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Excessive recovery delays can result in
damage to agency reputation and to interests associated with specific legislation. This can result
in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
legislative functions information is low.
C.2.8.3 Executive Functions Information Type

Subject to exception conditions described below, the recommended provisional security
categorization for the executive information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level associated with the executive information type is associated with
executive functions. The effects of loss of confidentiality of policies and guidance during the
formative stage can result in attempts by affected entities and other interested parties to influence
and/or impede the policy and guidance development process. Premature public release of
formative policies and guidance before internal coordination and review can result in
unnecessary damage to public confidence in the executive office. These consequences may
occur when the release includes unedited internal commentary and discussion.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for executive functions information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications that
contain executive information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect public
confidence in the government.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
executive information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the executive information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
executive functions information is low.
