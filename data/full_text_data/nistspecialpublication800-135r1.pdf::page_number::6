This Recommendation has been prepared for use by federal agencies. It may be used
by non-governmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to
copyright. (Attribution would be appreciated by NIST.)
Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made
mandatory and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under
statutory authority. Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or
superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the
OMB, or any other federal official.
Conformance testing for implementations of this Recommendation will be conducted
within the framework of the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) and
the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP). The requirements of this
Recommendation are indicated by the word “shall.” Some of these requirements may
be out-of-scope for CMVP or CAVP validation testing, and thus are the responsibility
of entities using, implementing, installing or configuring applications that incorporate
this Recommendation.

3.1    Terms and Definitions


Algorithm                 A clearly specified mathematical process for computation; a
                          set of rules that, if followed, will give a prescribed result.
Approved                  FIPS-approved and/or NIST-recommended. An algorithm
                          or technique that is either 1) specified in a FIPS or NIST
                          Recommendation, 2) adopted in a FIPS or NIST
                          Recommendation or 3) specified in a list of NIST-approved
                          security functions.
Approved hash             Cryptographic hash algorithms specified in FIPS 180-3
algorithms                [FIPS 180-3].
Block cipher              A family of functions and their inverse functions that is
                          parameterized by cryptographic keys; the functions map bit
                          strings of a fixed length to bit strings of the same length.
Cryptographic key         A parameter used in conjunction with a cryptographic
(key)                     algorithm that determines the algorithm’s operation in such
                          a way that an entity with knowledge of the key can
                          reproduce or reverse the operation, while an entity without
                          knowledge of the key cannot. Examples include:

                          1. The transformation of plaintext data into ciphertext data,
                          2. The transformation of ciphertext data into plaintext data,
