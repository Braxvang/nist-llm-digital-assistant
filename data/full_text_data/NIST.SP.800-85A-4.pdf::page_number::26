NIST SP 800-85A-4                                            PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                      INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

7.    Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria are based on the compliance of the item under the test with the
requirements defined in FIPS 201 and the accompanying special publication documents. The
criteria are further specified in the following sections, based on the type of test being
conducted.
7.1   Acceptance Criteria for the PIV Middleware Test

The PIV Middleware test acceptance criteria will be based on the middleware application
under the test passing the SP 800-73-4 client API test assertions. The middleware should
return appropriate return codes in response to executing the client API functions as defined in
Section 3, Part 3 of SP 800-73-4. The middleware should also be able to send the correct card
commands to and interpret the responses received from the “SP 800-73-4 conformant PIV
Card Application” (refer to Section 7.2 for definition). The test assertions detail the pass/fail
criteria defined for each test case that is designed to test a certain condition being tested.
PIV Middleware that supports the SP 800-73-4 client API with SM will be required to test
against both the SP 800-73-4 client API test assertions and the SP 800-73-4 client API with
SM test assertions. All SP 800-73-4 client API with SM test assertions are to be conducted
over a contactless interface.
7.2   Acceptance Criteria for the PIV Card Application Tests

Acceptance criteria for the PIV Card Application tests are based on the PIV Card Application
passing the following two classes of tests: PIV Card Application card command interface
tests and PIV data objects accessibility and storage tests. The PIV Card Application that has
passed these classes of tests is called an “SP 800-73-4 conformant PIV Card Application.”
For PIV Card Application card command tests, the PIV Card Application should send the
appropriate response status codes and application data in response to commands. It should
also set or reset certain card state variables and thus fulfill the test postconditions.
For the PIV data objects accessibility and storage tests, the PIV Card Application should
show the presence of all mandatory PIV data objects and published optional PIV data
objects. It should also demonstrate the ability to access and store all the above data objects
using the correct BER-TLV tag under the appropriate security conditions and interfaces
(contact, contactless, secure messaging, or VCI) and that the containers for storing them
satisfy the specified minimum size requirements.
The acceptance criteria for the testing of PIV Card functionalities, for which FIPS 201 makes
reference to external documents (such as digital signature formats), is based on visual
verification of vendor-provided documents and test/compliance certificates.
