this takes place, however, the portal is not required to access resources because the client machine has
direct access to these resources via the network extension. An organization’s access control policy could
determine the hyperlinks or icons that are displayed in the portal. For example, if the access control
policy prohibits a user from using network extension, then the hyperlink or icon enabling network
extension should not be displayed. Figure 4-6 depicts an example of a generic SSL VPN portal interface.

4.3.5    Cryptography Policy and FIPS Compliance

The organization should choose a cryptography policy that fits its needs and is compliant with its
requirements. In addition, Federal agencies must use only cryptographic modules whose algorithms and
methods are compliant with the FIPS 140-2 specification. This topic is discussed in detail in Section 4.2.

4.3.6    Other Design Decisions

In addition to what has already been discussed in this section, there are other possible design
considerations. The following items describe issues not addressed earlier:

 IPv6. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has mandated that all Federal government
  agencies must migrate their network backbones to support Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) by June
  2008. 17 If the organization is planning a migration to IPv6 in the near future for compliance with this
  mandate or for any other reason, it should deploy an SSL VPN solution that is compliant with IPv6.
  There is currently no official definition of “IPv6 compliance” from a Federal government
17
     The OMB issued a memo titled Transition Planning for Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) on August 2, 2005 that lays out a
     transition process for federal government agencies to IPv6. The memo is available at
     http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy2005/m05-22.pdf.
