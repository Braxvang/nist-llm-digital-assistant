                                              TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



Assessors should be proactive in their communication with the appropriate parties in the organization.
This communication can be maintained through periodic status meetings and daily or weekly reports.
Meeting attendees and report recipients should be identified in the assessment plan or ROE, and may
include the assessors, ISSO, CISO, and CIO. The frequency of status meetings and reports will be driven
by the assessment’s length and complexity. For example, for a one-month penetration test, status
meetings may be held weekly with daily reports provided during the active testing phase (i.e., the period
during which systems are being exploited). Meetings and reports should address activities completed to
date, success rate, problems encountered, and critical findings/recommended remediation.

7.2     Assessing

As discussed in Section 6, the assessment plan or ROE provides guidelines for conducting the assessment.
The plan or ROE should be followed unless specific permission to deviate has been obtained, normally in
writing, from the original signatory or individual in command. It is critical that all assessors read and
understand the plan or ROE. It is recommended that assessors periodically review the plan or ROE
during the assessment—particularly in the case of activities in the target vulnerability validation category.

During an assessment, the organization’s incident response team may detect an incident. This could be
caused by the assessors’ actions—or by a real adversary that happens to perform an attack while the
assessment is in progress. Regardless, the incident response team or individual discovering the incident
should follow the organization’s normal escalation procedures, and assessors should follow the guidelines
set forth by the assessment plan or ROE unless instructed otherwise. If the presence of an adversary is
found during the assessment, it should immediately be reported to the appropriate individual and
assessors should follow the protocol identified in the assessment plan or ROE. It is recommended that
assessors stop assessing the systems involved in the incident while the organization carries out its
response.

In addition to encountering new incidents or uncovering existing ones, assessors may face other technical,
operational, and political challenges during an assessment. These can include:

       Resistance. Resistance to assessments can come from many sources within an organization,
        including system and network administrators and end users. Reasons may include fear of losing
        system or network availability, fear of being reprimanded, inconvenience, and resistance to
        change. Obtaining upper management approval and support will help resolve problems related to
        resistance, and incorporating security assessments into the organization’s overall security policy
        will help establish a process that does not surprise administrators and users.
       Lack of Realism. In preparing for an assessment, users and administrators sometimes modify
        settings to make their systems more secure, resistant to attack, or more compliant with policies
        and other requirements. While this can be viewed as positive, changes made under these
        circumstances are generally only maintained for the duration of the assessment, after which the
        systems are returned to their previous configurations. Providing no advance notice of
        assessments to users and administrators helps to address this challenge. Many organizations
        perform occasional unannounced assessments to supplement their announced assessments.
       Immediate Mitigation. As security weaknesses are identified during an assessment,
        administrators may want to take immediate steps to mitigate them and expect assessors to quickly
        re-assess the system to confirm that the problems have been resolved. Although this desire for
        quick mitigation is admirable, assessors should communicate the importance of following the
        organization’s change management policies and procedures.
