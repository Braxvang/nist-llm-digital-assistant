                                                                          GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



immediately after the installation process concludes. Securing the Web server application would
generally include the following steps:

 Patch and upgrade the Web server application

 Remove or disable unnecessary services, applications, and sample content

 Configure Web server user authentication and access controls

 Configure Web server resource controls

 Test the security of the Web server application and Web content.

Organizations should take steps to ensure that only appropriate content is published on a Web site.

Many agencies lack a Web publishing process or policy that determines what type of information to
publish openly, what information to publish with restricted access, and what information should not be
published to any publicly accessible repository. This is unfortunate because Web sites are often one of
the first places that malicious entities search for valuable information. Some generally accepted examples
of what should not be published or at least should be carefully examined and reviewed before publication
on a public Web site include—

 Classified or proprietary information

 Information on the composition or preparation of hazardous materials or toxins 2

 Sensitive information relating to homeland security

 Medical records

 An organization’s detailed physical and information security safeguards

 Details about an organization’s network and information system infrastructure (e.g., address ranges,
  naming conventions, access numbers)

 Information that specifies or implies physical security vulnerabilities

 Detailed plans, maps, diagrams, aerial photographs, and architectural drawings of organizational
  buildings, properties, or installations

 Any sensitive information about individuals, such as personally identifiable information (PII), that
  might be subject to either Federal, state or, in some instances, international privacy laws. 3

Organizations should ensure appropriate steps are taken to protect Web content from
unauthorized access or modification.
