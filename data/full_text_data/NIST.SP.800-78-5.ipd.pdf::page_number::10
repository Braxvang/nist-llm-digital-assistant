      NIST SP 800-78-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                 Cryptographic Algorithms
      September 2023                                                                 and Key Sizes for PIV

209       •   Section 2, Applicationof Cryptography in FIPS 201-3, identifies the cryptographic
210           mechanisms and objects that employ cryptography as specified in FIPS 201-3 and its
211           supporting documents.
212       •   Section 3, On-Card Cryptographic Requirements   , describes the cryptographic
213           requirements for cryptographic keys and authentication information stored on the PIV
214           Card.
215       •   Section 4, Certificate Status Information
                                                      , describes the cryptographic requirements for
216           status information generated by PKI certification authorities (CA) and Online Certificate
217           Status Protocol (OCSP) responders.
218       •   Section 5, PIV Card Application Administration Keys, describes the cryptographic
219           requirements for managing information stored on the PIV Card.
220       •   Section 6, Identifiers for PIV Card Interfaces , specifies key reference values and
221           algorithm identifiers for the application programming interface and card commands
222           defined in [SP800-73].
223       •   Section 7, Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Testing Requirements   , specifies the
224           cryptographic algorithm validation testing that must be performed on the PIV Card based
225           on the keys and algorithms that it supports.
226       •   The Referencessection contains the list of documents used as references in this
227           document.
228       •   Appendix A, Acronyms, contains the list of acronyms used in this document.
229       •   Appendix B, Change Log
                                   , describes the changes made to NIST SP 800-78 since its initial
230           release.
