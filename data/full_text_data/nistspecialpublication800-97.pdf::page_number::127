                                    ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



9.1.3   Phase 3: Implementation

When the APs arrived, the IT group was just completing its PKI rollout. Each of the APs was similarly
configured with the following:

     A common SSID to support roaming across the enterprise
     IEEE 802.1X pass-through, enabling the ASs to perform authentication transactions
     Disabling WEP and TKIP to prevent connections using a data confidentiality and integrity
      protocol other than CCMP
     IPsec tunnels with each AS to protect authentication and key distribution traffic on the wired
      network
     Forwarding of AP-generated security events to the enterprise audit server for analysis and real-
      time intrusion detection.
Each client computer (or STA) was updated with new configuration settings using a combination of logon
scripts and enterprise management software. The configuration was relatively complex, requiring that the
STA specify the following:

     The SSID of the agency’s enterprise WLAN
     The use of IEEE 802.1X port-based access control
     EAP-TLS as the authentication method
     The names of each AS that could perform the authentication transaction
     The CA certificate used to verify the AS certificate’s digital signature
     The client certificate used to authenticate the STA to the AS.
The secure configuration is invoked for the SSID of the enterprise WLAN only. Each user can still
configure additional SSIDs for connections to hotspots at hotels, conferences, and elsewhere. Personal
firewall software on each laptop ensures that other hotspot users cannot gain unauthorized access. The
laptop also automatically launches VPN client software for remote connections to the enterprise network,
which may be occurring over insecure wireless links.

Finally, technicians configured each domain controller to serve as an AS by doing the following:

     Ensuring that the server was hardened against possible attack, which included installing all
      current patches as required by vulnerability management policy, and reviewing the system’s
      configuration against the organization’s security policies and server security configuration
      baseline
     Establishing IPsec connections with each AP to protect authentication and key distribution traffic
      on the wired network
     Forcing use of EAP-TLS to support WLAN authentication.
Before users were allowed to use the WLAN, they were required to complete a 20-minute, Web-based
WLAN security awareness course. The course covered important aspects of the WLAN use policy,
including not letting people other than employees and full-time on-site contractors use the WLAN, and
