      High-dimensional data [10] can be used to single out data records and, thus, consti-
          tute a unique pattern that could be identifying if the values exist in a secondary
          source to link against.32
   3. Determine the direct identifers in the dataset. An expert determines the elements in
      the dataset that only serve to identify the data subjects.
   4. Mask (transform) direct identifers. The direct identifers are either removed or re-
      placed with pseudonyms. Options for performing this operation are discussed in
      Sec. 4.3.1.
   5. Perform threat modeling. The organization determines the additional information
      they might be able to use for re-identifcation, including both quasi-identifers and
      non-identifying values that a data intruder might use for re-identifcation.
   6. Determine minimal acceptable data accuracy. The organization determines what uses
      can or will be made with the de-identifed data.
   7. Determine the transformation process that will be used to manipulate the quasi-
      identifers. Pay special attention to the data felds that contain dates and geographical
      information, removing or recoding as necessary.
   8. Import (sample) data from the source dataset. Because the effort to acquire data
      from the source (identifed) dataset may be substantial, some researchers recommend
      conducting a test data import run to assist in planning [58].
   9. Review the results of the trial de-identifcation. Correct any coding or algorithmic
      errors that are detected.
 10. Transform the quasi-identifers for the entire dataset.
 11. Evaluate the actual re-identifcation risk, which is calculated. As part of this evalua-
     tion, every aspect of the released dataset should be considered in light of the question,
     “Can this information be used to identify someone?”
 12. Compare the actual re-identifcation risk with the threshold specifed by the policy-
     makers.
 13. If the data do not pass the actual risk threshold, adjust the procedure and repeat Steps
     11 and 12. For example, additional transformations may be required. Alternatively,
     it may be necessary to remove outliers. Removing data will of course impact data
     quality, but it will also protect the privacy of the individuals whose data have been
     removed.


32 For example, Narayanan and Shmatikov demonstrated that the set of movies that a person had watched

 could be used as an identifer given the existence of a second dataset of movies that had been publicly
 rated [109].
