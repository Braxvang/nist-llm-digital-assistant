GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



In many RFID systems, the tags and readers are supported by an enterprise system that is composed of
middleware, analytic systems, and networking services. The middleware filters data, aggregates data, and
manages readers and other RFID devices. Analytic systems process and store this information to support
business processes. Lastly, the networking services are used to provide the connections among the
components of enterprise subsystem and between the enterprise subsystem and the RF subsystem.

RFID systems that share information across organizational boundaries, such as supply chain applications,
also have an inter-enterprise subsystem. The RF, enterprise, and inter-enterprise subsystems together
allow an RFID system to support business processes. The versatile components of these subsystems
allow an RFID system to be tailored to the needs of a particular application. If an inter-enterprise
subsystem is constructed to EPCglobal specifications, then it will have a local ONS and an EPCIS, and
may utilize the EPCglobal Root ONS and Discovery Services. The Root ONS provides an authoritative
lookup for an EPC identifier that returns pointers to the resources from the organization that created that
identifier. Finally, EPCglobal Discovery Services are envisioned to serve as a type of search engine for
an EPC identifier that can return pointers to multiple organizations that have information related to that
EPC identifier (e.g., companies in the supply chain that have completed a transaction with a particular tag
and registered information related to its EPC in their EPCIS).
