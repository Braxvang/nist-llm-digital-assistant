Q. How are the different metrics selected?
Q. Can a weighting scale be used during the selection process for metrics?
Q. Are there any specific characteristics that should be defined in each metric?

Q. How can an organization benefit from metrics?
A. Metrics bring multiple benefits to organizations, including:
   • Improving accountability for security;
   • Enabling management to pinpoint specific technical, operational, or
     management controls that are not being implemented or are being
     implemented incorrectly;
   • Justifying investment requests using quantitative vs. qualitative data;
   • Targeting investments specifically to the areas in need of improvement to
     maximize investment value; and
   • Determining the effectiveness of implemented information security processes,
     procedures, and controls by relating results of information security activities
     (e.g., incident data, revenue lost to cyber attacks) to the respective
     requirements and to information security investments.

Q. What are the interdependent components of the security metrics
   program?
A. The interdependent components of the security metrics program are:
   1. Strong upper-level management support, which establishes a focus on
      security within the highest levels of the organization;
   2. Practical security policies and procedures backed by the authority necessary
      to enforce compliance. Practical security policies and procedures are defined
      as those that are attainable and provide meaningful security through
      appropriate controls. Metrics are not easily obtainable if there are no
      procedures in place;
   3. Quantifiable performance metrics that are designed to capture and provide
      meaningful performance data. To provide meaningful data, quantifiable
      security metrics must be based on information security performance goals
      and objectives, and be easily obtainable and feasible to measure. They must
      also be repeatable, provide relevant performance trends over time, and be
      useful for tracking performance and directing resources; and
   4. Consistent, periodic analysis of the metrics data to apply lessons learned,
      improve the effectiveness of existing security controls, and plan future
      controls to meet new security requirements as they occur. Accurate data
