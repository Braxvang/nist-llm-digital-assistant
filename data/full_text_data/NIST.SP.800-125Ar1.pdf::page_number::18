NIST SP 800-125A REV. 1                                                   SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
                                                                      SERVER-BASED HYPERVISOR PLATFORMS

•   The hypervisor offering must be able to utilize the MLE feature. In other words, the hypervisor should be
    able to invoke the secure launch process, which is usually done by integrating a pre-kernel module into
    the hypervisor’s code base since the kernel is the first module installed in a hypervisor boot up. The
    purpose of this pre-kernel module is to ensure the selection of the right authenticated module in the
    hardware that performs an orderly evaluation or measurement of the launch components of the hypervisor
    or any software launched on that hardware. The Tboot is an example of a mechanism that enables the
    hypervisor to take advantage of the MLE feature of the hardware.
•   All hypervisor components that are intended to be part of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) must be
    included within the scope of the MLE-enabling mechanism so that they are measured as part of their
    launch process.

The MLE feature with storage and reporting mechanisms on the hardware of the virtualized host can be
leveraged to provide boot integrity assurance for hypervisor components by measuring the identity of all
entities in the boot sequence, starting with firmware, BIOS, hypervisor and hypervisor modules; comparing
them to “known good values;” and reporting any discrepancies. If the measured boot process is to be extended
to cover VMs and its contents (guest OS and applications), a software-based extension to the hardware-based
MLE implementation within the hypervisor kernel is required. The security recommendation for ensuring a
secure boot process for all components of a hypervisor platform can now be stated as follows:

Security Recommendation HY-SR-1: The hypervisor that is launched should be part of a platform
and an overall infrastructure that contains: (a) hardware that supports an MLE with standards-based
cryptographic measurement capabilities and storage devices and (b) an attestation process with the
capability to provide a chain of trust starting from the hardware to all hypervisor components.
Moreover, the measured elements should include, at minimum, the core kernel, kernel support modules,
device drivers, and the hypervisor’s native management applications for VM Lifecycle Management
and Management of Hypervisor. The chain of trust should provide assurance that all measured
components have not been tampered with and that their versions are correct (i.e., overall boot integrity).
If the chain of trust is to be extended to guest VMs, the hypervisor should provide a virtual interface to
the hardware-based MLE.
