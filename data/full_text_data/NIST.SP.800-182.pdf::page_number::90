      The group is recognized for outstanding technical accomplishments in the development of the first
      efficient tool for generating high-strength software testing plans, resulting in cost savings and more
      reliable products. The team has developed software tools that use a novel combinatorial testing meth-
      odology. This methodology enables software developers to generate the smallest number of test cases
      needed to identify the most critical and elusive software bugs, those caused by interactions among input
      parameters. The team has made their tool, Automated Combinatorial Testing of Software (ACTS), widely
      available, and it is now used by major software companies and many government agencies.
