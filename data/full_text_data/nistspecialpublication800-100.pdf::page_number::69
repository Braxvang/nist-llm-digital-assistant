CHAPTER 7                                                                   Performance Measures


    Fiscal constraints and market conditions compel government and industry to
operate on reduced budgets. In such an environment, it is difficult to justify broad
investments in the information security infrastructure. Historically, arguments for
investing in specific areas of information security lack detail and specificity and fail to
adequately mitigate specific system risk. Information security metrics can facilitate
the capital planning and investment control (CPIC) process by providing quantifiable
information for business case development. 46 Information security metrics can also
assist with determining the effectiveness of implemented information security
processes, procedures, and controls by relating results of information security
activities (e.g., incident data, revenue lost to cyber attacks) to the respective
requirements and to information security investments.
    Departments and agencies can also demonstrate compliance with applicable laws,
such as FISMA, rules, and regulations by implementing and maintaining an
information security metrics program as described in this handbook. Information
security metrics will assist in satisfying the annual FISMA reporting requirement by
providing an infrastructure for organized data collection, analysis, and reporting.
Information security metrics can also be used as input into the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) and Inspector General (IG) audits.

7.1 Metric Types
   Metrics are tools that support decision making. Like experience, external
mandates, and strategies, metrics are one element of a manager’s toolkit for making
and substantiating decisions. Metrics are used to answer three basic questions:
       •   “Am I implementing the tasks for which I am responsible?” Consider the
           example of a program manager with responsibility for 250 information
           systems. Among other things, that manager is responsible for the security
           certification and accreditation of those systems. A commonly used
           implementation metric for security certification and accreditation is the
           percentage of systems accredited.
       •   “How efficiently or effectively am I accomplishing those tasks?” Such metrics
           often answer more complex questions after an activity is fully implemented.
           For example, federal law requires that security certification and accreditation
           take place following a major system change. One might measure the
           efficiency of a security certification and accreditation program by determining
           the time lag between each major system change and that system’s renewed
           accreditation. Or one might measure the effectiveness of a security
           certification and accreditation program by determining the number of
           accredited systems whose certification process included the creation of a
           system security plan.
       •   “What impact are those tasks having on the mission?” Activities are initially
           selected with the belief that they will contribute to the mission. After an
           activity is shown to be fully implemented, managers must validate that the
           activity is delivering the expected benefit. These metrics are the most difficult
           to generate. A security certification and accreditation process may prove to
           have an impact by showing that fewer interruptions or losses of data due to
           security incidents are experienced among correctly accredited systems than
           among incorrectly accredited or nonaccredited systems.
