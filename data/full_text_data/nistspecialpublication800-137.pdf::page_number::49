Special Publication 800-137                     Information Security Continuous Monitoring for
                                                Federal Information Systems and Organizations




 Common Control               A security control that is inherited by one or more organizational
 [CNSSI 4009]                 information systems. See Security Control Inheritance.

 Common Control Provider      An organizational official responsible for the development,
 [NISTIR 7298]                implementation, assessment, and monitoring of common controls
                              (i.e., security controls inherited by information systems).

 Compensating Security        The management, operational, and technical controls (i.e.,
 Controls                     safeguards or countermeasures) employed by an organization in
 [NISTIR 7298]                lieu of the recommended controls in the low, moderate, or high
                              baselines described in NIST Special Publication 800-53, that
                              provide equivalent or comparable protection for an information
                              system.

 Comprehensive Testing        A test methodology that assumes explicit and substantial
 [NISTIR 7298]                knowledge of the internal structure and implementation detail of
                              the assessment object. Also known as white box testing.

 Computer Incident            Group of individuals usually consisting of Security Analysts
 Response Team (CIRT)         organized to develop, recommend, and coordinate immediate
 [CNSSI 4009]                 mitigation actions for containment, eradication, and recovery
                              resulting from computer security incidents. Also called a
                              Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) or a CIRC
                              (Computer Incident Response Center, Computer Incident
                              Response Capability, or Cyber Incident Response Team).

 Confidentiality              Preserving authorized restrictions on information access and
 [44 U.S.C., Sec. 3542]       disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and
                              proprietary information.

 Configuration Control (or    Process for controlling modifications to hardware, firmware,
 Configuration                software, and documentation to protect the information system
 Management)                  against improper modifications before, during, and after system
 [CNSSI 4009]                 implementation.

 Continuous Monitoring        Maintaining ongoing awareness to support organizational risk
                              decisions.
                              See Information Security Continuous Monitoring, Risk
                              Monitoring, and Status Monitoring.

 Controlled Interface         A boundary with a set of mechanisms that enforces the security
 [CNSSI 4009]                 policies and controls the flow of information between
                              interconnected information systems.

 Countermeasures              Actions, devices, procedures, techniques, or other measures that
 [CNSSI 4009]                 reduce the vulnerability of an information system. Synonymous
                              with security controls and safeguards.
