                                                                                                GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



method used, computer type and location, user identification, and other characteristics. The SSL VPN
uses an access control policy to provide different services based on these characteristics.

Table 3-1 provides examples of typical access control policies. Access privileges may be granted to
individuals, groups, or resources. For ease of configuration, access control is typically configured based
on groups. Each user is assigned to one or more groups, each group having certain security parameters.
Group information may be accessed from the authentication database, such as the LDAP directory.
Access control may also be defined for a set of resources instead of an individual resource. This makes
adding and removing resources to and from a group transparent to the users and reduces policy
complexity. In some specific instances, user-level parameters are also set.

                                     Table 3-1. Access Control Examples

        Method                                               Example
     Per-user         The CEO may access all intranet servers, email, and the executive folder of the
                      administrative server.
     Per-group        Sales staff may access email, the organization’s intranet, and the sales server.
     Per-resource     All users and groups may access the Community Relations server.



Access control can also be integrated with endpoint security controls. SSL VPNs can use host integrity
checking to check the status of the SSL VPN client before access is granted. Some SSL VPNs have the
capability to perform this checking either before or after authentication to determine the appropriate
access controls. Access control in this sense may be as simple as allowing or denying access completely,
or more elaborate such as providing restricted access to selected information based on host integrity
checks. Access controls may also be configured per-user, per-group, and per-resource in terms of host
integrity checking. It is beneficial to have the ability to bypass the endpoint security restrictions for
certain circumstances such as disaster response. Bypassing endpoint security for special circumstances
may be accomplished through a special access control policy setting or whitelist.

Table 3-2 shows some examples of access control policies in conjunction with endpoint security controls.
These examples are an extension of the examples in Table 3-1. The first user is the CEO, who is
accessing the SSL VPN from home via an organization-issued laptop. The firewall and antivirus software
pass the security checks since they are enabled and up-to-date. Based on user and group access policies,
and the passing of the endpoint security checks, the CEO may access the intranet servers, email, the
executive folder of the administrative server, and the Community Relations server. The next user is John
Smith, who is a traveling member of the sales team. He is attempting to access the SSL VPN from a
public computer in an Internet café. The firewall passes the security checks, but the antivirus software is
not up-to-date on its signatures. Based on user and group access policies and the fact that only some of
the security checks passed, John is granted access to email and the ability to download (but not upload)
files from the sales server (he would have been given more privileges if he had passed all the security
checks). He may also access the Community Relations server. The last user is Sally Jones, who is an
employee at a business partner, XYZ Corp. She is attempting to access the SSL VPN from a trusted
partner network. Based on user and group access policies, and the passing of the endpoint security
checks, Sally is granted access to the extranet partner server and the Community Relations server.
