                                                            CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



Such systems inherit “pedigree” as a byproduct of the regulations under which they are controlled,
developed, and tested. Because of the current lack of ability to assess “pedigree” of one of these systems
within a cloud (due to many distinct subcomponents that comprise or support the cloud), employing cloud
technologies as the host for this class of applications is not recommended. However this does not suggest
that for the development of safety-critical systems, cloud technologies should not be considered in
supporting roles (e.g., employing a cloud to run a simulation of a safety-critical system under
development).

More information on high-impact systems can be found in NIST FIPS 199.

8.3     Economic Goals

In public and outsourced scenarios, cloud computing offers an opportunity for consumers to use
computing resources with small or modest up-front costs; furthermore, cloud computing promotes
business agility by reducing the costs of pilot efforts, and may reduce costs to consumers through
economies of scale. Although the benefits can be substantial, a number of economic risks must be
considered as well.

8.3.1    Risk of Business Continuity

With on premises systems, consumers can continue to use products, even when the vendors have
suspended support or have gone out of business. However for public or outsourced cloud computing,
consumers depend on near real-time provisioning of services by providers. Since business shutdown is
normal in any marketplace, this dependence is a risk to consumers with time-critical computing needs.
Various approaches may be used to mitigate this risk, e.g., by employing redundant clouds, by monitoring
the business health of providers, or by employing hybrid clouds.

8.3.2    Service Agreement Evaluation

As presented in Section 3, service agreements may define terms such as availability and security in
specific and limited ways. Additionally, service agreements often place differing responsibilities on
consumers to track changes in service agreements and to determine when to reevaluate service
agreements.

Consumers need practical techniques to evaluate and compare service agreements. Currently, service
agreements are human-generated and human-consumed. The commonality observed in current service
agreement offerings, however, suggests that a basis exists for partial standardization of service agreement
terminology. An open issue is how to design a service agreement template that would practically embody
common service agreement terms. The specification of such templates could allow service agreements to
be partially evaluated mechanically, thus reducing costs to consumers and increasing understanding into
actual cloud service offerings.

Expressing service agreements in a machine-readable format using common ontologies might be a
productive step in supporting automated evaluation of terms and conditions. A template defining common
elements could support a query interface allowing potential consumers to quickly check and compare
important components before investing the effort of manual evaluation of detailed terms and conditions.
This then would support a more efficient cloud marketplace. The template could include standardized
performance metrics that would allow consumers to compare service offerings in an objective manner.
