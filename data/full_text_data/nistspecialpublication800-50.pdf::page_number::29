Figure 3-5 illustrates overarching agency-specific issues that must be understood at the start of the needs
assessment. The techniques shown in Figure 3-4 should provide information that offers insight into, and
understanding of, these issues. These issues should feed necessary information into the needs assessment
process. Understanding them will help shape the strategy and design of the IT security awareness and
training program.11




                            Figure 3-5: Understanding Overarching Agency-Specific Issues

Analysis of the information gathered should provide answers to key questions, shown in Figure 3-6.



          What awareness, training, and/or education are needed (i.e., what is required)?
          What is currently being done to meet these needs?
          What is the current status regarding how these needs are being addressed (i.e., how well
           are current efforts working)?
          Where are the gaps between the needs and what is being done (i.e., what more needs to be
           done)?
          Which needs are most critical?

                   Figure 3-6: Key Questions to be Answered in Performing a Needs Assessment



Figure 3-7 shows the relationship between awareness and training requirements and an organization’s
current efforts. The shaded area represents the additional IT security awareness and/or training efforts
11
     Another issue that should be addressed during a needs assessment is the roles that have been identified as having significant
     security responsibilities. Existing roles that have been so identified should be reviewed to ensure that they still have
     significant security responsibilities. Other roles that previously have had little or no security responsibilities should also be
     reviewed. Organizational and technological changes in the organization may impact roles and the security responsibilities
     they carry.
