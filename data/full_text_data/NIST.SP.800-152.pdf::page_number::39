SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


4.9.3 Unobservability
An FCKMS could protect the existence of transactions and the identities of the entities that
initiate or participate in the transactions from being observed (i.e., monitored, recorded).

FR:4.12 The CKMS design shall specify which CKMS transactions have or can be provided
with unobservability protection.

FR:4.13 The CKMS design shall specify how CKMS transaction unobservability is
achieved.

                           When unobservability is required, a Federal CKMS shall
PR:4.16
                           assure that any key-management transaction is not observable
                           by anyone except authorized entities.

4.10 Laws, Rules, and Regulations

The security policies of an organization should conform to the laws, rules, and regulations of
the locality, state, and nation(s) in which its FCKMS will be used. If an FCKMS is designed
for international use, then it should be flexible enough to conform to the restrictions of
multiple nations.

FR:4.14 The CKMS design shall specify the countries and/or regions of countries where it is
intended for use and any legal restrictions that the CKMS is intended to enforce.

                SC-1       A Federal CKMS shall comply with U.S. Federal laws, rules
PR:4.17
                           and regulations.


                           A Federal CKMS should comply with the rules and
PA:4.8
                           regulations of the countries in which it is operating and
                           providing key-management services.

                           A Federal CKMS could be configurable to comply with the
PF:4.2
                           policies of one or more national and international
                           organizations.

4.11 Security Domains

A security domain is a collection of entities that support the same FCKMS Security Policy
(see Section 4.3). When two mutually trusting entities are operating in the same security
domain, the entities can exchange keys and metadata while providing the protections that are
required by the FCKMS Security Policy.

Security domains can be useful when managing an organizationâ€™s users and computers that
can connect to users and computers in other organizations. If different entities are in the
same Security Domain, sharing information securely is relatively easy. If they are in different
Security Domains, then the sharing of information becomes difficult or even impossible.
