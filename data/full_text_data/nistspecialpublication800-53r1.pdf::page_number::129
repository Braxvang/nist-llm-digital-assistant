SC-1      SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION POLICY AND PROCEDURES

          Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a formal,
          documented, system and communications protection policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
          responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and
          compliance; and (ii) formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system
          and communications protection policy and associated system and communications protection
          controls.
          Supplemental Guidance: The system and communications protection policy and procedures are
          consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
          guidance. The system and communications protection policy can be included as part of the
          general information security policy for the organization. System and communications protection
          procedures can be developed for the security program in general, and for a particular information
          system, when required. NIST Special Publication 800-12 provides guidance on security policies
          and procedures.
          Control Enhancements: None.

SC-2      APPLICATION PARTITIONING

          Control:The information system separates user functionality (including user interface services)
          from information system management functionality.
          Supplemental Guidance:  The information system physically or logically separates user interface
          services (e.g., public web pages) from information storage and management services (e.g.,
          database management). Separation may be accomplished through the use of different computers,
          different central processing units, different instances of the operating system, different network
          addresses, combinations of these methods, or other methods as appropriate.
          Control Enhancements: None.
