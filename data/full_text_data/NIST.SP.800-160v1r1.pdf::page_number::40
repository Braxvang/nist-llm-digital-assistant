•    Events and conditions that are desirable, intended, and even planned yet produce
     unanticipated, unforeseen, and unpredictable results
•    Cascading and ripple events and conditions

Finally, the causes of asset loss answer the following questions:
•    How can loss occur?
•    How has loss occurred in the past?

However, determining how loss can occur does not require asking or answering the question,
“What is likely or probable to happen?” 39
Addressing loss occurs through the protective measures that enforce constraints to ensure that
only authorized and intended behaviors and outcomes of the system occur. These include:
•    Protective measures that are provided by the machine portion of the system (i.e., the system
     architecture and design, the use of engineered features and devices within the architecture
     and design)
•    Protective measures that are provided by the human in the system (i.e., personnel, practices,
     procedures, the use of tools to support the human as a system element, and the human role in
     designing and building the machine part of the system)
•    Protective measures that are provided by the physical environment (i.e., controlled access
     areas, facility access points, physical monitoring, environmental controls, fire suppression)

The terminology used to describe means and methods includes mechanisms, configurations,
controls, safeguards, countermeasures, features, techniques, overrides, practices, procedures,
processes, and inhibits. These may be applied in accordance with governing policies, regulations,
laws, practices, standards, and techniques.


                            ASSET-BASED PROTECTION – ENGINEERING FOR SUCCESS
                Do not focus on what is likely to happen. Instead, focus on what can happen, and
                be prepared. That is what systems security engineering means by adopting a
                preemptive and reactive strategy (Section D.2) in the form of a concept of secure
                function that addresses the spectrum of asset loss and associated consequences.
                This means proactively planning and designing to prevent the loss of an asset that
                you are not willing to accept, to be able to minimize the consequences should such
                a loss occur, and to be in an informed position to reactively recover from the loss
                when it does happen.

  This point distinguishes analysis of what can happen from a risk assessment that determines probability greater than zero and less than one that
the adverse event will happen.
