 Reproducibility                      The ability of different experts to produce the same
                                      results from the same data.
 Residual Risk                        Portion of risk remaining after security measures have
 [CNSSI No. 4009]                     been applied.

 Risk                                 A measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened
 [CNSSI No. 4009]                     by a potential circumstance or event, and typically a
                                      function of: (i) the adverse impacts that would arise if the
                                      circumstance or event occurs; and (ii) the likelihood of
                                      occurrence. See Information System-Related Security
                                      Risk.
 Risk Assessment                      The process of identifying, estimating, and prioritizing
 [NIST SP 800-39]                     risks to organizational operations (including mission,
                                      functions, image, reputation), organizational assets,
                                      individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, resulting
                                      from the operation of an information system.
                                      Part of risk management, incorporates threat and
                                      vulnerability analyses, and considers mitigations
                                      provided by security controls planned or in place.
                                      Synonymous with risk analysis.
 Risk Assessment Methodology          A risk assessment process, together with a risk model,
                                      assessment approach, and analysis approach.

 Risk Assessment Report               The report which contains the results of performing a risk
                                      assessment or the formal output from the process of
                                      assessing risk.
 Risk Assessor                        The individual, group, or organization responsible for
                                      conducting a risk assessment.

 Risk Executive (Function)            An individual or group within an organization that helps
 [CNSSI No. 4009]                     to ensure that: (i) security risk-related considerations for
                                      individual information systems, to include the
                                      authorization decisions for those systems, are viewed
                                      from an organization-wide perspective with regard to the
                                      overall strategic goals and objectives of the organization
                                      in carrying out its missions and business functions; and
                                      (ii) managing risk from individual information systems is
                                      consistent across the organization, reflects organizational
                                      risk tolerance, and is considered along with other
                                      organizational risks affecting mission/business success.
 Risk Factor                          A characteristic used in a risk model as an input to
                                      determining the level of risk in a risk assessment.
