Cryptographic standards, algorithms, and methods for encryption, key-establishment, and digital
signatures provide a critical foundation for cybersecurity. NIST cryptographic standards have
been adopted as essential tools to secure communications and protect computing platforms.
The validation program ensures that hardware and software cryptographic implementations meet
standard security requirements. Cryptography is a continually evolving field that drives research
and innovation to deal with constantly advanced cryptanalysis techniques and rapidly growing
computing powers for attackers. Furthermore, in today’s digitalized environment, cryptographic
mechanisms are implemented in a broader range of platforms for various purposes. The demand
for new cryptographic tools has been higher than ever. The accomplishments below demonstrate
NIST’s continued dedication to the role it has fulfilled for nearly 50 years – leading public and
private collaborations to foster continuous improvement and reliability in cryptographic techniques
and technology.
Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)
In recent years, there has been steady progress in building quantum computers – machines
that exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to solve problems that are difficult or intractable
for conventional computers. When the capacity to build large-scale quantum computers exists,
they will be able to break many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use. This weakness
would seriously compromise the confidentiality and integrity of digital communications on the In-
ternet and elsewhere. The goal of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) (also called quantum-resis-
tant or quantum-safe cryptography) is to develop cryptographic systems that are secure against
quantum and classical computers and can also be deployed without drastic changes to existing
communication protocols and networks.
