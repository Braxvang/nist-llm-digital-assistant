GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



         Completed                                              Action
                          Review logs weekly (for more long-term trends)
                          Use automated log file analysis tool(s)
                          Mail server backups
                          Create a mail server backup policy
                          Back up mail server differentially or incrementally on a daily to weekly basis
                          Back up mail server fully on a weekly to monthly basis
                          Periodically archive backups
                          Recovering from a compromise
                          Report incident to organizationâ€™s computer incident response capability
                          Isolate compromised system(s) or take other steps to contain attack so
                          additional evidence can be collected
                          Consult, as appropriate, with management, legal counsel, and law enforcement
                          expeditiously
                          Investigate similar hosts to determine if the attacker has also compromised
                          other systems
                          Analyze the intrusion
                          Restore the system
                          Test system to ensure security
                          Reconnect system to network
                          Monitor system and network for signs that the attacker is attempting to access
                          the system or network again
                          Document lessons learned
                          Security testing
                          Periodically conduct vulnerability scans on mail server and supporting network
                          Update vulnerability scanner before testing
                          Correct any deficiencies identified by the vulnerability scanner
                          Conduct penetration testing on the mail server and the supporting network
                          infrastructure
                          Correct deficiencies identified by penetration testing
                          Remote administration
                          Use a strong authentication mechanism (e.g., public/private key pair, two factor
                          authentication)
                          Restrict which hosts can be used to remotely administer the mail server by IP
                          address or by authorized users
                          Use secure protocols (e.g., SSH, HTTPS) that can provide encryption for both
                          passwords and data
                          Enforce the concept of least privilege on remote administration (e.g., attempt to
                          minimize the access rights for the remote administration accounts)
                          Change any default accounts or passwords for the remote administration utility
                          or application
                          Do not allow remote administration from the Internet unless mechanisms such as
                          VPN are used
                          Do not mount any file shares on the internal network from the mail server and
                          vice versa
