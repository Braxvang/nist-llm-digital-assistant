5.3     Techniques for Delivering Training Material

Techniques for effectively delivering training material should take advantage of technology that supports
the following features:

     Ease of use (e.g., easy to access and easy to update/maintain);
     Scalability (e.g., can be used for various audience sizes and in various locations);
     Accountability (e.g., capture and use statistics on degree of completion); and
     Broad base of industry support (e.g., adequate number of potential vendors, better chance of
      finding follow-on support).
Some of the more common techniques that agencies can employ include:

     Interactive video training (IVT) – IVT is one of several distance-learning techniques available for
      delivering training material. This technology supports two-way interactive audio and video
      instruction. The interactive feature makes the technique more effective than non-interactive
      techniques, but it is more expensive.
     Web-based training – This technique is currently the most popular for distributed environments.
      “Attendees” of a web-based session can study independently and learn at their own pace. Testing and
      accountability features can be built in to gauge performance. Training models incorporating this
      technique are beginning to provide the additional benefit of interaction between instructor and student
      or among students.
     Non-web, computer-based training – This technique continues to be popular even with web
      availability. It can still be an effective method for distribution of training material, especially if
      access to web-based material is not feasible. Like web-based training, this technique does not allow
      for interaction between the instructor and students or among students.
     Onsite, instructor-led training (including peer presentations and mentoring) – This is one of the
      oldest, but one of the most popular techniques for delivering training material to an audience. The
      biggest advantage of the technique is the interactive nature of the instruction. This technique,
      however, has several potential disadvantages. In a large organization, there may be difficulty in
      scheduling sufficient classes so that all of the target audience can attend. In an organization that has a
      widely distributed workforce, there may be significant travel costs for instructors and students.
      Although there are challenges for distributed environments, some learners prefer this traditional
      method over other methods.
Blending various training delivery techniques in one session can be an effective way to present material
and hold an audience’s attention. For example, showing videos during an instructor-led session allows
the audience to focus on a different source of information. The video can also reinforce what the
instructor has been presenting. IVT, web-based training, and non-web, computer-based training can also
be used as part of an instructor-led training session.
