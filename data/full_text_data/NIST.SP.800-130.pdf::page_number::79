SP 800-130                                                             August 2013



A secure operating system depends on a trusted hardware platform running secure code.
The trusted hardware platform often enforces two or more states in order to provide
privileged operations, such as memory and I/O management.

In some situations, a secure operating system is an isolation kernel (also known as
hypervisor), which provides virtual machines to the guest operating systems and CKMS
applications running on top of the guest operating systems. In this architecture, the
isolation kernel views the guest operating systems as the applications.

CKMS devices that perform dedicated security functions and are not built with general-
purpose capabilities can have reduced or minimal operating system requirements. As an
example, consider a special-purpose device loaded with firmware and/or software to
perform intrusion detection functions. This device may not have an operating system, and
hence, has no operating system security requirements. Another example is a firewall or
intrusion detection system built on a “locked-down” (i.e., non-modifiable) operating
system so that the capability to load additional code is not available.

FR:8.3 The CKMS design shall specify all secure operating system requirements
(including any required operating system configurations) for each CKMS device.

FR:8.4 The CKMS design shall specify which of the following hardening 20 features are
enforced by the CKMS:
   a) Removing all non-essential software programs and utilities from the computer;
   b) Using the principle of least privilege to control access to sensitive system features
       and applications;
   c) Using the principle of least privilege to control access to sensitive system and
       application files and data;
   d) Limiting user accounts to those needed for legitimate operations, i.e., disabling or
       deleting the accounts that are no longer required;
   e) Running the applications with the principle of least privilege;
   f) Replacing all default passwords and keys with strong passwords and randomly
       generated keys, respectively;
   g) Disabling or removing network services that are not required for the operation of
       the system;
   h) Disabling or removing all other services that are not required for the operation of
       the system;
   i) Disabling removable media, or disabling automatic run features on removable
       media and enabling automatic malware checks upon media introduction;
   j) Disabling network ports that are not required for the system operation;
   k) Enabling optional security features as appropriate; and
