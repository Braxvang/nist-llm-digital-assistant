NIST SP 800-156                                                  REPRESENTATION OF PIV CHAIN-OF-TRUST
                                                                               FOR IMPORT AND EXPORT


      <CardHolderUUID>:
            The <CardHolderUUID > element is optional, and occurs once when included
            in the PersonalInformationType complex type. The Cardholder UUID is is a
            persistent identifier for the cardholder. The data is provided in an xs:string
            format. <CardHolderUUID> can be used by Agency B to request record from
            Agency A. The user then re-connects with the record via a biometric match.

      <CardUUID>:
            The <CardUUID > element is optional, and occurs once when included in the
            PersonalInformationType complex type. It is envisioned that the
            <CardUUID> will be used only in the agency to service provider record
            exchange use case to transfer the Card UUID to be stored on the PIV Card.
            The data is provided in an xs:string format. <CardUUID> can be used by
            Agency B to request a record from Agency A. The user then re-connects with
            the record via a biometric match.

      <CHUID>:
           This element is optional and if used should occur once when included in the
           PersonalInformationType complex type. It is envisioned that the <CHUID>
           will be used only in the agency to service provider use case to transfer the
           CHUID-specific details to be stored on the PIV Card. The data is provided in
           an xs:string format. <CHUID>â€™s FASC-N can be used by Agency B to request
           a record from Agency A. The user then re-connects with the record via a
           biometric match.

3.6     Complex Type AdjudicationInformationType

The following schema fragment defines the AdjudicationInformationType complex
type:
<xs:complexType name="AdjudicationInformationType">
  <xs:sequence>
    <xs:element name="NACIAdjudicationValue" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1">
      <xs:simpleType>
        <xs:restriction base="xs:string">
          <xs:enumeration value="Approved"/>
          <xs:enumeration value="Pending"/>
        </xs:restriction>
      </xs:simpleType>
    </xs:element>
    <xs:element name="NACIAdjudicationEffDate" type="xs:date" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/>
  </xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>


The AdjudicationInformationType complex type contains two elements that describe
the status of the PIV background investigation of the subject of the chain-of-trust
enrollment record. Those elements are:

      <NACIAdjudicationValue>:
           This element is required, and occurs once in the
           AdjudicationInformationType complex type. The element indicates the
           status of the National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) (or equivalent or
                                               11
