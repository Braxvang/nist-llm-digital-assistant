       NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                         Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
       November 2023

2019             b. Review and update policies and procedures periodically.

2020             DISCUSSION
2021             This requirement addresses policies and procedures for the protection of CUI. Policies and
2022             procedures contribute to security assurance and should address each family of the CUI security
2023             requirements. Policies can be included as part of the generalized organizational security policy
2024             or be represented by separate policies that address each family of requirements. Procedures
2025             describe how policies are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the
2026             object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security plans or in one or
2027             more separate documents.

2032   3.15.2. System Security Plan
2033             REQUIREMENT: 03.15.02
2034             a. Develop a system security plan that:
2035                  1. Defines the constituent system components;
2036                  2. Describes the system operating environment;
2037                  3. Describes specific threats to the system that are of concern to the organization;
2038                  4. Provides an overview of the security requirements for the system;
2039                  5. Identifies connections to other systems;
2040                  6. Identifies individuals that fulfill system roles and responsibilities; and
2041                  7. Includes other relevant information necessary for the protection of CUI.
2042             b. Review and update the system security plan periodically.
2043             c.   Protect the system security plan from unauthorized disclosure.

2044             DISCUSSION
2045             System security plans provide key characteristics of the system that is processing, storing, and
2046             transmitting CUI and how the system and information are protected. System security plans
2047             contain sufficient information to enable a design and implementation that is unambiguously
2048             compliant with the intent of the plans and the subsequent determinations of risk if the plan is
2049             implemented as intended. System security plans can be a collection of documents, including
2050             documents that already exist. Effective system security plans make use of references to policies,
2051             procedures, and additional documents (e.g., design specifications) where detailed information
2052             can be obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements associated with security
2053             programs and maintains security information in other established management or operational
2054             areas related to enterprise architecture, the system development life cycle, systems engineering,
2055             and acquisition.
