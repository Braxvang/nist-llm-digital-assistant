D.15.3 Housing Assistance Information Type

Housing Assistance involves the development and management programs that provide housing
to those who are unable to provide housing for themselves including the rental of single-family
or multifamily properties, and the management and operation of federally supported housing
properties. The recommended provisional categorization of the housing assistance information
type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of housing assistance
information on the ability of responsible agencies to develop and manage programs that provide
housing to those who are unable to provide housing for themselves including the rental of single-
family or multifamily properties, and the management and operation of federally supported
housing properties. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most housing assistance
information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Exceptions that might have a
potential for more serious consequences are based on privacy information (e.g., information
required by the Privacy Act of 1974 or other statutes and executive orders to receive special
handling to protect the privacy of individuals). The Privacy Act Information provisional impact
levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. This can
result in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for housing assistance information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of housing assistance information
would have, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.
Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications
(e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the
agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
housing assistance information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to housing assistance information. The
effects of disruption of access to most housing assistance information or information systems
would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.
