implemented in hardware, firmware, and software. The former is referred to as being in the
organization and the latter as being in the system. Understanding the source of vulnerabilities
and predisposing conditions can help identify optimal mitigation strategies. Deeper analysis may
uncover that causes and observations may not be one-to-one â€“ that is, some underlying causes
may exhibit multiple symptoms, and some symptoms may come from more than one cause.
Any given OT will usually exhibit a subset of the identified vulnerabilities in this appendix but
may also contain additional vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions that are unique to a
particular technology or implementation. Specific current information on OT vulnerabilities can
be found on the CISA website, though many vendors publish notifications and patches that are
not always found on the CISA website. It is beneficial to maintain relationships with vendors in
order to stay up to date with known vulnerabilities.
Some vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions can be mitigated. Others can only be accepted
and controlled by appropriate countermeasures but will result in some residual risk to the OT
environment. For example, some existing policies and procedures may be changed with a level
of effort that the organization considers acceptable, while others are more expeditiously dealt
with by instituting additional policies and procedures.
Vulnerabilities in the products and services acquired from outside of the organization are rarely
under the direct control of the organization. Changes may be influenced by market forces, but
this is a slow and indirect approach. Instead, the organization may change predisposing
conditions to reduce the likelihood that a systemic vulnerability will be exploited.

C.2.1. Policy and Procedure Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions
Vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions are often introduced into the OT environment
because of incomplete, inappropriate, or nonexistent security policy, including documentation,
implementation guides (e.g., procedures), and enforcement. Management support of security
policy and procedures is the cornerstone of any security program. Organization security policy
can reduce vulnerabilities by mandating and enforcing proper conduct. Written policy and
procedures are mechanisms for informing staff and stakeholders of decisions about behavior that
is beneficial to the organization. From this perspective, policy is an educational and instructive
way to reduce vulnerabilities. Enforcement is a partner to policy and encourages people to do the
proper thing. Various forms of corrective action are the usual consequences to personnel not
following policy and procedures. Policies should be explicit about the consequences to
individuals or organizations that do not conform.
There is usually a complex policy and procedure environment that includes laws, regulations,
overlapping jurisdictions and spheres of influence, economics, custom, and history. The larger
enterprise is often subdivided into organizational units that should work together to reduce
vulnerabilities. The scope and hierarchical relationship among policies and procedures needs to
be managed for maximum effectiveness.
