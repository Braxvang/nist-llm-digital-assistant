Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Exceptions that might result in more
serious consequences are based on the mission supported by the higher education activity (e.g.,
undetected modification of weapons training information at a service academy where the
modification could result in harm to the student or other individuals). In such cases, the impact
is determined by the information associated with the supported mission. This can result in
assignment of a moderate or high impact level to such information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
higher education information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to higher education information. The
effects of disruption of access to most higher education information or information systems
would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
higher education information is low.

D.12.3 Cultural and Historic Preservation Information Type

Cultural and Historic Preservation involves all activities performed by the Federal Government
to collect and preserve information and artifacts important to the culture and history of the
United States and its citizenry and the education of U.S. citizens and the world. The
recommended provisional categorization of the cultural and historic preservation information
type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of cultural and historic
preservation information on the ability of responsible agencies to collect and preserve
information and artifacts important to the culture and history of the United States and its
citizenry and the education of U.S. citizens and the world. The consequences of unauthorized
disclosure of most cultural and historic preservation information would have a limited adverse
effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In cases where disclosure of
information might be useful to an individual or organization intent on destruction of historical
materials, the potential consequences to key national assets could be serious to severe. In such
cases, the confidentiality impact could be moderate to high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for cultural and historic preservation information is low.
