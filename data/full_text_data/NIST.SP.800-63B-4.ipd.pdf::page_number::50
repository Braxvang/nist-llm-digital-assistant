       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines

1461   The use of a restricted authenticator requires that the implementing organization assess,
1462   understand, and accept the risks associated with that authenticator and acknowledge
1463   that risk will likely increase over time. It is the responsibility of the organization to
1464   determine the level of acceptable risk for their systems and associated data and to define
1465   any methods for mitigating excessive risks. If at any time the organization determines that
1466   the risk to any party is unacceptable, then that authenticator SHALL NOT be used.
1467   Further, the risk of an authentication error is typically borne by multiple parties, including
1468   the implementing organization, organizations that rely on the authentication decision,
1469   and the subscriber. Because the subscriber may be exposed to additional risk when an
1470   organization accepts a restricted authenticator and that the subscriber may have a limited
1471   understanding of and ability to control that risk, the CSP SHALL :
1472      1. Offer subscribers at least one alternate authenticator that is not restricted and can be
1473         used to authenticate at the required AAL.
1474      2. Provide meaningful notice to subscribers regarding the security risks of the
1475         restricted authenticator and availability of alternatives that are not restricted.
1476      3. Address any additional risk to subscribers in its risk assessment.
1477      4. Develop a migration plan for the possibility that the restricted authenticator is no
1478         longer acceptable at some point in the future and include this migration plan in its
1479         digital identity acceptance statement.

1480   5.2.11. Activation Secrets
1481   Memorized secrets that are used as an activation factor for a multi-factor authenticator
1482   are referred to as activation secrets. An activation secret is used to decrypt a stored secret
1483   key used for authentication or is compared against a locally held stored verifier to provide
1484   access to the authentication key. In either of these cases, the activation secret SHALL
1485   remain within the authenticator and its associated user endpoint.
1486   Authenticators making use of activation secrets SHALL require the secrets to be at
1487   least 6 characters in length. Activation secrets MAY be entirely numeric (i.e., a PIN).
1488   If alphanumeric (rather than only numeric) values are permitted, all printing ASCII
1489   [RFC20] characters as well as the space character SHOULD be accepted. Unicode
1490   [ISO/ISC 10646] characters SHOULD be accepted as well in alphanumeric secrets. The
1491   authenticator SHALL contain a blocklist (either specified by specific values or by an
1492   algorithm) of at least 10 commonly used activation values and SHALL prevent their use
1493   as activation secrets.
1494   The authenticator or verifier SHALL implement a retry-limiting mechanism that
1495   effectively limits the number of consecutive failed activation attempts using the
1496   authenticator to ten (10). If the entry of an incorrect activation secret causes the
1497   authenticator to generate an invalid output that is sent to the central verifier, rate
