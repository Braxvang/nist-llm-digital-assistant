SP 800-152                                 A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


             Throughout the lifetime of a Federal CKMS, the CKMS
PA:12.1
             designer/developer, and the FCKMS service-providing and
             service-using organizations should evaluate possible threats
             to the FCKMS resulting from advances in technology that
             may render the FCKMS insecure, including:
               a) New attacks on cryptographic algorithms,
               b) New attacks on key-establishment protocols,
               c) New attacks on FCKMS devices,
              d) New computing technologies that could reduce the
                 security provided by a cryptographic algorithm,
              e) New attacks on access control mechanisms, and
              f) New mathematical attacks that could reduce the
                 protection provided by a cryptographic algorithm and a
                 fixed key length.
             FCKMS management should assure that a periodic review of
PA:12.2
             the advances in technology is conducted in order to determine
             the feasibility and desirability of system improvements.

             Federal CKMS administrators could review the current
PF:12.1
             FCKMS technology used in security-domain policy
             specification, negotiation, and/or enforcement to determine if
             an upgrade or replacement of the FCKMS is needed.
