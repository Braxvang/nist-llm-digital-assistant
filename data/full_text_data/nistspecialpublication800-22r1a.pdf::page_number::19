A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



P-value                       The probability (under the null hypothesis of randomness) that the chosen
                              test statistic will assume values that are equal to or worse than the
                              observed test statistic value when considering the null hypothesis. The P-
                              value is frequently called the “tail probability.”
Poisson Distribution - §3.8   Poisson distributions model (some) discrete random variables. Typically,
                              a Poisson random variable is a count of the number of rare events that
                              occur in a certain time interval.
Probability Density           A function that provides the "local" probability distribution of a test
Function (PDF)                statistic. From a finite sample size n, a probability density function will be
                              approximated by a histogram.
Probability Distribution      The assignment of a probability to the possible outcomes (realizations) of
                              a random variable.
Pseudorandom Number           A deterministic algorithm which, given a truly random binary sequence of
Generator (PRNG)              length k, outputs a binary sequence of length l >> k which appears to be
                              random. The input to the generator is called the seed, while the output is
                              called a pseudorandom bit sequence.
Random Number                 A mechanism that purports to generate truly random data.
Generator (RNG)
Random Binary Sequence        A sequence of bits for which the probability of each bit being a “0” or “1”
                              is ½. The value of each bit is independent of any other bit in the sequence,
                              i.e., each bit is unpredictable.
Random Variable               Random variables differ from the usual deterministic variables (of science
                              and engineering) in that random variables allow the systematic
                              distributional assignment of probability values to each possible outcome.
Rank (of a matrix)            Refers to the rank of a matrix in linear algebra over GF(2). Having
                              reduced a matrix into row-echelon form via elementary row operations, the
                              number of nonzero rows, if any, are counted in order to determine the
                              number of linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix.
Run                           An uninterrupted sequence of like bits (i.e., either all zeroes or all ones).
Seed                          The input to a pseudorandom number generator. Different seeds generate
                              different pseudorandom sequences.
SHA-1                         The Secure Hash Algorithm defined in Federal Information Processing
                              Standard 180-1.
Standard Normal               See the definition in Section 5.5.3. This is the normal function for mean =
Cumulative Distribution       0 and variance = 1.
Function
Statistically Independent     Two events are independent if the occurrence of one event does not affect
Events                        the chances of the occurrence of the other event. The mathematical
                              formulation of the independence of events A and B is the probability of the
                              occurrence of both A and B being equal to the product of the probabilities
                              of A and B (i.e., P(A and B) = P(A)P(B)).
Statistical Test (of a        A function of the data (binary stream) which is computed and used to
Hypothesis)                   decide whether or not to reject the null hypothesis. A systematic statistical
                              rule whose purpose is to generate a conclusion regarding whether the
                              experimenter should accept or reject the null hypothesis Ho.
Word                          A predefined substring consisting of a fixed pattern/template (e.g., 010,
                              0110).
