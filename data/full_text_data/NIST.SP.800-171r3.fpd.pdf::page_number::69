       NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                      Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
       November 2023

1982             The granularity of monitoring the information collected is based on organizational monitoring
1983             objectives and the capability of the system to support such objectives.
1984             Systems connections can be network, remote, or local. A network connection is any connection
1985             with a device that communicates through a network (e.g., local area network, the internet). A
1986             remote connection is any connection with a device that communicates through an external
1987             network (e.g., the internet). Network, remote, and local connections can be either wired or
1988             wireless.
1989             Unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions related to inbound and outbound
1990             communications traffic include internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious code in
1991             the system or propagating among system components, the unauthorized export of information,
1992             or signaling to external systems. Evidence of malicious code is used to identify a potentially
1993             compromised system. System monitoring requirements, including the need for types of system
1994             monitoring, may be referenced in other requirements.

2002             REQUIREMENT: 03.14.08
2003             Manage and retain CUI within the system and CUI output from the system in accordance with
2004             applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines, and
2005             operational requirements.

2006             DISCUSSION
2007             Federal agencies consider data retention requirements for nonfederal organizations. Retaining
2008             CUI on nonfederal systems after contracts or agreements have concluded increases the attack
2009             surface for those systems and the risk of the information being compromised. NARA provides
2010             federal policy and guidance on records retention and schedules.
