                                                                 GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


    IPv4-compatible IPv6 address:

          80 bits                                             16 bits       32 bits

          0000………………………….……..0000                             0000          IPv4 address


    IPv4-mapped IPv6 address:

          80 bits                                             16 bits       32 bits

          0000………………………….……..0000                             FFFF          IPv4 address


    The two IPv4 embedded address types are similar. The only difference is the sixth group of 16 bits.
    IPv4-compatible addresses set these to 0; IPv4-mapped addresses set these to 1.

   A more generalized form of IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses has been defined (RFC 6052), to aid the
   process of automated translation from one type of address to the other. Two new variants of IPv4-
   embedded IPv6 addresses are:
               IPv4-converted IPv6 addresses: "IPv6 addresses used to represent IPv4 nodes in an
                  IPv6 network"
               IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses: "IPv6 addresses assigned to IPv6 nodes for use with
                  stateless transition"
   It is quite likely that additional special-use variants will be defined in the future.

        Other address or Special Address types. IPv6 makes use of addresses other than those
         shown above. The unspecified address consists of all zeros (0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 or simply ::) and
         may be the source address of a node soliciting its own IP address from an address assignment
         authority (such as a DHCPv6 [DHCP for IPv6] server). IPv6-compliant routers never forward
         a packet with an unspecified address. The loopback address is used by a node to send a packet
         to itself. The loopback address, 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 (or simply ::1), is defined as being interface-
         local. IPv6-compliant hosts and routers never forward packets with a loopback destination.

An essential design consideration for IPv6 is to simplify routing in enterprise and global networks. One
of the intents of the IPv6 address schema is to facilitate hierarchical routing. Hierarchical routing in turn
accelerates the end-to-end routing function, and routing table convergence and maintenance are vastly
simplified.

A typical IPv6 interface is configured to receive packets sent to several addresses. In addition to its link
local and global unicast addresses, it may have a unique local address. It can also receive multicast
messages sent to the all hosts and solicited node multicast addresses, as well as possibly to other multicast
addresses. Finally, because of renumbering, multiple instances of some of these addresses may be active
at once. How these addresses are selected is covered in the Sections 4.6, Address Selection, and 4.2,
Multicast.

  3.1.5   IPv4 Addressing

Each IPv4 address is 32 bits long and is typically written as four decimal numbers (0-255) representing
eight bits each and separated by decimal points or periods. This is called dotted decimal. An example of
an IPv4 address is 172.30.128.97. Each IPv4 address is associated with an additional component called a
