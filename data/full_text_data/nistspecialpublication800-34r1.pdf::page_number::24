                                                         CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



2.2.5    Cyber Incident Response Plan

The cyber incident response plan 11 establishes procedures to address cyber attacks against an
organization’s information system(s). 12 These procedures are designed to enable security personnel to
identify, mitigate, and recover from malicious computer incidents, such as unauthorized access to a
system or data, denial of service, or unauthorized changes to system hardware, software, or data (e.g.,
malicious logic, such as a virus, worm, or Trojan horse). This plan may be included as an appendix of the
BCP.

2.2.6    Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)

The DRP applies to major, usually physical disruptions to service that deny access to the primary facility
infrastructure for an extended period. A DRP is an information system-focused plan designed to restore
operability of the target system, application, or computer facility infrastructure at an alternate site after an
emergency. The DRP may be supported by multiple information system contingency plans to address
recovery of impacted individual systems once the alternate facility has been established. A DRP may
support a BCP or COOP plan by recovering supporting systems for mission/business processes or mission
essential functions at an alternate location. The DRP only addresses information system disruptions that
require relocation.

2.2.7    Information System Contingency Plan (ISCP)

An ISCP provides established procedures for the assessment and recovery of a system following a system
disruption. The ISCP provides key information needed for system recovery, including roles and
responsibilities, inventory information, assessment procedures, detailed recovery procedures, and testing
of a system.

The ISCP differs from a DRP primarily in that the information system contingency plan procedures are
developed for recovery of the system regardless of site or location. An ISCP can be activated at the
system’s current location or at an alternate site. In contrast, a DRP is primarily a site-specific plan
developed with procedures to move operations of one or more information systems from a damaged or
uninhabitable location to a temporary alternate location. Once the DRP has successfully transferred an
information system site to an alternate site, each affected system would then use its respective ISCP to
restore, recover, and test systems, and put them into operation.

2.2.8    Occupant Emergency Plan (OEP)

The OEP outlines first-response procedures for occupants of a facility in the event of a threat or incident
to the health and safety of personnel, the environment, or property. Such events include a fire, bomb
threat, chemical release, domestic violence in the workplace, or a medical emergency. Shelter-in-place
procedures for events requiring personnel to stay inside the building rather than evacuate are also
addressed in an OEP. OEPs are developed at the facility level, specific to the geographic location and
structural design of the building. General Services Administration (GSA)-owned facilities maintain plans
based on the GSA OEP template. The facility OEP may be appended to the COOP or BCP, but is
executed separately and as a first response to the incident. Aspects of planning for personnel safety and
evacuation are discussed in Appendix D.

11
   A cyber incident response plan is different from the Cyber Incident Annex of the National Response Framework (NRF). The
   Cyber Incident Annex is for incidents “capable of causing extensive damage to critical infrastructure or key assets” and is
   more applicable to CIP plans.

   NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 1, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, provides guidance on establishing a cyber incident
   response capability and plan.
