                                                                                              SECTION 2: RFID TECHNOLOGY



personnel, and business continuity infrastructure (e.g., electric generators, enterprise data backup, high-
availability communications equipment). If the analytic systems integrate both RFID and non-RFID
information systems, then it is unlikely that the location of the RF subsystem will significantly influence
the location of the analytic systems.

When the enterprise subsystem components are distributed across an organization’s network, the resulting
physical topology can be complex, but depending on the network’s configuration, the logical topology
might be relatively simple. Many organizations create virtual local area networks (VLAN) for the
distributed enterprise subsystem devices that make them appear to each other as if they were on the same
network segment. VLANs reduce latency that causes performance problems on networks with large
numbers of time-sensitive transactions. They also isolate traffic from other systems, which improves
security.

2.4.3.2 Data Communications Protocols

Data communications protocols are a critical component of a network’s performance, reliability, and
security. A complete discussion of data communications protocols is beyond the scope of this guide, but
readers should be able to distinguish between link-layer and network-layer protocols to understand how
RFID enterprise subsystem network infrastructures work and are secured. Link-layer protocols specify
how devices communicate with each other over a common medium, or link. Network-layer protocols
(sometimes called internetwork protocols) describe how data traffic is routed across multiple network
links, possibly over many types of media.

The most common link-layer protocol connecting RFID enterprise subsystem components is Ethernet
(IEEE 802.3), which is the same link-layer protocol used to connect most office computers to local wired
networks. Ethernet has no built-in security functionality, which means other complementary data
communications protocols must provide any required protection.

In most RFID implementations, data communication within the enterprise subsystem is wired
communication. The exception is mobile readers, which connect to the enterprise subsystem using a
wireless link-layer protocol, such as Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11). 21 Wi-Fi’s characteristics are significantly
different than the link-layer protocols supporting communication between tags and readers. In particular,
Wi-Fi equipment supporting Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) includes numerous security features, such as
strong authentication and encryption. 22

The most common network-layer protocol for enterprise subsystem communication is the IP. Since most
modern computers are IP-enabled, enterprise subsystem components, such as middleware and analytic
systems, can easily communicate across the enterprise and over external networks, including the Internet.
The ability to communicate with a diverse range of computers and their application services also
represents a security risk. IP-enabled enterprise subsystem components are subject to the same protocol
attacks as any other IP-enabled computer.

2.5     Inter-Enterprise Subsystem

The inter-enterprise subsystem connects enterprise subsystems together when information needs to be
shared across geographic or organizational boundaries, such as in a supply chain application. Not all
RFID systems contain inter-enterprise subsystems. The largest government inter-enterprise subsystem is

21
      IEEE 802.11 is also used for communication between readers and some types of active tags.
