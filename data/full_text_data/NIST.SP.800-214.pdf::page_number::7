Identity and Access Management (IdAM) is a fundamental and critical cybersecurity capability
to ensure that the right people have the appropriate access to the proper resources at the right
time. To advance the state of identity and access management, NIST:
• Conducts focused research to better understand new and emerging technologies,
  impacts on existing standards, and ways to implement IdAM solutions;
• Leads in the development of national and international IdAM standards, guidance,
  best practices, profiles, and frameworks to create an enhanced, interoperable suite of
  secure, privacy-enhancing solutions;
• Evolves its IdAM standards, guidelines, and resources; and
• Produces example solutions that bring together the IdAM requirements needed to
  address specific business cybersecurity challenges.
IdAM is an important component of cloud computing security, and NIST publishes access control
characteristics and general access control guidelines for various cloud service models. NIST also
performs research and development regarding access control rules and methods.

Personal Identity Verification (PIV)

As required by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12, NIST developed and maintains
the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for personal identity verification (PIV) of
federal employees and contractors (FIPS 201). In FY 2019, NIST initiated a revision of FIPS 201
to incorporate changing business requirements of federal departments and agencies and to
adapt to an evolving technology environment. The revision also helps users to align with Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) Policy Memorandum M-19-17. Revision activities began in
FY 2019 with a business requirement meeting to engage with federal stakeholders about the
revision goals. In FY 2020, the PIV team updated the draft standard based on the revision goals
