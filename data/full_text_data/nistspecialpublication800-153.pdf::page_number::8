                                             GUIDELINES FOR SECURING W IRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (WLANS)


1.        Introduction

1.1       Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency
Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2       Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this publication is to provide organizations with recommendations for improving the
security configuration and monitoring of their IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networks (WLANs) and
their devices connecting to those networks. The scope of this publication is limited to unclassified
wireless networks and unclassified facilities within range of unclassified wireless networks.

This publication supplements other NIST publications by consolidating and strengthening their key
recommendations, and it points readers to the appropriate NIST publications for additional information
(see Appendix C for the full list of references and Appendix A for a list of major security controls
relevant for WLAN security). This publication does not eliminate the need to follow recommendations in
other NIST publications, such as [SP800-48] and [SP800-97]. If there is a conflict between
recommendations in this publication and another NIST wireless publication, the recommendation in this
publication takes precedence.

1.3       Audience

The primary audience for this publication is security professionals, network professionals, system
administrators, and others who are responsible for planning, implementing, maintaining, and monitoring
the security of their organization’s WLANs and the devices that connect to those WLANs.

1.4       Document Structure

The remainder of this document is composed of the following sections and appendices:

          Section 2 provides recommendations for WLAN security configuration, including configuration
           design, implementation, evaluation, and maintenance.
