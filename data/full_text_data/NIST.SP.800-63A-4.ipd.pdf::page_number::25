580   In order to be considered SUPERIOR, identity evidence SHALL meet all the following
581   requirements:
582      1. The issuing source of the evidence confirmed the claimed identity by following
583         written procedures designed to enable it to have high confidence that the source
584         knows the real-life identity of the subject. Such procedures are subject to recurring
585         oversight by regulatory or publicly accountable institutions.
586      2. The issuing source visually identified the applicant and performed further checks to
587         confirm the existence of that person.
588      3. The issuing process for the evidence ensured that it was delivered into the
589         possession of the person to whom it relates.
590      4. The evidence contains at least one reference number that uniquely identifies the
591         person to whom it relates.
592      5. The evidence contains a facial portrait or other biometric characteristic of the
593         person to whom it relates.
594      6. The evidence includes digital information that is cryptographically signed.
595      7. The evidence includes physical security features that make it difficult to copy or
596         reproduce.
597      8. The evidence includes an expiration date and is unexpired.

598   4.3.4. Identity Evidence and Attribute Validation
599   The CSP SHALL validate all identity evidence collected to meet evidence collection
600   requirements and all core attribute information required by the CSP identity service.

601   4.3.4.1. Evidence Validation
602   The CSP SHALL validate the authenticity, accuracy, and currency of presented evidence
603   by:
604       • Confirming the evidence is in the correct format and includes complete information
605         for the identity evidence type.
606       • Confirming the evidence is not counterfeit and that it as not been tampered with.
607       • Confirming any security features.
608   The CSP SHALL validate that the evidence is current through confirmation that its
609   expiration date has not passed or that evidence without an expiration date was issued
610   within the previous six (6) months.
611   The authenticity and accuracy of identity evidence or attribute information that is
612   cryptographically protected can be validated through verification of the digital signature
