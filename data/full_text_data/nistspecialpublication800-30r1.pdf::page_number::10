INTRODUCTION
THE NEED FOR RISK ASSESSMENTS TO SUPPORT ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT




O        rganizations 5 in the public and private sectors depend on information technology 6 and
         information systems 7 to successfully carry out their missions and business functions.
         Information systems can include very diverse entities ranging from office networks,
financial and personnel systems to very specialized systems (e.g., industrial/process control
systems, weapons systems, telecommunications systems, and environmental control systems).
Information systems are subject to serious threats that can have adverse effects on organizational
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation by exploiting both known
and unknown vulnerabilities to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the
information being processed, stored, or transmitted by those systems. Threats to information
systems can include purposeful attacks, environmental disruptions, human/machine errors, and
structural failures, and can result in harm to the national and economic security interests of the
United States. Therefore, it is imperative that leaders and managers at all levels understand their
responsibilities and are held accountable for managing information security risk—that is, the risk
associated with the operation and use of information systems that support the missions and
business functions of their organizations.

Risk assessment is one of the fundamental components of an organizational risk management
process as described in NIST Special Publication 800-39. Risk assessments are used to identify,
estimate, and prioritize risk to organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, and
reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation, resulting from
the operation and use of information systems. The purpose of risk assessments is to inform
decision makers and support risk responses by identifying: (i) relevant threats to organizations or
threats directed through organizations against other organizations; (ii) vulnerabilities both internal
and external to organizations; (iii) impact (i.e., harm) to organizations that may occur given the
potential for threats exploiting vulnerabilities; and (iv) likelihood that harm will occur. The end
result is a determination of risk (i.e., typically a function of the degree of harm and likelihood of
harm occurring). Risk assessments can be conducted at all three tiers in the risk management
hierarchy—including Tier 1 (organization level), Tier 2 (mission/business process level), and Tier
3 (information system level). At Tiers 1 and 2, organizations use risk assessments to evaluate, for
example, systemic information security-related risks associated with organizational governance
and management activities, mission/business processes, enterprise architecture, or the funding of
information security programs. At Tier 3, organizations use risk assessments to more effectively
support the implementation of the Risk Management Framework (i.e., security categorization;
security control selection, implementation, and assessment; information system and common
control authorization; and security control monitoring). 8

5
  The term organization describes an entity of any size, complexity, or positioning within an organizational structure
(e.g., a federal agency or, as appropriate, any of its operational elements) that is charged with carrying out assigned
mission/business processes and that uses information systems in support of those processes.
6
 Organizations also manage information technology in the form of common infrastructures, sets of shared services, and
sets of common controls.
7
  An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance,
use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information.

    The Risk Management Framework is described in NIST Special Publication 800-37.
