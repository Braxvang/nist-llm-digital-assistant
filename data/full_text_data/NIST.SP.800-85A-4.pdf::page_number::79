NIST SP 800-85A-4                                           PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                     INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

 Target                  pivLogoutOfCardApplication
 Reference(s)            1. SP 800-73-4 Part 3, Section 3.2.5
                         2. AS04.07
 Precondition(s)         1. The client application owns a connection to the PIV Card
                            Application accessible through cardHandle.
                         2. The client is logged into the card application.
                         3. The client has established an “application security status.”
 Test Steps              1. Set cardHandle := <<an invalid cardHandle>>
                         2. Call pivLogoutOfCardApplication with
                            • (IN) cardHandle
 Expected Result(s)      Call returns with status_word of PIV_INVALID_CARD_HANDLE.
 Postcondition(s)        The precondition states remain unchanged.


B.6           pivGetData

B.6.1           Valid Test Assertions

B.6.1.1          Get a Reference to Data Object that Does Not Require Login
 Purpose                Ensure the PIV Middleware reads data objects from the PIV Card
                        Application that do not require a login.
 Target                  pivGetData
 Reference(s)            1. SP 800-73-4 Part 3, Section 3.2.4
                         2. AS04.01, AS04.02A-R4, AS04.06
 Precondition(s)         1. The client application owns a connection to the PIV Card
                            Application accessible through cardHandle.
                         2. The client application has successfully selected the PIV Card
                            Application.
                         3. The client is not logged into the PIV Card Application.
 Test Steps              1. Set cardHandle := <<valid cardHandle>>
                         2. Set OID := <<valid OID>> (Repeat this for all implemented
                            objects on the card except for Fingerprints, Printed
                            Information, Facial Image, Iris Images, and Pairing Code
                            Reference Data Container)
                         3. Create data reference
                         4. Call pivGetData with (each data object identified in Step
                            2)
                            • (IN) cardHandle
                            • (IN) OID
                            • (IN) oidLength
                            • (OUT) data
                            • (INOUT) DataLength
 Expected Result(s)      Call returns with status_word of PIV_OK in each case and sets
                         reference to data.
