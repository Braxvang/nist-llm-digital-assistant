CHAPTER 5                                    Capital Planning and Investment Control


    Figure 5-1 illustrates the relationship between security drivers in the GAO Select-
Control-Evaluate investment lifecycle and the System Development Life Cycle
(SDLC). During the Select phase, security drivers include assessment activities to
ensure that IT security investments comply with security requirements. During the
Control phase, investments are monitored through the use of security metrics to
ensure that security controls are in place and operational, and that investments
remain compliant with requirements. During the Evaluate phase, security drivers
include self-assessment activities to ensure compliance and media sanitization efforts
following removal from operation and prior to disposition.

5.2      Integrating Information Security into the CPIC Process
   National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP)
800-65, Integrating IT Security into the Capital Planning and Investment Control
Process, provides a seven-step process, illustrated in Figure 5-2, for prioritizing
security activities and corrective actions:
      1. Identify the Baseline: use
         information security metrics or
         other available data to baseline
         the current security posture.
      2. Identify Prioritization
         Requirements: evaluate
         security posture against
         legislative and chief information
         officer (CIO)-articulated
         requirements and agency
         mission.
      3. Conduct Enterprise-Level
         Prioritization: prioritize
         potential enterprise-level
         information security investments
         against the mission and the
         financial impact of implementing
         appropriate security controls.
      4. Conduct System-Level
         Prioritization: prioritize
         potential system-level corrective
         actions against system category
         and corrective action impact.
      5. Develop Supporting Materials:
         for enterprise-level investments,    Figure 5-2. Integrating Information Security
                                                         into the CPIC Process
         develop concept paper, business
         case analysis, and Exhibit 300. For system-level investments, adjust Exhibit
         300 to request additional funding to mitigate prioritized weaknesses.
      6. Implement Investment Review Board (IRB) and Portfolio
         Management: prioritize agency-wide business cases against requirements
         and CIO priorities and determine investment portfolio.
      7. Submit Exhibit 300s, Exhibit 53, and Conduct Program Management:
         ensure approved 300s become part of the agencyâ€™s Exhibit 53; ensure
         investments are managed through their life cycle.
