1461           ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
1462           Examine
1463           [SELECT FROM: identification and authentication policy and procedures; list of circumstances or
1464           situations requiring re-authentication; system design documentation; system configuration
1465           settings; system audit records; list of system accounts; system security plan; other relevant
1466           documents or records]
1467           Interview

1477           REQUIREMENT: 03.05.02

1478           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
1479           Determine if:
1480           A.03.05.02: devices are uniquely identified and authenticated before establishing a system
1481           connection.

1482           ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
1483           Examine
1484           [SELECT FROM: identification and authentication policy and procedures; procedures for device
1485           identification and authentication; system design documentation; list of devices requiring unique
1486           identification and authentication; device connection reports; system configuration settings; system
1487           security plan; other relevant documents or records]
1488           Interview
1489           [SELECT FROM: personnel with responsibilities for device identification and authentication;
1490           personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers; system administrators]
1491           Test
1492           [SELECT FROM: mechanisms for supporting and/or implementing device identification and
