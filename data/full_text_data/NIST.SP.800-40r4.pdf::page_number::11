                                                                                                       applications, operating systems, and firmware. This involves knowing what assets

                                                                                                       that software. For example, your organization might subscribe to vulnerability feeds from
                                                                                                       software vendors, security researchers, and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

                                                                                                       exploited in the wild, then choose mitigation as the risk response and mitigate the
                                                                                                       vulnerability by upgrading the vulnerable software and altering the software’s
                                                                                                       configuration settings.
                                                                                                    3. Execute the risk response. This will vary depending on the nature of the selected risk

                                                                                                               additional security controls to safeguard the vulnerable software; or acquiring a
