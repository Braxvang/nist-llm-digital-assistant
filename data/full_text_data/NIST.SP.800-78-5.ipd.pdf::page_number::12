      NIST SP 800-78-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                 Cryptographic Algorithms
      September 2023                                                                 and Key Sizes for PIV

266   Applications may be designed to use any or all of the cryptographic keys and objects stored on
267   the PIV Card. Where maximum interoperability is required, applications should support all of the
268   identified algorithms, key sizes, and parameters specified in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.
269   FIPS 201-3 requires CAs and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responders to generate
270   and distribute digitally signed certificate revocation lists (CRL) and OCSP status messages,
271   respectively. These certificate status mechanisms support validation of the PIV Card, the PIV
272   cardholder, the cardholder’s digital signature key, and the cardholder’s key management key.
273   The signed certificate status mechanisms specified in FIPS 201-3 are:
274       •   X.509 CRLs that specify the status of a group of X.509 certificates and
275       •   OCSP status response messages that specify the status of a particular X.509 certificate.
276   The cryptographic algorithms, key sizes, and parameters that may be used to sign these
277   mechanisms are specified in Section 4, which also describes rules for encoding the signatures to
278   ensure interoperability.
279   FIPS 201-3 permits optional card management operations. These operations may only be
280   performed after the PIV Card authenticates the card management system. Card management
281   systems are authenticated through the use of PIV Card Application Administration Keys. The
282   cryptographic algorithms and key sizes that may be used for these keys are specified in Section
283   5.
