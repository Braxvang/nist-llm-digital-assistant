                                                               GUIDELINES ON ACTIVE CONTENT AND MOBILE CODE



Organizations should be aware of the specific benefits they gain using active content and balance
them against associated risks.

Active content has a history of increasing risks as well as benefits. Security involves continually
analyzing and managing risks. A risk analysis identifies vulnerabilities and threats, enumerates potential
attacks, assesses their likelihood of success, and estimates the potential damage from successful attacks.
Risk management is the process of assessing risk, taking steps to reduce risk to an acceptable level, and
maintaining that level of risk.

Security is relative to each organization and must take into account an organizationâ€™s specific needs,
budget, and culture. As new products are selected and procured, organizations need to consider the risk
environment, cost-effectiveness, assurance level, and security functional specifications, in making their
decisions. Organizations should also be aware of the interconnectivity and associated interdependence of
organizations, and that a risk accepted by one organization may inadvertently expose other organizations
with whom they interoperate to the same risk. Moreover, since active content is heavily oriented toward
rendering information for an individual, their decisions may affect the citizens being served. Once an
assessment is made, safeguards can be put in place against those risks deemed significantly high, by either
reducing the likelihood of occurrence or minimizing the consequences.

Organizations need to maintain consistent systemwide security when configuring and integrating
products involving active content into their system environments.

Organizations should be knowledgeable of the features in the products they procure that can be used to
control active content. Products and software applications that handle active content typically have built-
in controls that can be used to control or prevent activation of related features. Email, spreadsheet, word
processor, database, presentation graphics, and other desktop software applications have similar
configuration settings that can be used to control the security capabilities of active content documents.
Such configuration settings demand scrutiny in light of past exploits. It is an unfortunate fact that many
products are delivered with insecure default settings.

Network devices or other special purpose software should be used to supplement existing application-
oriented controls. For example, firewalls can be augmented by gateway devices to filter certain types of
email attachments and Web content that have known malicious code characteristics and to reject them at a
point of entry. Desktop anti-malware software has also become increasingly capable of detecting
malicious code signatures within active content. In addition, many active content technologies provide
mechanisms for dynamically restraining the behavior of mobile code by quarantining it within a logical
sandbox. Organizations should become familiar with available security options and use them according
to their organizational policy.
