Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the regulatory creation information.
The regulatory creation process is usually tolerant of delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
regulatory creation information is low.
C.2.2.4 Rule Publication Information Type

Rule Publication includes all activities associated with the publication of a proposed or final rule
in the Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations. Subject to exception conditions
described below, the recommended security categorization for the rule publication information
type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of rule publication
information on the ability of responsible agencies to publish proposed or final rules in the
Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations. The published rules are, by definition, public
information.

The effects of loss of confidentiality of information associated with the rule publication process
are unlikely to pose the threat of serious harm to agency assets, personnel or operations.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: In general, the provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for rule publication information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

In the worst cases, errata can be published. Unauthorized modification or destruction of
information may result in unnecessary expenditures, some confusion, and limited damage to
public confidence in the agency.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for rule
publication information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the rule publication information.

Rule publication processes are usually tolerant of delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
rule publication information is low.
