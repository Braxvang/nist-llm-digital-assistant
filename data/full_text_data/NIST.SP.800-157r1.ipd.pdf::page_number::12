      NIST SP 800-157r1 ipd                            Derived PIV Credentials (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


266   achieving substantial cost savings by leveraging the identity proofing results that were
267   already performed to issue PIV Cards. This document provides technical guidelines for
268   the implementation of derived PIV credentials.

269   1.2. Purpose and Scope
270   This document provides guidelines for cases in which the use of PIV Cards is deemed
271   impractical for authentication. This guideline specifies the use of authenticators with
272   alternative form factors to the PIV Card that may be inserted into endpoints, such as USB
273   authenticators, authenticators that are connected wirelessly to endpoints, or authenticators
274   that are embedded in endpoints. Authenticators used as derived PIV credentials must
275   meet the requirements for either hardware or software cryptographic authenticators. The
276   use of alternative form factors greatly improves the usability of electronic authentication
277   to remote IT resources while simultaneously maintaining the goals of HSPD-12 for
278   common identification that is secure, reliable, and has government-wide interoperability.
279   The purpose of the derived PIV credential is to provide PIV-enabled authentication
280   services on alternative endpoints in order to authenticate the credential holder to remote
281   systems.
282   To achieve interoperability with the PIV infrastructure and its applications, two
283   approaches to derived PIV credentials have been selected:
284      1. Use of public key infrastructure (PKI) technology. PKI-based derived PIV
285         credentials rely on the same infrastructure as that used for authentication with a
286         PIV Card.
287      2. Use of non-PKI-based authenticators. When non-PKI-based authenticators are used,
288         derived PIV credentials are only used to authenticate with the home agency of the
289         associated PIV Card. Interoperability with other agencies is achieved through the
290         use of federation protocols, as specified in [SP800-217].
291   The derived PIV credentials specified in this document are issued at authentication
292   assurance level (AAL) 2 or 3.
293   Derived PIV credentials are based on the general concept of post-enrollment authenticator
294   binding in [SP800-63B], which leverages identity proofing and vetting associated with
295   an existing subscriber account using current and valid authenticators to bind additional
296   authenticators to that account. Identity proofing and vetting processes do not have to be
297   repeated to issue a derived PIV credential. Instead, the user proves possession and control
298   of a valid PIV Card to bind a derived PIV credential to their PIV identity account. While
299   the PIV Card may be used as the basis for issuing other types of derived credentials, the
300   issuance of these other credentials is outside of the scope of this document.
301   Derived PIV credentials are:
302       â€¢ Issued based on possession and control of the PIV Card,
