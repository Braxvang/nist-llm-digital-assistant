GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



that many people share are generally not considered PII. Examples include age, gender, city of residence,
religious affiliation, and medical conditions.

Sometimes multiple pieces of information, none of which alone is considered PII, might still uniquely
identify a person when combined. For example, NIST may employ only one 39-year old female with a
residence in Roanoke, Virginia. In this case, the employer, age, gender, and city of residence are not PII
elements by themselves, but become PII when they are presented together. This scenario is an example of
PII established through indirect inference, while data elements such as a driver’s license number
constitute PII through direct inference.

As a general rule, privacy laws govern the management of PII inferred through both direct and indirect
means. The same laws, however, usually do not address data elements that individuals perceive as
personal information but do not meet the criteria of PII as defined by the E-Government Act of 2002. For
example, people anonymously walking down the street may perceive a loss of privacy if someone with a
reader can ascertain the books they are reading or the medicine they are taking, but not their identities, by
remotely scanning various tagged items in a bag, purse or on one’s person. In this case, the individuals
remain anonymous but may perceive a compromise of privacy because they do not have control over the
personal information they reveal to others. To address these concerns, organizations implementing RFID
systems may choose to mitigate the risk associated with these scenarios. In these cases, the range of
privacy considerations is not limited to those required by law.

6.2   The Applicability of Privacy Considerations to RFID Systems

RFID systems support a large variety of business processes, not all of which involve personal privacy.
Examples of RFID systems that likely do not have privacy considerations include those supporting
industrial processes, animal tracking, and asset management systems in which the assets are never
associated with individuals during their life cycle. Privacy considerations exist when the system uses,
collects, stores, or discloses personal information. An RFID system might use or disclose personal
information in one of several ways:

 Personal information such as a name or account number may be stored on the tag or in a database in
  the enterprise subsystem.
 A tag may be associated with a personal item such as a blood sample, a bottle of prescription
  medicine, or a folder of legal documents that might be outside of the individual’s possession.
 A tag may be associated with an item that often travels with an individual, such as a tagged box or a
  vehicle part in an automobile or truck the individual often drives.
The RFID system does not have to store personal information to have privacy implications. For example,
the tag on a bottle of prescription medicine may identify the drug in the bottle, but not the identity of the
person for whom the prescription was written. Nonetheless, the individual taking the medicine may still
perceive the possession of the drug as personal information if scanned and read by another, as it might
reveal information about a medical condition that the individual considers private.

Similarly, the individual does not have to own a tagged item for the RFID system to have privacy
implications. For example, if an employee carries an employer-tagged computer or tools, then RFID
technology potentially could be used to track the employee’s whereabouts. The employee may agree to
be on-call after business hours but could consider his or her location during those times as personal
information.
