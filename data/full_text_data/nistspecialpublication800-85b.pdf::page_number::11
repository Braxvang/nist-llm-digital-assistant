2.      Conformance Test Overview

The conformance testing guidelines in this document applies to the testing of a PIV data model.
The data model requirements are extracted from FIPS201, SP80073, SP80076, and SP80078. This
overview section provides a high level conformance test architecture for testing the PIV data
model. The conformance test architecture is confined to the end result of a personalized PIV
card. In other words, the conformance test approach views the card issuance system as a “black
box,” meaning that the interface of that system is opaque and its implementation details are not
relevant to the testing. The PIV data model testing operates under the assumption that the PIV
card being tested has already been personalized as described in Sections 2.3 and 5.3 of FIPS201.
The following sections provide the details of data model testing, test architecture, test
methodology, and test areas.


2.1     Test Architecture
The conceptual architecture for data model testing is shown in Figure 1. The conformance test in
this document applies to the area highlighted with dashed lines. SP80085A addresses the writing
and extracting of data from the card and subsequently, those processes are not addressed in this
document.

The PIV data model defines the logical use of the on-card application space including the
SP80073 required data objects and data elements along with the size and structure of each object.
