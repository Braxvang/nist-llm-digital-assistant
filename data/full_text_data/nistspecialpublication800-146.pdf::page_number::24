                                                               CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



            investment; however, the resources available to such a configuration will be limited to the
            previously-surplus resources in the organization's infrastructure (unless the former uses of the
            hardware are reduced in favor of the cloud). Additional limitations are that: (1) hardware
            resources must be incorporated into the on-site private cloud from wherever they exist in a
            consumer organization's infrastructure (via networking) rather than being co-located for
            efficiency, and (2) the available hardware may not be homogeneous and thus may be somewhat
            more difficult to administer.

ÔÅÆ Limited resources (on-site-private). An on-site private cloud, at any specific time, has a fixed
  computing and storage capacity that has been sized to correspond to anticipated workloads and cost
  restrictions. If an organization is large enough and supports a sufficient diversity of workloads, an
  on-site private cloud may be able to provide elasticity to clients within the consumer organization.
  Smaller on-site private clouds will, however, exhibit maximum capacity limits similar to those of
  traditional data centers. An on-site private cloud also requires that some costs, e.g., for equipment, be
  paid up-front.
4.3       The Outsourced Private Cloud Scenario

Figure 4 depicts an outsourced private cloud. As shown in the figure, an outsourced private cloud has two
security perimeters, one implemented by a cloud consumer (on the right) and one implemented by a
provider 10 (left). The two security perimeters are joined by a protected communications link. As is
apparent from the figure, the security of data and processing conducted in the outsourced private cloud
depends on the strength and availability of both security perimeters and of the protected communication
link. The provider thus accepts a responsibility to enforce the provider-implemented security perimeter
and to prevent mingling of private cloud resources with other cloud resources that are outside the
provider-controlled security perimeter. The suitability of various mechanisms for achieving an
appropriate strength of separation between private cloud resources and other cloud resources depends on
the consumer's security requirements. A number of possible mechanisms could be used with various
tradeoffs between separation strength and cost/convenience (e.g., Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN),
VPN, separate network segments or clusters). This scenario, however, should, not merely employ
separation mechanisms that are identical to the normal mechanisms (e.g., hardware virtualization,
VLANs) that separate customers in a public cloud. If those mechanisms alone were used, this scenario
would essentially become the public cloud scenario.
