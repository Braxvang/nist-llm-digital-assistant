                         Table 17. Physical vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions

            Vulnerability                                                Description
  Unauthorized personnel have           Physical access to OT equipment should be restricted to only the
  physical access to equipment          necessary personnel while taking safety requirements into account, such as
                                        emergency shutdown or restarts. Improper access to OT equipment can
                                        lead to any of the following:
                                        • Physical theft of data and hardware
                                        • Physical damage to or destruction of data and hardware
                                        • Modification of the operational process
                                        • Unauthorized changes to the functional environment (e.g., data
                                             connections, unauthorized use of removable media, adding/removing
                                             resources)
                                        • Disconnection of physical data links
                                        • Undetectable interception of data (e.g., keystroke and other input
                                             logging)
  Radio frequency, electromagnetic      Some hardware used for OT systems is vulnerable to radio frequency,
  pulse (EMP), static discharge,        electromagnetic pulses (EMP), static discharge, brownouts, and voltage
  brownouts, and voltage spikes         spikes. The impacts can range from the temporary disruption of command
                                        and control to permanent damage to circuit boards. Proper shielding,
                                        grounding, power conditioning, and/or surge suppression is recommended.
  Lack of backup power                  Without backup power to critical assets, a general loss of power will shut
                                        down the OT and could create an unsafe situation. Loss of power could
                                        also lead to insecure default settings. If the program file or data is stored in
                                        volatile memory, the process may not be able to restart after a power
                                        outage without appropriate backup power.
  Loss of environmental control         The loss of environmental control (e.g., temperatures, humidity) could
                                        lead to equipment damage, such as processors overheating. Some
                                        processors will shut down to protect themselves. Others may continue to
                                        operate in a minimal capacity and produce intermittent errors, continually
                                        reboot, or become permanently inoperable.
  Unsecured physical ports              Unsecured universal serial bus (USB) and PS/2 ports could allow
                                        unauthorized connection of thumb drives or keystroke loggers.

           Vulnerability                                                 Description
  Improper data validation              OT software may not properly validate user inputs or received data to
                                        ensure validity. Invalid data may result in numerous vulnerabilities,
                                        including buffer overflows, command injections, cross-site scripting, and
                                        path traversals.
  Installed security capabilities are   Security capabilities that were installed with the product are useless if they
  not enabled by default                are not enabled or at least identified as being disabled.
  Inadequate authentication,            Unauthorized access to configuration and programming software could
