CHAPTER TWO

THE FUNDAMENTALS
BASIC CONCEPTS ASSOCIATED WITH RISK MANAGEMENT




T      his chapter describes the fundamental concepts associated with managing information
       security risk across an organization including: (i) the components of risk management; (ii)
       the multitiered risk management approach; (iii) risk management at Tier 1 (organization
level); (iv) risk management at Tier 2 (mission/business process level); (v) risk management at
Tier 3 (information system level); (vi) risk related to trust and trustworthiness; (vii) the effects of
organizational culture on risk; and (viii) the relationships among key risk management concepts.

2.1 COMPONENTS OF RISK MANAGEMENT
Managing risk is a complex, multifaceted activity that requires the involvement of the entire
organization—from senior leaders/executives providing the strategic vision and top-level goals
and objectives for the organization; to mid-level leaders planning, executing, and managing
projects; to individuals on the front lines operating the information systems supporting the
organization’s missions/business functions. Risk management is a comprehensive process that
requires organizations to: (i) frame risk (i.e., establish the context for risk-based decisions); (ii)
assess risk; (iii) respond to risk once determined; and (iv) monitor risk on an ongoing basis using
effective organizational communications and a feedback loop for continuous improvement in the
risk-related activities of organizations. Risk management is carried out as a holistic, organization-
wide activity that addresses risk from the strategic level to the tactical level, ensuring that risk-
based decision making is integrated into every aspect of the organization.13 The following
sections briefly describe each of the four risk management components.

The first component of risk management addresses how organizations frame risk or establish a
risk context—that is, describing the environment in which risk-based decisions are made. The
purpose of the risk framing component is to produce a risk management strategy that addresses
how organizations intend to assess risk, respond to risk, and monitor risk—making explicit and
transparent the risk perceptions that organizations routinely use in making both investment and
operational decisions. The risk frame establishes a foundation for managing risk and delineates
the boundaries for risk-based decisions within organizations. Establishing a realistic and credible
risk frame requires that organizations identify: (i) risk assumptions (e.g., assumptions about the
threats, vulnerabilities, consequences/impact, and likelihood of occurrence that affect how risk is
assessed, responded to, and monitored over time); (ii) risk constraints (e.g., constraints on the risk
assessment, response, and monitoring alternatives under consideration); (iii) risk tolerance (e.g.,
levels of risk, types of risk, and degree of risk uncertainty that are acceptable); and (iv) priorities
and trade-offs (e.g., the relative importance of missions/business functions, trade-offs among
different types of risk that organizations face, time frames in which organizations must address
risk, and any factors of uncertainty that organizations consider in risk responses). The risk
framing component and the associated risk management strategy also include any strategic-level
decisions on how risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations,
and the Nation, is to be managed by senior leaders/executives.

   Integrated, enterprise-wide risk management includes, for example, consideration of: (i) the strategic goals/objectives
of organizations; (ii) organizational missions/business functions prioritized as needed; (iii) mission/business processes;
(iv) enterprise and information security architectures; and (v) system development life cycle processes.
