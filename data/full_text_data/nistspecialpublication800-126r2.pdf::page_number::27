                The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2


                           Table 14 - Use of Dublin Core Terms in <xccdf:metadata>

Dublin Core Term        Description of Use
<dc:creator>            The person, organization, and/or service that created the benchmark
<dc:publisher>          The person, organization, and/or service that published the benchmark
<dc:contributor>        The person, organization, and/or service that contributed to the creation of the benchmark
<dc:source>             An identifier that indicates the organizational context of the benchmark’s @id attribute. An
                        organizationally specific URI SHOULD be used.

3.2.3   The <xccdf:Profile> Element
As stated in the XCCDF specification, the use of an <xccdf:Profile> element is not required. SCAP
content commonly includes <xccdf:Profile> elements, so people tend to assume that they are
required, but they are optional.
Use of the <xccdf:set-complex-value> element within the <xccdf:Profile> element
SHALL NOT be allowed.

3.2.4   The <xccdf:Rule> Element
The following requirements and recommendations apply to the <xccdf:Rule> element. The topics
they address are <xccdf:ident> elements, <xccdf:check> elements, patches up-to-date rules, and
CVSS and CCSS scores.

3.2.4.1 The <xccdf:ident> Element
Each <xccdf:Rule> element SHALL include an <xccdf:ident> element containing a CVE, CCE,
or CPE identifier reference if an appropriate identifier exists. The meaning of the identifier MUST be
consistent with the recommendation implemented by the <xccdf:Rule> element. If the rule references
an OVAL Definition, then <xccdf:ident> element content SHALL match the corresponding CVE,
CCE, or CPE identifier found in the associated OVAL Definition(s) if an appropriate identifier exists and
if that OVAL Definition is the only input to the rule’s final result.
When referencing a CVE, CCE, or CPE identifier, an <xccdf:Rule> element MUST have a purpose
consistent with one of the rows in Table 15. Based on the purpose of the <xccdf:Rule> element, the
<xccdf:Rule> SHALL define its <xccdf:ident> element’s @system attribute using the
corresponding value from Table 15. Also, if the <xccdf:Rule> element references an OVAL
Definition, it SHALL reference an OVAL Definition of the specified class.
                          Table 15 – <xccdf:Rule> and <xccdf:ident> Element Values

   Purpose of the <xccdf:Rule>                       OVAL Definition      Identifier   Value for <xccdf:ident>
                                                     Class                Type         @system attribute

Here is a partial example of a rule intended to check compliance with a configuration setting:
<xccdf:Rule id="xccdf_gov.nist.fdcc.xp_value_AuditAccountLogonEvents">
    …
    <xccdf:ident system="http://cce.mitre.org">CCE-3867-0</xccdf:ident>
    …
</xccdf:Rule>
