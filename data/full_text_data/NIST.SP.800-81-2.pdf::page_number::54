                   Table 8-1. BIND Access Control Statement Syntax for DNS Transactions

              Access Control Statement Syntax                            DNS Transaction
     allow-query { address_match_list }                     DNS Query/Response
     allow-recursion { address_match_list }                 Recursive Query
     allow-transfer { address_match_list }                  Zone Transfer
     allow-update { address_match_list }                    Dynamic Update
     allow-update-forwarding { address_match_list }         Dynamic Update
     allow-notify { address_match_list }                    DNS NOTIFY
     blackhole { address_match_list }                       Blacklisted Hosts


The purpose of each of these access control statements is as follows:

    •   allow-query: specifies the list of hosts allowed to query the name server as a whole or a
        particular zone within the name server

    •   allow-recursion: specifies the list of hosts allowed to submit recursive queries to the name server
        as a whole or to a particular zone served by the name server

    •   allow-transfer: specifies the list of hosts allowed to initiate zone transfer requests to the name
        server as a whole or to a particular zone within the name server. This statement is predominantly
        required for configuration of master name servers.

    •   allow-update: specifies the list of hosts allowed to initiate dynamic update requests

    •   allow-update-forwarding: specifies the list of hosts allowed to forward dynamic update requests
        (regardless of the originator of the requests)

    •   allow-notify: specifies the list of hosts from which to accept DNS NOTIFY messages indicating
        changes in the zone file. This list is relevant only for configuration of secondary slave name
        servers.

    •   blackhole: specifies the list of hosts that are blacklisted (barred) from initiating any transaction
        with this name server. Used only in an “options” server wide ACL statement.
The foregoing access control statements are, in fact, substatements that can be used in the context of
options and zone statements in the BIND 9.x configuration file (with the exception of blackhole). When
they are used within the zone statement, they specify access control restrictions for the corresponding
DNS transaction for that specific zone. When they are used as part of the options statement, they specify
access control restrictions for the corresponding DNS transaction for the name server as a whole (because
a name server could host multiple zones).

NSD has a similar set of configuration options for certain transactions. NSD has a more limited sets of
options and currently only restrict zone transfers. In the following sections, if a comparable set of options
exists for NSD, they will be listed. Otherwise it should be noted that a comparable option does not exist
at the time of writing.
