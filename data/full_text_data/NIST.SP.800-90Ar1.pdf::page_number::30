NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                            Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                   Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


to produce a new seed that is determined by both the old seed and newly obtained entropy input
that will support the desired security strength.
An alternative to reseeding would be to create an entirely new instantiation. However, reseeding
is preferred over creating a new instantiation. If a DRBG instantiation was initially seeded with
sufficient entropy, and the randomness source subsequently fails without being detected, then a
new instantiation using the same (failed) source would not have sufficient entropy to operate
securely. However, if there is an undetected failure in the randomness source of an already
properly seeded DRBG instantiation, the DRBG instantiation will still retain any previous
entropy when the reseed operation fails to introduce new entropy.
8.6.9       Seed Use

The seed that is used to initialize one instantiation of a DRBG shall not be intentionally used to
reseed the same instantiation or used as the seed for another DRBG instantiation. In addition, a
DRBG instantiation shall not reseed itself. Note that a DRBG does not provide output until a
seed is available, and the internal state has been initialized (see Section 10).
8.6.10      Entropy Input and Seed Separation

The seed used by a DRBG and the entropy input used to create that seed shall not intentionally
be used for other purposes (e.g., domain parameter or prime number generation).

8.7      Other Input to the DRBG Mechanism

Other input may be provided during DRBG instantiation, generation and reseeding. This input
may contain entropy, but this is not required. During instantiation, a personalization string may
be provided and combined with entropy input and a nonce to derive a seed (see Section 8.6.1).
When pseudorandom bits are requested and when reseeding is performed, additional input may
be provided (see Section 8.7.2).
Depending on the method for acquiring the input, the exact value of the input may or may not be
known to the user or consuming application. For example, the input could be derived directly
from values entered by the user or consuming application, or the input could be derived from
information introduced by the user or consuming application (e.g., from timing statistics based
on key strokes), or the input could be the output of another RBG.
8.7.1       Personalization String

A personalization string is an optional (but recommended) input to the instantiate function and is
used to derive the seed (see Section 8.6.1). The personalization string may be obtained from
inside or outside a cryptographic module, and may be an empty string. Note that a DRBG does
not rely on a personalization string to provide entropy, even though entropy could be provided in
the personalization string, and knowledge of the personalization string by an adversary does not
degrade the security strength of a DRBG instantiation, as long as the entropy input is unknown.
When used within a cryptographic module, a personalization string is not considered to be a
critical security parameter.
