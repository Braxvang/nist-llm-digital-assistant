       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                                 Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1535   users are as prepared as possible for their enrollment sessions is critical to the overall
1536   success and usability of the enrollment and identity proofing process.
1537   Such preparation is only possible if users receive the necessary information (e.g., required
1538   documentation) in a usable format in an appropriate timeframe. This includes making
1539   users aware of exactly what identity evidence will be required. Users do not need to know
1540   anything about IALs or whether the identity evidence required is scored as “fair,” “strong,”
1541   or “superior,” whereas organizations need to know what IAL is required for access to a
1542   particular system.
1543   To ensure users are equipped to make informed decisions about whether to proceed with
1544   the enrollment process, and what will be needed for their session, provide users:
1545       • Information about the entire process, such as what to expect in each step.
1546            – Clear explanations of the expected timeframes to allow users to plan
1547              accordingly.
1548       • Explanation of the need for — and benefits of — identity proofing to allow users to
1549         understand the value proposition.
1550       • Information on the monetary amount and acceptable forms of payment, and if
1551         there is an enrollment fee. Offering a larger variety of acceptable forms of payment
1552         allows users to choose their preferred payment operation.
1553       • Information on whether the user’s enrollment session will be in-person or in-person
1554         over remote channels, and whether a user can choose. Only provide information
1555         relevant to the allowable session option(s).
1556            – Information on the location(s), whether a user can choose their preferred
1557              location, and necessary logistical information for in-person or in-person over
1558              remote channels session. Note that users may be reluctant to bring identity
1559              evidence to certain public places (bank versus supermarket), as it increases
1560              exposure to loss or theft.
1561            – Information on the technical requirements (e.g., requirements for internet
1562              access) for remote sessions.
1563            – An option to set an appointment for in-person or in-person over remote
1564              channels identity proofing sessions to minimize wait times. If walk-ins are
1565              allowed, make it clear to users that their wait times may be greater without an
1566              appointment.
1567                 * Provide clear instructions for setting up an enrollment session
1568                   appointment, reminders, and how to reschedule existing appointments.
1569                 * Offer appointment reminders and allow users to specify their preferred
1570                   appointment reminder format(s) (e.g., postal mail, voicemail, email, text
1571                   message). Users need information such as date, time, location, and a
1572                   description of required identity evidence.
