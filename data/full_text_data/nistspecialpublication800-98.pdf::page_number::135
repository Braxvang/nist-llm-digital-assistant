Appendix B—Glossary

Selected terms used in Guidelines for Securing Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Systems are
defined below.

Active Tag: A tag that relies on a battery for power.

Analytic Systems: IT systems that process the information outputs produced by middleware. Analytic
systems may be comprised of databases, data processing software, and Web services.

Authenticated RFID: The use of digital signature technology to provide evidence of the authenticity of a
tag and possibly chain of custody events.

Back Channel: The channel on which a tag transmits its signals.

Backscatter Channel: The type of back channel used by passive tags. Since passive tags do not have a
local power source, they communicate by reflecting or backscattering electromagnetic signals received
from a reader.

Cloned Tag: A tag that is made to be a duplicate of a legitimate tag. A cloned tag can be created by
reading data such as an identifier from a legitimate tag and writing that data to a different tag.

Closed System: A system that is self-contained within an enterprise. Closed systems do not have an
inter-enterprise subsystem.

Cover-Coding: A technique to reduce the risks of eavesdropping by obscuring the information that is
transmitted. The EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 and ISO/IEC 18000-6C standards use cover-coding to
obscure certain transmissions from readers to tags. A more detailed description of how cover-coding is
used in these two standards can be found in Section 5.3.2.1 on cover-coding.

Duty Cycle: The percentage of time that a device is operating over a specified period. For example, a
reader that is emitting energy to communicate with tags for 15 seconds every minute has a duty cycle of
25%.

Eavesdropper: A party that secretly receives communications intended for others.

Electronic Product Code (EPC) Identifier: One of the available formats for encoding identifiers on
RFID tags. The EPC is a globally unique number that identifies a specific item in the supply chain. This
number may be used to identify a container, pallet, case or individual unit.

Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS): An inter-enterprise subsystem that facilitates
information sharing using the EPCglobal network. EPCISs provide information services necessary for
the storage, communication and dissemination of EPC data in a secure environment.

Enterprise Subsystem: The portion of the RFID system that analyzes, processes, and stores information
collected by the RF subsystem. The primary role of the enterprise subsystem is to make the data collected
by the RF subsystem useful for a supporting business process. An enterprise subsystem is made up of
middleware, analytic systems, and network infrastructure.

Form Factor: The physical characteristics of a device or object including its size, shape, packaging,
handling, and weight.
