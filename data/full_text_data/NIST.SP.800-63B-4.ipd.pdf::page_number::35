      NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                        Authentication and Lifecycle Management


916   5.1.3.3. Authentication using the Public Switched Telephone Network
917   Use of the PSTN for out-of-band verification is restricted as described in this section
918   and in Sec. 5.2.10. If out-of-band verification is to be made using the PSTN, the verifier
919    SHALL verify that the pre-registered telephone number being used is associated with a
920   specific physical device. Changing the pre-registered telephone number is considered to
921   be the binding of a new authenticator and SHALL only occur as described in Sec. 6.1.2.
922   Use of the PSTN to deliver out-of-band authentication secrets is potentially not available
923   to some subscribers in areas with limited telephone coverage (particularly in areas
924   without mobile phone service). Accordingly, verifiers SHALL ensure that alternative
925   authenticator types are available to all subscribers and SHOULD remind subscribers of
926   this limitation of PSTN out-of-band authenticators prior to binding.
927   Verifiers SHOULD consider risk indicators such as device swap, SIM change, number
928   porting, or other abnormal behavior before using the PSTN to deliver an out-of-band
929   authentication secret.
930         NOTE: Consistent with the restriction of authenticators in Sec. 5.2.10, NIST
931         may adjust the restricted status of the PSTN over time based on the evolution
932         of the threat landscape and the technical operation of the PSTN.

933   5.1.3.4. Multi-Factor Out-of-Band Authenticators
934   Multi-factor out-of-band authenticators operate in a similar manner to single-factor out-
935   of-band authenticators (see Sec. 5.1.3.1) except that they require the presentation and
936   verification of an additional factor, either a memorized secret or a biometric characteristic,
937   prior to allowing the claimant to complete the authentication transaction (i.e., prior to
938   accessing the authentication secret, entering the authentication secret, or confirming
939   the transaction as appropriate for the authentication flow being used). Each use of the
940   authenticator SHALL require the presentation of the activation factor.
941   The use of an activation secret by the authenticator SHALL meet the requirements of
942   Sec. 5.2.11. A biometric activation factor SHALL meet the requirements of Sec. 5.2.3,
943   including limits on the number of consecutive authentication failures. Submission of the
944   activation factor SHALL be a separate operation from unlocking of the host device (e.g.,
945   smartphone), although the same activation factor used to unlock the host device MAY
946   be used in the authentication operation. The memorized secret or biometric sample used
947   for activation — and any biometric data derived from the biometric sample such as a
948   probe produced through signal processing — SHALL be zeroized immediately after the
949   authentication operation.

950   5.1.4. Single-Factor OTP Device
951   A single-factor OTP device generates one-time passwords (OTPs). This category includes
952   hardware devices and software-based OTP generators installed on devices such as mobile
