Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of substance control
information on the ability of responsible agencies to enforce legal substances (i.e., alcohol and
tobacco) and illegal narcotics laws including trafficking, possession, sale, distribution, and other
related activities. Unauthorized disclosure of a significant proportion of substance control
information can compromise investigations, cause apprehension operations to fail, and
compromise prosecutions. This can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations and place
the agency at a significant disadvantage.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some
routine substance control information is unlikely to have more than a limited adverse effect on
agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. The confidentiality impact associated with
such information is low.

Where the unauthorized disclosure of information exposes sensitive information sources or
compromises investigative or interdiction operations, the consequences of unauthorized
disclosure of substance control information may have a serious adverse effect on agency
operations, significantly degrade mission capability, and/or pose a threat to human life. Where
unauthorized disclosure endangers investigations in process, investigative or intelligence
information sources, or information regarding witnesses or other critical case file elements, the
danger to human life and key agency missions can be significant. Where unauthorized disclosure
endangers witnesses or law enforcement officers, the impact level must be rated as high.

Other factors affecting confidentiality impacts associated with substance control information are
discussed under Section D.16.1 (Criminal Apprehension) and Section D.16.2 (Criminal
Investigation and Surveillance).

Some substance control information is classified (e.g., some intelligence-derived information).
Classified information and other national security information are outside the scope of this
guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most substance control information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The amount of
money available to perpetrators significantly increases the insider threat. The consequences of
unauthorized modification or destruction of information can be serious if the information is
critical to tactical operations i.e., is time-critical. Unauthorized modification or destruction of
information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely
affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to most missions would
usually be limited

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or
destruction of information (particularly time-critical information) affecting internal
