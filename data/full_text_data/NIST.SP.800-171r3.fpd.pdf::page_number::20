      NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                      Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
      November 2023

125      The Requirements
126   This section describes 17 families of security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of
127   CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations. When used in the context of the requirements in
128   Section 3, the term system is narrowed to only include nonfederal systems or system components
129   that process, store, or transmit CUI or that provide protection for such systems or components.
130   Not all security requirements mention CUI explicitly. However, the requirements are included
131   because they directly affect the protection of CUI during processing, while in storage, and when
132   in transmission between different locations.

133   Some systems, including specialized systems (e.g., industrial/process control systems, medical
134   devices, computer numerical control machines), may have limitations on the application of
135   certain security requirements. To accommodate such issues, the system security plan — as
136   reflected in requirement 03.15.02 — is used to describe any enduring exceptions to the security
137   requirements. Individual, isolated, or temporary deficiencies are managed though organizational
138   plans of action and milestones, as reflected in requirement 03.12.02.

140   3.1.1. Account Management
141           REQUIREMENT: 03.01.01
142           a. Define the types of system accounts allowed and prohibited.
143           b. Create, enable, modify, disable, and remove system accounts in accordance with
144              organizational policy, procedures, prerequisites, and criteria.
145           c.   Specify authorized users of the system, group and role membership, and access
146                authorizations (i.e., privileges).
147           d. Authorize access to the system based on a valid access authorization and intended system
148              usage.
149           e. Monitor the use of system accounts.
150           f.   Disable system accounts when:
151                1. The accounts have expired;
152                2. The accounts have been inactive for [Assignment: organization-defined time period];
153                3. The accounts are no longer associated with a user or individual;
154                4. The accounts are in violation of organizational policy; or
155                5. Significant risks associated with individuals are discovered.
156           g. Notify organizational personnel or roles when:
157                1. Accounts are no longer required;
158                2. Users are terminated or transferred; and
159                3. System usage or need-to-know changes for an individual.
