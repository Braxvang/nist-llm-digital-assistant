   OT Cybersecurity Program Development
To mitigate cybersecurity risks to their OT systems, organizations need to develop and deploy an
OT cybersecurity program. It should be consistent and integrated with existing IT cybersecurity
programs and practices but also account for the specific requirements and characteristics of OT
systems and environments. Organizations should regularly review and update their OT
cybersecurity plans and programs to reflect changes in technologies, operations, standards,
regulations, and the security needs of specific facilities.
Effective integration of cybersecurity into the operation of OT requires defining and executing a
comprehensive program that addresses all aspects of cybersecurity. This includes defining the
objectives and scope of the program; establishing a cross-functional team that understands OT
and cybersecurity; establishing policies and procedures; identifying cyber risk management
capabilities that include people, processes, and technologies; and identifying day-to-day
operations of event monitoring and auditing for compliance and improvement.
When a new system is being designed and installed, it is imperative to take the time to address
security throughout the life cycle, including architecture, procurement, installation, maintenance,
and decommissioning. Deploying systems to the field based on the assumption that these systems
will be secured later introduces significant risks to the systems and the organization. If there are
not enough time and resources to properly secure the system before deployment, it is unlikely
that security will be addressed at a later time. Since new OT systems are designed and deployed
less frequently than IT systems, it is much more common to improve, expand, or update an
existing OT system than to design a new one.
This section introduces the basic process for developing an OT cybersecurity program and
applies to new and deployed OT systems. Additional guidance for developing the specific
elements of an OT cybersecurity program can be found in Section 3.3.10.

       Establish a Charter for the OT Cybersecurity Program
Senior management must demonstrate a clear commitment to cybersecurity and communicate its
importance throughout the organization. Cybersecurity is a business responsibility shared by all
members of the organization, especially by its leaders and IT and OT teams. Commitment to
cybersecurity can be demonstrated by establishing a charter for a cybersecurity program with
adequate funding, visibility, governance, and support from senior leaders. A cybersecurity
program that has commitment from senior management is more likely to achieve the mission and
business goals of the organization.
A charter for a cybersecurity program is a plain-language high-level description that establishes
clear ownership and accountability for protecting OT resources and provides a mandate for the
most senior person responsible to establish and maintain the cybersecurity program (e.g., CISO).
This section focuses on an OT-specific program, which should be integrated with the
organizationâ€™s overall cybersecurity program.
A cybersecurity program charter should include program objectives, scope, and responsibilities.
Senior management establishes the OT cybersecurity program charter and identifies an OT
cybersecurity manager with appropriate authority to lead the OT cybersecurity program. The OT
cybersecurity manager should define the roles and responsibilities of system owners, mission and
business process managers, and users. The OT cybersecurity manager should also document the
