            Continuous monitoring can be achieved using automated tools, through
            passive scanning, or with manual monitoring performed at a frequency
            deemed commensurate with the risk. For example, a risk assessment may
            determine that the logs from isolated (i.e., non-networked), non-critical
            devices should be reviewed monthly by OT personnel to determine
            whether anomalous behavior is occurring. Alternatively, a passive
            network monitor might be able to detect vulnerable network services
            without having to scan the devices.
            When organizations implement a sampling methodology, the criticality
            of the components should be considered. For example, the sampling
            methodology should not inadvertently exclude higher risk devices, such
            as Layer 3 or Layer 4 firewalls.
            When using third parties to continuously monitor security controls,
            ensure that the personnel involved have the appropriate skillset to
            analyze OT environments.

6.3.2.1.       Network Monitoring (DE.CM-1)
Network monitoring involves organizations reviewing alerts and logs and analyzing them for
signs of possible cybersecurity incidents. Organizations should consider automation – including
in-house developed, commercially available solutions or some combination of tools – to assist
with monitoring efforts. Tools and capabilities that support behavior anomaly detection (BAD),
security information and event management (SIEM), intrusion detection systems (IDS), and
intrusion prevention systems (IPS) can assist organizations with monitoring traffic throughout
the network and generate alarms when they identify anomalous or suspicious traffic. Some other
capabilities to consider for network monitoring include:
   •   Asset management, including discovering and inventorying devices connected to the
       network
   •   Baselining typical network traffic, data flows, and device-to-device communications
   •   Diagnosing network performance issues
   •   Identifying misconfigurations or malfunctions of networked devices
Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-94, Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)
   •   NIST IR 8219, Securing Manufacturing Industrial Control Systems: Behavioral Anomaly
       Detection
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Network monitoring can greatly enhance the ability to detect attacks
            entering or leaving the OT networks. It can also improve network
            efficiency by detecting non-essential traffic. OT cybersecurity personnel
            must be part of the diagnostic process of interpreting the alerts provided
            by network monitoring tools. Careful monitoring and an understanding
