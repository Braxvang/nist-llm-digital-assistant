       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines

1425   5.2.8. Replay Resistance
1426   An authentication process resists replay attacks if it is impractical to achieve a successful
1427   authentication by recording and replaying a previous authentication message. Replay
1428   resistance is in addition to the replay-resistant nature of authenticated protected channel
1429   protocols, since the output could be stolen prior to entry into the protected channel.
1430   Protocols that use nonces or challenges to prove the “freshness” of the transaction are
1431   resistant to replay attacks since the verifier will easily detect when old protocol messages
1432   are replayed since they will not contain the appropriate nonces or timeliness data.
1433   Examples of replay-resistant authenticators are OTP devices, cryptographic authenticators,
1434   and look-up secrets.
1435   In contrast, memorized secrets are not considered replay resistant because the
1436   authenticator output — the secret itself — is provided for each authentication.

1437   5.2.9. Authentication Intent
1438   An authentication process demonstrates intent if it requires the subject to explicitly
1439   respond to each authentication or reauthentication request. The goal of authentication
1440   intent is to make it more difficult for authenticators (e.g., multi-factor cryptographic
1441   devices) to be used without the subject’s knowledge, such as by malware on the endpoint.
1442   Authentication intent SHALL be established by the authenticator itself, although multi-
1443   factor cryptographic devices MAY establish intent by reentry of the activation factor for
1444   the authenticator.
1445   Authentication intent MAY be established in a number of ways. Authentication processes
1446   that require the subject’s intervention establish intent (e.g., a claimant entering an
1447   authenticator output from an OTP device). Cryptographic devices that require user action
1448   for each authentication or reauthentication operation also establish intent (e.g., pushing a
1449   button or reinsertion).
1450   Depending on the modality, presentation of a biometric characteristic may or may
1451   not establish authentication intent. Behavioral biometrics similarly may or may not
1452   establish authentication intent because they do not always require a specific action on
1453   the claimant’s part.

1454   5.2.10. Restricted Authenticators
1455   As threats evolve, authenticators’ capability to resist attacks typically degrades.
1456   Conversely, some authenticators’ performance may improve, for example, when changes
1457   to their underlying standards increases their ability to resist particular attacks.
1458   To account for these changes in authenticator performance, NIST places additional
1459   restrictions on authenticator types or specific classes or instantiations of an authenticator
1460   type.
