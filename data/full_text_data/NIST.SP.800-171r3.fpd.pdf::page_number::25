      NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                        Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
      November 2023

317           DISCUSSION
318           Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic system lockouts are, in most cases, temporary
319           and automatically release after a predetermined period established by the organization (i.e., using
320           a delay algorithm). Organizations may employ different delay algorithms for different system
321           components based on the capabilities of the respective components. Responses to unsuccessful
322           system logon attempts may be implemented at the system and application levels.

326   3.1.9. System Use Notification
327           REQUIREMENT: 03.01.09
328           Display a system use notification message with privacy and security notices consistent with
329           applicable CUI rules before granting access to the system.

330           DISCUSSION
331           System use notifications can be implemented using warning or banner messages. The messages
332           are displayed before individuals log in to the system. System use notifications are used for access
333           via logon interfaces with human users and are not required when human interfaces do not exist.
334           Organizations consider whether a secondary use notification is needed to access applications or
335           other system resources after the initial network logon. Posters or other printed materials may be
336           used in lieu of an automated system message. This requirement is related to 03.15.03.

340   3.1.10. Device Lock
341           REQUIREMENT: 03.01.10
342             a. Prevent access to the system by [Selection (one or more): initiating a device lock after
343                [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of inactivity; requiring the user to initiate a
344                device lock before leaving the system unattended].
345             b. Retain the device lock until the user reestablishes access using established identification
346                and authentication procedures.
347             c.   Conceal, via the device lock, information previously visible on the display with a publicly
348                  viewable image.

349             DISCUSSION
350             Device locks are temporary actions taken to prevent access to the system when users depart
351             from the immediate vicinity of the system but do not want to log out because of the temporary
352             nature of their absences. Device locks can be implemented at the operating system level or
353             application level. User-initiated device locking is behavior- or policy-based and requires users
354             to take physical action to initiate the device lock. Device locks are not an acceptable substitute
355             for logging out of the system, such as when organizations require users to log out at the end of
