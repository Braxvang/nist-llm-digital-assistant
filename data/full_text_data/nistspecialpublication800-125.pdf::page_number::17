2.4.2   Desktop Virtualization

One of the most common reasons for using desktop virtualization is to allow a user to run applications for
different OSs on a single host. Without virtualization, this would be accomplished by using multiple
devices, each with a different OS, or by configuring a single device to boot using multiple OSs and using
one OS (and application) at a time. Desktop virtualization allows users to access both OSs simultaneously
on one computer.

Another common use for desktop virtualization is allowing organizations to more tightly control the
environment of its users. The organization stores a known-good image that contains the OS and all the
applications needed for the user. The user loads this image using hosted virtualization and does all their
work within this image, not on the host OS, then exits the guest OS. Later the user restarts the guest OS,
causing any previous changes to the guest OS to be lost. The advantage of this quit-and-restart strategy is
that malicious changes that have been introduced to the OS or applications are erased by quitting.

With desktop virtualization, the user’s data is normally stored on the host or on the network; otherwise, it
would be lost each time the user quits from the virtualization system. This aspect of desktop virtualization
can be the most frustrating and complicated for users; it is quite easy to store new documents on what
appears to be the correct place, only to discover later that the document was lost because it was stored in
the wrong place. Some desktop virtualization systems have methods to deal with making sure that users’
data is correctly stored before quitting, but these programs are not foolproof. For example, many
Windows programs store valuable information in the Windows Registry, and such data is often hard to
find and back up correctly. Organizations should test the data backup facilities of any desktop
virtualization system they use for all software that the desktop users are expected to use.
