ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



The second step in the project plan was to bring together the major stakeholders to draft a WLAN use
policy and gather functional requirements for the WLAN solution. The stakeholder advisory panel agreed
that the WLAN would be for the use of employees and full-time on-site contractors only; other users
should be prevented from using the WLAN through the implementation of user authentication and
authorization technology. The panel also wanted users to be able to roam to any conference room in the
building without having to reconfigure their laptops or other wireless devices. Finally, the panel
requested that users be able to access all information resources available from their wired desktops,
including Internet access. The WLAN use policy also specified who is authorized to install APs (e.g. not
end users), as well as which techniques would be used to detect and handle rogue APs.

An attorney on the panel noted that the agency’s memorandum of understanding (MOU) with several
state governments explicitly prohibited the agency from using wireless networks to access sensitive
information that the state governments enter into a database system that the agency calls StateConnect. A
network engineer from the IT group had argued that this limitation was unnecessary because RSN
protections offered a better defense against eavesdropping and data modification than the agency’s wired
networks. Nevertheless, the panel eventually agreed that the MOUs would need to be honored regardless
of the assurance an RSN could provide. The solution would have to include technical controls to prevent
WLAN users from accessing any portion of the StateConnect database system. However, the panel
agreed that MOUs should be updated in the next revision cycle to account for advances in WLAN
security.

9.1.2   Phase 2: Acquisition/Development

With the WLAN use policy and a solid set of functional requirements in place, the IT staff started the
acquisition/development phase of the project. The first step was a site survey to help determine the
network architecture of the WLAN solution. All 20 conference rooms were located in the center of the
building, which meant the risk of radio emanations beyond the property’s perimeter was unlikely.
Testing established that installing one AP in each conference room would provide adequate coverage for
all except the two large conference rooms on the ground floor, which would require three APs to provide
adequate connectivity. Testing also confirmed that WLAN emissions would be contained within the
building. The resulting plan called for mounting the APs in the center of each conference room,
immediately above the ceiling tiles.

The design team wanted to segregate the APs from other network components to improve security and
manageability. Unfortunately, the conference rooms were too far apart from each other to connect all of
the APs to a dedicated WLAN hub or switch. Accordingly, in the network design, each AP was cabled to
the nearest available switch, which typically reside in communications closets near each conference room.
The switches were configured to place each port supporting an AP on a single enterprise VLAN. The
VLAN spanned the entire building and behaved as if all the APs were on a single local network segment,
thereby providing the desired isolation from the rest of the network. The VLAN was connected to the rest
of the agency’s network through a router. To prevent WLAN users from reaching the StateConnect
database, the plan specified an access control list (ACL) on the router that prohibited all traffic from any
device on the WLAN to any servers supporting the database and vice versa.

Everyone on the project team quickly agreed that RSN authentication should be based on IEEE 802.1X
port-based access control rather than pre-shared keys, primarily because the administrative burden of
managing pre-shared keys would likely overwhelm the IT support staff and the fact that PSK does not
always uniquely authenticate the end node. On the other hand, determining which EAP method to use
with IEEE 802.1X generated more debate. Several technicians wanted to implement the WLAN as
quickly and painlessly as possible. They wanted to use the wireless client support bundled with the
operating system common to all of the agency’s client computers. Then they argued that the logon
