NIST SP 800-219r1                                                                                     Automated Secure Configuration
July 2023                                                                                                  Guidance from the mSCP

        •    Generating a mapping between security standards, regulations, frameworks, etc.
        •    Producing human-readable documentation in a variety of formats
        •    Customizing existing baselines
mSCP content can also be used to generate Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)
content for automated security compliance scans. The SCAP generated follows the SCAP 1.3
specification [10]. The generation of SCAP content uses an Extensible Stylesheet Language
Transformations (XSLT) file to create an Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format
(XCCDF) checklist document with an accompanying Open Vulnerability and Assessment
Language (OVAL) document.
The XCCDF and OVAL documents are bundled into an SCAP data stream collection document
with accompanying files that include Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) dictionary [11]
information and an Open Checklist Interactive Language (OCIL) document. This creates an
SCAP 1.3 document that validates using the NIST SCAP Content Validation Tool 2 and can be
used by SCAP tools on macOS. More information on SCAP content generation is available at the
project wiki.
