GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



4.4.1    Implementation

Once a network-based IDPS product has been selected, the administrators need to design an architecture,
perform IDPS component testing, secure the IDPS components, and then deploy them. The following
items list additions to the material presented in Section 3.3.1:

 Architecture Design. A consideration specific to network-based IDPSs is where the sensors should
  be placed on the network, which includes deciding how many sensors are needed, which sensors
  should be inline and which should be passive, and how passive sensors should be connected to the
  network (e.g., IDS load balancer, network tap, switch spanning port).
 Component Testing and Deployment. Implementing a network-based IDPS can necessitate brief
  network outages, particularly when deploying inline sensors. However, passive sensor deployment
  can also cause outages for several reasons, including installation of network taps and IDS load
  balancers, and reconfiguration of switches to activate spanning port functions.
 Securing the IDPS Components. Administrators should ensure that for both passive and inline
  sensors, IP addresses are not assigned to the network interfaces used to monitor network traffic,
  except for network interfaces also used for IDPS management. Operating a sensor without IP
  addresses assigned to its monitoring interfaces is known as operating in stealth mode. Stealth mode
  improves the security of the IDPS sensors because it prevents other hosts from initiating connections
  to them. This conceals the sensors from attackers and thus limits their exposure to attacks. However,
  attackers may be able to identify the existence of an IDPS sensor and determine which product is in
  use by analyzing the characteristics of its prevention actions. Such analysis might include monitoring
  protected networks, and determining which scan patterns trigger particular responses and what values
  are set in certain packet header fields.
4.4.2    Operation and Maintenance

The operation and maintenance of network-based IDPSs is performed in the same manner as that
documented in the general information provided in Section 3.3.2.

4.5     Summary

A network-based IDPS monitors network traffic for particular network segments or devices and analyzes
network, transport, and application protocols to identify suspicious activity. Network-based IDPS
components are similar to other types of IDPS technologies, except for the sensors. A network-based
IDPS sensor monitors and analyzes network activity on one or more network segments. Sensors are
available in two formats: appliance-based sensors, which are comprised of specialized hardware and
software optimized for IDPS sensor use, and software-only sensors, which can be installed onto hosts that
meet certain specifications.

Organizations should consider using management networks for their network-based IDPS deployments
whenever feasible. If an IDPS is deployed without a separate management network, organizations should
consider whether or not a VLAN is needed to protect the IDPS communications. In addition to choosing
the appropriate network for the components, administrators also need to decide where the IDPS sensors
should be located. Sensors can be deployed in one of two modes: inline sensors are deployed so that the
network traffic they monitor must pass through them, while passive sensors are deployed so that they
monitor copies of the actual network traffic. Generally, organizations should deploy inline sensors if
prevention methods will be used and passive sensors if they will not.
