2.3.4. Programmable Logic Controller-Based Topologies
PLCs are used in both SCADA and DCS systems as the control components of an overall
hierarchical system to locally manage processes through feedback control, as described in the
previous sections. In the case of SCADA systems, they may provide similar functionality to
RTUs. When used in DCS systems, PLCs are implemented as local controllers within a
supervisory control scheme.
PLCs can also be implemented as the primary controller in smaller OT system configurations to
provide operational control of discrete processes (e.g., automobile assembly lines, process
controllers). These topologies differ from SCADA and DCS in that they generally lack a central
control server or HMI and, therefore, primarily provide closed-loop control with minimal human
involvement. PLCs have a user-programmable memory for storing instructions for the purpose of
implementing specific functions, such as I/O control, logic, timing, counting, three mode
proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, communications, arithmetic, and data and file
processing.
Figure 8 shows a PLC over a fieldbus network performing the control of a manufacturing
process. The PLC is accessible via a programming interface located on an engineering
workstation, and data is stored in a data historian, all of which are connected on a LAN.
