                               GUIDE TO MALWARE INCIDENT PREVENTION AND HANDLING FOR DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS


post-incident activity. Some major recommendations for malware incident handling, by phase or
subphase, are as follows:

    Preparation. Organizations should perform preparatory measures to ensure that they can respond
     effectively to malware incidents. Recommended actions include—

       –   Building and maintaining malware-related skills within the incident response team

       –   Facilitating communication and coordination throughout the organization

       –   Acquiring the necessary tools (hardware and software) and resources to assist in malware
           incident handling
    Detection and Analysis. Organizations should strive to detect and validate malware incidents
     rapidly to minimize the number of infected hosts and the amount of damage the organization
     sustains. Recommended actions include—

       –   Analyzing any suspected malware incident and validating that malware is the cause. This
           includes identifying characteristics of the malware activity by examining detection sources,
           such as antivirus software, intrusion prevention systems, and security information and event
           management (SIEM) technologies.

       –   Identifying which hosts are infected by the malware, so that the hosts can undergo the
           appropriate containment, eradication, and recovery actions. Identifying infected hosts is often
           complicated by the dynamic nature of malware and computing. Organizations should
           carefully consider host identification issues before a large-scale malware incident occurs so
           that they are prepared to use multiple strategies for identifying infected hosts as part of their
           containment efforts. Organizations should select a sufficiently broad range of identification
           approaches and should develop procedures and technical capabilities to perform each selected
           approach effectively when a major malware incident occurs.

       –   Prioritizing the handling of each incident based on NIST SP 800-61 guidelines and additional
           malware-specific criteria

       –   Studying the behavior of malware by analyzing it either actively (executing the malware) or
           forensically (examining an infected host for evidence of malware)
    Containment. Malware incident containment has two major components: stopping the spread of
     malware and preventing further damage to hosts. Nearly every malware incident requires
     containment actions. In addressing an incident, it is important for an organization to decide which
     methods of containment to employ initially, early in the response. Organizations should have
     strategies and procedures in place for making containment-related decisions that reflect the level
     of risk acceptable to the organization. Containment strategies should support incident handlers in
     selecting the appropriate combination of containment methods based on the characteristics of a
     particular situation. Specific containment-related recommendations include the following:

       –   It can be helpful to provide users with instructions on how to identify infections and what
           measures to take if a host is infected; however, organizations should not rely primarily on
           users for containing malware incidents.

       –   If malware cannot be identified and contained by updated antivirus software, organizations
           should be prepared to use other security tools to contain it. Organizations should also be
           prepared to submit copies of unknown malware to their security software vendors for
