                         Reports on Computer Systems Technology

The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the
development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in federal
information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and
outreach efforts in information system security and its collaborative activities with industry,
government, and academic organizations.


                                                Abstract

NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-73 contains the technical specifications to interface with the smart
card to retrieve and use the Personal Identity Verification (PIV) identity credentials. This document, SP
800-85A, contains the test assertions and test procedures for testing smart card middleware as well as the
card application. The tests reflect the design goals of interoperability and PIV Card functions.
