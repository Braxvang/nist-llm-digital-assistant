5.       Incident Response for Breaches Involving PII

Handling incidents and breaches involving PII is different from regular incident handling and may require
additional actions by an organization. 68 Breaches involving PII can receive considerable media attention,
which can greatly harm an organization‘s reputation and reduce the public‘s trust69 in the organization.
Moreover, affected individuals can be subject to embarrassment, identity theft, or blackmail as the result
of a breach involving PII. Due to these particular risks of harm, organizations should develop additional
policies, such as determining when and how individuals should be notified, when and if a breach should
be reported publicly, and whether to provide remedial services, such as credit monitoring, to affected
individuals. Organizations should integrate these additional policies into their existing incident handling
response policies. 70

Management of incidents involving PII often requires close coordination among personnel from across
the organization, such as the CIO, CPO, system owner, data owner, legal counsel, and public relations
officer. Because of this need for close coordination, organizations should establish clear roles and
responsibilities to ensure effective management when an incident occurs.

FISMA requires Federal agencies to have procedures for handling information security incidents, and it
directed OMB to ensure the establishment of a central Federal information security incident center, which
is the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT). Additionally, NIST provided guidance
on security incident handling in NIST SP 800-61 Revision 1, Computer Security Incident Handling
Guide. In 2007, OMB issued M-07-16, which provided specific guidance to Federal agencies for
handling incidents involving PII.71

Incident response plans should be modified to handle breaches involving PII. Incident response plans
should also address how to minimize the amount of PII necessary to adequately report and respond to a
breach. NIST SP 800-61 Revision 1 describes four phases of handling security incidents. Specific
policies and procedures for handling breaches involving PII can be added to each of the following phases
identified in NIST SP 800-61: preparation; detection and analysis; containment, eradication, and
recovery; and post-incident activity. This section provides additional details on PII-specific
considerations for each of these four phases.

5.1      Preparation

Preparation requires the most effort because it sets the stage to ensure the breach is handled appropriately.
Organizations should build their response plans for breaches involving PII into their existing incident
response plans. The development of response plans for breaches involving PII requires organizations to
make many decisions about how to handle breaches involving PII, and the decisions should be used to
develop policies and procedures. The policies and procedures should be communicated to the
organization‘s entire staff through training and awareness programs. Training may include tabletop

      For the purposes of this document, incident and breach are used interchangeably to mean any violation or imminent threat of
      violation of privacy or computer security policies, acceptable use policies, privacy rules of behavior, or standard computer
      security practices. Modified from NIST SP 800-61 Revision 1.

      According to a 2007 Government Privacy Trust Survey conducted by the Ponemon Institute, a Federal department fell from
      being a top five most trusted agency in 2006 to just above the bottom five least trusted agencies after the highly publicized
      breach of millions of PII records in 2006. http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0207/022007tdpm1.htm.

      Some organizations choose to have separate policies and procedures for incidents and breaches of PII, which may involve
      the use of a separate privacy incident response team. If the policies and procedures are separate for incidents and breaches
      involving PII, then the security incident response plan should be amended so that staff members know when to follow the
      separate policies and procedures for incidents and breaches involving PII.
