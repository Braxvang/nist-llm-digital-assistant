                                                                             Guidelines on PDA Forensics


1.3   Audience and Assumptions

       The intended audience is varied and ranges from response team members handling a computer
       security incident to organizational security officials investigating an employee-related situation
       to forensic examiners involved in criminal investigations. The practices recommended in this
       guide are designed to highlight key principles associated with the handling and examination of
       electronic evidence, in general, and PDAs in particular. Readers are assumed to have a basic
       grounding in classical computer forensics involving individual computer systems (e.g.,
       personal computers) and network servers. Because of the constantly changing nature of
       handheld devices and related forensic procedures and tools, readers are expected to take
       advantage of other resources, including those listed in this guide, for more current and detailed
       information.

1.4   Document Structure

       The guide is divided into the following nine sections:

               Section 1 (this section) explains the authority, purpose and scope, audience and
               assumptions of the document, and outlines its structure.

               Section 2 is an overview on PDAs, including an overview of common operating
               systems and generic operating states.

               Section 3 discusses present-day PDA forensic tools and with which types of devices
               they work.

               Section 4 provides general information on procedures and principles that apply to
               PDA forensics.

               Section 5 discusses considerations for preserving digital evidence associated with
               PDAs.

               Section 6 examines the process of acquisition of digital evidence from PDAs, as well
               as from common types of peripheral equipment.

               Section 7 outlines common sources of evidence on PDAs and the features and
               capabilities of tools for examination.

               Section 8 discusses the reporting of findings.

               Section 9 contains a list of references used in this guide.

               Appendix A contains a list of acronyms used in this guide.

               Appendix B contains a glossary defining terms used in this guide.
