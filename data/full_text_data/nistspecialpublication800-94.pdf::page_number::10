GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



protective actions of particular importance include creating separate accounts for each IDPS user and
administrator, restricting network access to IDPS components, and ensuring that IDPS management
communications are protected appropriately, such as encrypting them or transmitting them over a
physically or logically separate network. Administrators should maintain the security of the IDPS
components on an ongoing basis, including verifying that the components are functioning as desired,
monitoring the components for security issues, performing regular vulnerability assessments, responding
appropriately to vulnerabilities in the IDPS components, and testing and deploying IDPS updates.
Administrators should also back up configuration settings periodically and before applying updates to
ensure that existing settings are not inadvertently lost.

Organizations should consider using multiple types of IDPS technologies to achieve more
comprehensive and accurate detection and prevention of malicious activity.

The four primary types of IDPS technologies—network-based, wireless, NBA, and host-based—each
offer fundamentally different information gathering, logging, detection, and prevention capabilities. Each
technology type offers benefits over the others, such as detecting some events that the others cannot and
detecting some events with significantly greater accuracy than the other technologies. In many
environments, a robust IDPS solution cannot be achieved without using multiple types of IDPS
technologies. For most environments, a combination of network-based and host-based IDPS technologies
is needed for an effective IDPS solution. Wireless IDPS technologies may also be needed if the
organization determines that its wireless networks need additional monitoring or if the organization wants
to ensure that rogue wireless networks are not in use in the organization’s facilities. NBA technologies
can also be deployed if organizations desire additional detection capabilities for denial of service attacks,
worms, and other threats that NBAs are particularly well-suited to detecting. Organizations should
consider the different capabilities of each technology type along with other cost-benefit information when
selecting IDPS technologies.

Organizations planning to use multiple types of IDPS technologies or multiple products of the same
IDPS technology type should consider whether or not the IDPSs should be integrated.

Direct IDPS integration most often occurs when an organization uses multiple IDPS products from a
single vendor, by having a single console that can be used to manage and monitor the multiple products.
Some products can also mutually share data, which can speed the analysis process and help users to better
prioritize threats. A more limited form of direct IDPS integration is having one IDPS product provide
data for another IDPS product (but no data sharing in the opposite direction). Indirect IDPS integration is
usually performed with security information and event management (SIEM) software, which is designed
to import information from various security-related logs and correlate events among them. SIEM
software complements IDPS technologies in several ways, including correlating events logged by
different technologies, displaying data from many event sources, and providing supporting information
from other sources to help users verify the accuracy of IDPS alerts.

Before evaluating IDPS products, organizations should define the requirements that the products
should meet.

Evaluators need to understand the characteristics of the organization’s system and network environments,
so that a compatible IDPS can be selected that can monitor the events of interest on the systems and/or
networks. Evaluators should articulate the goals and objectives they wish to attain by using an IDPS,
such as stopping common attacks, identifying misconfigured wireless network devices, and detecting
misuse of the organization’s system and network resources. Evaluators should also review their existing
security policies, which serve as a specification for many of the features that the IDPS products need to
provide. In addition, evaluators should understand whether or not the organization is subject to oversight
