      NIST SP 800-217 ipd                         Guidelines for PIV Federation (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


672   4.   Federation Assurance Level (FAL)
673   This section is normative.
674   The federation assurance level, or FAL, is defined in [SP800-63C] as a set of
675   requirements for the federation process. A higher FAL indicates a greater degree of trust
676   that the RP can place in the results of the federation process—namely, that the subscriber
677   present at the RP is the subscriber identified in the federation protocol.
678   As discussed in [SP800-63C], federation provides a means of conveying the proofing and
679   authentication processes associated with the lifecycle of the subscriber account. For PIV
680   federation, the PIV identity account is proofed at IAL3, and all PIV credentials are either
681   AAL2 or AAL3, depending on the type of credential. PIV federation MAY be conducted
682   at any FAL, depending on the requirements of the use case.

683   4.1. Reaching Diﬀerent FALs in PIV Federation
684   The FAL classification of a PIV federation transaction primarily depends on several
685   aspects of the federation process, including the establishment of the trust agreement, as
686   discussed in Sec. 3. [SP800-63C] defines general requirements for FALs, and this section
687   defines requirements specific to PIV federation.

688   4.1.1. FAL1
689   FAL1 allows federation in a wide variety of situations, particularly where the results of
690   a risk assessment show that the value of making the federated connection outweighs the
691   complexities of implementing higher FALs. The establishment of the trust agreement and
692   the determination of the PIV IdP MAY happen dynamically. The PIV IdP SHOULD be
693   the home IdP for the agency if known by the RP. The RP SHOULD audit and review all
694   accepted PIV IdPs.
695   As defined in [SP800-63C], at FAL1, the IdP MAY use front-channel presentation of
696   the assertion. However, if the assertion contains private or sensitive information and is
697   presented over the front-channel, an encrypted assertion SHALL be used.

698   4.1.2. FAL2
699   All of the requirements for FAL1 apply at FAL2 except where overridden by more
700   specific or stringent requirements in this section.
701   As defined in [SP800-63C], FAL2 requires the assertion presentation to be protected
702   against injection by an attacker at the RP. To accomplish this, PIV federation at FAL2
703    SHALL use back-channel presentation methods.

704   The establishment of the trust agreement and determination of the PIV IdP at FAL2
705    SHALL be done through a trusted process whereby the RP ensures that the PIV IdP
706   is the official home IdP that represents the population of accounts in question. This
