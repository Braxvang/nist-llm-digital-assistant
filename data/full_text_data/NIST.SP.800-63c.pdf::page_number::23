                                                                                             In a federated environment, the RP manages its sessions separately from any sessions at the IdP.
                                                                                             The session at the RP starts when the RP processes the federation protocol from the IdP. At the

                                                                                             sessions with the IdP and RP independently of one another. The RP SHALL NOT assume that
                                                                                             the subscriber has an active session at the IdP past the establishment of the federated log in. The
