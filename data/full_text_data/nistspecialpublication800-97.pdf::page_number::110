                                                      This control is applicable only in cases in which APs or ASs
                                                      can support a dedicated management interface. A
                                                      dedicated management VLAN can be used to transfer pre-
                                                      shared keys, execute management commands, and transmit
                                                      audit data without the risk that non-administrative users can
              Ensure that network management
                                                      eavesdrop on that communication. Segregating this type of
              information between APs/ASs and
                                                      traffic is often referred as out of band communication

              consoles is transmitted over a

              dedicated management VLAN.
                                                      useful during denial of service attacks, when severe
                                                      congestion on data channels may prevent administrators
                                                      from implementing corrective security measures if those
                                                      data channels are the only ones available to them. This
                                                      sensitive VLAN traffic should be protected.
