SP 800-132      Recommendation for Password-Based Key Derivation           December 2010



If only encryption is applied to the plaintext data, and the data size is large, in order to
detect an incorrect entry of the password without decrypting the whole data on the
storage medium, a prefix value (e.g., a string of zeros) might be prepended to the
plaintext data prior to encryption. If this method is used, the password would be checked
by decrypting the part of the ciphertext data containing the prefix value and comparing
the result against the expected value of the prefix.

Changing a password changes the associated DPK(s). Therefore, whenever a password is
changed, any data that is protected by the retiring password shall be recovered (e.g.,
decrypted) using the appropriate DPK that is associated with the retiring password, and
then re-protected (e.g., encrypted) using the appropriate DKP that is associated with the
revised password.

Option 2:

In the second option, randomly generated DPKs are protected in one of two ways. In
