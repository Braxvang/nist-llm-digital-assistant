       September 2023                                 PIV Card Application Namespace, Data Model, and Representation

1455   Appendix E. Glossary
1456   algorithm identifier
1457   A 1-byte identifier that specifies a cryptographic algorithm and key size. For symmetric cryptographic operations,
1458   the algorithm identifier also specifies a mode of operation (i.e., ECB).

1459   application identifier
1460   A globally unique identifier of a card application. [ISO7816, Part 4, adapted]

1461   authenticable entity
1462   An entity that can successfully participate in an authentication protocol with a card application.

1463   BER-TLV data object
1464   A data object coded according to ISO/IEC 8824-2:2021

1465   card
1466   An integrated circuit card.

1467   card application
1468   A set of data objects and card commands that can be selected using an application identifier.

1469   client application
1470   A program running on a computer in communication with a card interface device.

1471   card management operation
1472   Any operation involving the PIV Card Application Administrator.

1473   Card Verifiable Certificate
1474   A certificate stored on the card that includes a public key, the signature of certification authority, and the
1475   information needed to verify the certificate.

1476   data object
1477   An item of information seen at the card command interface with a specified a name, a description of logical content,
1478   a format, and a coding.

1479   key reference
1480   A 1-byte identifier that specifies a cryptographic key according to its PIV Key Type. The identifier is part of the
1481   cryptographic material used in a cryptographic protocol, such as an authentication or a signing protocol.

1482   MSCUID
1483   A deprecated (previously optional legacy) identifier included for compatibility with Common Access Card and
1484   Government Smart Card Interoperability Specifications.

1485   object identifier
1486   A globally unique identifier of a data object. [ISO8824, adapted]

1487   pairing code
1488   An 8-digit code used to establish a relationship between the PIV Card and a device for the purpose of creating the
1489   virtual contact interface after secure messaging has been established.

1490   PIV Key Type
1491   The type of a key. The PIV Key Types are 1) PIV Authentication key, 2) Card Authentication key, 3) digital
1492   signature key, 4) key management key, 5) retired key management key, 6) PIV Secure Messaging key, and 7) PIV
1493   Card Application Administration key.

1494   relying party
1495   An entity that relies upon the subscriberâ€™s credentials, typically to process a transaction or grant access to
1496   information or a system.

                                                                57
