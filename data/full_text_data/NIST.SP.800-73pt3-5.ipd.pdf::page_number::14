                 Interface device – PC/SC         ‘81’          Card reader name
                 Interface device – SCP           ‘82’          Card reader identifier on terminal equipment
                 Interface device – EMR           ‘83’          Contactless connection using radio transmission
                 Interface device – IR            ‘84’          Contactless connection using infrared transmission

                 Interface device – PKCS #11      ‘85’          PKCS #11 interface
                 Interface device – CryptoAPI     ‘86’          CryptoAPI interface
                 Network node – Local             ‘90’          No network between client application host and card
                                                                reader host
                 Network node – IP                ‘91’          IP address of card reader host
                 Network node – DNS               ‘92’          Internet domain name of card reader host
                 Network node – ISDN              ‘93’          ISDN dialing number string of terminal equipment
                                                                containing the card reader

290   At most one selection from the ‘8x’ series and one selection from the ‘9x’ series SHALL appear
291   in the connection description template. For example, ‘7F 21 0C 82 04 41 63 6D 65 91 04 C0 00
292   02 17’ describes a connection to a generic card reader at internet address 192.0.2.23. In another
293   example, ‘7F 21 0B 82 01 00 93 06 16 17 55 50 12 3F’ describes a connection to the subscriber
294   identity module in the mobile phone at +1 617 555 0123.
295   When used as an argument to the pivConnect entry point on the PIV client API described in this
296   section, an ‘8x’ series data object with zero length and a ‘9x’ series data object request the return
297   of all available card readers of the described type on the described node. Thus, ‘7F 21 04 81 00
298   90 00’ would request a list of all available PC/SC card readers on the host on which the client
299   application was running.
