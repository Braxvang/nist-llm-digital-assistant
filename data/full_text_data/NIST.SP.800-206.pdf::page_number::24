IMPERATIVE 5
Improving Cybersecurity Awareness, Training, Education,
and Workforce Development

People are often the most underappreciated ingredient in the people, process, and
technology formula that determines an organization’s readiness to understand and deal
with cybersecurity challenges. This includes gaps in users’ and providers’ awareness
about how to access cybersecurity guidelines and tools that apply to their own
operations and environments along with a shortage of people who have the needed
cybersecurity education, training, and experience.
In FY18, NIST placed a greater emphasis on improving the public availability of information
resources by providing them to small businesses in the form of briefings, advancing
awareness and understanding of human factors contributing to cybersecurity challenges,
and recommendations for steps to address workforce shortage and training issues.
FY18 web-accessible information resources included: the Computer Security Resource
Center (CSRC),29 National Software Reference Library (NSRL),30 Security Automation
Reference Data and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD),31 National Checklist
Program (NCP) repository,32 Software Assurance and Quality Software Assurance
Reference Dataset (SARD),33 and Computer Forensics Tool Testing Project tool
catalog34 and reference data sets.35 Ongoing federal outreach efforts include the
Software and Supply Chain Assurance (SSCA) Forum,36 the Federal Computer Security
Managers’ (FCSM) Forum,37 and the Federal Information Systems Security Educators’
Association (FISSEA).38
         •   Cybersecurity for Small Businesses. Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs)
             represent approximately 95 % of all businesses and are often considered to be the
             backbone of the U.S. economy. Typically faced with limited budgets, SMBs need
             practical resources that enable them to understand and cost-effectively address
             their cybersecurity risks. NIST has been working on behalf of SMBs for many years,
