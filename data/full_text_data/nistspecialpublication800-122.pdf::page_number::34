                                  GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



 Means of providing the notification
 Who receives the notification; public outreach response
 What actions were taken and by whom
Additionally, organizations should establish a committee or person responsible for using the breach
notification policy to coordinate the organization‘s response. Organizations also need to determine how
incidents involving PII will be tracked within the organization.

The organization should also determine what circumstances require the organization to provide remedial
assistance to affected individuals, such as credit monitoring services. The PII confidentiality impact level
should be considered for this determination because it provides an analysis of the likelihood of harm for
the loss of confidentiality for each instance of PII.

5.2      Detection and Analysis

Organizations may continue to use their current detection and analysis technologies and techniques for
handling incidents involving PII. However, adjustments to incident handling processes may be necessary,
such as ensuring that the analysis process includes an evaluation of whether an incident involves PII.
Detection and analysis should focus on both known and suspected breaches involving PII. Detection of
an incident involving PII also requires reporting internally, to US-CERT, and externally, as appropriate.

5.3      Containment, Eradication, and Recovery

Existing technologies and techniques for containment, eradication, and recovery may be used for breaches
involving PII. However, changes to incident handling processes may be necessary, such as performing
additional media sanitization steps when PII needs to be deleted from media during recovery. 76 PII
should not be sanitized until a determination has been made about whether the PII must be preserved as
evidence. 77 Particular attention should be paid to using proper forensics techniques 78 to ensure
preservation of evidence. Additionally, it is important to determine whether PII was accessed and how
many records or individuals were affected.

5.4      Post-Incident Activity

As with other security incidents, information learned through detection, analysis, containment, and
recovery should be collected for sharing within the organization and with the US-CERT to help protect
against future incidents. The incident response plan should be continually updated and improved based
on the lessons learned during each incident. Lessons learned might also indicate the need for additional
training, security controls, or procedures to protect against future incidents.

Additionally, the organization should use its response policy, developed during the planning phase, to
determine whether the organization should provide affected individuals with remedial assistance. When
providing notice to individuals, organizations should make affected individuals aware of their options,

      Often, information involved with an incident will need to be preserved in preparation for prosecution or litigation related to
      the incident. Legal counsel should be consulted before any PII is sanitized.
