GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



      Overwrite the oldest entries. This is often acceptable for lower-priority log sources, particularly
       when the significant log entries have already been transmitted to a log server or archived to
       offline storage. This is also typically the best method for logs that are very difficult to rotate.
      Stop the log generator. When logging is critical, it may be necessary to configure the OS,
       security software, or application generating the logs to shut down when there is no space left for
       more log entries. On such systems, administrators should take reasonable measures to ensure that
       log generators have adequate space for their logs and that log usage is monitored closely.
Many of these log sources can also alert administrators when a log is nearly full (generally, a
predetermined threshold such as 80 or 90% full), and again when the log is completely full. This can be
helpful for any log source, but is most effective for logs that fill slowly—the first warning of the log
becoming full may be sent several days before the log is completely full, giving administrators ample
time to archive any needed log entries and then clear the log.

Infrastructure and system-level administrators are also responsible for ensuring that old logs are archived
for the appropriate length of time and then destroyed when no longer needed, in compliance with the
organization’s logging, data retention, and media sanitization policies.58 If substantial volumes of logs
need to be kept on the system to expedite analysis or for other reasons, administrators might need to
acquire additional storage devices (e.g., hard drives) for the archived logs. If old log data still on a system
is no longer needed because it is not of importance or has already been archived, it is usually disposed of
either by deleting the old log files or by performing log clearing to remove all entries that precede a
certain date and time. Many log sources offer log clearing features.

5.1.3    Log Security

Infrastructure and system-level administrators need to protect the integrity and availability of log data,
and often protect its confidentiality as well. Section 5.1.2 describes log storage and archival practices,
which support availability. Additional security considerations for securing logs on systems, in storage,
and in transit include the following:

      Limit access to log files. Users should not have any access to most log files unless some level of
       access is necessary for creating log entries. If so, users should have append-only privileges and
       no read access if possible. Users should not be able to rename, delete, or perform other file-level
       operations on log files.
      Avoid recording unneeded sensitive data. Some logs may record sensitive data, such as
       passwords, that does not need to be logged. When feasible, logging should be configured not to
       record information that is not required and would present a substantial risk if accessed by
       unauthorized parties.
      Protect archived log files. This could include creating and securing message digests for the
       files, encrypting log files, and providing adequate physical protection for archival media.
      Secure the processes that generate the log entries. Unauthorized parties should not be able to
       manipulate log source processes, executable files, configuration files, or other components of the
       log sources that could impact logging.
      Configure each log source to behave appropriately when logging errors occur. For example,
       logging might be considered so important for a particular log source that the log source should be

58
     In many cases, only some of the old entries might need to be archived. Administrators might choose to perform log filtering
     so that only the necessary data is archived. This generally reduces the time and storage media needed for archival.
