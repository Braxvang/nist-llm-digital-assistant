operation of addition on elliptic curves via the “chord-and-tangent” rule, where the point at
infinity serves as the identity element. See Appendix A.1.2 for details of the group operation.

2.1.3. Twisted Edwards Curves
Let GF(q) denote the finite field with q elements, where q is an odd prime power. Let Ea,d be the
twisted Edwards curve with defining equation a x2 + y2 = 1+ d x2 y2, where a and d are elements
of GF(q) with a, d ≠ 0, a ≠ d, and a is a square in GF(q) while d is not. The points of Ea,d are the
ordered pairs (x, y) whose coordinates are elements of GF(q) and that satisfy the defining
equation (i.e., the affine points). It can be shown that this set forms a group under the operation
addition, where the point (0, 1) serves as the identity element. The addition formulae are
complete, meaning that the formulae work for all inputs on the curve. See Appendix A.1.3 for
details of the group operation.
An Edwards curve is a twisted Edwards curve with a = 1.

2.2.1. Curves in Short-Weierstrass Form
Let GF(q) denote the finite field with q elements, where q = 2m. Let Ba,b be the Weierstrass curve
with defining equation y2 + x y = x3 + a x2 + b, where a and b are elements of GF(q) with b ≠ 0.
The points of Ba,b are the ordered pairs (x, y) whose coordinates are elements of GF(q) and that
satisfy the defining equation (i.e., the affine points) together with the special point ∅ (the “point
at infinity”). This set forms a group under the operation of addition on elliptic curves via the
“chord-and-tangent” rule, where the point at infinity serves as the identity element. See
Appendix A.2.1 for details of the group operation.
