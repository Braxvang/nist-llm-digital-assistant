SP 800-130                                                                   August 2013




    h) Schemes or Modes of Operation: This element defines the applicable schemes
       or modes of operation for performing a cryptographic function using a key. For
       asymmetric algorithms, it may specify the operation of discrete logarithm
       algorithms in a mathematical finite field, binary field, or Elliptic Curve (EC) field.
       For symmetric algorithms, this field may define the mode(s) of operation that can
       be used by the block cipher algorithm when using the key. Examples of modes of
       operation are Electronic Code Book (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC),
       Output Feedback Mode (OFB), and Counter with Cipher Block Chaining-
       Message Authentication Mode (CCM). For more information, see [SP 800-38A]
       through [SP 800-38F].

    i) Parameters for the Key: This element specifies the parameters, if applicable, for
       a key. For example, a DSA key has the following domain parameters: large prime
       (p), small prime (q), and generator (g).

    j) Length of the Key: This element specifies the length of the key in bits (or bytes).
       Examples include 2048 bits for an RSA modulus, and 256 bits for an elliptic
       curve key.

    k) Security Strength of the Key/Algorithm Pair: This element is a number
       indicating the amount of work (that is, the base 2 logarithm of the number of
       operations) that is required to break (i.e., cryptanalyze) the cryptographic
       algorithm. For example, for a TDEA key of 168 bits (not including parity bits),
       the security strength is specified as 112 bits; for a 2048-bit RSA modulus, the
       security strength is specified as 112 bits. The security strength of a key/algorithm
       pair may be reduced if a previously unknown attack is discovered.

    l) Key Type 5: This element identifies the key type. Key types were discussed in
       Section 6.1.

    m) Appropriate Applications for the Key: This element specifies applications for
       which the key may be used. Examples include Kerberos, Signed E-Mail, Trusted
       Time Stamp, Code Signing, File Encryption, and IPSEC.

    n) Key Security Policy Identifier: This element identifies the security policy
       applicable to the key or key type. A Key Security Policy is a set of security
       controls that are used to protect the key or key type during the lifecycle of the key
       from generation to destruction (see Section 6.7 and [RFC 3647]). A Key Security
       Policy is typically represented by an object identifier registered by the CKMS
       organization. The Key Security Policy for individual keys or key types is part of,
       and should be consistent with, the CKMS Security Policy.

 Key type also implies key usage, since usage is one of the two factors that define key type.
Thus, the key usage implied by the key type should be consistent with the application of the key.
