RA-3      RISK ASSESSMENT

          Control: The organization conducts assessments of the risk and magnitude of harm that could result
          from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of
          information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency
          (including information and information systems managed/operated by external parties).
          Supplemental Guidance: Risk assessments take into account vulnerabilities, threat sources, and
          security controls planned or in place to determine the resulting level of residual risk posed to
          organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals based on the operation of the
          information system. The organization also considers potential impacts to other organizations and,
          in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act and Homeland Security Presidential Directives,
          potential national-level impacts in categorizing the information system. Risk assessments also
          take into account risk posed to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals
          from external parties (e.g., service providers, contractors operating information systems on behalf
          of the organization, individuals accessing organizational information systems, outsourcing
          entities). In accordance with OMB policy and related E-authentication initiatives, authentication
          of public users accessing federal information systems may also be required to protect nonpublic or
          privacy-related information. As such, organizational assessments of risk also address public
          access to federal information systems. The General Services Administration provides tools
          supporting that portion of the risk assessment dealing with public access to federal information
          systems. NIST Special Publication 800-30 provides guidance on conducting risk assessments
          including threat, vulnerability, and impact assessments.
          Control Enhancements: None.

RA-4      RISK ASSESSMENT UPDATE

          Control: The organization updates the risk assessment [Assignment: organization-defined
          frequency] or whenever there are significant changes to the information system, the facilities
          where the system resides, or other conditions that may impact the security or accreditation status
          of the system.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization develops and documents specific criteria for what is
          considered significant change to the information system. NIST Special Publication 800-30
          provides guidance on conducting risk assessment updates.
          Control Enhancements: None.
