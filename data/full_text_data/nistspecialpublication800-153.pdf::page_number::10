2.    WLAN Security Configuration

Wireless networking enables computing devices with wireless capabilities to use computing resources
without being physically connected to a network. The devices simply need to be within a certain distance
(known as the range) of the wireless network infrastructure. Wireless local area networks (WLANs) are
groups of wireless networking devices within a limited geographic area, such as an office building, that
are capable of exchanging data through radio communications. WLANs are usually implemented as
extensions to existing wired local area networks (LANs) to provide enhanced user mobility and network
access. WLAN technologies are based on the IEEE 802.11 standard and its amendments. Throughout the
rest of this publication, the generic term “WLAN” refers to an IEEE 802.11 WLAN.

The two fundamental types of WLAN components are client devices (such as laptops and smartphones)
and access points (APs), which logically connect client devices with a distribution system (DS), typically
the organization’s wired network infrastructure. The DS is the means by which client devices can
communicate with the organization’s wired LANs and external networks such as the Internet. Some
WLANs also use wireless switches, which act as intermediaries between APs and the DS. The purpose of
the switch is to assist administrators in managing the WLAN infrastructure. Figure 1 shows a simplified
view of WLAN components that includes a wireless switch. WLANs without wireless switches have a
similar architecture, except that the APs connect directly to the DS.

The security of each of the WLAN components—including client devices, APs, and wireless switches—is
heavily dependent on their WLAN security configuration. This section explains why having standardized
security configurations is important for WLAN components and provides recommendations for
designing, implementing, evaluating, and maintaining those configurations, particularly for client devices.
