a growing number of inadvertent data disclosures within the U.S. Government, resulted in
President George W. Bush signing Executive Order 13402, which established an Identity
Theft Task Force on May 10, 2006 [25]. One year later, the Offce of Management and
Budget (OMB) issued Memorandum M-07-16 [80], which required federal agencies to
develop and implement breach notifcation policies. As part of this effort, NIST issued
Special Publication (SP) 800-122, Guide to Protecting the Confdentiality of Personally
Identifable Information (PII) [103]. These policies and documents had the specifc goal of
limiting the accessibility of information that could be directly used for identity theft but did
not create a framework for processing government datasets so that they could be released
without impacting the privacy of the data subjects.
In 2015, NIST published NIST Interagency or Internal Report (IR) 8053, De-Identifcation
of Personal Information [66], which provided an overview of de-identifcation issues and
terminology. It also summarized signifcant publications involving de-identifcation and
re-identifcation. However, NIST IR 8053 did not make recommendations regarding the
appropriateness of de-identifcation or specifc de-identifcation algorithms. The following
year, NIST convened the Government Data De-Identifcation Stakeholder’s Meeting [67].
In 2016, OMB revised Circular A-130, “Managing Information as a Strategic Resource,”
refecting changes in law and advances in technology. The revision was also designed to
ensure consistency between executive orders, presidential directives, NIST standards and
guidelines, and other OMB policies. A-130 defnes personally identifable information
(PII) as “information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, either
alone or when combined with other information that is linked or linkable to a specifc
individual.”[4]
De-identifcation is one of several models for allowing the controlled sharing of data de-
rived from confdential data about individuals.10 Other models include the use of data pro-
cessing enclaves, where computations are performed with confdential data using comput-
ers that are physically isolated from the outside world. That isolation might be performed
with locked doors and guards, or it might be performed using silicon and encryption, as is
the case with enclaves implemented on some modern microprocessors. Another approach
is to use mathematical techniques, such as secure multi-party computation, so that compu-
tations can be carried out on confdential data held by multiple parties without ever bringing
all of the confdential data together in a single location. Researchers have introduced more
than 80 different privacy metrics in an attempt to characterize privacy and privacy loss in
different settings [169].
Techniques for privacy-preserving data-sharing and analysis can be layered to provide
stronger protection than any single technique would provide in isolation. Such comple-
mentary models are discussed in Sec. 3.4. For a more complete description of data-sharing
