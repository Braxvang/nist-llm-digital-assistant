defects, errors, and vulnerabilities. 91 Other subclaims may exist involving the ability to exhibit
predictable behavior while operating in secure states in the presence and absence of adversity
and the ability to recover from an insecure state. Claims can be expressed in terms of functional
correctness, strength of function, and the protection capability derived from adherence to
standards and/or from the use of specific processes, procedures, and methods.


                                                        LEARNING FROM SAFETY
             The NASA System Safety Handbook [6] describes the relevant claims to be met in terms
             of the top-level claim that the system is adequately safe with subclaims, including that
             the system is designed to be as safe as reasonably practicable, built to be as safe as
             reasonably practicable, and operated as safely as reasonably practicable.




F.2.2. Approaches to Assurance
There are three general approaches to assurance. These assurance approaches can vary based on
the type of evidence, how the evidence is acquired, the strength of the judgments made based on
the acquired evidence, and the extent to which the assurance matches decision-making needs.
From weakest to strongest, the assurance approaches are axiomatic, analytic, and synthetic.
•    Axiomatic Assurance (assurance by assertion) is based on beliefs accepted on faith in an
     artifact or process. The beliefs are often accepted because they are not contradicted by
     experiment or demonstration. Axiomatic assurance is not suited to complex scenarios [62].
     -     Demonstration of conformance and compliance are types of axiomatic assurance. While
           useful, they are not well-suited as the sole basis of assurance for complex scenarios.
•    Analytic Assurance (assurance by test and analysis) derives from testing or reasoning to
     justify conclusions about properties of interest. Belief is relocated from an artifact or process
     to trust in some method of analysis. The feasibility of establishing an analytic basis depends
     on the amount of work involved in performing the analysis and on the soundness of any
     assumptions underlying that analysis. Analytic methods are most relevant in a model that
     spans all relevant uses and all interfaces to the environment. That is, the model must not
     ignore too many details.
     -     Testing demonstrates the presence but not the absence of errors and vulnerabilities.
           Testing and analyses will have uncertainty that cannot be ignored, especially when they
           lack comprehensiveness. Uncertainty contributes to risk.
•    Synthetic Assurance (assurance by structured reasoning) derives from the method of
     composition of the “components of assurance” (i.e., the assurance derives from the manner of

   Not all vulnerabilities can be mitigated to an acceptable level. There are three classes of vulnerabilities in systems: (1) vulnerabilities whose
existence is known and either eliminated or made to be inconsequential, (2) vulnerabilities whose existence is known but that are not sufficiently
mitigated, and (3) unknown vulnerabilities that constitute an element of uncertainty. That is, the fact that the vulnerability has not been identified
should not give increased confidence that the vulnerability does not exist. Determining the effect of vulnerabilities that are in the delivered system
and the risk posed by those vulnerabilities and accepting uncertainty about the existence of a vulnerability that will only become known over time
are important aspects that are addressed by assurance.
