                                                                            FOR IMPORT AND EXPORT


5     Log and Historical Data

Logs and historical data are maintained by the original issuer and are not transferred
when exchanging PIV Card enrollment records. These log and historical data were
created by the original issuer and are part of the chain-of-trust record. Log and historical
data contain information that correlates the subject of a chain-of-trust record to logs of
identity proofing, registration (enrollment) and maintenance activities of a cardholder.
This includes information about the officer who took the action, what action was taken,
and when and where the action occurred. Some examples of log activities maintained in
the chain-of-trust record log are: initial PIV Cardholder registration, enrollment, and
issuance, change of name and subsequent re-issuance, loss of card and subsequent
reissuance.
