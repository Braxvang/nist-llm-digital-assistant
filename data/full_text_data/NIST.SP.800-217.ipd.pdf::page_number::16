      NIST SP 800-217 ipd                               Guidelines for PIV Federation (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


387   2.   Architecture
388   This section is informative.
389   PIV federation is the process by which a subscriber uses their PIV identity account to
390   access an RP using an IdP for that account. As shown in Figure 1, the subscriber uses
391   their PIV credentials (either a PIV Card or a derived PIV credential) to authenticate to the
392   IdP and access the PIV identity account. The authentication event is then conveyed to the
393   RP using an assertion that contains a set of attributes about the authentication event and
394   the PIV identity account.

395   For PIV federation to occur, all of the following conditions apply:
396        • The account being asserted is a valid and active PIV identity account (See Sec. 2.1).
397        • The RP has established the IdP as the PIV IdP for the account through a valid and
398          current trust agreement (See Sec. 2.2.2).
399        • The subscriber authenticates to the IdP using a PIV credential (See Sec. 2.3).
400   If any of these items are not true, such as the use of a non-PIV identity account at a PIV-
401   enabled IdP or the authentication of a PIV identity account through an IdP that is not
