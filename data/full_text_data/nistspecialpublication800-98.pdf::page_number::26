GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



2.3.1.4 Functionality

The primary function of a tag is to provide an identifier to a reader, but many types of tags support
additional capabilities that are valuable for certain business processes. These include:

 Memory. Memory that is nonvolatile enables data to be stored on tags and retrieved at a later time.
  This memory is either write once, read many (WORM) memory or re-writeable memory, which can
  be modified after initialization. Non-volatile memory enables more flexibility in the design of RFID
  systems because RFID data transactions can occur without concurrent access to data stored in an
  enterprise subsystem. However, adding memory to a tag increases its cost and power requirements.
  Section 3 discusses RFID application requirements and provides additional information about the
  circumstances under which the use of re-writable memory would be a desirable approach. In general,
  when this document refers to memory, it is referring to non-volatile memory. In contrast, volatile
  memory, which is also used in tags, supports tag computations and does not retain data after it is
  powered down.
 Environmental sensors. The integration of environmental sensors with tags is an example of the
  benefit of local memory. The sensors can record temperature, humidity, vibration, or other
  phenomena to the tag’s memory, which can later be retrieved by a reader. The integration of sensors
  significantly increases the cost and complexity of the tags. Moreover, while many tag operations can
  be powered using the electromagnetic energy from a reader, this approach is not workable for sensors,
  which must rely on battery power. Tags integrated with sensors typically are only used with high-
  value, environmentally sensitive, or perishable objects worthy of the additional expense.
 Security functionality, such as password protection and cryptography. Tags with on-board
  memory are often coupled with security mechanisms to protect the data stored in that memory. For
  example, some tags support a lock command that, depending on its implementation, can prevent
  further modification of data in the tag’s memory or can prevent access to data in the tag’s memory.
  In some cases, the lock command is permanent and in other cases, a reader can “unlock” the memory.
  EPCglobal standards, standards developed jointly by the International Organization for
  Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and many
  proprietary tag designs support this feature. Some RFID systems support advanced cryptographic
  algorithms that enable authentication mechanisms and data confidentiality features, although these
  functions are most commonly found on RFID-based contactless smart cards and not tags used for
  item management. Some tags offer tamper protection as a physical security feature.
 Privacy protection mechanisms. EPCglobal tags support a feature called the kill command that
  permanently disables the tag from responding to subsequent commands. The primary objective of the
  kill command is to protect personal privacy. Unlike the lock command, the kill command is
  irreversible. The kill command also prevents wireless access to a tag’s identifier, in addition to any
  memory that may be on the tag. While the lock command provides security, the primary objective of
  the kill command is personal privacy. RFID tags could potentially be used to track individuals that
  carry tagged items or wear tagged articles of clothing when the tags are no longer required for their
  intended use, such as to expedite checkout or inventory. The ability to disable a tag with the kill
  command provides a mechanism to prevent unauthorized access to and illegitimate use of product
  information stored in the tag.
2.3.1.5 Form Factor

The form factor of a tag refers to its shape, size, packaging, and handling features. To a large extent, a
tag’s form factor is determined by the characteristics previously discussed, such as power source and
functionality. Some important aspects regarding a tag’s form factor include the size of the tag, the weight
