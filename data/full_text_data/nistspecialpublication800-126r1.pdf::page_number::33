                  The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



version 5.8 of the OVAL Results schema24 regardless of the version of the OVAL Definitions document
that was evaluated.

An SCAP OVAL result data stream component SHALL include the results of every OVAL Definition
used to generate the reported results.

In order to be SCAP compliant, an SCAP scanning product SHALL be able to produce all the types of
OVAL Results output described below. The specific result output SHALL be configurable within the
SCAP product.

In order to support SCAP instances where OVAL thin content (only the ID of the definition and the
results) is preferred, SCAP products SHALL support all valid values for the <oval-
res:directives> controlling the expected content of the results file.

To support the ability for results to be consumed by the appropriate product(s), data results SHALL be
expressed as Single Machine Without System Characteristics, Single Machine With System
Characteristics, or Single Machine With Thin Results as follows:

     1. Single Machine Without System Characteristics – A single result file that includes all OVAL
        definitions evaluated and ―full‖ results types as described in the ContentEnumeration element of
        the OVAL Results schema25, without system characteristics.

         For this format, the values for the <oval-res:directives> element SHALL be:
         <oval-res:definition_true content="full" reported="true"/>
         <oval-res:definition_false content="full" reported="true"/>
         <oval-res:definition_unknown content="full" reported="true"/>
         <oval-res:definition_error content="full" reported="true"/>
         <oval-res:definition_not_evaluated content="full" reported="true"/>
         <oval-res:definition_not_applicable content="full" reported="true"/>

     2. Single Machine With System Characteristics – A single result file that includes all OVAL
        definitions evaluated and ―full‖ results types as described in the ContentEnumeration element of
        the OVAL Results schema and the System Characteristics of the target evaluated.

         For this format, the values for the <oval-res:directives> element SHALL be:
         <oval-res:definition_true content="full" reported="true"/>
         <oval-res:definition_false content="full" reported="true"/>
         <oval-res:definition_unknown content="full" reported="true"/>
         <oval-res:definition_error content="full" reported="true"/>
         <oval-res:definition_not_evaluated content="full" reported="true"/>
         <oval-res:definition_not_applicable content="full" reported="true"/>

         When creating the OVAL System Characteristics as defined by the <oval-
         sc:oval_system_characteristics> element, the <oval-sc:collected_objects> and
         <oval-sc:system_data> elements SHALL be provided.
