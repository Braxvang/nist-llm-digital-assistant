GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



 A description of the control and how it works,
 The types of implementations or applications where the control might be helpful,
 The benefits that the control provides, such as which risks it mitigates, and
 The weaknesses of the control, including why it might not be effective in some environments, and
  what residual risks and other concerns remain even if the control is implemented.
The summary at the end of Section 5 summarizes the controls and maps them to the risk categories
discussed in Section 4.

5.1     Management Controls

Management controls are typically involved in risk assessment, system planning, and system acquisition,
as well as security certifications, accreditations, and assessments. The sub-sections below discuss
management controls for RFID systems in more detail.

5.1.1    RFID Usage Policy

Control: An RFID usage policy describes the authorized and unauthorized uses of RFID technology in
an organization and the personnel roles assigned to particular RFID system tasks. Federal agencies
should follow FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and
Information Systems, when developing the RFID usage policy.

The usage policy also should be consistent or integrated with the organizationâ€™s privacy policy, which
addresses topics such as how personal information is stored and shared. The RFID usage policy should
also address privacy issues associated with the tag identifier formats and the potential disclosure of
information based on solely on the tag identifier format selected. Additional information resources are
found in the privacy guidelines in Section 6.

Applicability: All organizations that use RFID technologies or are considering using them.

Benefits: The policy establishes the framework for many other security controls. It provides a vehicle
for management to communicate its expectations regarding the RFID system and its security. It enables
management to take legal or disciplinary action against individuals or entities that do not comply with the
policy.

Weaknesses: The existence of a policy does not ensure compliance with the policy. A policy needs to be
coupled with the implementation and enforcement of appropriate operational and technical controls to be
effective.

5.1.2    IT Security Policies

Control: IT security policies describe the approach to achieve high-level security objectives of the usage
policy. The IT security policies related to RFID should cover each RFID subsystem, including network,
database and application security in the enterprise and inter-enterprise subsystems; they should not just be
limited to security of tags and readers in the RF subsystem.

IT security policies for RFID systems should address:

 Access control to RFID information, especially records contained in RFID analytic system databases,
