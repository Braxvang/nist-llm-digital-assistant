76   Note to Reviewers
77   NIST welcomes public comments on any aspect of this publication, including the following
78   questions asked on behalf of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the
79   Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA):
80      1. This revision is informed by NIST SP 800-207 and the NCCoEâ€™s Zero Trust Architecture
81         project calling out data analytics for zero trust purposes. Should the scope of this
82         publication be expanded to directly support and map to zero trust?
83      2. Should this publication be expanded to include log management implementation
84         guidance?
85      3. Are there additional considerations for different types of log sources that should be
86         included in this publication (e.g., on-premises, cloud, managed services, or hybrid)?
87      4. Should the standardization of log management planning to facilitate the sharing of cyber
88         threats or incidents be included?
89      5. Should guidance on how to determine the purposefulness of logging categories and types
90         be included?
91      6. Should guidance for determining storage retention periods be included?
92      7. Should this publication address how new technologies may change log management
93         planning (e.g., blockchains, zero trust, generative AI, quantum computing)?
94      8. Should this publication address how and which major triggers may necessitate reviewing
95         or changing log management plans?
96      9. Should this publication address storage costs and offer guidance on prioritizations and
97         trade-offs for cost-effective log management planning?
