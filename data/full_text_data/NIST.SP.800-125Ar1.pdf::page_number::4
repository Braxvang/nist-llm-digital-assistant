                        Reports on Computer Systems Technology

The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the
development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
Federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities with
industry, government, and academic organizations.


                                             Abstract

 The Hypervisor platform is a collection of software modules that provides virtualization of
 hardware resources (such as CPU, Memory, Network and Storage) and thus enables multiple
 computing stacks (made of an operating system (OS) and application programs) called Virtual
 Machines (VMs) to be run on a single physical host. In addition, it may have the functionality
 to define a network within the single physical host (called virtual network) to enable
 communication among the VMs resident on that host as well as with physical and virtual
 machines outside the host. With all this functionality, the hypervisor has the responsibility to
 mediate access to physical resources, provide run time isolation among resident VMs and enable
 a virtual network that provides security-preserving communication flow among the VMs and
 between the VMs and the external network. The architecture of a hypervisor can be classified in
 different ways. The security recommendations in this document relate to ensuring the secure
 execution of baseline functions of the hypervisor and are therefore agnostic to the hypervisor
 architecture. Further, the recommendations are in the context of a hypervisor deployed for server
 virtualization and not for other use cases such as embedded systems and desktops.
 Recommendations for secure configuration of a virtual network are dealt with in a separate NIST
 document (Special Publication 800-125B).
