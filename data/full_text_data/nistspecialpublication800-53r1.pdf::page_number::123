RA-5      VULNERABILITY SCANNING

          Control: The organization scans for vulnerabilities in the information system [Assignment:
          organization-defined frequency] or when significant new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the
          system are identified and reported.
          Supplemental Guidance: Vulnerability scanning is conducted using appropriate scanning tools and
          techniques. The organization trains selected personnel in the use and maintenance of vulnerability
          scanning tools and techniques. Vulnerability scans are scheduled and/or random in accordance
          with organizational policy and assessment of risk. The information obtained from the
          vulnerability scanning process is freely shared with appropriate personnel throughout the
          organization to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other information systems. Vulnerability
          analysis for custom software and applications may require additional, more specialized approaches
          (e.g., vulnerability scanning tools for applications, source code reviews, static analysis of source
          code). NIST Special Publication 800-42 provides guidance on network security testing. NIST
          Special Publication 800-40 (Version 2) provides guidance on patch and vulnerability management.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs vulnerability scanning tools that include the capability to readily update
                the list of information system vulnerabilities scanned.
          (2)   The organization updates the list of information system vulnerabilities scanned [Assignment:
                organization-defined frequency] or when significant new vulnerabilities are identified and reported.
          (3)   The organization employs vulnerability scanning procedures that can demonstrate the breadth and
                depth of scan coverage, including vulnerabilities checked and information system components
                scanned.
