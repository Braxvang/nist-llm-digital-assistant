                       instantiation                                     shall follow the practice specified in [MINUSTD]


NORMATIVE NOTES:
1.         [MINUSTD] requires that each stored minutia have a type associated with it. For PIV, the mandatory card
           templates shall contain minutiae of type ridge ending or ridge bifurcation. These types are defined in [MINUSTD,
           5.3.{2,3}]. Other types of minutiae, such as trifurcations and crossovers, shall not be included in PIV Card
           templates. However, for those minutiae where it is not possible to reliably distinguish between a ridge ending
           and a bifurcation, the category of "other" shall be assigned and encoded using bit values 00b. The angle and
           location for a minutia of type "other" should be the angle and location that would have applied to the
           corresponding ridge ending or bifurcation depending on which one the encoding algorithm determines to be the
           most likely for that particular minutiae. This is a common characteristic of "inked" impressions that exhibit ridge
           endings being converted to bifurcations and vice-versa due to over- or under-inking in the image.
2.         The second paragraph of [MINUSTD, 6.4.2] refers both to an ASCII space and "three ASCII numerals" mentioned
           in the first paragraph. The practice of using an ASCII space character as the first character of the version number
           shall be followed: " 20\0" i.e., 0x20323000.
3.         The length of the entire record shall fit within the container size limits specified in [800-73]. These limits apply to
           the entire CBEFF wrapped and signed entity, not just the [MINUSTD] record.
4.         Both fields ("Owner" and "Type") of the CBEFF Product Identifier of [MINUSTD, Clause 6.4.4] shall be non-zero.
           The two most significant bytes shall identify the vendor, and the two least significant bytes shall identify the
           version number of that supplier's minutiae detection algorithm.
5.         The Capture Equipment ID shall be reported. Its use may improve interoperability.
6.         The quality value shall be that computed for the parent image using [NFIQ] and reported here as Q = 20*(6 -
           NFIQ). A value of "255" shall be assigned when fingerprints are temporarily unusable for matching. A value of
           "254" shall be assigned when the fingerprints are permanently unusable.
7.         All coordinates and angles for minutiae shall be recorded with respect to the original finger image. They shall not
           be recorded with respect to any sub-image(s) created during the template creation process.
