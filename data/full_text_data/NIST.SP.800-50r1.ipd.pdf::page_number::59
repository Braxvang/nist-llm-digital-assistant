       NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                        Building a Cybersecurity and
       August 2023                                                                   Privacy Learning Program

1790   maintain access to IT systems, the communications plan must include this notice. For those with
1791   significant cybersecurity or privacy responsibilities, identify which training is assigned to a
1792   specific work role, individual, or department.
1793   Employees must know the consequences of failing to complete the learning activity according to
1794   the organization’s policy. This should be explained in the Learning Program Communications
1795   Plan and noted in the course description in the Learning Plan within the Learning Management
1796   System.
1797   Other considerations for CPLP communications include:
1798      •   Course titles and numbers should be unique, differentiated, and include information on
1799          the access method (e.g., online or in-person), availability, course dates, and deadlines.
1800      •   All learners, their managers or supervisors, and human capital departments should be
1801          made aware of any required training and associated due dates. Communication should
1802          include reminder messages, references and links to the organization’s official policy
1803          statements for employee information systems, and the consequences for failing to
1804          complete the learning activity.

1805          Establishing Reporting and Metrics Requirements for CPLP Elements
1806   The Learning Program Manager should strive to ensure that the implementation of all new CPLP
1807   elements (e.g., courses, training, posters, practical exercises, etc.) will allow for performance
1808   metrics and measurements to be established and collected. Establish these requirements during
1809   the developmental phases of both the overall program and each component for which measures
1810   are expected to meet regulatory and annual reporting requirements and to continually assess and
1811   improve the performance of the program. As previously mentioned in Section 3.2.2, these must
1812   be included in the Design Plan requirements that go to curriculum and content developers.
1813   In addition to any applicable measures that support the program, as described in Section 2.4, the
1814   Learning Program Manager should utilize element level measures, such as the target percentage
1815   of the applicable audience who receives the training or awareness material and feedback from the
1816   audience on effectiveness of the material.
1817   Some considerations for reporting:
1818      •   Learning Management System (LMS) integration: Training is usually tracked and
1819          recorded using the LMS. Will the course or training element include quizzes with scores
1820          or other metrics and measurements?
1821      •   Non-LMS integrated elements: Consider how the participation and performance of each
1822          learner will be tracked and recorded if the training is face-to-face, virtual, or hybrid. Will
1823          manual or paper tracking be required?

1824          Building a CPLP Schedule
1825   Establish a primary calendar for CPLP activities. The process may be automated using an LMS.
1826   Enable organization-wide access so that personnel can find elements applicable to each audience
1827   segment (e.g., by date, learning objective, etc.). It is a good idea to align this calendar with the
