                                             ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



     Service Set Identifier (SSID) for the AP. The SSID is a name assigned to a WLAN; it allows
      STAs to distinguish one WLAN from another. SSIDs are broadcast in plaintext in wireless
      communications, so an eavesdropper can easily learn the SSID for a WLAN. However, the SSID
      is not an access control feature, and was never intended to be used for that purpose.
     Media Access Control (MAC) address for the STA. A MAC address is a (hopefully) unique
      48-bit value that is permanently assigned to a particular wireless network interface. Many
      implementations of IEEE 802.11 allow administrators to specify a list of authorized MAC
      addresses; the AP will permit devices with those MAC addresses only to use the WLAN. This is
      known as MAC address filtering. However, since the MAC address is not encrypted, it is simple
      to intercept traffic and identify MAC addresses that are allowed past the MAC filter.
      Unfortunately, almost all WLAN adapters allow applications to set the MAC address, so it is
      relatively trivial to spoof a MAC address, meaning attackers can gain unauthorized access easily.
Additionally, the AP is not authenticated to the STA by open system authentication. Therefore, the STA
has to trust that it is communicating to the real AP and not an impostor AP that is using the same SSID.
Therefore, open system authentication does not provide reasonable assurance of any identities, and can be
misused easily to gain unauthorized access to a WLAN or trick users into connecting to a malicious
WLAN.

Shared key authentication was supposed to be more robust than open system authentication; in fact, it is
equally insecure. As the name implies, shared key authentication is based on a secret cryptographic key
known as a Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) key; this key is shared by legitimate STAs and APs. (WEP
is described in more detail in Section 3.2.2.) Shared key authentication uses a simple challenge-response
scheme based on whether the STA seeking WLAN access knows the WEP key. As shown in Figure 3-1,
the STA initiates an Authentication Request with the AP, and the AP generates a random 128-bit
challenge value and sends it to the STA. Using the WEP key, the STA encrypts the challenge and returns
the result to the AP. The AP decrypts the result using the same WEP key and allows the STA access only
if the decrypted value is the same as the challenge. The cryptographic computations are performed using
the RC4 stream cipher algorithm, which generates a pseudo-random data sequence known as a key
stream. To encrypt or decrypt data, the key stream is combined with the data.
