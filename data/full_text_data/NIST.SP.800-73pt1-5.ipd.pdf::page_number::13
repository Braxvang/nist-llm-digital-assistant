      NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1
      September 2023                                 PIV Card Application Namespace, Data Model, and Representation


248       Introduction
249   Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) called for the adoption of a common
250   identification standard to govern the interoperable use of identity credentials to allow physical
251   and logical access to federally controlled facilities and information systems. In response, Federal
252   Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201 [FIPS201], Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of
253   Federal Employees and Contractors, was developed to define reliable, government-wide identity
254   credentials for use in applications such as access to federally controlled facilities and information
255   systems. FIPS 201 supports multiple types of authenticators, including authenticators on smart
256   cards (also known as PIV Cards) and derived PIV credential authenticators in various other form
257   factors. This publication contains technical specifications to interface with PIV Cards to retrieve
258   and use identity credentials. Other specifications, such as NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-
259   157r1 (Revision 1), contain procedures and life cycle activities to issue, maintain, and use
260   derived PIV credentials.

261           Purpose
262   FIPS 201 defines processes for binding identities to authenticators, such as the PIV Card and
263   derived PIV credentials used in the federal PIV system. SP 800-73-5 contains the technical
264   specifications to interface with the PIV Card to retrieve and use the identity credentials. The
265   specifications reflect the design goals of interoperability and PIV Card functions. The goals are
266   addressed by specifying a PIV data model, card edge interface, and application programming
267   interface. Moreover, this document enumerates requirements for the options and branches in
268   international integrated circuit card (ICC) standards [ISO7816]. The specifications go further by
269   constraining interpretations of the normative standards to ease implementation, facilitate
270   interoperability, and ensure performance in a manner tailored for PIV applications.

271           Scope
272   SP 800-73-5 specifies the PIV data model, application programming interface (API), and card
273   interface requirements necessary to comply with the use cases, as defined in Section 6 of FIPS
274   201 and further described in this document. Interoperability is defined as the use of PIV identity
275   credentials such that client-application programs, compliant card applications, and compliant
276   ICCs CAN be used interchangeably by all information processing systems across federal
277   agencies. SP 800-73-5 defines the PIV data elements’ identifiers, structure, and format, as well
278   as the client API and card command interface for use with the PIV Card.
279   This document — SP 800-73-5, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1 – PIV Card
280   Application Namespace, Data Model, and Representation — is a companion document to FIPS
281   201 and specifies the PIV Card Application Namespace, the PIV Data Model, and its logical
282   representation on the PIV Card.
