       November 2023

2662   external system service
2663   A system service that is implemented outside of the authorization boundary of the organizational system (i.e., a
2664   service that is used by but not a part of the organizational system) and for which the organization typically has no
2665   direct control over the application of required security controls or the assessment of security control effectiveness.

2666   external network
2667   A network not controlled by the organization.

2668   facility
2669   One or more physical locations containing systems or system components that process, store, or transmit
2670   information.

2671   federal agency
2672   See executive agency.

2673   federal information system
2674   An information system used or operated by an executive agency, by a contractor of an executive agency, or by
2675   another organization on behalf of an executive agency. [80]

2676   FIPS-validated cryptography
2677   A cryptographic module validated by the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) to meet the
2678   requirements specified in FIPS Publication 140-2 (as amended). As a prerequisite to CMVP validation, the
2679   cryptographic module is required to employ a cryptographic algorithm implementation that has successfully passed
2680   validation testing by the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP). See NSA-approved cryptography.

2681   firmware
2682   Computer programs and data stored in hardware – typically in read-only memory (ROM) or programmable read-
2683   only memory (PROM) – such that the programs and data cannot be dynamically written or modified during
2684   execution of the programs. See hardware and software. [78]

2685   hardware
2686   The material physical components of a system. See software and firmware. [78]

2687   identifier
2688   Unique data used to represent a person’s identity and associated attributes. A name or a card number are examples
2689   of identifiers.
2690   A unique label used by a system to indicate a specific entity, object, or group.

2691   impact
2692   With respect to security, the effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other
2693   organizations, or the Nation (including the national security interests of the United States) of a loss of
2694   confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or a system. With respect to privacy, the adverse effects that
2695   individuals could experience when an information system processes their PII.

2696   impact value
2697   The assessed worst-case potential impact that could result from a compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or
2698   availability of information expressed as a value of low, moderate or high. [6]

2699   incident
2700   An occurrence that actually or imminently jeopardizes, without lawful authority, the confidentiality, integrity, or
2701   availability of information or an information system; or constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of
2702   law, security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies. [79]
