                                            Audience

This document is targeted at vendors of Derived PIV Applications, issuers of Derived PIV
Credentials, and entities that will conduct tests on these applications and credentials. Readers are
assumed to have a working knowledge of SP 800-157, FIPS 201 and other PIV guidelines, and
applicable technologies. This document is intended to:

   +   Enable developers of Derived PIV Applications to design their applications as specified
       in SP 800-157 for interface, data object container size and access requirements.

   +   Enable issuers of Derived PIV Credentials to ensure that Derived PIV data objects
       conform to the requirements specified in SP 800-157.

   +   Enable developers and issuers to develop self-tests as part of the development effort and
       issuance process.

   +   Enable entities performing conformance tests on Derived PIV Applications and Derived
       PIV data objects to develop tests that cover the test suite provided in this document.
