Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external publication of
testimony associated with legislation (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect
inter-agency relationships, relations with Congress, or public confidence in the agency.
However, damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
legislation testimony information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the legislation testimony information.
The legislation testimony processes are usually tolerant of delays.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Excessive recovery delays can result in
damage to agency reputation and to interests associated with specific legislation. This can result
in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
legislation testimony information is low.
C.2.7.3 Proposal Development Information Type

Proposal Development involves drafting proposed legislation that creates or amends laws subject
to Congressional legislative action. Subject to exception conditions described below, the
recommended security categorization for the proposal development information type is as
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of proposal development
information on the ability of responsible agencies to draft proposed legislation that creates or
amends laws subject to Congressional legislative action. Legislation is normally in the public
domain. However, the effects of loss of confidentiality of background information used in the
development of proposed legislation or of early drafts of proposed legislation could result in
attempts by competing interests to influence and/or impede a specific legislative process. The
consequences to agency programs and of the ability of an agency to perform its mission can be
very serious. Premature public release of proposed legislation before internal coordination and
review has been conducted can result in unnecessary criticism of the proposed legislation and
even damage public confidence in the agency. These consequences are particularly likely where
the release includes unedited internal commentary and discussion. In general, unauthorized
disclosure of much legislative proposal information, particularly in early phases of the process, is
likely to result in serious harm to agency assets or operations.
