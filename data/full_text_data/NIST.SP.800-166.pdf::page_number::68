NIST SP 800-166                                                  DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                 DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

 Test Scenario           1. Send the SELECT command with
                               • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                         2. Send the VERIFY command with
                               • P2, key reference value, is set to '80'
                               • Data field of the command will contain the
                                  correct Derived PIV Application Password,
                                  padded with 'FF' (if necessary) to complete
                                  the total length of the value to 8 bytes
                         3. Send the GENERAL AUTHENTICATE command
                               • CLA is set to:
                                   1. '00' if command chaining is not needed or
                                   2. '10' if command chaining is used. (The
                                      last chain of the command sets CLA to
                                      '00')
                               • P1, algorithm reference, is set to '07' or
                                  '11'.
                                  P2, key reference, is set to '9A' indicating
                                  the Derived PIV Authentication key
                               • Data field in the command is to include '81'
                                  specifying a challenge, followed by a randomly
                                  generated challenge, and '82 00' in order to
                                  request a response
 Expected Result(s)      1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                            template with the status word '90 00'.
                         2. From Step 2, the command returns status word '90 00'.
                         3. From Step 3, the command returns the signed challenge with
                            status word '90 00'.

8.3.4.2 Verify and Reset Security Status

 Test Assertion          TA-08.03.04.03
 Purpose                 Verifies that the Derived PIV Application responds to the VERIFY
                         command for resetting the security status with the correct key
                         reference.

 Precondition(s)         •   A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                             appropriate token reader.
                         •   Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                             an instance of the reader.
                         •   The Derived PIV Application Password is recorded.
                         •   The Derived PIV Application Password’s retry counter is not 0.
