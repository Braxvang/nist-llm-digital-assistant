IA-7      CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODULE AUTHENTICATION

          Control: The information system employs authentication methods that meet the requirements of
          applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance for
          authentication to a cryptographic module.
          Supplemental Guidance:    The applicable federal standard for authentication to a cryptographic
          module is FIPS 140-2 (as amended). Validation certificates issued by the NIST Cryptographic
          Module Validation Program (including FIPS 140-1, FIPS 140-2, and future amendments) remain
          in effect, and the modules remain available for continued use and purchase until a validation
          certificate is specifically revoked. Additional information on the use of validated cryptography is
          available at http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval.
          Control Enhancements: None.
