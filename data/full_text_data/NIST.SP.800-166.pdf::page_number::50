8.3   Derived PIV Application Command Interface Conformance

8.3.1 SELECT Command

8.3.1.1 Select using the Full and Truncated AID

 Test Assertion       TA-08.03.01.01
 Purpose              Verifies that the Derived PIV Application executes the SELECT token
                      command for the following conditions: (i) long AID and (ii) right-
                      truncated short AID. The application property template as specified by
                      the vendor is returned.
