                                                                                             Any enterprise environment can be designed with zero trust tenets in mind. Most organizations
                                                                                             already have some elements of zero trust in their enterprise infrastructure or are on their way
                                                                                             through implementation of information security and resiliency policies and best practices.
                                                                                             Several deployment scenarios and use cases lend themselves readily to a zero trust architecture.
                                                                                             For instance, ZTA has its roots in organizations that are geographically distributed and/or have a

                                                                                             In the use cases below, ZTA is not explicitly indicated since the enterprise likely has both
