E.18. Loss Margins
Principle: The system is designed to operate in a state space sufficiently distanced from the
threshold at which loss occurs.
Note: Margins refer to the difference between a conservative threshold at which the system is expected to
operate while subjected to adversity and the point at which the adversity results in failure. Loss margins
are created by engineered features put in place to maintain operational conditions and the associated
adversity level at some distance (i.e., conservative threshold) from the estimated critical adversity
threshold or loss-triggering threshold. Loss margins also allow for increased time to (1) detect the need
for a response action (Anomaly Detection), (2) determine what the response action should be
(Commensurate Response), and (3) complete the selected response action. When there is uncertainty
about the effectiveness of the response action, loss margins need to allow time to evaluate response
effectiveness, determine any additional actions needed, and complete any selected actions.
Uncertainty may derive from the operational environment, the design and realization of the system, the
utilization and sustainment of the system, and the adversity presenting itself to the system. Loss margins
are effective in addressing uncertainty about how and when a loss-triggering event occurs. Specifically,
loss margins are effective in addressing uncertainty associated with:
-   Intelligently designed and executed attacks, including attacks that persist and evolve over time
-   Unknown, unquantified, and underappreciated susceptibilities, threats, vulnerabilities, hazards, and
    associated risks
For designs that incorporate loss margins, uncertainty about adversity makes determining the loss-
triggering thresholds difficult. Loss margins for design should be determined with a balance between
certainty (i.e., what has happened and can happen again) and uncertainty (i.e., what has not happened but
can happen, or what has happened but can also happen in a different way). Loss scenarios that include
loss escalation and an estimation of the critical threshold for loss occurrence are helpful in making design
decisions that incorporate loss margins. Loss scenarios also help to determine the limits of adversity-
driven decisions due to uncertainty in knowledge about the adversity (i.e., the adversity is insufficiently
known or understood or is just unknown).
Sensitivity analyses must inform the determination of loss margins. Other factors for computing loss
margins include system complexity, the use of newer technology or older technology in new ways, and
the degree of new environments being introduced. An additional factor is the ability to complete
comprehensive and effective testing. Limitations on system test coverage and effectiveness for actual,
simulated, or emulated adversity necessitate larger margins to account for the remaining uncertainty. The
size of the margin may be reduced over time as unknown and underappreciated loss scenarios are
uncovered and corrected. The size of the margin may also need to be increased over time as a malicious
adversity capability matures in sophistication.

E.19. Mediated Access
Principle: All access to and operations on system elements are mediated.
Note: Mediated access is a foundational principle in the design of secure systems. The purpose of
mediated access is to:
-   Place limits on access to and use of the system
-   Reduce the possibility of loss escalation
