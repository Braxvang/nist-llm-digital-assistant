2.2.1 Information Security Strategic Planning
      “Strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual program performance
      reports are the main elements of GPRA. Together these elements create a
      recurring cycle of reporting, planning, and execution.” 5
    GPRA requires federal agencies to develop and submit to OMB and Congress a
“strategic plan for program activities” and “prepare an annual performance plan
covering each program activity set forth in the budget of such agency.“6 Agencies
are required to refresh their strategic plans within three years of submitting their
previous strategic plans, while submitting performance plans is required annually.
    Agencies should integrate information security into the agency strategic planning
processes by establishing and documenting information security strategies that
directly support agency strategic and performance planning activities. The
organization’s information security strategy should establish a comprehensive
framework to enable the development, institutionalization, assessment, and
improvement of the agency’s information security program. The information security
strategy should support the overall agency strategic and performance plans and IT
strategic plan (if applicable) with its content clearly traceable to these higher-level
sources. Each agency should define the following for its information security
program:
