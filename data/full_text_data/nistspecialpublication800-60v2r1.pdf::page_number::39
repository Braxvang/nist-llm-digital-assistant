The public comment tracking process is usually tolerant of delays. Permanent loss of comment
information may disrupt some government operations by showing a lack of due diligence in
response to comments.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
public comment tracking information is low.
C.2.2.3 Regulatory Creation Information Type

Regulatory Creation involves the activities of researching and drafting proposed and final
regulations. Subject to exception conditions described below, the recommended security
categorization for the regulatory creation information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The level of confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of regulatory
creation information on the ability of responsible agencies to research and draft proposed and
final regulations. The effects of loss of confidentiality of early drafts of regulations can result in
attempts by affected entities and other affected parties to influence and/or impede the regulation
development process.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Premature public release of draft
regulations before internal coordination and review has been conducted can result in unnecessary
criticism of the proposed regulation and even damage public confidence in the agency. In such
cases, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for regulatory creation
information is moderate. These consequences are particularly likely where the release includes
unedited internal commentary and discussion. Delays can impair an agency’s mission, but loss
of public confidence can do serious and persistent harm to an agency’s ability to effectively
perform its mission. If the regulatory information is moved to the public domain, the
confidentiality impact level becomes Not Applicable (NA).

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Because most regulatory information is intended for
release to the public, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for regulatory
creation information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of information affecting external communications that contain regulatory information (e.g., web
pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency. The
consequences of a reduction in public confidence will be more serious for agencies that have
national defense, intelligence, or information security missions. In such cases, the impact level
may be at least moderate.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
regulatory creation information is low.
