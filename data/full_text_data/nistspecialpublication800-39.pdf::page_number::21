As part of organizational governance, senior leaders/executives in consultation and collaboration
with the risk executive (function), determine: (i) the types of risk management decisions that are
reserved for specific senior leadership roles (e.g., heads of agencies or chief executive officers,
chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief information security officers);24 (ii) the
types of risk management decisions that are deemed to be organization-wide and the types of
decisions that can be delegated to subordinate organizations or to other roles in the organization
(e.g., systems and security engineers, mission/business owners, enterprise architects, information
security architects, common infrastructure or service providers, authorizing officials); and (iii)
how risk management decisions will be communicated to and by the risk executive (function).
Three different types of governance models (i.e., centralized, decentralized, and hybrid) are
described in Appendix F. Regardless of the governance model(s) employed, clear assignment and
accountability for accepting risk is essential for effective risk management.


     Strong governance is the best indicator of senior leadership commitment to effective, consistent risk
     management across the organization to achieve ongoing mission/business success.
