     With the advance of current computing technologies
and the diverse environments, access control issues, such
as situational awareness, trust management, preservation of
privacy, and privilege-management systems, are becoming
increasingly complex. Practical and conceptual guidance for
these topics is needed.
     In FY 2015, the following research was accomplished for
this project:
