STEP 2: CONDUCT THE ASSESSMENT

IDENTIFY THREAT SOURCES
TASK 2-1: Identify and characterize threat sources of concern, including capability, intent, and targeting
characteristics for adversarial threats and range of effects for non-adversarial threats.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations identify threat sources of concern and determine the characteristics associated
with those threat sources. For adversarial threat sources, assess the capabilities, intentions, and targeting associated
with the threat sources. For non-adversarial threat sources, assess the potential range of effects from the threat sources.
The risk management strategy and the results of the Prepare step provide organizational direction and guidance for
conducting threat source identification and characterization including, for example: (i) sources for obtaining threat
information; (ii) threat sources to consider (by type/name); (iii) threat taxonomy to be used; and (iv) the process for
identifying which threat sources are of concern for the risk assessment. As identified in Task 1-3, organizations make
explicit any assumptions concerning threat sources including decisions regarding the identification of threat sources
when specific and credible threat information is unavailable. Organizations can also view adversarial threat sources
from a broad-based perspective, considering the time such threat sources may have to exploit identified organizational
vulnerabilities, the scale of the attack, and the potential use of multiple attack vectors. The identification and
characterization of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) can involve considerable uncertainty. Organizations annotate
such threat sources with appropriate rationale and references (and providing classifications as necessary).
Appendix D provides a set of exemplary tables for use in identifying threat sources:
• Table D-1 provides a set of exemplary inputs to the threat source identification task;
• Table D-2 provides an exemplary taxonomy that can be used to identify and characterize threat sources;
• Tables D-3, D-4, and D-5 provide exemplary assessment scales to assess the risk factors (i.e., characteristics) of
  adversarial threat sources with regard to capability, intent, and targeting;
• Table D-6 provides an exemplary assessment scale for assessing the ranges of effects from threat events initiated by
  non-adversarial threat sources; and
• Tables D-7 and D-8 provide templates for summarizing and documenting the results of threat source identification
  and characterization.
If a particular type of threat source is outside the scope of the risk assessment or not relevant to the organization, the
information in Tables D-7 and D-8 can be truncated accordingly. The information produced in Task 2-1 provides threat
source inputs to the risk tables in Appendix I.



                                    Summary of Key Activities – Task 2-1

       •    Identify threat source inputs (see Table D-1, as tailored by the organization).
       •    Identify threat sources (see Table D-2, as tailored by the organization).
       •    Determine if threat sources are relevant to the organization and in scope (see Table D-1, as
            tailored by the organization).
       •    Create or update the assessment of threat sources (see Table D-7 for adversarial threat
            sources and Table D-8 for non-adversarial threat sources, as tailored by the organization).
            •    For relevant adversarial threat sources:
                 -    Assess adversary capability (see Table D-3, as tailored by the organization).
                 -    Assess adversary intent (see Table D-4, as tailored by the organization).
                 -    Assess adversary targeting (see Table D-5, as tailored by the organization).
            •    For relevant non-adversarial threat sources:
                 -     Assess the range of effects from threat sources (see Table D-6, as tailored by the
                       organization).
