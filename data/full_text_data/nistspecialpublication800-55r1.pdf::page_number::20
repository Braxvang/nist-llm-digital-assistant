requirement to state performance measures for past and current fiscal years. Additionally,
information security measures can be used as input into the Government Accountability Office
(GAO) and Inspectors General (IG) audits. Implementation of an information security
measurement program will demonstrate agency commitment to proactive information security.
It will also greatly reduce time spent by agencies in collecting data, which is routinely requested
by the GAO and IG during audits and for subsequent status updates.

Provide Quantifiable Inputs for Resource Allocation Decisions: Fiscal constraints and market
conditions compel government and industry to operate on reduced budgets. In such an
environment, it is difficult to justify broad investments in the information security infrastructure.
Information security investments should be allocated in accordance with a comprehensive risk
management program. Use of information security measures will support risk-based decision
making by contributing quantifiable information to the risk management process. It will allow
organizations to measure successes and failures of past and current information security
investments, and should provide quantifiable data that will support resource allocation for future
investments. Using the results of the measures analysis, program managers and system owners
can isolate problems, use collected data to justify investment requests, and then target
investments specifically to the areas in need of improvement. By using measures to target
security investments, these measures can aid organizations in obtaining the best value from
available resources.

3.3    Types of Measures

The maturity of an organization’s information security program determines the type of measures
that can be gathered successfully. A program’s maturity is defined by the existence and
institutionalization of processes and procedures. As an information security program matures, its
policies become more detailed and better documented, the processes it uses become more
standardized and repeatable, and the program produces a greater quantity of data that can be used
for performance measurement.

Figure 3-1 depicts this continuum by illustrating measurement considerations for information
security programs. As Figure 3-1 illustrates, less mature information security programs need to
develop their goals and objectives before being able to implement effective measurement. More
mature programs use implementation measures to evaluate performance, while the most mature
programs use effectiveness/efficiency and business impact measures to determine the effect of
their information security processes and procedures.

An information security program is dependent upon upper-level management support to define
its goals and objectives. These goals and objectives may be expressed through information
security policies and processes at the program’s inception, or in a variety of other sources.
(Goals and objectives are addressed in more detail in Sections 4.1 and 5.2.) Information security
policies are documented, and information security procedures begin to stabilize, as the program
is implemented and begins to mature. To be useful, information security measurement requires
existence of documented procedures and some available data on the implementation of security
controls.
