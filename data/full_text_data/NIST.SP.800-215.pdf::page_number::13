NIST SP 800-215                                                           Guide to a Secure Enterprise
November 2022                                                                     Network Landscape

   •   The security focus has enlarged from being network-centric (i.e., internal/corporate
       network versus external/public internet) to centering on the user, device, endpoint, and
       service.
   •   The new trust relationship has to not only be based on identity or the location of the
       access but enhanced to include validation of each access request (not just at the beginning
       of an access session), as well as the applicable set of contextual information associated
       with the user, device, or service.

       Scope
The scope of this document includes:
   •   A structural view of the enterprise network landscape based on the distribution of IT
       resources and the consequent security challenges it poses
   •   Emerging and state-of-practice solutions in terms of feature sets and requirements to
       address the security challenges; solutions discussed will focus on the functional and
       operational levels

       Target Audience
This guidance is intended for network design architects and network security solution architects
in organizations with a hybrid IT environment (consisting of both on-premises and cloud-based
applications) with a combination of legacy and microservices-based (i.e., cloud-native)
applications.

       Organization of This Document
The organization of this document is as follows:
   •   Section 2 considers traditional network access principles, technologies, and limitations in
       the context of the current enterprise network landscape.
   •   Section 3 provides a brief functional description of network security appliances – some
       new, some traditional (e.g., firewall) – that have enhanced capabilities to meet the
       security needs of the current network landscape.
   •   Section 4 outlines various network configurations that have evolved specifically for
       realizing security functions (e.g., device authentication).
   •   Section 5 considers a framework (i.e., ZTNA) that integrates two or more of these stand-
       alone network configurations to realize an abstract enterprise architecture (zero trust
       architecture [ZTA]) and looks at two candidate enterprise network security techniques –
       microsegmentation and software-defined perimeter (SDP).
   •   Section 6 focuses on the evolution of the WAN portion of the enterprise network
       landscape and enhanced offerings of the WAN services with global spread with a built-in
       security service infrastructure.
   •   Section 7 provides the summary and conclusions.
