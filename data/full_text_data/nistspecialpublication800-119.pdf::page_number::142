                                                              GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


are encoded in the low-order bits of the IPv6 addresses, allowing automatic tunneling. Globally routable
IPv4 addresses are not needed. If using a private IPv4 address to create the ISATAP address, then that
IPv6 address cannot be used out of its IPv4 scope. The local IPv4 network is represented in IPv6 as a
single subnet.

ISATAP assumes that some dual stack IPv4/IPv6 router exists and that it advertises an IPv6 prefix. A
host with an IPv4 address w.x.y.z then performs autoconfiguration with interface ID = ::0:5EFE:w.x.y.z.

The example in Figure 6-3 shows:

        IPv4 address:           192.168.1.10
        Global IPv6 prefix:      2001:1C3:1:200F::/64
        Link-local address:      FE80::5EFE:65:C0A8:010A = FE80::5EFE:65:192.168.1.10
        Global IPv6 address: 2001:1C3:1:200F::5EFE:C0A8:010A =
         2001:1C3:1:200F::5EFE: 192.168.1.10.
To make this work, one needs to ensure that:

        All IPv6 hosts run dual stack IPv4/IPv6 with support for ISATAP.
        Each ISATAP host must know at least one dual stack IPv4/IPv6 router.
        All traffic is constrained to a single administrative domain.
        There is no need for IPv4 NAT traversal.
