                                                                 GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



     Time value of data (if data is valuable but for only a short time period [e.g., days as opposed to
        years], then a weaker encryption algorithm could be used)

     Threat to data (the higher the threat level, the stronger the required encryption)

     Other protective measures that are in place and that may reduce the need for stronger
        encryption—for example, using protected methods of communications, such as dedicated circuits
        as opposed to the public Internet

 Required performance (higher performance requirements may require procurement of additional
  system resources, such as a hardware cryptographic accelerator, or may necessitate weaker
  encryption)

 System resources (fewer resources [e.g., process, memory] may necessitate weaker encryption)

 Import, export, or usage restrictions

 Encryption schemes supported by Web server application

 Encryption schemes supported by Web browsers of expected users.

7.5.5   Implementing SSL/TLS

A digital signature is needed to implement SSL/TLS on a Web server. A certificate, which is the digital
equivalent of an ID card, is used in conjunction with a public key encryption system. Certificates can be
issued by trusted third parties, known as CAs, or can be self-signed. Organizational requirements
determine which approach is used.

Although the sequence of steps is not identical for all Web servers, the implementation of a third-party
signed certificate for a Web server generally includes at least three steps:

 Generating and submitting a certificate-signing request (CSR)

 Picking up a signed SSL/TLS certificate from a CA

 Installing the certificate and configuring the Web server to use SSL/TLS for any specified resources.

A CSR consists of three parts: certification request information, a signature algorithm identifier, and a
digital signature over the certification request information. Web servers that are SSL/TLS enabled
provide specific instructions for the generation of a CSR. There are two major types of CSRs. The most
popular is the encoded Public Key Cryptography Standard (PKCS) #10, Certification Request Syntax
Standard, which is used by newer Web servers [RSA00]. The other CSR type, based on the Privacy
Enhanced Mail (PEM) specification, is called either PEM message header or Web site professional
format. The use of this CSR is generally limited to older Web servers. Most Web servers generate PKCS
#10-compliant CSRs similar to the sample CSR shown in Figure 7-2. A CSR provides not only
additional information about a given entity, or a “challenge password” by which the entity may later
request certificate revocation, but also attributes for inclusion in X.509 certificates [RSA00].
