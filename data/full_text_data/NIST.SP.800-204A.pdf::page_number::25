                                                                                              The increasing adoption of microservices-based applications in cloud and large enterprise
                                                                                              environments has prompted the identification of an infrastructure that provides a comprehensive,
                                                                                              consistent, and coordinated set of support services. The Service Mesh is one such infrastructure,
                                                                                              and the state of practice for deployment of Service Mesh components is a proxy-based approach
                                                                                              that can provide all support services without any change to the application code.

                                                                                              The proxy-based Service Mesh can be engineered to build and integrate support service
                                                                                              components that provide secure service discovery, definition, and enforcement of authentication
