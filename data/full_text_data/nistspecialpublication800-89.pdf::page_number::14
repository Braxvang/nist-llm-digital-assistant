SP 800-89                                                                    November 2006



entity because of that trust. However, the TTP shall obtain this assurance for itself using
one of the following methods:
         1. The TTP generates the set of domain parameters.
         2. The TTP selects the set of domain parameters from a list published by an
            entity that the TTP trusts.
         3. The TTP performs explicit domain parameter validation and obtains an
            indication of validity (see Section 4.1 for DSA and ANS X9.62 for ECDSA).


4.2.2 Assurance When Domain Parameters are Generated by an Untrusted
      Party
Domain parameters may be generated by a party that is not trusted by the entity requiring
assurance of domain parameter validity. In this case, the entity shall obtain assurance of
domain parameter validity using at least one of the following methods:
      1. The entity performs explicit domain parameter validation and obtains an
         indication of validity (see Section 4.1 for DSA and ANS X9.62 for ECDSA).
      2. The entity receives assurance from a third party (i.e., a TTP) that is trusted by that
         entity that the TTP performed an explicit domain parameter validation and
         obtained an indication of validity (see Section 4.1 for DSA and ANS X9.62 for
         ECDSA).

5 Assurance of Public Key Validity
The correct functioning of the digital signature algorithms depends on the arithmetic
validity of the public/private key pair that is used for digital signature generation and
verification. Digital signature key pairs shall be generated by the intended signatory,
generated in a cooperative process by both the signatory and a TTP, or generated by a
TTP (trusted by the intended signatory) and provided to the intended signatory.
Each intended signatory (i.e., the key pair owner) shall have assurance of public key
validity prior to generating a digital signature (see Section 5.1). Each verifier shall have
assurance of the validity of the public key prior to verifying a digital signature (see
Section 5.2). CAs shall have assurance of public key validity prior to issuing a digital
signature certificate containing the digital signature public key for the owner.
For DSA and ECDSA, an entity shall obtain assurance of domain parameter validity
prior to obtaining assurance of public key validity.

5.1      Owner Assurances of Public Key Validity
The owner shall obtain assurance of the validity of its own public key using one or more
of the following methods. Maximal assurance is provided when method 1 or 2 is
combined with method 3 or 4.
      1. Intended owner generation. The intended owner generates the key pair.
