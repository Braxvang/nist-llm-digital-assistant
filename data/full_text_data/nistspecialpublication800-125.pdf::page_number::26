be shared among many guest OSs; still, access to that image should be read-only, and no guest image
should have write access to it.

Hypervisor systems that connect multiple guest OSs together on a virtual network present issues for
organizations whose policies require that all networks be monitored in specified fashions. For example, an
organization might have a network security policy that says that all network switches connecting multiple
servers must be managed and that traffic between the servers be monitored for suspicious activity.
However, network switches in most virtual systems do not have such a capability. Some virtual switches
support virtual LAN (VLAN) and firewall capabilites to provide separation and isolation of the VM
network traffic. In some environments, additional security appliances can be implemted to inspect,
control, shape, and monitor the VM network communications in a centralized location.

Hypervisors sometimes offer virtual storage networks and virtual interfaces to existing hardware storage
networks. These features offer the same security problems as virtual networks, namely that organizations
whose security policies require monitoring those connections cannot use the same methods for virtual
storage as they do for physical storage. Using physical interfaces to existing networked storage can
eliminate this problem, but also reduces some of the flexibility that hypervisors offer.

4.4   Desktop Virtualization Security

A major difference in security between server and desktop virtualization is the ability to control the
images. In a server environment, the ability to create and manage images is usually limited to
administrators. But in desktop environments, end users often have the ability to create, modify, duplicate,
and delete images. The virtualization software itself may also be fully controlled by the user. It may not
be possible for the organization to ensure that the guest OS images meet the organization’s security policy
requirements, such as being patched regularly.

Organizations considering the use of desktop virtualization should determine which scenarios require the
enforcement of security by managed virtualization solutions and which scenarios do not require
centralized management. For example, if a teleworker is using desktop virtualization to run programs that
the security policy would allow them to run from, say, a lightly-protected home computer, then that
system probably does not need to be as tightly managed as one that accesses internal databases or
websites, and therefore would only be allowed from computers with more stringent security controls.
Organizations often manage virtual machines like they are real computers; another option is to treat them
as appliances that expire (or are forced out of service) after a period of time and replaced by more up-to-
date appliances.

Desktop virtualization can be used to improve security by providing a well-secured guest OS image for
the desktop environment. A number of virtualization vendors provide solutions that will allow
organizations to deploy a managed desktop guest OS on unmanaged computers. For example,
telecommuting employees may install a hypervisor on their home computer and access the organization’s
intranet through a specific guest OS image, or a remote access server might deliver a clean guest OS
image every time a user initiates a remote access session. Some solutions even permit users to boot their
home computers from removable media containing a hypervisor and guest OS image; this can provide a
bare metal full virtualization solution that does not run the host OS on the home computer. Guest OS
images on read-only media are not a panacea, however. Guest OSs are often updated, which means that
the old read-only media would need to be destroyed and new media created and distributed. Because of
this, some organizations might be tempted to use rewritable media instead, but that could lead to the
media being infected with malware.
