factors can be functionally combined to evaluate risk; and (iv) an analysis approach (e.g., threat-
oriented, asset/impact-oriented, or vulnerability-oriented), describing how combinations of risk
factors are identified/analyzed to ensure adequate coverage of the problem space at a consistent
level of detail. Risk assessment methodologies are defined by organizations and are a component
of the risk management strategy developed during the risk framing step of the risk management
process.17 Figure 2 illustrates the fundamental components in organizational risk frames and the
relationships among those components.

Organizations can use a single risk assessment methodology or can employ multiple assessment
methodologies, with the selection of a specific methodology depending on, for example: (i) the
time frame for investment planning or for planning policy changes; (ii) the complexity/maturity
of organizational mission/business processes (by enterprise architecture segments); (iii) the phase
of the information systems in the system development life cycle; or (iv) the criticality/sensitivity 18
of the information and information systems supporting the core organizational missions/business
functions. By making explicit the risk model, the assessment approach, and the analysis approach
employed, and requiring as part of the assessment process, a rationale for the assessed values of
risk factors, organizations can increase the reproducibility and repeatability of risk assessments. 19

  Risk assessment methodologies are influenced in large measure by the organizational risk management strategy.
However, risk assessment methodologies can be customized for each risk assessment based on the purpose and scope
of the assessment and the specific inputs organizations choose to make regarding the risk assessment process, risk
model, assessment approach, and analysis approach.

  NIST Special Publication 800-60 discusses the concepts of criticality and sensitivity of information with respect to
security categorization.
19
   Reproducibility refers to the ability of different experts to produce the same results from the same data. Repeatability
refers to the ability to repeat the assessment in the future, in a manner that is consistent with and hence comparable to
prior assessmentsâ€”enabling the organization to identify trends.
