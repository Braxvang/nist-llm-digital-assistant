recording) and detect pending and actual failure (e.g., by crossing the threshold of the margins
that have been established). The design principle of Anomaly Detection embodies this capability.

The design approach includes the following elements: 66
•    Define the intended behaviors and outcomes for the system 67
•    Identify the system states and conditions that reflect the intended behaviors and outcomes
•    Identify the system states and conditions that potentially lead to loss in the system
•    Select and alter the system design to prevent loss to the extent practicable (preferred) and
     limit the loss that does occur (where, when, and to the extent necessary and practicable)
•    Iterate the above elements to address how the functions that serve to prevent or limit loss
     may fail due to intentional or unintentional reasons

Figure 15 illustrates the steps in the design approach in the context of the Systems Security
Engineering Framework described in Chapter Four.

The approach to trustworthy design includes both preemptive and reactive aspects. These
mutually reinforcing aspects provide the protection needed to achieve only the authorized and
intended behaviors and outcomes. The preemptive aspect results in system features and system
actions taken to prevent and limit loss before the loss occurs, while the reactive aspect results in
system actions to limit loss and its effects once a loss has occurred. Figure 16 illustrates a
balanced design strategy that includes preemptive and reactive aspects.

  These steps are useful in applying a system control concept for any loss-relevant emergent property (e.g., safety, resilience).

  This flow iterates through systems engineering as the system is decomposed. Subsequent iterations would apply within the elements that
comprise the system of interest (i.e., the subsystems, assemblies, and components).
