       NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1
       September 2023                                 PIV Card Application Namespace, Data Model, and Representation

1500   Appendix F. Notation
1501   The 16 hexadecimal digits SHALL be denoted using the alphanumeric characters 0, 1, 2, …, 9,
1502   A, B, C, D, E, and F. A byte consists of two hexadecimal digits, such as '2D'. The two
1503   hexadecimal digits are represented in quotations '2D' or as 0x2D. A sequence of bytes MAY be
1504   enclosed in single quotation marks (e.g., 'A0 00 00 01 16') rather than given as a sequence of
1505   individual bytes (e.g., 'A0' '00' '00' '01' '16').
1506   A byte can also be represented by bits b8 to b1, where b8 is the most significant bit (MSB) and
1507   b1 is the least significant bit (LSB) of the byte. In textual or graphic representations, the leftmost
1508   bit is the MSB. Thus, for example, the most significant bit b8 of '80' is 1, and the least significant
1509   bit b1 is 0.
1510   All bytes specified as RFU SHALL be set to '00', and all bits specified as RFU SHALL be set to
1511   0.
1512   All lengths SHALL be measured in number of bytes unless otherwise noted.
1513   The expression 'X' & 'Y' is a bitwise AND operation between bytes 'X' and 'Y'.
1514   The symbol || means a concatenation of byte strings. For example, if X is '00 01 02' and Y is '03
1515   04 05', then X || Y is '00 01 02 03 04 05'.
1516   Data objects in templates are described as being mandatory (M), optional (O), or conditional (C).
1517   Mandatory means that the data object SHALL appear in the template. Optional means that the
1518   data object MAY appear in the template. For conditional data objects, the conditions under
1519   which they are required are provided.
1520   In other tables, the M/O/C column identifies the properties of the PIV Card Application that
1521   SHALL be present (M), MAY be present (O), or are conditionally required to be present (C).
1522   BER-TLV data object tags are represented as byte sequences, as described above. Thus, for
1523   example, 0x4F is the interindustry data object tag for an application identifier, and 0x7F61 is the
1524   interindustry data object tag for the Biometric Information Templates Group template.
1525   This document uses the following typographical conventions in text:
1526       •   Specific terms in CAPITALS represent normative requirements. When these same terms
1527           are not in CAPITALS, the term does not represent a normative requirement.
1528       •   The terms SHALL and SHALL NOT indicate requirements to be strictly followed in
1529           order to conform to the publication and from which no deviation is permitted.
1530       •   The terms SHOULD and SHOULD NOT indicate that among several possibilities, one
1531           is recommended as particularly suitable without mentioning or excluding others, that a
1532           certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily required, or that — in the negative
1533           form — a certain possibility or course of action is discouraged but not prohibited.
1534       •   The terms MAY and NEED NOT indicate a course of action that is permissible within
1535           the limits of the publication.
1536       •   The terms CAN and CANNOT indicate a material, physical, or causal possibility or
1537           capability or — in the negative — the absence of that possibility or capability.
