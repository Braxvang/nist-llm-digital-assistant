3.11 System Interconnection/Information Sharing
System interconnection is the direct connection of two or more IT systems for the
purpose of sharing information resources. System interconnection, if not appropriately
protected, may result in a compromise of all connected systems and the data they store,
process, or transmit. It is important that system owners, information owners, and
management obtain as much information as possible regarding vulnerabilities associated
with system interconnections and information sharing. This is essential to selecting the
appropriate controls required to mitigate those vulnerabilities. An Interconnection
Security Agreement (ISA), Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), or Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) is needed between systems (not between workstations/desktops or
publicly accessed systems) that share data that are owned or operated by different
organizations. An ISA is not needed with internal agency systems if an agency manages
and enforces a rigid system development life cycle, which requires approvals and sign-
offs ensuring compliance with security requirements. For additional information on
interconnections, see NIST SP 800-47, Security Guide for Interconnecting Information
Technology Systems.

In this section, for each interconnection between systems that are owned or operated by
different organizations, provide the following information concerning the authorization
for the connection to other systems or the sharing of information:

   •   Name of system;

   •   Organization;

   •   Type of interconnection (Internet, Dial-Up, etc.);

   •   Authorizations for interconnection (MOU/MOA, ISA);

   •   Date of agreement;

   •    FIPS 199 Category;

   •   Certification and accreditation status of system; and

   •   Name and title of authorizing official(s).

For agencies with numerous interconnections, a table format including the above
information may be a good way to present the information.


3.12 Laws, Regulations, and Policies Affecting the System
List any laws, regulations, or policies that establish specific requirements for
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system and information retained by,
transmitted by, or processed by the system. General agency security requirements need
