Appendix B                                             Frequently Asked Questions


   news. Awareness programs continually push the security message to users in a
   variety of formats and provide security information to users.

Q. What is security training?
A. Security training strives to produce relevant and needed security knowledge and
   skills within the workforce. Training supports competency development and helps
   personnel understand and learn how to perform their security role. Security
   training provides general security courses that are appropriate and applicable to
   the entire workforce and offers role-based training that is tailored to the specific
   needs of each security role.

Q. How can an awareness and training program be established?
A. A viable awareness and training program takes time and, if starting from scratch,
   a phased approach will be best. An awareness and training program can be
   established by following a five-phase process, designed to populate an awareness
   and training program:
       1.   Analysis;
       2.   Design;
       3.   Development;
       4.   Implementation; and
       5.   Evaluation.
   Specific details can be found in NIST SP 800-50, Building an Information
   Technology Security Awareness and Training Program, and NIST SP 800-16,
   Information Technology Security Training Requirements: A Role-and
   Performance-Based Model.

Q. How can an organization enhance security awareness?
A. An organization can enhance security awareness by establishing a continual
   program that uses a variety of methods, including:
   • Tools to promote the security cause, including events, such as a security
     awareness day promotional materials, and rules of behavior;
   • Communication of security-related material with users, managers, executives,
     system owners, and others through activities, such as assessment (as is/to be
     models), strategic plan, and program implementation;
   • Outreach to leverage internal and external awareness “best practices,” such as
     Web portals, security e-newsletters, and FAQs; and
   • Metrics to measure the effectiveness of the awareness program.

Q. When should an awareness and training program be changed?
A. Awareness and training programs should be continually changing to meet the
   unique needs of your environment, culture, business, and mission. Programs
   should continue to evolve as new technology and associated security issues
   emerge. Training needs will shift as new skills and capabilities become necessary
   to respond to new policy and the resultant architectural and technological
   changes. A change in the organizational mission and/or objectives will influence
   ideas on how best to design training solutions and content. Emerging issues, such
   as homeland defense, will also impact the nature and extent of professional
   development activities that will be necessary to keep users informed/educated
   about the latest threats, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures. Finally, as security
   policies evolve, awareness and training material should reflect these changes.
