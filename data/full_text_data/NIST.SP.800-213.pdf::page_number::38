                                                                                                   the IoT device and document as such. Justifiable reasons include:

                                                                                                      a. The goal of the security control does not apply to the proposed use case,
                                                                                                      b. Another security control that does not require direct support from the IoT
                                                                                                         device/manufacturer may be selected, or
                                                                                                      c. The residual risk introduced by the lack of support for the security control is
                                                                                                         acceptable to the organization.

                                                                                                2. Determine that support for the security control provided by an alternative capability is
                                                                                                   acceptable and requires no change in security control.

                                                                                                3. Determine that support provided by an alternative capability is acceptable but requires a
                                                                                                   change in security control.

                                                                                                4. Determine that the IoT device’s lack of support or alternative support for the security

                                                                                             As summarized in Figure 8, three of the four determinations mean an organization can likely
