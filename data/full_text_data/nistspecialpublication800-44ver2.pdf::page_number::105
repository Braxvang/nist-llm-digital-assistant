      Accepted practices

      Criticality of data to organization

 Organizational guidelines and policies.

Although each organization’s Web server backup policy will be different to reflect its particular
environment, it should address the following issues:

 Purpose of the policy

 Parties affected by the policy

 Web servers covered by the policy

 Definitions of key terms, especially legal and technical

 Detailed requirements from the legal, business, and organization’s perspective

 Required frequency of backups

 Procedures for ensuring data is properly retained and protected

 Procedures for ensuring data is properly destroyed or archived when no longer required

 Procedures for preserving information for Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, legal
  investigations, and other such requests

 Responsibilities of those involved in data retention, protection, and destruction activities

 Retention period for each type of information logged 76

 Specific duties of a central/organizational data backup team, if one exists.

Three primary types of backups exist: full, incremental, and differential. Full backups include the OS,
applications, and data stored on the Web server (i.e., an image of every piece of data stored on the Web
server hard drives). The advantage of a full backup is that it is easy to restore the entire Web server to the
state (e.g., configuration, patch level, data) it was in when the backup was performed. The disadvantage
of full backups is that they take considerable time and resources to perform. Incremental backups reduce
the impact of backups by backing up only data that has changed since the previous backup (either full or
incremental).

Differential backups reduce the number of backup sets that must be accessed to restore a configuration by
backing up all changed data since the last full backup. However, each differential backup increases as

     Organizations should carefully consider the retention period for Web transaction logs and other Web server-related records.
     Many organizations are subject to multiple sets of legal and regulatory requirements that can affect their retention of Web
     records. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has a Web site for Federal records management,
     which is located at http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/.
