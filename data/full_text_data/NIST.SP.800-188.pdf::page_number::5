Abstract

De-identifcation is a general term for any process of removing the association between
a set of identifying data and the data subject. This document describes the use of de-
identifcation with the goal of preventing or limiting disclosure risks to individuals and
establishments while still allowing for the production of meaningful statistical analysis.
Government agencies can use de-identifcation to reduce the privacy risk associated with
collecting, processing, archiving, distributing, or publishing government data. Previously,
NIST IR 8053, De-Identifcation of Personal Information, provided a detailed survey of de-
identifcation and re-identifcation techniques. This document provides specifc guidance
to government agencies that wish to use de-identifcation. Before using de-identifcation,
agencies should evaluate their goals for using de-identifcation and the potential risks that
releasing de-identifed data might create. Agencies should decide upon a data-sharing
model, such as publishing de-identifed data, publishing synthetic data based on identi-
fed data, providing a query interface that incorporates de-identifcation, or sharing data in
non-public protected enclaves. Agencies can create a Disclosure Review Board to over-
see the process of de-identifcation. They can also adopt a de-identifcation standard with
measurable performance levels and perform re-identifcation studies to gauge the risk asso-
ciated with de-identifcation. Several specifc techniques for de-identifcation are available,
including de-identifcation by removing identifers, transforming quasi-identifers, and gen-
erating synthetic data using models. People who perform de-identifcation generally use
special-purpose software tools to perform the data manipulation and calculate the likely
risk of re-identifcation. However, not all tools that merely mask personal information pro-
vide suffcient functionality for performing de-identifcation. This document also includes
an extensive list of references, a glossary, and a list of specifc de-identifcation tools, which
is only included to convey the range of tools currently available and is not intended to imply
a recommendation or endorsement by NIST.
