3.3    Symbols

      Symbol         Meaning
                    Bit-wise exclusive-or.
         ||          Concatenation.
                     The ceiling of a: the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to
         a
                     a. For example, 5 = 5, 5.3 = 6, and –2.1 = –2.
         C           Iteration count.
       hLen          The length of the output of PRF in bits.
                     32-bit encoding of integer i, with the most significant bit on the
       Int(i)
                     left.
       kLen          The length of the output of PBKDF in bits.
                     An integer that represents the number of PRF output blocks to be
        len          concatenated in order to obtain kLen bits of MK, i.e.,
                     len = kLen / hLen
        mk           The MK derived using the PBKDF.
         P           A password or passphrase, represented as a binary string.

      purpose        A binary string defined for a specific application, message or a
                     user which is optionally prepended to the randomly generated part
