                                                                  COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE



      should be on the incident response team. This information can be communicated through many
      means: workshops, websites, newsletters, posters, and even stickers on monitors and laptops.
 Information Sharing. Incident response teams often participate in information sharing groups, such
  as ISACs or regional partnerships. Accordingly, incident response teams often manage the
  organization’s incident information sharing efforts, such as aggregating information related to
  incidents and effectively sharing that information with other organizations, as well as ensuring that
  pertinent information is shared within the enterprise.
2.6     Recommendations

The key recommendations presented in this section for organizing a computer security incident handling
capability are summarized below.

 Establish a formal incident response capability. Organizations should be prepared to respond
  quickly and effectively when computer security defenses are breached. FISMA requires Federal
  agencies to establish incident response capabilities.
 Create an incident response policy. The incident response policy is the foundation of the incident
  response program. It defines which events are considered incidents, establishes the organizational
  structure for incident response, defines roles and responsibilities, and lists the requirements for
  reporting incidents, among other items.
 Develop an incident response plan based on the incident response policy. The incident response
  plan provides a roadmap for implementing an incident response program based on the organization’s
  policy. The plan indicates both short- and long-term goals for the program, including metrics for
  measuring the program. The incident response plan should also indicate how often incident handlers
  should be trained and the requirements for incident handlers.
 Develop incident response procedures. The incident response procedures provide detailed steps for
  responding to an incident. The procedures should cover all the phases of the incident response
  process. The procedures should be based on the incident response policy and plan.
 Establish policies and procedures regarding incident-related information sharing. The
  organization should communicate appropriate incident details with outside parties, such as the media,
  law enforcement agencies, and incident reporting organizations. The incident response team should
  discuss this with the organization’s public affairs office, legal department, and management to
  establish policies and procedures regarding information sharing. The team should comply with
  existing organization policy on interacting with the media and other outside parties.
 Provide pertinent information on incidents to the appropriate organization. Federal civilian
  agencies are required to report incidents to US-CERT; other organizations can contact US-CERT
  and/or their ISAC. Reporting is beneficial because US-CERT and the ISACs use the reported data to
  provide information to the reporting parties regarding new threats and incident trends.
 Consider the relevant factors when selecting an incident response team model. Organizations
  should carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each possible team structure model and
  staffing model in the context of the organization’s needs and available resources.
 Select people with appropriate skills for the incident response team. The credibility and
  proficiency of the team depend to a large extent on the technical skills and critical thinking abilities of
  its members. Critical technical skills include system administration, network administration,
  programming, technical support, and intrusion detection. Teamwork and communications skills are
