                                                                                                 A hierarchical PKI is one in which all of the end entities and relying parties use a single "root CA"
                                                                                                 as their trust anchor. If the hierarchy has multiple levels, the root CA certifies the public keys of
                                                                                                 intermediate CAs (also known as subordinate CAs). These CAs then certify end entities'

                                                                                                 Typically, only one superior CA certifies each CA. Certification path building in a hierarchical

                                                                                                 A widely used variation on the single-rooted hierarchical PKI is the inclusion of multiple CAs as

                                                                                                 with any hierarchical PKI. The difference is that a certificate will be accepted if it can be verified
                                                                                                 back to any of the set of trust anchors.
