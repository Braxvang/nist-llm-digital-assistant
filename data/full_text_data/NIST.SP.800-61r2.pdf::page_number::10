                                                                     COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE



Executive Summary

Computer security incident response has become an important component of information technology (IT)
programs. Cybersecurity-related attacks have become not only more numerous and diverse but also more
damaging and disruptive. New types of security-related incidents emerge frequently. Preventive activities
based on the results of risk assessments can lower the number of incidents, but not all incidents can be
prevented. An incident response capability is therefore necessary for rapidly detecting incidents,
minimizing loss and destruction, mitigating the weaknesses that were exploited, and restoring IT services.
To that end, this publication provides guidelines for incident handling, particularly for analyzing incident-
related data and determining the appropriate response to each incident. The guidelines can be followed
independently of particular hardware platforms, operating systems, protocols, or applications.

Because performing incident response effectively is a complex undertaking, establishing a successful
incident response capability requires substantial planning and resources. Continually monitoring for
attacks is essential. Establishing clear procedures for prioritizing the handling of incidents is critical, as is
implementing effective methods of collecting, analyzing, and reporting data. It is also vital to build
relationships and establish suitable means of communication with other internal groups (e.g., human
resources, legal) and with external groups (e.g., other incident response teams, law enforcement).

This publication assists organizations in establishing computer security incident response capabilities and
handling incidents efficiently and effectively. This revision of the publication, Revision 2, updates
material throughout the publication to reflect the changes in attacks and incidents. Understanding threats
and identifying modern attacks in their early stages is key to preventing subsequent compromises, and
proactively sharing information among organizations regarding the signs of these attacks is an
increasingly effective way to identify them.

Implementing the following requirements and recommendations should facilitate efficient and effective
incident response for Federal departments and agencies.

Organizations must create, provision, and operate a formal incident response capability. Federal
law requires Federal agencies to report incidents to the United States Computer Emergency
Readiness Team (US-CERT) office within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requires Federal agencies to establish
incident response capabilities. Each Federal civilian agency must designate a primary and secondary point
of contact (POC) with US-CERT and report all incidents consistent with the agency’s incident response
policy. Each agency is responsible for determining how to fulfill these requirements.

Establishing an incident response capability should include the following actions:

 Creating an incident response policy and plan
 Developing procedures for performing incident handling and reporting
 Setting guidelines for communicating with outside parties regarding incidents
 Selecting a team structure and staffing model
 Establishing relationships and lines of communication between the incident response team and other
  groups, both internal (e.g., legal department) and external (e.g., law enforcement agencies)
 Determining what services the incident response team should provide
