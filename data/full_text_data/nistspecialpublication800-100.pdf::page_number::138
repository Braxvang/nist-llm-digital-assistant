CHAPTER 13                                                         Incident Response


the incident have been predetermined. Organizations should define acceptable risks
in dealing with incidents and develop strategies accordingly.
    Containment strategies vary based on the type of incident. For example, the
overall strategy for containing an e-mail-borne virus infection is quite different from
that of a network-based distributed denial of service attack. Organizations should
create separate containment strategies for each major type of incident. The criteria
for choosing the appropriate strategy should be documented clearly to facilitate quick
and effective decision making. Examples of criteria include potential damage to and
theft of resources, the need to preserve evidence, the effectiveness of the strategy,
the time and resources needed to implement the strategy, and the duration of the
solution.
   After an incident has been contained, eradication may be necessary to eliminate
components of the incident, such as deleting malicious code and disabling breached
user accounts. For some incidents, eradication is either unnecessary or is performed
during recovery. In recovery, administrators restore systems to normal operation
and (if applicable) harden systems to prevent similar incidents. Recovery may
involve such actions as:
    • Restoring systems from clean backups;
    • Rebuilding systems from scratch;
    • Replacing compromised files with clean versions;
    • Installing patches;
    • Changing passwords; and
    • Tightening network perimeter security (e.g., firewall rule sets).
    It is also often desirable to employ higher levels of system logging or network
monitoring as part of the recovery process. Once a resource is successfully
attacked, it is often attacked again, or other resources within the organization are
attacked in a similar manner

13.4 Post-Incident Activity
    After a major incident has been handled, the organization should hold a lessons-
learned meeting to review the effectiveness of the incident handling process and
identify necessary improvements to existing security controls and practices.
Lessons-learned meetings should also be held periodically for lesser incidents. The
information accumulated from all lessons-learned meetings, as well as the data
collected while handling each incident, should be used to identify systemic security
weaknesses and deficiencies in policies and procedures. Follow-up reports generated
for each resolved incident can be important for evidentiary purposes, used as a
reference in handling future incidents, and used in training new incident response
team members. An incident database, with detailed information on each incident
that occurs, can be another valuable source of information for incident handlers.
