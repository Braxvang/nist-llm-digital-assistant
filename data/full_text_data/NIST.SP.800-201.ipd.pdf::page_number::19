      NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                  Cloud Computing Forensic
      February 2023                                                                  Reference Architecture

545       The Forensic Reference Architecture Methodology
546   The Cloud Computing Forensic Reference Architecture introduced in this document aims to help
547   the user understand the cloud forensic challenges that might exist for an organization’s cloud
548   systems. When architecting or orchestrating a new cloud system, cloud architects and cloud
549   security and forensic practitioners are encouraged to use the CC FRA to identify which
550   challenges could impact the system and therefore require at least partial mitigation strategies to
551   minimize the risk incurred during operations by, for example, allowing real-time interventions
552   based on the proactively generated forensic data and to eliminate potential negative impacts on
553   digital forensic investigations if the need arises.
554   While the FRA can be used by any cloud computing practitioner, it is specifically designed to
555   help the following target audiences by finding answers for specific questions related to their
556   cloud computing architectures:
557       •   Target Audience #1: Cloud System Architects and Engineers. This target audience
558           might ask: “To what extent does the cloud system I’m designing facilitate the use of
559           digital forensics?” The architectural methodology and initial architecture presented in
560           this paper can help this audience identify where there could be potential challenges for
561           conducting forensics and can allow them to focus on areas of potential concern. System
562           trade-offs can be considered as well (e.g., the more that a system facilitates the use of
563           forensics, the greater the negative operational or economic impacts might be, or the
564           greater the chance that privacy might be impacted negatively).
565       •   Target Audience #2: Forensic Practitioners. This target audience might ask: “What
566           items do I need to be aware of to conduct digital forensics in the cloud environment
567           versus a traditional or on-premises computing environment?”
568       •   Target Audience #3: Consumers Who Want to Procure Cloud Services from Providers.
569           This target audience might ask: “What forensic questions and issues do I need to consider
570           when discussing what a cloud provider has to offer?”
571   The Cloud Computing Forensic Reference Architecture provides a useful starting point for all
572   cloud security and forensic stakeholders to analyze the extent to which the cloud forensic
573   challenges identified in NIST IR 8006 [1] are impacting their systems.
574   The 62 forensic challenges and 347 functional capabilities described in Section 2 and Section 3,
575   respectively, provide the basis for determining which capabilities are affected by each of the
576   challenges. All possible pairs of challenges and capabilities are considered. The capabilities help
577   focus possible mitigation efforts as follows. If a challenge affects a capability, there may be
578   mitigation approaches that can be used to perform better forensics with regard to that capability.
579   Such information could prove useful for forensic practitioners, developers, and researchers.
580   The NCC FSWG has developed a mapping between functional capabilities and forensic
581   challenges. For each functional capability, the mapping shows all of the forensic challenges that
582   affect that capability. This has resulted in a Mapping Table of 347 rows (one for each capability)
583   and 62 columns (one for each challenge). An entry in the table is YES if the associated challenge
584   affects the associated capability; otherwise, the entry is NO. (See Figure 3 for an excerpt of this
585   table.)
