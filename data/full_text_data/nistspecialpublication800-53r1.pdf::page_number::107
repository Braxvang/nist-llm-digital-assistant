MP-5      MEDIA TRANSPORT

          Control: The organization protects and controls information system media during transport outside
          of controlled areas and restricts the activities associated with transport of such media to authorized
          personnel.
          Supplemental Guidance: Information system media includes both digital media (e.g., diskettes,
          tapes, removable hard drives, flash/thumb drives, compact disks, digital video disks) and non-
          digital media (e.g., paper, microfilm). A controlled area is any area or space for which the
          organization has confidence that the physical and procedural protections provided are sufficient to
          meet the requirements established for protecting the information and/or information system. This
          control also applies to portable and mobile computing and communications devices with
          information storage capability (e.g., notebook computers, personal digital assistants, cellular
          telephones) that are transported outside of controlled areas. Telephone systems are also
          considered information systems and may have the capability to store information on internal
          media (e.g., on voicemail systems). Since telephone systems do not have, in most cases, the
          identification, authentication, and access control mechanisms typically employed in other
          information systems, organizational personnel exercise extreme caution in the types of information
          stored on telephone voicemail systems that are transported outside of controlled areas. An
          organizational assessment of risk guides the selection of media and associated information
          contained on that media requiring protection during transport. Organizations document in policy
          and procedures, the media requiring protection during transport and the specific measures taken to
          protect such transported media. The rigor with which this control is applied is commensurate with
          the FIPS 199 security categorization of the information contained on the media. An organizational
          assessment of risk also guides the selection and use of appropriate storage containers for
          transporting non-digital media. Authorized transport and courier personnel may include
          individuals from outside the organization (e.g., U.S. Postal Service or a commercial transport or
          delivery service).
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization protects digital and non-digital media during transport outside of controlled areas
                using [Assignment: organization-defined security measures, e.g., locked container, cryptography].

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Physical and technical security measures for the
                protection of digital and non-digital media are approved by the organization, commensurate
                with the FIPS 199 security categorization of the information residing on the media, and
                consistent with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards,
                and guidance. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and/or integrity
                protections depending upon the mechanisms used.
          (2)   The organization documents, where appropriate, activities associated with the transport of
                information system media using [Assignment: organization-defined system of records].

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Organizations establish documentation requirements for
                activities associated with the transport of information system media in accordance with the
                organizational assessment of risk.
          (3)   The organization employs an identified custodian at all times to transport information system
                media.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Organizations establish documentation requirements for
                activities associated with the transport of information system media in accordance with the
                organizational assessment of risk.
