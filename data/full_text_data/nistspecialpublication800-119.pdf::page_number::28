  3.1.2      IPv6 Address Space Usage

This section introduces the different types of IPv6 addresses, their scope, and use. It introduces IPv6
addressing as basic information needed for secure adoption and deployment of the protocol. RFC 4291,
IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture, is the authoritative source for information on IPv6 addressing, and
it should be referenced for comprehensive details. Mechanisms for generating and assigning IPv6
addresses are discussed in detail in subsequent sections of this document.

IPv6 addressing differs from IPv4 in several ways aside from the address size. In both IPv4 and IPv6,
addresses specifically belong to interfaces, not to nodes. However, because IPv6 addresses are not in
short supply, interfaces often have multiple addresses. As discussed in 3.1, IPv6 addresses consist of a
network prefix in the higher order bits and an interface identifier in the lower order bits. Moreover, the
prefix indicates a subnet or link within a site, and a link can be assigned multiple subnet IDs.

Many IPv6 address ranges are reserved or defined for special purposes by the IETF’s IPv6 standards and
by the Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA). Table 3-2 lists the major assignments and how to
identify the different types of IPv6 address from the high-order bits.
