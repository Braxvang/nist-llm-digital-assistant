2.      Introduction to IPv6

Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a new network layer protocol. It is an enhancement to Internet
Protocol version 4 (IPv4), the protocol in use since the 1980s. There are numerous upgrades in IPv6.
Most significantly, in comparison with IPv4, IPv6 has increased its network address size from 32 bits to
128. This provides more than enough addresses to satisfy the global demand for unique IP addresses.

This chapter provides an overview of IPv6 as a foundation for later sections. The section starts with the
early history of IPv6 and the limitations of IPv4, followed by descriptions of the major features of the
IPv6 specifications. This is followed by a threat comparison between IPv4 and IPv6 and concludes with
motivations for deploying to IPv6.

2.1     Early History of IPv6

IPv4 was developed in the 1970s and early 1980s for use in government and academic communities in the
United States to facilitate communication and information sharing. Today’s networking demand, in
particular web pages, email, peer-to-peer services, and the use of mobile devices, has grown well beyond
its originators’ expectations. Widespread deployment and growth of networking technologies and mobile
communications have surpassed IPv4’s ability to provide adequate globally unique address space4.

Efforts to develop a successor to IPv4 started in the early 1990s within the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF)5. The objective was to solve the address space limitations as well as provide additional
functionality. The IETF started the Internet Protocol Next Generation (IPng) work in 1993 to investigate
different proposals and to make recommendations for further actions. The IETF recommended IPv6 in
1994. (The name IPv5 had previously been allocated to an experimental stream protocol.) Their
recommendation is specified in RFC 1752, The Recommendation for IP Next Generation Protocol.
Several proposals followed; the Internet Engineering Steering Group approved the IPv6 recommendation
and drafted a Proposed Standard on November 17, 1994. RFC 1883, Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6)
Specification, was published in 1995. The core set of IPv66 protocols became an IETF Draft Standard on
August 10, 1998. This included RFC 2460, which replaced RFC 1883.

IPv6 is a protocol designed to handle the growth rate of the Internet and to cope with the demanding
requirements of services, mobility, and end-to-end security. The following sections describe the
limitations of IPv4, the major features of IPv6, and motivations for deploying IPv6.

2.2     Limitations of IPv4

IPv4 (RFC 791) was designed over 30 years ago for a relatively small number of users. At that time, it
seemed unlikely that personal computing technology would become as widespread as it is today in the
United States and worldwide. The rapid, universal adoption and growth of personal computing
technologies, including IP networking, were unforeseen in 1981. At that time, the Internet was used
almost exclusively by scholars and researchers, and IPv4’s 4.3 billion theoretically available addresses
were considered to be more than sufficient.

      The IETF is an open international community charged with the evolution of the Internet architectures and standards. An
      Internet standard begins as an Internet Draft, which generally evolves during the publication of successive versions. It may
      then be published as a Request for Comments (RFC) document. Some RFCs define IETF standards; others are informational
      documents or describe experimental protocols.

      Two current IETF working groups that concentrate on IPv6 operations and protocols are the IPv6 Operations (v6ops)
      Working Group and the IPv6 Maintenance (6man ) Working group.
