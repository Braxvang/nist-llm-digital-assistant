IDENTIFY VULNERABILITIES AND PREDISPOSING CONDITIONS
TASK 2-3: Identify vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions that affect the likelihood that threat events of
concern result in adverse impacts.
Supplemental Guidance: The primary purpose of vulnerability assessments is to understand the nature and degree to
which organizations, mission/business processes, and information systems are vulnerable to threat sources identified in
Task 2-1 and the threat events identified in Task 2-2 that can be initiated by those threat sources. Vulnerabilities at Tier
1 can be pervasive across organizations and can have wide-ranging adverse impacts if exploited by threat events. For
example, organizational failure to consider supply chain activities can result in organizations acquiring subverted
components that adversaries could exploit to disrupt organizational missions/business functions or to obtain sensitive
organizational information. Vulnerabilities at Tier 2 can be described in terms of organizational mission/business
processes, enterprise architecture, the use of multiple information systems, or common infrastructures/shared services.
At Tier 2, vulnerabilities typically cross or span information system boundaries. Vulnerabilities at Tier 3 can be
described in terms of the information technologies employed within organizational information systems, the
environments in which those systems operate, and/or the lack of or weaknesses in system-specific security controls.
There is potentially a many-to-many relationship between threat events and vulnerabilities. Multiple threat events can
exploit a single vulnerability, and conversely, multiple vulnerabilities can be exploited by a single threat event. The
severity of a vulnerability is an assessment of the relative importance of mitigating such a vulnerability. Initially, the
extent to which mitigation is unplanned can serve as a surrogate for vulnerability severity. Once the risks associated
with a particular vulnerability have been assessed, the impact severity and exposure of the vulnerability given the
security controls implemented and other vulnerabilities can be taken into consideration in assessing vulnerability
severity. Assessments of vulnerability severity support risk response. Vulnerabilities can be identified at varying
degrees of granularity and specificity. The level of detail provided in any particular vulnerability assessment is
consistent with the purpose of the risk assessment and the type of inputs needed to support follow-on likelihood and
impact determinations.
Due to the ever-increasing size and complexity of organizations, mission/business processes, and the information
systems supporting those processes, the number of vulnerabilities tends to be large and can increase the overall
complexity of the analysis. Therefore, organizations have the option of using the vulnerability identification task to
understand the general nature of the vulnerabilities (including scope, number, and type) relevant to the assessment (see
Task 1-3) and performing a cataloging of specific vulnerabilities as necessary to do so. Organizations determine which
vulnerabilities are relevant to which threat events in order to reduce the space of potential risks to be assessed. In
addition to identifying vulnerabilities, organizations also identify any predisposing conditions which may affect
susceptibility to certain vulnerabilities. Predisposing conditions that exist within organizations (including
mission/business processes, information systems, and environments of operation) can contribute to (i.e., increase or
decrease) the likelihood that one or more threat events, once initiated by threat sources, result in adverse impacts to
organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation. Organizations
determine which predisposing conditions are relevant to which threat events in order to reduce the space of potential
risks to be assessed. Organizations assess the pervasiveness of predisposing conditions to support determination of the
tier(s) at which risk response could be most effective.
Appendix F provides a set of exemplary tables for use in identifying vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions:
• Table F-1 provides a set of exemplary inputs to the vulnerability and predisposing condition identification task;
• Table F-2 provides an exemplary assessment scale for assessing the severity of identified vulnerabilities;
• Table F-3 provides a template for summarizing/documenting the results of vulnerability identification;
• Table F-4 provides an exemplary taxonomy that can be used to identify and characterize predisposing conditions;
• Table F-5 provides an exemplary assessment scale for assessing the pervasiveness of predisposing conditions; and
• Table F-6 provides a template for summarizing/documenting the results of identifying predisposing conditions.
The information produced in Task 2-3 provides vulnerability and predisposing condition inputs to the risk tables in
Appendix I.
