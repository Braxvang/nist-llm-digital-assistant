additional vulnerabilities may be uncovered during follow-up security tests. An organization may also
choose to verify implementation of the mitigation strategy through nontechnical means such as
documentation. For example, it may be appropriate and cost-effective to hold the security personnel
responsible for implementing the mitigation strategy accountable by requesting that they sign a document
describing all of the accomplished actions. While this method is more cost-effective in the short term for
an organization, there are risks posed by not technically verifying that changes have been implemented.

Last, as part of the implementation strategy, it is important to continuously update POA&Ms to identify
activities that have been accomplished, partially accomplished, or are pending action by another
individual or system. Ensuring that the POA&M is integrated into the organizationâ€™s configuration
management process will facilitate centralized tracking and management of changes to systems, policies,
processes, and procedures, as well as provide an oversight mechanism that will address compliance
requirements.
