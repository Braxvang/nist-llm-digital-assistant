NIST SP 800-58                                             Voice Over IP Security
    _________________________________________________________________________

      SEQUENCE NUMBER and DATA fields as defined in RFC 2402. The semantics
      of the header fields are the same as the "transport mode" of RFC 2402, except for
      the calculation of the Integrity Check Value. For more details on the calculation
      of the ICV check H.248. The interim AH interim scheme does not provide
      protection against the eavesdropping and replay attacks.

      For MEGACO, manual key management is assumed and replay protection,
      defined for IPsec, may not be used in this scenario (the sequence number in the
      AH may overrun when using manual key management, since re-keying is not
      possible). Furthermore, H.248 states that implementations employing the ESP
      header shall provide a minimum set of algorithms for integrity checking and
      encryption (compliant to RFC 2402). Moreover, implementations should use IKE
      (RFC 2409) to permit more robust keying options. Implementations employing
      IKE should support authentication with RSA signatures and RSA public key
      encryption.
