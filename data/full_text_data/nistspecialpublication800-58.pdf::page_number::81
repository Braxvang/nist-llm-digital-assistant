NIST SP 800-58                                              Voice Over IP Security

      are not used in the volume needed to overwhelm the crypto-engines or congest the
      network enough to cause a significant downturn in QoS. Thus it is not clear that
      the large-scale implementation of a VPN tunneling system for VOIP is an
      effective solution for an enterprise network [see Broadcom in 27], as there is
      significant overhead associated with VOIPsec. Also, the ability to use firewalls
      for analyzing VOIP traffic for malicious or suspicious patterns would be lost.
      This being said, the implementation of VOIP aware firewalls and proxies incurs a
      significant cost now and in the future. Such protocol specific hardware would
      need to be upgraded each time standards evolve. A third solution that has not
      been fully developed yet is a hybrid system, where call setup information (H.323
      or SIP) is sent through a VOIP aware gateway/firewall but the RTP traffic itself is
      encrypted and tunneled over VPN. The call setup protocols could be secured
      using their proprietary authentication mechanisms [17] in place of the IPsec
      tunnel. This would seemingly combine the network protection of the firewall and
      the data security/protection of IPsec. Also, the robust authentication mechanisms
      and abstraction of the voice network from the data network accomplished by SIP
      proxies and H.323 gateways/gatekeepers would be preserved. However, no
      expanded study has been done on the ramifications of this hybrid approach.

      There are a number of privacy issues regarding storage of call detail records.
      Agencies and other organizations should review these issues with their legal
      advisors. US Government guidance on these issues includes the following:

      •   the Privacy Act of 1974.

      •   Office of Management and Budget "Guidance on the Privacy Act Implications of
          Call Detail Programs to Manage Employees' Use of the Government's
          Telecommunication System" (See FEDERAL REGISTER, 52 FR 12990, April 20,
          1987).

      •   NARA General Records Schedule 12, which requires a 36-month retention of
          telephone CDR records

      • 21 CFR 102-172, Federal Management Regulation (FMR),
         Telecommunications Management Policy. 21 CFR 102-172 . Note that 21
         CFR 102-172 replaces 21 CFR 101-35, Federal Property Management
         Regulation (FPMR), Telecommunications Management Policy, which expired
         in August 2001.


      The construction of a VOIP network is an intricate procedure that should be
      studied in great detail before being attempted. New risks can be introduced, and
      vulnerabilities of data packet networks appear in new guises for VOIP (see
      Appendix A for more detailed discussion of vulnerabilities of VOIP and their
      relation to data network vulnerabilities). The integration of a VOIP system into an
      already congested or overburdened network could be catastrophic for an
