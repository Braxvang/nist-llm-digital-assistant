SAMPLE SYSTEM TEST VALIDATION

A test of any system requires methods and criteria to evaluate whether the system test and associated
component tests or processes worked as intended. Test validation should include the metrics by which
the success of the component or process will be measured and detail the expected outcome. System test
validation can be determined by the validation of each individual component test objectives and
validation.

In this example, validation for this system test should verify the backup proceduresâ€™ accuracy and
equipment functionality for backing up data for its associated type of systems; verify data integrity
checking; validate local and offsite data storage and retrieval procedures; and verify system restoration
function as expected for each associated type of system.
