G.1.4. Curve P-521
The modulus for this curve is p = 2 521 – 1. Each integer A less than p2 can be written as
                                              A = A1 ⋅ 2521 + A0,
where each A i is a 521-bit integer. As a concatenation of 521-bit words, this can be denoted by
                                                 A = (A1 || A0).
The expression for B is
                                             B = (A0 + A1) mod p.

G.1.5. Curve25519
The modulus for this curve is p = 2255– 19. Each integer A less than p2 can be written
A = A9⋅ 2230 +A8 ⋅ 2204 + A7 ⋅ 2179 + A6 ⋅ 2153 + A5 ⋅ 2128 + A4 ⋅ 2102 + A3 ⋅ 277 + A2 ⋅ 251 +A1 ⋅ 226 + A0,
where each Ai is a 64-bit integer. As a concatenation of 64-bit words, this can be denoted by
                           A = (A9 || A8 || A7 || A6 || A5 || A4 || A3 || A2 || A1 || A0).

G.1.6. Curve448
The modulus for this curve is p = 2448−2224 – 1. Each integer A less than p2 can be written
                                 A = A3 ⋅ 2672 + A2 ⋅ 2448 + A1 ⋅ 2224 + A0,
where each A i is a 224-bit integer. As a concatenation of 224-bit words, this can be denoted by
                                           A = (A3 || A2 || A1 || A0).
The expression for B is
                                       B = (S1 + S2 + S3 + S4) mod p,
where the 448-bit terms are given by
    S1 = ( A1 || A0)
    S2 = ( A2 || A2)
    S3 = ( A3 || A3)
    S4 = ( A3 || 0).

G.2.    Scalar Multiplication for Koblitz Curves
This section describes a particularly efficient method of computing the scalar multiple Q:= kP on
the Koblitz curve Wa,b over GF(2m).
The operation τ is defined by
                                               τ (x, y) := (x2, y2).
