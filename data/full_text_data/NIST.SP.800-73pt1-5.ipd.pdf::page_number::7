      NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1
      September 2023                                 PIV Card Application Namespace, Data Model, and Representation

109   Configuration Management
110   When a federal agency adds one or several of the optional features listed in Appendix G to its
111   PIV Cards, client applications must upgrade the PIV Middleware accordingly. This will enable
112   the PIV Middleware to recognize and process the new data objects and/or features.
113   Where maximum interoperability is required, it is necessary to upgrade to SP 800-73-5-based
114   PIV Middleware as they become available. Only SP 800-73-5-based PIV Middleware fully
115   support all capabilities outlined in Appendix G. Previous versions of the PIV Middleware (based
116   on SP 800-73-4 or older versions) are unaware of new SP 800-73-5 features and may have some
117   limitations.

118   NPIVP Conformance Testing
119   As outlined in FIPS 201-3, Appendix A.3, NIST has established the NIST Personal Identity
120   Verification Program (NPIVP) to:
121       •   Validate the compliance and conformance of PIV Middleware and PIV Card
122           Applications with the specifications in SP 800-73
123       •   Provide assurance that the PIV Middleware and PIV Card Applications validated by
124           NPIVP are interoperable
125   For further information on NPIVP, see https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/nist-personal-identity-
126   verification-program.
127   With the final release of SP 800-73-5, NPIVP plans to revise and publish SP 800-85A-5, PIV
128   Card Application and Middleware Interface Test Guidelines. This document will outline the
129   Derived Test Requirements (DTRs) of SP 800-73-5 based PIV Card Applications and PIV
130   Middleware. In parallel, NPIVP plans to update the test tools (Test Runner) for NPIVP
131   laboratories to test PIV Card Applications in accordance with the DTRs in SP 800-85A-5. The
132   Test Runner will not be updated for PIV Middleware testing because smart card support is
133   natively supported by most endpoint devices. Hence, with this revision, SP 800-73-5 Part 3 is
134   optional, and NPIVP conformance testing for PIV Middleware in accordance with SP 800-73
135   Part 3 is discontinued.
136   Once SP 800-85A-5 is published and the test tools are available to NPIVP test laboratories, SP
137   800-73-4 based testing will be discontinued, and SP 800-73-5-based testing will begin. NPIVP
138   will announce the start of SP 800-73-5-based testing at https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/nist-
139   personal-identity-verification-program/announcements.

140   Terminology
141   Throughout this publication the following terminology will be used:
142       •   SP 800-73-5 refers collectively to the three-part report, Interfaces for Personal Identity
143           Verification.
144       •   SP 800-73-5 Part [#] refers to a specific part of SP 800-73-5.
