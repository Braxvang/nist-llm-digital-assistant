        Completed                                         Action
                    Perform logging
                    Use the combined log format for storing the Transfer Log or manually configure
                    the information described by the combined log format to be the standard format
                    for the Transfer Log
                    Enable the Referrer Log or Agent Log if the combined log format is unavailable
                    Establish different log file names for different virtual Web sites that may be
                    implemented as part of a single physical Web server
                    Use the remote user identity as specified in RFC 1413
                    Store logs on a separate (syslog) host
                    Ensure there is sufficient capacity for the logs
                    Archive logs according to organizational requirements
                    Review logs daily
                    Review logs weekly (for more long-term trends)
                    Use automated log file analysis tool(s)
                    Perform Web server backups
                    Create a Web server backup policy
                    Back up Web server differentially or incrementally on a daily to weekly basis
                    Back up Web server fully on a weekly to monthly basis
                    Periodically archive backups
                    Maintain an authoritative copy of Web site(s)
                    Recover from a compromise
                    Report the incident to the organizationâ€™s computer incident response capability
                    Isolate the compromised system(s) or take other steps to contain the attack so
                    additional information can be collected
                    Investigate similar hosts to determine if the attacker has also compromised other
                    systems
                    Consult, as appropriate, with management, legal counsel, and law enforcement
                    officials expeditiously

                    Analyze the intrusion
                    Restore the system
                    Test system to ensure security
                    Reconnect system to network
                    Monitor system and network for signs that the attacker is attempting to access
                    the system or network again
                    Document lessons learned
                    Test security
                    Periodically conduct vulnerability scans on Web server, dynamically generated
                    content, and supporting network
                    Update vulnerability scanner prior to testing
                    Correct any deficiencies identified by the vulnerability scanner
                    Conduct penetration testing on the Web server and the supporting network
                    infrastructure
                    Correct deficiencies identified by penetration testing
