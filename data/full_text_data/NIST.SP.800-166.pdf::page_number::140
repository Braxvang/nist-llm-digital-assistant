Appendix C—Glossary of Terms

 Application      A part of the application layer in the Open Systems Interconnection
 Protocol         Reference model that is used for communication between two separate
 Data Unit        device's applications. In the context of smart cards, an APDU is the
                  communication unit between a smart card reader and a smart card. The
                  structure of the APDU is defined by [ISO7816-4].

 Derived PIV      A standardized application residing on a cryptographic token that hosts a
 Application      Derived PIV Credential and associated mandatory and optional elements.

 Derived PIV      An X.509 Derived PIV Authentication certificate, which is issued in
 Credential       accordance with the requirements specified in [SP800-157], where the PIV
                  Authentication certificate on the Applicant’s PIV Card serves as the original
                  credential. The Derived PIV Credential is an additional common identity
                  credential under [HSPD12] and [FIPS201] that is issued by a federal
                  department or agency and that is used with mobile devices

All other significant technical terms used within this document are defined in other key
documents including [FIPS201], [SP800-63], and [SP800-73].
