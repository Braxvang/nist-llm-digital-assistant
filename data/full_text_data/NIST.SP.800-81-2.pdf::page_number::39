6.        DNS Transactions—Threats, Security Objectives, and Protection
          Approaches

The threats to a DNS transaction depend on the type of transaction. Name resolution queries and
responses (DNS query/response) between DNS clients (stub resolver or resolving name server) and DNS
servers (caching/resolving name server or authoritative name server) could involve any nodes in the
Internet; hence, the threats against them are much greater in number and severity compared to those for
zone transfer, dynamic update, and DNS NOTIFY transactions. In general, the nodes involved in zone
transfer, dynamic update, and DNS NOTIFY transactions are all within the administrative domain of a
single organization. The only exceptions are instances in which the primary or secondary name servers of
an organization are run on its behalf by ISPs or other organizations. There usually is a preexisting trust
relationship in these cases, however, so it is not difficult to set up a mutual authentication system for DNS
zone transfers.

This section seeks to identify protocol-based threats to the operation and administration of the DNS. This
section also lists DNS protocol methods to address these threats. Non-DNS protocol based solutions such
as IPsec are beyond the scope of this document but could be a more appropriate solution for an
organizations based on its infrastructure.

6.1       DNS Query/Response Threats and Protection Approaches

DNS name resolution queries and responses (DNS query/response) generally involve single, unsigned,
and unencrypted UDP packets. The known threats to DNS query/response transactions have been
documented in IETF RFC 3833 [RFC3833] and can be classified as follows:

      •    Threat T12: Forged or bogus response

      •    Threat T13: Removal of some RRs from the response

      •    Threat T14: Incorrect expansion rules applied to wildcard RRs in a zone file.
6.1.1      Forged or Bogus Response

A forged or bogus response is a response that is different from the one that is expected from a legitimate
authoritative name server. A bogus response can originate from:

      •    A compromised authoritative name server (for queries originating from a resolving name server)

      •    A poisoned cache of a resolving name server (for queries originating from a stub resolver).
An authoritative name server could be compromised by a platform-level attack on its OS or
communication stack (see Section 5.1).

The cache of a resolving (caching) name server could be poisoned by the following attacks:

      •    Packet Interception. In this type of attack, the attacker eavesdrops on a request and is able to
           generate and send a response by spoofing an authoritative name server before the real response
           from the legitimate authoritative name server reaches the resolving name server.
