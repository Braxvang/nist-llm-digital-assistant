a single key to the block cipher must be established beforehand among the parties to the data;
thus, CCM should be implemented within a well-designed key management structure. The
security properties of CCM depend, at a minimum, on the secrecy of the key.

CCM is intended for use in a packet environment, i.e., when all of the data is available in storage
before CCM is applied; CCM is not designed to support partial processing or stream processing.
The input to CCM includes three elements: 1) data that will be both authenticated and encrypted,
called the payload; 2) associated data, e.g., a header, that will be authenticated but not encrypted;
and 3) a unique value, called a nonce, that is assigned to the payload and the associated data.

CCM consists of two related processes: generation-encryption and decryption-verification, which
combine two cryptographic primitives: counter mode encryption and cipher block chaining-
based authentication. Only the forward cipher function of the block cipher algorithm is used
within these primitives.

In generation-encryption, cipher block chaining is applied to the payload, the associated data,
and the nonce to generate a message authentication code (MAC); then, counter mode encryption
is applied to the MAC and the payload to transform them into an unreadable form, called the
ciphertext. Thus, CCM generation-encryption expands the size of the payload by the size of the
MAC. In decryption-verification, counter mode decryption is applied to the purported ciphertext
to recover the MAC and the corresponding payload; then, cipher block chaining is applied to the
payload, the received associated data, and the received nonce to verify the correctness of the
MAC. Successful verification provides assurance that the payload and the associated data
originated from a source with access to the key.

A MAC provides stronger assurance of authenticity than a checksum or an error detecting code.
The verification of a (non-cryptographic) checksum or an error detecting code is designed to
detect only accidental modifications of the data, while the verification of a MAC, as occurs in
CCM, is designed to detect intentional, unauthorized modifications of the data, as well as
accidental modifications.

This specification of CCM is intended to be compatible with the use of CCM within the draft
amendment [4] to the IEEE Standard 802.11 for wireless local area networks [5].
