GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



software for centralized logging is the syslog protocol, which provides a simple standard framework for
log generation, storage, and transfer that any IDPS can use if designed to do so. Syslog is very flexible
for log sources, because each syslog entry contains a content field into which logging sources can place
information in any format. However, this flexibility makes analysis of the log data challenging. Each
IDPS may use many different formats for its log message content, so a robust analysis program would
need to be familiar with each format and be able to extract the meaning of the data within the fields of
each format. Generally, the use of syslog for centralized collection and analysis of IDPS logs does not
provide sufficiently strong analysis capabilities to support incident identification and handling.

In addition to dedicated IDPSs, organizations typically have several other types of technologies that offer
some IDPS capabilities and complement, but do not replace, the primary IDPSs. These include network
forensic analysis tools, anti-malware technologies (antivirus software and antispyware software), and
firewalls and routers.
