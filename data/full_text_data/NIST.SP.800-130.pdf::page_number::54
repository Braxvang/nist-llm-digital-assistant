with the key, but it may be impractical to remember all the values of every metadata
element associated with a key. Therefore, the list metadata function may be very useful.

FR:6.45 For each key type, the CKMS design shall specify which metadata can be listed
by authorized entities.

6.4.14 Store Operational Key and Metadata
Operational key and metadata storage involves the moving of keys and/or metadata to a
medium from which the stored data may later be recovered. Keys and metadata should be
physically or cryptographically protected when stored outside of a cryptographic module
(see [SP 800-57-part1]).

FR:6.46 For each key type, the CKMS design shall specify: the circumstances under
which keys of each type and their metadata are stored, where the keys and metadata are
stored, and how the keys and metadata are protected.

6.4.15 Backup of a Key and its Metadata
Key and metadata backup involves the copying of keys and/or metadata to a safe facility
so that it can be recovered if the original (operational) copy is lost, modified, or otherwise
unavailable. Backup copies of keys and metadata may be located in the same or a
different facility than the operational keys/metadata to assure that the keys and metadata
can be recovered when needed, even after a natural or man-made disaster. Keys/metadata
may be backed-up by the owner or a trusted entity.

FR:6.47 The CKMS design shall specify how, where, and the circumstances under
which keys and their metadata are backed up.

FR:6.48 The CKMS design shall specify the security policy for the protection of backed-
up keys/metadata 13.

FR:6.49 The CKMS design shall specify how the security policy is implemented during
the key and metadata back-up, e.g., how the confidentiality and multi-party control
requirements are implemented during transport and storage of the backed-up keys and
metadata.

6.4.16 Archive Key and/or Metadata
The archive of keys and/or metadata involves placing keys and/or metadata in a safe,
long-term storage facility so that they can be recovered when needed. The archive
supports the Key and Metadata Retention Policy (see Section 4.3). Archived keys and/or
metadata must be physically or cryptographically protected. Keys used to protect the keys
and/or metadata in an archive are called archive keys. These archive keys will also have
cryptoperiods, and the continued protection provided to the archived keys and/or
metadata needs to be considered when the cryptoperiod of the archive key expires. This
