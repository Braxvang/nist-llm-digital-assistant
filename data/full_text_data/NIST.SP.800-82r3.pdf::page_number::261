OT Discussion: Configuration change control procedures should align with the organizationâ€™s
management of change practices.
Control Enhancement: (1) (2) (4) (6) No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (7) OT Discussion: The organization considers OT-specific requirements
when determining the frequency and/or circumstances for reviewing system changes. For
example, safety instrumented systems may be justified for the review of system changes on a
predetermined frequency to ensure that no inadvertent changes have been made to the logic
solver portion of a safety instrumented function.
Control Enhancement: (8) OT Discussion: The organization prevents or restricts configuration
changes based on a risk determination that the system should not be modified without additional
permission. For example, some PLCs have physical key switches that are used to place the PLC
in a mode that allows for programming changes. Physical key switches can restrict configuration
changes so that physical access is required to make a modification to the system.
