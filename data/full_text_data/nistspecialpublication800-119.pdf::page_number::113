Three main ideas dominate the work on new cryptographic methods for IPsec:

 Strengthen or find alternatives to hash-based Message Authentication Codes (MACs)
      In 2005, vulnerabilities were found to exist in SHA-1. NIST’s resulting policy42 on the use of hash
      functions recommends the use of alternative hash functions for digital signatures and other
      applications that require collision resistance; it requires the use of the SHA-2 family of hash
