      January 2023


118   technologies employed in the federal government, while maintaining a strong security
119   posture.
120   NIST is specifically interested in comments on and recommendations for the following
121   topics:
122   Home Agency Attributes:
123      • Are additional attributes needed in the guidelines to achieve interagency or cross-
124        domain interoperability?
125      • Are additional attributes required for RP provisioning and access?
126   PIV Federation:
127      • Are additional process steps or mechanism needed for the connection and
128        communication between home-IdP-to PIV identity account?
129      • Do the required parameters for establishing trust agreements fit the use cases for
130        PIV RPs?
131      • Are the required identity attributes sufficient for PIV use cases?
132      • Are the federated subject identifier requirements sufficient for PIV use cases?
133      • Is it clear how to apply the binding ceremony for RP-managed bound authenticators
134        at FAL3 to PIV and non-PIV authenticators?
