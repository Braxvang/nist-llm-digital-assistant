NIST defines a platform as a computer or hardware device, operating system, or virtual environment
on which software can be installed or run. The goal of the Trustworthy Platforms focus area is
to improve trust in the security and privacy of these systems and infrastructures by providing
guidance and technologies for the development and use of secure platforms, including software,
hardware, and firmware. A trustworthy platform is a dynamic ecosystem that depends on multiple
security and privacy technologies for reliable service delivery. It is deployed and maintained in a
measured state that is known to protect the security and privacy of users and data, and it performs
services in a consistent and reliable manner. The desired outcome of the NIST focus area is to
increase the adoption of trustworthy platforms in order to improve trust in the security and privacy
of systems and infrastructures. NIST provides guidance and technologies for the development
and use of secure platforms and foundational components such as cryptography. NIST also helps
to develop quantifiable measurements that provide assurances for platform security, privacy, and
robustness.
Enhancing the Security of the Software Supply Chain – Implementation of EO 14028
The President’s Executive Order (EO) 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, issued on
May 12, 2021, charged multiple agencies – including NIST – with enhancing cybersecurity through
a variety of initiatives related to the security and integrity of the software supply chain. In support
of EO 14028, NIST solicited position papers and other input from the community, hosted a series
of workshops, and consulted with other federal agencies. NIST published a definition of “critical
software” within the context of EO 14028, guidance that outlines security measures for critical
software use, and recommended minimum standards for vendor or developer verification of
software. NIST has also published Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Systems
and Organizations (draft SP 800-161, Revision 1) and Secure Software Development Framework
(SSDF) Version 1.1: Recommendations for Mitigating the Risk of Software Vulnerabilities (SP
800-218). Work in support of EO 14028 will continue throughout FY 2022.
