10.        Minimum accuracy specifications

10.1       Scope
This Section establishes specifications for configuration of deployed biometric verification algorithms. In previous
        23
sections , this document includes performance specifications for qualification of components that influence
recognition outcomes. This Section establishes minimum accuracy specifications and performance parameters for
components configured and used in operational PIV biometric authentication subsystems.
NOTE     [FIPS] establishes options and requirements for all PIV functions including authentication. It allows only
certain modalities to be used in PIV contexts.

10.2       Approach
FIPS 140-2 establishes minimum requirements for authentication for activation of cryptographic-modules. This
Section defines analogous specifications for biometric person authentication. The specifications implement the
primary security objective of using biometrics as an authentication factor.
The approach is to require recognition algorithm operating thresholds to be set to achieve false match rates (FMR) no
higher than those advanced here. These false match rates apply to zero-effort authentication, i.e., the one-to-one
                                                                        24
comparison of sample pairs from randomly selected different persons . The false match criteria implement the core
biometric security objectives. These are the primary interest of a security policy.
                                                                                        25
While any false match criterion can always be met by setting a stringent comparison threshold, the adoption of
                                                                                                                  26
stringent thresholds will imply elevated false rejection rates (FNMR or FRR) because of the error-rate tradeoff . High
false rejection rates will inconvenience legitimate users, and it is therefore imperative that biometric systems offering
sufficient performance are used – see Section 10.5.

10.3       Operating threshold specification
The threshold applied to scores from the biometric comparison algorithms shall be set to achieve false match rates at
                                                                                                            27
or below the respective values in Table 16. The threshold shall be calibrated in tests conformant to Annex A .
Agencies may require lower (more secure) FMR values; particularly some implementations can attain lower false
match rates.

NOTE 1           Transactional false accept rates will be higher than these values if the transaction allows
presentation of more than one sample (e.g., a second finger) or biometrics (e.g., iris and face).

  Those clauses, 4.5.3 and 4.5.4 for off-card fingerprint comparison, and 5.7.3.2 and 5.7.4 for on card comparison, qualify
 components requiring core minutiae-based interoperable accuracy. They do this in laboratory tests. The accuracy criteria were
 never intended to be adopted as operational verification criteria – particularly the FMR = 0.01 threshold was instituted to bar non-
 interoperable minutia detection algorithms and matchers – but is not appropriate as an Agency security policy.
24
     This represents the case where a lost card is found by someone who casually attempts a biometric authentication.
25
  For fingerprints and face, industry convention is for recognition algorithms to produce similarity scores, for which higher
 thresholds produce fewer false matches. For iris, the convention is to produce distance or dissimilarity scores, for which lower
 thresholds produce fewer false matches.
26
  As required by ISO/IEC 19795 biometric testing standards, test reports almost universally show this tradeoff using detection-error
 tradeoff characteristics (DETs) or almost equivalently receiver operating characteristics (ROCs).

     Threshold calibration information is available under NIST's MINEX and IREX programs.
