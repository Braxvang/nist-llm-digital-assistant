Risk tolerance, enterprise architecture, security architecture, security configurations, plans for
changes to the enterprise architecture, and available threat information provide data that is
fundamental to the execution of these steps and to ongoing management of information security-
related risks. Security-related information is analyzed for its relevance to organizational risk
management at all three tiers.

The balance of this chapter discusses the process of ISCM, providing detail on topics not covered
by existing guidelines and referencing existing guidelines where appropriate. Primary roles,
supporting roles, expected inputs, and expected outputs are given for each process step as a guide.
Roles and responsibilities will vary across organizations as will implementation-level details of
an ISCM program.

3.1    DEFINE IS CM STRATEGY
Effective ISCM begins with development of a strategy that addresses ISCM requirements and
activities at each organizational tier (organization, mission/business processes, and information
systems). Each tier monitors security metrics and assesses security control effectiveness with
established monitoring and assessment frequencies and status reports customized to support tier-
specific decision making. Policies, procedures, tools, and templates that are implemented from
Tiers 1 and 2, or that are managed in accordance with guidance from Tiers 1 and 2, best support
shared use of data within and across tiers. The lower tiers may require information in addition to
that required at higher tiers and hence develop tier-specific strategies that are consistent with
those at higher tiers and still sufficient to address local tier requirements for decision making.
Depending on the organization, there may be overlap in the tasks and activities conducted at each
tier.

The guidelines below, though not prescriptive, helps to ensure an organization-wide approach to
ISCM that best promotes standardized methodologies and consistent practices and hence
