      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines

638       • Step 1: An applicant applies to a CSP through an enrollment process. The CSP
639         identity proofs that applicant.
640       • Step 2: Upon successful proofing, the applicant is enrolled in the identity service as
641         a subscriber.
642            – A subscriber account and corresponding authenticators are established
643              between the CSP and the subscriber. The CSP maintains the subscriber
644              account, its status, and the enrollment data. The subscriber maintains their
645              authenticators.
646   The usual sequence of interactions involved in using one or more authenticators to
647   perform digital authentication in the non-federated model is as follows:
648       • Step 3: The RP requests authentication from the claimant.
649       • Step 4: The claimant proves possession and control of the authenticators to the
650         verifier through an authentication process.
