                                                                                   GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



5.       Securing the Web Server

Once the OS has been installed and secured, installing the chosen Web server software can begin. Before
starting this process, read the Web server manufacturer’s documentation carefully and understand the
various options available during the installation process. Also, be sure to visit the manufacturer’s Web
site or a vulnerability database Web site, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), 24 to
determine whether there are known vulnerabilities and related patches available that should be installed or
configured as part of the setup process. Only after these preliminary steps are accomplished should the
installation be started. Note that this section discusses only generic installation and configuration
procedures; specific directions for particular Web servers are available from Web server manufacturers
and from security checklist repositories. 25

A partially configured and/or patched server should not be exposed to external networks (e.g., the
Internet) or external users. In addition, internal network access should be as limited as possible until all
software is installed, patched, and configured securely. Insecure Web servers can be compromised in a
matter of minutes after being placed on the Internet. While it is ideal to fully harden the platform before
placing it on the network, it is not always feasible. For example, some application development tool
combinations cannot be installed, configured, and tested on top of a pre-hardened OS and Web server
configuration. In such situations, stepwise or incremental hardening is a viable option to consider, with
full validation of complete hardening occurring at production deployment.

5.1      Securely Installing the Web Server

In many respects, the secure installation and configuration of the Web server application mirrors the OS
process discussed in Section 4. The overarching principle, as before, is to install only the services
required for the Web server and to eliminate any known vulnerabilities through patches or upgrades. Any
unnecessary applications, services, or scripts that are installed should be removed immediately once the
installation process is complete. During the installation of the Web server, the following steps should be
performed:

 Install the Web server software either on a dedicated host or on a dedicated guest OS if virtualization
  is being employed.

 Apply any patches or upgrades to correct for known vulnerabilities.

 Create a dedicated physical disk or logical partition (separate from OS and Web server application)
  for Web content.

 Remove or disable all services installed by the Web server application but not required (e.g., gopher,
  FTP, remote administration).

 Remove or disable all unneeded default login accounts created by the Web server installation.

 Remove all manufacturers’ documentation from the server.

 Remove all example or test files from the server, including scripts and executable code.
