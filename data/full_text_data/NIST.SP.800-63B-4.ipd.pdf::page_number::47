1350   impostor relying party without reliance on the vigilance of the subscriber. The means
1351   by which the subscriber was directed to the impostor relying party are not relevant.
1352   For example, regardless of whether the subscriber was directed there via search engine
1353   optimization or prompted by email, it is considered to be a phishing attack.
1354   Approved cryptographic algorithms SHALL be used to establish phishing resistance
1355   where it is required. Keys used for this purpose SHALL provide at least the minimum
1356   security strength specified in the latest revision of [SP800-131A] (112 bits as of the date
1357   of this publication).
1358   Authenticators that involve the manual entry of an authenticator output, such as out-of-
1359   band and OTP authenticators, SHALL NOT be considered phishing resistant because
1360   the manual entry does not bind the authenticator output to the specific session being
1361   authenticated. In an AitM attack, an impostor verifier could replay the OTP authenticator
1362   output to the verifier and successfully authenticate.
1363   While an individual authenticator may be phishing resistant, phishing resistance for a
1364   given subscriber account is only achieved when all methods of authentication are phishing
1365   resistant.
1366   Two methods of phishing resistance are recognized: channel binding and verifier name
1367   binding. Channel binding is considered more secure than verifier name binding because
1368   it is not vulnerable to mis-issuance or misappropriation of relying party certificates, but
1369   either method satisfies the requirements for phishing resistance.

1370   5.2.5.1. Channel Binding
1371   An authentication protocol with channel binding SHALL establish an authenticated
1372   protected channel with the verifier. It SHALL then strongly and irreversibly bind a
1373   channel identifier that was negotiated in establishing the authenticated protected channel
1374   to the authenticator output (e.g., by signing the two values together using a private
1375   key controlled by the claimant for which the public key is known to the verifier). The
1376   verifier SHALL validate the signature or other information used to prove phishing
1377   resistance. This prevents an impostor verifier, even one that has obtained a certificate
1378   representing the actual verifier, from successfully relaying that authentication on a
1379   different authenticated protected channel.
1380   An example of a phishing resistant authentication protocol that uses channel binding is
1381   client-authenticated TLS, because the client signs the authenticator output along with
1382   earlier messages from the protocol that are unique to the particular TLS connection being
1383   negotiated.

1384   5.2.5.2. VeriÔ¨Åer Name Binding
1385   An authentication protocol with authenticator name binding SHALL establish
1386   an authenticated protected channel with the verifier. It SHALL then generate an
