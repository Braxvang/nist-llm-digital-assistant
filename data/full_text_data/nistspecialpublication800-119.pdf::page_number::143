6.5.6.2    Security Considerations for ISATAP

Security considerations for ISATAP include:

       ISATAP does not assume that multicast works. ISATAP foregoes IPv6 autoconfiguration and
        neighbor discovery protocols. It automatically knows the correspondence between the IPv6
        and IPv4 (link layer) addresses. Administrators statically configure the address of the default
        router. Hence, many of the security considerations with autoconfiguration and neighbor
        discovery do not exist with ISATAP.
       The appropriate use of IPsec is the same as with 6to4. Implement IPsec in the IPv6 domain.
       Certain IPv6 addressing capabilities such as privacy addresses or CGA cannot be used.
       All of the usual protocol 41 concerns apply. Various spoofing attacks may try to take
        advantage of the protocol 41 tunneling mechanism. Firewalls need to perform ingress and
        egress filtering on either the encapsulating and encapsulated addresses or block protocol 41, as
        appropriate.
       ISATAP clients are vulnerable to an internal attack in which an imposter pretends to be an
        ISATAP router. The recommended defense is for administrators to ensure that the ISATAP
        potential routers list (PRL) is accurate and protected from tampering.
