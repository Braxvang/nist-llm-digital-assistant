E.29. Substantiated Trustworthiness
Principle: System trustworthiness judgments are based on evidence that the criteria for
trustworthiness have been satisfied.
Note: Trustworthiness should not be assumed but rather substantiated through evidence that clearly shows
the extent to which an entity is worth being trusted. This helps to ensure that an entity is never trusted
beyond the extent to which it is worthy of trust. The approach to substantiated trustworthiness requires
Commensurate Rigor with cautious mistrust (i.e., system elements are assumed to be guilty until proven
innocent). 84
Substantiated trustworthiness is characterized by a design mentality in which all components involved in
the design context (i.e., a system element and the elements with which it interacts) are treated with a
mutually suspicious mindset [2] [20]. Such mutual suspicion reflects cautious mistrust – the feeling or
thought that something undesired, unwanted, or unexpected is possible or can happen. The design for
every system element should reflect a lack of trust in interacting elements or itself. This suspicion
assumes element non-performance and addresses the following cases:
-    Interacting element suspicion (mutual suspicion): The system element-of-interest design is based on
     the non-performance of the elements it interacts with and how their non-performance can influence
     the element-of-interest’s behavior and outcomes. Designing to mutual suspicion is reinforced by
     applying the principle of Least Privilege to all entities (so that an element executes with only the
     privileges needed, mitigating harm that may be created) while applying the principle of Least
     Persistence so that each element is minimally exposed.
-    Self-suspicion: The design for the system element-of-interest must consider its own non-performance
     independent of any external influence. Designing to self-suspicion may involve self-monitoring and
     built-in actions, including built-in testing at the initiation of the element.
This approach forces the system designer to assume that things will not go right and to rigorously seek
evidence that demonstrates the effectiveness of the design when things go wrong. Considerations for
system element non-performance include:
-    An expectation that elements will behave and produce outcomes that are inconsistent with their
     design intent
-    The constraints, assumptions, and preconditions that are associated with achieving threshold
     performance
-    Intentional and unintentional events and conditions, typically referred to by terms like fault, error,
     failure, and compromise

E.30. Trustworthy System Control
Principle: The design for system control functions conforms to the properties of the generalized
reference monitor.
Note: The trustworthy system control principle reflects the generalization of the reference monitor
concept to provide a uniform design assurance basis for trustworthy system control mechanisms or
constraint-enforcing mechanisms that compose to provide system control functions.
