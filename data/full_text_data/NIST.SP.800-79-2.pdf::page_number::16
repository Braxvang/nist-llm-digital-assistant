maintenance. An issuing facility operates under the auspices of a PIV Card or Derived PIV
Credential Issuer, and implements the policies and executes procedures prescribed by the issuer
for those functions sanctioned for the facility (e.g., an identity proofing/registration facility).

Based on certain characteristics (e.g., size, geographic locations, the organization(s) that it
supports), an issuer may have its services and functions provided centrally, distributed across
multiple locations, or may even be able to perform the entire issuance process remotely.7 For
example, in the case of PIV Card issuance, a geographically dispersed organization may decide
to have identity proofing/registration and activation/issuance functions performed in different
facilities in different parts of the country so that applicants can minimize travel. In this example,
the different issuing facilities fall under the purview (policy, management) of a single issuer
which encompasses all the functions necessary to issue PIV Cards.

Within that issuer, the geographically dispersed issuing facilities have specific responsibilities
and are under the direct management control of the issuer.

2.3 Outsourcing of Issuing Functions

An organization may outsource its issuing functions to one or more organizations. As the
complexity and cost of new technology increase, the organization may decide that the most
efficient and cost-effective solution for implementing [HSPD-12] is to seek the services of an
external service provider. An external service provider may be a Federal Government agency, a
private entity, or some other organization that offers services or functions necessary to issue PIV
Cards or Derived PIV Credentials.

Figure 1 provides an illustration of the functions that can be outsourced. Only the organization
can decide which of its employees and contractors are required to apply for a PIV Card and a
Derived PIV Credential (Sponsorship – a responsible official of the organization providing the
biographic and organizational affiliation of the applicant) and under what conditions the
application will be approved (Adjudication – the kind of background information that will form
the basis for authorization to issue the PIV Card). Therefore, these two functions cannot be
outsourced.
