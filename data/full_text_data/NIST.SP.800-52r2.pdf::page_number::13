NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                                                GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS



2       TLS Overview

TLS exchanges records via the TLS record protocol. A TLS record contains several fields,
including version information, application protocol data, and the higher-level protocol used to
process the application data. TLS protects the application data by using a set of cryptographic
algorithms to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of exchanged application data.
TLS defines several protocols for connection management that sit on top of the record protocol,
where each protocol has its own record type. These protocols, discussed in Section 2.1, are used
to establish and change security parameters and to communicate error and warning conditions to
the server and client. Sections 2.2 through 2.6 describe the security services provided by the TLS
protocol and how those security services are provisioned. Section 2.7 discusses key management.

2.1     TLS Subprotocols

There are three subprotocols in the TLS protocol that are used to control the session connection:
the handshake, change cipher spec, and alert protocols. The TLS handshake protocol is used to
negotiate the session parameters. The alert protocol is used to notify the other party of an error
condition. The change cipher spec protocol is used in TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 to change the
cryptographic parameters of a session. In addition, the client and the server exchange application
data that is protected by the security services provisioned by the negotiated cipher suite. These
security services are negotiated and established with the handshake.

The handshake protocol consists of a series of message exchanges between the client and the
server. The handshake protocol initializes both the client and server to use cryptographic
capabilities by negotiating a cipher suite of algorithms and functions, including key
establishment, digital signature, confidentiality, and integrity algorithms. Clients and servers can
be configured so that one or more of the following security services are negotiated during the
handshake: confidentiality, message integrity, authentication, and replay protection. A
confidentiality service provides assurance that data is kept secret, preventing eavesdropping. A
message integrity service provides confirmation that unauthorized data modification is detected,
thus preventing undetected deletion, addition, or modification of data. An authentication service
provides assurance of the sender or receiver’s identity, thereby detecting forgery. Replay
protection ensures that an unauthorized user does not capture and successfully replay previous
data. In order to comply with these guidelines, both the client and the server must be configured
for data confidentiality and integrity services.

The handshake protocol is used to optionally exchange X.509 public-key certificates 5 to
authenticate the server to the client and may be used to authenticate the client to the server as
well.

The handshake protocol is responsible for establishing the session parameters. The client and
server negotiate algorithms for authentication, confidentiality, and integrity, as well as derive
