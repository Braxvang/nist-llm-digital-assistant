       organization prefers the use of AES-256, then AES-256 must be configured to
       have the highest preference among all of the available encryption choices.
   4. Configure the use of only approved cryptographic algorithms by the server.
   5. Consider disabling the “host-based authentication” option at the server if the
      server is not willing to communicate with all possible users/clients at the host
      machine.
   6. When AEAD_AES_128_GCM or AEAD_AES_256_GCM is in a negotiating
      encryption-algorithm list, configure it to also be its companion MAC-algorithm if
      this is not done automatically.
   7. Suite B cryptographic algorithms should be set with the highest preferences in the
      client-side application. This will result in the selection of Suite B cryptographic
      algorithms to be used when the server supports them.
The installer shall make sure that all of the cryptographic components and required plug-
ins are installed so that cryptographic operations in SSH can function properly when
protecting the data traffic.

10.5 Recommendations for System Administrators
System administrators are those individuals responsible for the day-to-day functioning of
the SSH server and client applications. System administrators shall:
   1. Configure the client to verify the server’s public-key certificate in the key-
      exchange protocol in TLP and discontinue the protocol if the verification fails.
   2. Configure the server to authenticate the client by verifying the client’s certificate,
      if provided, when a public-key algorithm for authentication is used in UAP.
   3. Ensure that end users are properly trained to follow the organization’s security
      policy for the selection, use and protection of passwords.
   4. Ensure that the organization’s security policy is enforced.
   5. Ensure the protection of private key(s) associated with the server’s certificate and
      the client’s certificate from disposal, leaks or unauthorized access is/are properly
      configured.

10.6 Recommendations for End Users
An end user is the individual using the SSH client application to securely connect to the
SSH server. End users shall:
   1. Be aware of and trained to follow the organization’s security policy for using the
      product.
   2. Operate their system as instructed by their organization and system administrator.
