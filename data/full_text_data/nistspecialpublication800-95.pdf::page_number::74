 Green pages, which provide information about an organization’s services: the locations of services,
  and binding information.
There are six data types in a UDDI registry that provide all the information:

 businessEntity. Holds the name, address, and contact information of an organization
 businessService. Holds technical data about what services and products the organization offers
 bindingTemplate. Provides details on a particular Web service offered
 tModel. Defines how to interact with the target Web service, which is usually done by providing a
  technical specification, such as a wire protocol, interchange format, or interchange sequencing rule
  (e.g., WSDL document)
 publisherAssertion. Describes the relationship between businessEntity entries
 subscription. Describes a request to monitor changes to certain entities within the registry.
A WSDL document provides requesters with all the necessary information to send SOAP requests to a
provider service. A WSDL document defines services as a collection of endpoints, which are referred to
as ports. It also provides an abstract description of the types of messages and operations a Web service
performs along with what inputs are required for each operation and as what format the result is returned.
A UDDI registry provides a method to search for Web services and provides requester services with the
location of the WSDL document for the target Web service.

UDDI registries are generally hosted within organizational boundaries and allow access to certain
services within an individual SOA to be restricted. There are four types of private registries:

 Internet-based services registry. Hosted by a group of organizations and provides information
  about these organizations for public consumption
 Portal registry. Resides outside of an organization’s firewall and provides information about that
  particular organization’s Web services
 Partner catalog registry. Resides on an internal network and provides information on the services
  offered by a particular organization and its partners
 Internal services registry. Resides on an internal network and provides information on the services
  offered within that network.
In addition, UDDI v3 provides a framework for access privileges to keep portions of the registry available
only to authorized users.

3.9.2   UDDI Operations

In UDDI, the process of locating Web services through a registry is referred to as discovery. There are
two types of discovery: direct discovery and indirect discovery. In direct discovery, the information is
retrieved through a registry maintained by the service provider. In indirect discovery, the information is
retrieved through a third party registry.

UDDI provides three SOAP-based APIs to access the registry:
