NIST SP 800-58                                             Voice Over IP Security
    _________________________________________________________________________

      based on a VOIP signaling protocol. The problem is that computer systems are
      addressed using their IP address, but the user enters an ordinary telephone number
      or URI to place the call. The telephone number or URI must be linked with an IP
      address to reach the called party, much as an alphabetic web address, such as
      “www.nist.gov” must be linked to the IP address of the NIST web server. A
      number of protocols are involved in determining the IP address that corresponds
      to the called party’s telephone number. This process is covered in detail in
      Chapter 6.
