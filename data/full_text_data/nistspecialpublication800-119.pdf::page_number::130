                                                               GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


        DHCPv6 allows administrators to identify managed clients more easily than autoconfigured or
         manually configured clients, and to follow their network usage through logging.
With autoconfiguration, the host machine automatically generates an IPv6 address on its own.
Susceptibility to host initialization attacks poses one security risk. With autoconfiguration, generated
addresses are in a wider range of valid addresses. Administrators have to create broader rules for access
control lists if they are using range rules. This allows more addresses for rogue devices to connect to the
network, and scanning the network is harder. Benefits of using autoconfiguration include:

        Addresses are deterministic. The same machine will always generate the same IP address.
         Administrators can pre-populate DNS and other logging systems with valid hosts.
        If administrators use host enumeration rules, tighter access controls are possible than with
         range rules.
With manual address management, administrators configure each node manually. This method is more
resource intensive than the other two methods described in this section. Organizations often use manual
address management with well-known services to make them easier to discover or manage.

Address management in IPv6 will probably look similar to methods of address management used for
IPv4. After deploying IPv6, organizations should use a combination of methods for address management.
Administrators should use manually configured addresses for servers. Client machines will use either
DHCPv6 or autoconfiguration. The decision of which method to use (DHCPv6 or autoconfiguration) will
depend on how administrators want to manage addressing. If administrators want to manage their
addresses as pools of resources, they would opt for DHCPv6 address management. On the other hand, if
administrators want to allow equipment to assign itself an IP address without additional network
resources or administration, they would opt for autoconfiguration.

  6.2.5   Privacy Extensions

People accessing the Internet are concerned about their privacy and having their IP addresses tracked
when they are online. In response, the IETF released an RFC specifying the mechanism to create
temporary addresses, thereby affording the end user a degree of anonymity when online. RFC 4941,
Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6, specifies the mechanism for
autoconfiguration to generate a temporary address that inhibits device or user tracking of the end users.
Organizations that want to implement privacy extensions should consult RFC 4941 for more information.
The temporary interface ID is a randomly generated 64-bit value. Local policies control the regeneration
schedule of temporary interface IDs.

Organizations generally should use privacy extensions for external communications but not for internal
communications. Privacy extensions thwart correlation of a host with the use of a service. With internal
IT systems, privacy extensions affect logging and prevent administrators from properly tracking which
systems are accessing which services. Many internal resources require the ability to track the end user’s
use of services for correct operations. Organizations should document where and how it may intend to
use privacy extensions in the numbering plan. This will allow an organization to evaluate how it will use
privacy extensions and assess the security impact. Privacy extensions can be configured to reallocate
addressing on a scheduled interval; this rotation policy should also be documented in the numbering plan.

6.3   Transition Mechanisms

IPv6 is not backwards compatible with IPv4, and IPv4 systems cannot use IPv6 services or communicate
with IPv6 hosts. The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is expected to take a significant amount of time. As
