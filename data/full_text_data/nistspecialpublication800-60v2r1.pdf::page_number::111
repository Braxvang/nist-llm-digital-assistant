useful to criminals seeking to gain access to those facilities. In these cases, unauthorized
disclosure of information can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets,
or individuals. The consequent confidentiality impact would range from moderate to high. Also,
unauthorized disclosure of one agencyâ€™s goods acquisition information by another agency could
result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within the goods acquisition
infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations tasked with acquisition of
government facilities and supplies. Additionally, some procurement information associated with
proposals is proprietary. In the case of competitive procurements, much information associated
with unsuccessful bids remains proprietary following award of the contract (e.g., pricing
information). Unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information can have serious consequences
for agencies and have at least a moderate confidentiality impact level. Some procurement
information is classified. The classified information is national security related and is outside
the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for goods acquisition information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of goods acquisition information
usually depends on the urgency with which the information is needed or the immediacy with
which the information is used

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of information affecting external publication of goods acquisition information (e.g., web pages,
electronic mail) may adversely affect public confidence in the agency. However, damage to the
mission would usually be limited. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information
relating to procurement actions (particularly proposal information) can result in serious
disruption of procurement processes that can be important or even critical to agency operations.
In such cases, the integrity impact level can be moderate or even high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
modification or destruction of most goods acquisition information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the goods acquisition information.
Functions and processes supported by most goods acquisition information are tolerant of
delays i.e., the data supporting the functions/processes are not time-critical. Typically,
disruption of access will have a limited adverse effect on agency operations (including
mission functions and public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Exceptions may include emergency
procurements necessary to support response aspects of disaster management. In such cases,
delays may cost lives and major property damage. Consequently, the availability impact
level associated with disruption of access to goods acquisition information needed to respond
to emergencies may be high.
