Sample Authorization Decision Letter (Denial of Authorization to Operate)

From: Designated Authorizing Official                                          Date:

To: Organization Identity Management Official

Subject: Authorization Decision for [PCI / DPCI]

After reviewing the results of the assessment of the [PCI / DPCI] and the supporting evidence
provided in the associated authorization package, I have determined that the requirements
identified in [FIPS 201-2] and the organization’s policies, regulations, and standards are not
being exhibited by the [PCI / DPCI]. Accordingly, I am issuing a denial of authorization to
operate (DATO) to the [PCI / DPCI] and its issuing facilities. The [PCI / DPCI] is not authorized
and [MAY NOT BE PLACED INTO OPERATION or ALL CURRENT OPERATIONS MUST BE HALTED].

The corrective actions plan (CAP) is to be pursued immediately to ensure that proactive
measures are taken to correct the deficiencies found during the assessment. Re- authorization is
to be initiated at the earliest opportunity to determine the effectiveness of correcting the
deficiencies.

A copy of this letter and all supporting authorization documentation shall be retained in
accordance with the organization’s record retention schedule.
