                                                          SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



 Appendix A—Definitions of Important Terms

Selected terms used in the Secure Domain Name System (DNS) Deployment Guide are defined below. The
terms come from the DNSSEC specifications [RFC4033], [RFC4034], [RFC4035] and [RFC3833] with
some additions for specific terms used in this guide.

Authentication Chain: An alternating sequence of DNS public key (DNSKEY) RRsets and Delegation
Signer (DS) RRsets forms a chain of signed data, with each link in the chain vouching for the next. A
DNSKEY RR is used to verify the signature covering a DS RR and allows the DS RR to be authenticated.
The DS RR contains a hash of another DNSKEY RR, and this new DNSKEY RR is authenticated by
matching the hash in the DS RR. This new DNSKEY RR, in turn, authenticates another DNSKEY RRSet
and, in turn, some DNSKEY RR in this set may be used to authenticate another DS RR, and so forth until
the chain finally ends with a DNSKEY RR whose corresponding private key signs the desired DNS data.
For example, the root DNSKEY RRSet can be used to authenticate the DS RRSet for “example.” The
“example.” DS RRSet contains a hash that matches some “example.” DNSKEY, and this DNSKEY’s
corresponding private key signs the “example.” DNSKEY RRSet. Private key counterparts of the
“example.” DNSKEY RRSet sign data records such as “www.example.” as well as DS RRs for
delegations such as “subzone.example.”

Authentication Key: A public key that a DNSSEC-aware resolver has verified and can therefore use to
authenticate data. A DNSSEC-aware resolver can obtain authentication keys in three ways. First, the
resolver generally is configured to know about at least one public key; this configured data usually is
either the public key itself or a hash of the public key as found in the DS RR (see “trust anchor”). Second,
the resolver may use an authenticated public key to verify a DS RR and the DNSKEY RR to which the
DS RR refers. Third, the resolver may be able to determine that a new public key has been signed by the
private key corresponding to another public key that the resolver has verified. Note that the resolver must
always be guided by local policy in deciding whether to authenticate a new public key, even if the local
policy is simply to authenticate any new public key for which the resolver is able verify the signature.

Authoritative RRSet: Within the context of a particular zone, an RRSet (RRs with the same name, class,
and type) is authoritative if and only if the owner name of the RRSet lies within the subset of the name
space that is at or below the zone apex and at or above the cuts that separate the zone from its children, if
any. RRs of type NSEC, RRSIG and DS are examples of RRSets at a cut that are authoritative at the
parent side of the zone cut, and not the delegated child side.

Chain of Trust: See “authentication chain.”

Chained Secure Zone: A DNS zone in which there is an authentication chain from the zone to a trust
anchor.

Delegation Point: The name at the parental side of a zone cut. That is, the delegation point for
“foo.example” would be the foo.example node in the “example” zone (as opposed to the zone apex of the
“foo.example” zone). See also “zone apex.”

DNS Administrator: Used in this document to cover the person (or persons) tasked with updating zone
data and operating an enterprise’s DNS server. This term may actually cover several official roles, but
these roles are covered by one term here.

DNSSEC-Aware Name Server: An entity acting in the role of a name server that understands the DNS
security extensions defined in this document set. In particular, a DNSSEC-aware name server is an entity
that receives DNS queries, sends DNS responses, supports the EDNS0 [RFC2671] message size
