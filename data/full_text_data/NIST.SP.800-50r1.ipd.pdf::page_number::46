       NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                      Building a Cybersecurity and
       August 2023                                                                 Privacy Learning Program

1314          include a visitor or guest with acceptable use policies if they allow any type of system
1315          access, including wireless network connections.
1316      •   All users: This is also known as “general workforce training” and includes annual
1317          cybersecurity and privacy training for all organization system users. An analysis of this
1318          audience’s training requirements should include a review of the performance of previous
1319          program elements and any new organizational requirements.
1320      •   Privileged users: These are personnel with additional responsibilities who are trusted to
1321          perform cybersecurity- or privacy-relevant functions that ordinary users are not
1322          authorized to perform. They will require additional training in order to be provided with
1323          privileged access. Some information to consider when identifying privileged users
1324          include:
1325              o Determine whether any new systems have been implemented or are planned, and
1326                identify the rights and privileges associated with privileged account users.
1327              o Review the list of participants with system owners to ensure that the list is
1328                complete and whether new rights and privileges are required.
1329              o Determine whether any of these systems have been moved to the cloud and
1330                require new training.
1331      •   Staff with significant cybersecurity and privacy responsibilities training: Some
1332          positions with significant responsibilities require highly technical implementation by staff
1333          with significantly specialized responsibilities. This provides additional training that is
1334          designed for a specific job role, task, or responsibility (also known as “role-based”
1335          training). This type of training includes:
1336              o Specialized or customized training on specific products, networks, systems,
1337                applications, or information
1338              o Work role tasks and activities, such as incident response procedures, oversight
1339                responsibilities, or identity management
1340              o Reskilling and upskilling programs
1341              o Learning that helps the employee perform their work tasks
1342          The following are examples of how personnel can be assigned to multiple learning
1343          programs:
1344              o Wilson is currently a system administrator, and as an employee of a federal
1345                agency she attends the annual CPLP training. She is also in the Information
1346                Technology department, so she and her team receive additional training on
1347                cybersecurity and privacy. In her role as a system administrator, she has
1348                significant cybersecurity and privacy responsibilities and is therefore required to
1349                attend additional training.
1350              o Ng is now part of the organization’s web publishing team and has access rights to
1351                publish the public-facing webpages of the organization. This carries significant
1352                agency branding and communications responsibilities. Ng must take annual
1353                training and sign an additional Acceptable Use Policy regarding appropriate
1354                publishing activities.
