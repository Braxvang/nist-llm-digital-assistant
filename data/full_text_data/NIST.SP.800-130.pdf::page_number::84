SP 800-130                                                              August 2013




Two primary security issues should be addressed regarding the security of the contents of
cryptographic modules: the integrity of the security functions and the protection of the
cryptographic keys and metadata. For example, [FIPS 140] specifies requirements on
cryptographic modules for protecting keys within the module and maintaining the
integrity of the module’s security functions. Techniques such as the software/firmware
integrity test and known-answer test, along with physical protection from unauthorized
access and/or alteration, are specified in the FIPS. Since the cryptographic keys are
present in plaintext form for some period of time within the module, physical security
measures are necessary to protect keys from unauthorized disclosure, modification, and
substitution. A cryptographic module may provide the necessary physical protection.
Otherwise, a larger, physically protected space that includes the module is needed.

Vendors of hardware cryptographic products or modules often build physical security
safeguards into their devices by using strong metal cases, locks, alarms, and key
destruction mechanisms. However, software cryptographic applications running on
general-purpose computers face additional risks because these computers were not
designed and built to provide sufficient protection for cryptographic keys. In fact, the
very computers on which the cryptography runs usually contain software written by
individuals that have not been vetted for security. It is, therefore, critical that
cryptographic software running on a general-purpose computer is both physically
protected (i.e., kept in a safe environment) and logically protected from exploitation by
distrusted (perhaps hostile) code. [FIPS 140] provides guidance regarding these
protections.

FR:8.19 The CKMS design shall identify the cryptographic modules that it uses and their
respective security policies, including:
    a) The embodiment of each module (software, firmware, hardware, or hybrid),
    b) The mechanisms used to protect the integrity of each module,
    c) The physical and logical mechanisms used to protect each module’s cryptographic
        keys, and
    d) The third-party testing and validation that was performed on each module
        (including the security functions) and the protective measures employed by each
        module.

9. Testing and System Assurances
A CKMS device should undergo several types of testing to ensure that it has been built to
conform to its design, that it conforms to certain standards, that it continues to operate
according to its design, that it does not perform functions that may compromise its
security, that it is interoperable with other CKMS devices, and that it can be used in the
larger systems for which it is intended with reasonable assurance of preserving security.

Since testing is restricted to a finite number of cases that is typically much less than the
total number of possibilities, testing does not guarantee that a device or system is correct
