The significance of loss requires clarity in what loss means for the asset of interest. Examples of
terms used to describe asset loss include ability, accessibility, accuracy, assurance, advantage
(technological, competitive, combatant), capability, control, correctness, existence, investment,
ownership, performance, possession, precision, quality, satisfaction, and time.


                                           SIGNIFICANCE OF LOSS – AN EXAMPLE
           The significance of loss due to a flat tire is determined and assessed without consideration
           for how or why the tire became flat (e.g., puncture, manufacturing defect, impact with
           curb or other object) and without any consideration of malicious intent (e.g., tire cut, valve
           stem loosened). Regardless of how or why the tire became flat, the significance of loss
           remains the same (e.g., loss of control if the vehicle is moving, inability to drive if the
           vehicle is stationary, time lost to replace or repair the tire to make the vehicle operable).
           The significance of loss due to a flat tire includes the inability to steer the vehicle, and the
           resultant adverse effect may be to impact some other object (i.e., a crash). The adverse
           effect of the loss of steering (loss of control) is specific, while the adverse effect of a crash
           is general (many other circumstances may result in a crash without any loss of the ability
           to steer the vehicle).



Confidence in addressing loss ensures that protections have a body of objective evidence that
demonstrates the effectiveness, sufficiency, and suitability of protective measures to satisfy asset
protection needs. Confidence in addressing loss is cumulative. It begins with determining the
loss concerns for the asset of interest and continuously builds as those concerns are better
understood and addressed across the context of loss, the significance of loss, the causes of loss,
and how loss is addressed. The evidence basis that provides confidence is informed by the
verification and validation activities that occur throughout the life cycles of the assets and the
system, including requirements elicitation and analysis. A key informing element to those
activities is to ensure that the results contribute to the confidence sought.

The cause of loss 38 is the individual or combination of events, conditions, and circumstances that
result in some form of loss of an asset. The causes of asset loss constitute a continuum that
includes intentional, unintentional, accidental, incidental, misuse, abuse, error, defect, fault,
weakness, and failure events and conditions [26]. This continuum spans all human-based,
machine-based, physical-based, and nature-based drivers of loss. The following considerations
apply to reasoning about the causes of loss:
•    Single events and conditions that alone can produce the loss
•    Combinations, sequences, and aggregate events and conditions



38
   Many terms are used to describe the cause of asset loss. Some of these terms are specific to a community of interest or specialty field, while
others span communities and specialties. There are also cases where the same term may be used differently across communities and specialty
fields (e.g., the term threat has varying interpretations across communities, such as physical security, cybersecurity, commerce, law enforcement,
industry, military combat operations, and military intelligence). The terms used as a synonym for the cause of asset loss include attack, breach,
compromise, hazard, mishap, threat, violation, and vulnerability.
