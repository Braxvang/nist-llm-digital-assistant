                                         TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



 Developing a security assessment policy. Organizations should develop an information security
  assessment policy to provide direction and guidance for their security assessments. This policy
  should identify security assessment requirements and hold accountable those individuals
  responsible for ensuring that assessments comply with the requirements. The approved policy
  should be disseminated to the appropriate staff, as well as third parties who are to conduct
  assessments for the organization. The policy should be reviewed at least annually and whenever
  there are new assessment-related requirements.
 Prioritizing and scheduling assessments. Organizations should decide which systems should
  undergo assessments and how often these assessments should be done. This prioritization is
  based on system categorization, expected benefits, scheduling requirements, applicable
  regulations where assessment is a requirement, and resource availability. Technical
  considerations can also help determine assessment frequency, such as waiting until known
  weaknesses are corrected or a planned upgrade to the system is performed before conducting
  testing.
 Selecting and customizing technical testing and examination techniques. There are many
  factors for organizations to consider when determining which techniques should be used for a
  particular assessment. Factors include the assessment objectives, the classes of techniques that
  can obtain information to support those objectives, and the appropriate techniques within each
  class. Some techniques also require the organization to determine the assessorsâ€™ viewpoint (e.g.,
  internal versus external) so that corresponding techniques can be selected.
 Determining the logistics of the assessment. This includes identifying all required resources,
  including the assessment team; selecting environments and locations from which to perform the
  assessment; and acquiring and configuring all necessary technical tools.
 Developing the assessment plan. The assessment plan documents the activities planned for an
  assessment and other related information. A plan should be developed for every assessment to
  provide the rules and boundaries to which assessors must adhere. The plan should identify the
  systems and networks to be assessed, the type and level of testing permitted, logistical details of
  the assessment, data handling requirements, and guidance for incident handling.
 Addressing any legal considerations. Organizations should evaluate potential legal concerns
  before commencing an assessment, particularly if the assessment involves intrusive tests (e.g.,
  penetration testing) or if the assessment is to be performed by an external entity. Legal
  departments may review the assessment plan, address privacy concerns, and perform other
  functions in support of assessment planning.
