       INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING MATRIX                              — Cell 3.4D
 Training Area: System Life Cycle Security                — Implementation
 Functional Specialty: Implement & Operate

 Definition   —          The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an IT system
                         from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                         model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                         Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                         ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                         needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                         The implementation phase is the installation of the system into the
                         operational environment in a manner that does not compromise the integrity
                         and effectiveness of the successfully tested security safeguards.

 Behavioral Outcome           —   Individuals responsible for system implementation or operation
                                  ensure that approved safeguards are in place and effective as the
                                  system moves into production.

 Knowledge Levels          —
 1.          — Know, Apply, Recognize
      Beginning
 2.Intermediate —                 Decide
                          Identify, Interpret,
 3. Advanced — Analyze, Determine, Approve

 Sample Learning Objectives —

 At the conclusion of this module, individuals will be able to:

 1.    Beginning     —   Participate in the implementation of safeguards for an IT system in
       accordance with the established implementation plan.


 2.    Intermediate    —   Identify vulnerabilities resulting from a departure from the implementation
       plan or that were not apparent during testing. Determine necessary actions to return the
       implementation process to the established plan or to forward identified vulnerabilities for
       resolution.


 3.    Advanced      — Examine unresolved system       vulnerabilities and determine what corrective
       action or additional safeguards are necessary to mitigate them.
