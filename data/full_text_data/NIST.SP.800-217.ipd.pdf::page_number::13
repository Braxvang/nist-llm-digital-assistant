      NIST SP 800-217 ipd                         Guidelines for PIV Federation (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


303   1.3.1. Federation Considerations
304   The use of a federation protocol allows RPs to be shielded from the complexities
305   and requirements of managing individual authenticators. When a new authentication
306   technology is adopted, only the IdP needs to be updated in order for the entire network
307   to benefit. The home agency has the option to bind and manage any number of valid
308   PIV credentials to the PIV identity account. The lifecycle of adding and removing
309   authenticators to the PIV identity account does not affect the RP, which implements only
310   the federation protocol.
311   Federation allows an RP to access PIV identity accounts that originate from different
312   agencies on different networks. This connection allows an agency to leverage the identity
313   infrastructure of another agency without needing to replicate the PIV identity account
314   management process.
315   The subject identifier asserted by the IdP to the RP is stable to the PIV identity account
316   over time and across different authenticators, including different certificates and attribute
317   changes such as email address or name changes. The subject identifier can also be
318   generated in a pairwise fashion for use cases that require a higher degree of privacy
319   between multiple RPs while still providing a smooth user experience for the subscriber
320   who only has to manage one set of credentials.
321   Many RPs need access to attributes about the subscriber, such as a display name
322   or contact information. The fixed set of attributes included in a PIV certificate are
323   presented as a whole to all RPs at which the certificate is presented, and some derived
324   PIV credentials carry no attributes at all. In contrast, the attributes released during a
325   federation transaction can vary depending on a variety of factors, including the nature
326   of access required and the parameters of the RP. These attributes can include information
327   in the PIV identity account that is not carried in any specific authenticator. In fact, these
328   attributes are made available to the RP separate from the subscriber’s use of any particular
329   authenticator.
330   An RP may want to verify that the PIV identity account is still active and has not been
331   terminated, but in many circumstances, the RP will not have direct access to the PIV
332   identity account. With federated protocols, the IdP is the authority for the accounts
333   it asserts, allowing RPs to trust that these accounts are in good and current standing
334   according to the IdP. When a PIV identity account is terminated at the IdP, that account
335   can no longer be used at any connected RPs.
336   In advanced circumstances, the IdP and RP can engage in shared signaling about security
337   events concerning accounts, agencies, and applications. These signals can inform a party
338   about suspicious behavior with a given account or proactively indicate significant changes
339   in an account’s status, such as termination, without the need for action on the subscriber’s
340   part.
