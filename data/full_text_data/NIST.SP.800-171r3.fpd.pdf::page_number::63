1757   3.13.6. Network Communications – Deny by Default – Allow by Exception
1758             REQUIREMENT: 03.13.06
1759             Deny network communications traffic by default and allow network communications traffic by
1760             exception.

1761             DISCUSSION
1762             This requirement applies to inbound and outbound network communications traffic at the
1763             system boundary and at identified points within the system. A deny-all, allow-by-exception
1764             network communications traffic policy ensures that only essential and approved connections are
1765             allowed.

1769   3.13.7. Withdrawn
1770             Addressed by 03.01.12, 03.04.02 and 03.04.06.


1771   3.13.8. Transmission and Storage Confidentiality
1772             REQUIREMENT: 03.13.08
1773             Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of CUI during
1774             transmission and while in storage.

1775             DISCUSSION
1776             This requirement applies to internal and external networks and any system components that can
1777             transmit CUI, including servers, notebook computers, desktop computers, mobile devices,
1778             printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machines, and radios. Unprotected communication paths
1779             are susceptible to interception and modification. Encryption protects CUI from unauthorized
1780             disclosure during transmission and while in storage. Cryptographic mechanisms that protect the
1781             confidentiality of CUI during transmission include TLS and IPsec. Information in storage (i.e.,
1782             information at rest) refers to the state of CUI when it is not in process or in transit and resides
1783             on internal or external storage devices, storage area network devices, and databases. Protecting
1784             CUI in storage does not focus on the type of storage device or the frequency of access to that
1785             device but rather on the state of the information. This requirement relates to 03.13.11.
