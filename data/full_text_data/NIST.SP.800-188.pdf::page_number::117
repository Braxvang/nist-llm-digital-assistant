de-identifed information Records that have had enough PII removed or obscured such
      that the remaining information does not identify an individual, and there is no rea-
      sonable basis to believe that the information can be used to identify an individual.
differential privacy A rigorous mathematical defnition of disclosure that considers the
      risk that an individual’s confdential data may be learned as a result of a mathematical
      analysis based on that data being made publicly available.
direct identifer An attribute that alone enables unique identifcation of a data principal
      within a specifc operational context.39 (ISO/IEC 20889:2018)
direct identifying data Data that directly identify a single individual. (ISO/TS 25237:2008)
disclosure Divulging of, or provision of access to, data. (ISO/TS 25237:2008)
disclosure limitation Statistical methods used to hinder anyone from identifying an indi-
      vidual respondent or establishment by analyzing published data, especially by ma-
      nipulating mathematical and arithmetical relationships among the data. p. 21][160]
disassociability Enabling the processing of PII or events without association to individuals
      or devices beyond the operational requirements of the system. (NISTIR 8062)
dominance rule Synonym of the (n,k) rule. (OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms)
effectiveness The extent to which planned activities are realized and planned results achieved.
      (ISO/IEC 27000:2014)
entity An item inside or outside an information and communication technology system,
      such as a person, an organization, a device, a subsystem, or a group of such items
      that has recognizably distinct existence. (ISO/IEC 24760-1:2011)
expert determination Within the context of de-identifcation, refers to the Expert Deter-
     mination method for de-identifying protected health information in accordance with
     the HIPAA Privacy Rule de-identifcation standard.
Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology (FCSM) An interagency committee ded-
     icated to improving the quality of Federal statistics. The FCSM was created by the
     Offce of Management and Budget (OMB) to inform and advise OMB and the Inter-
     agency Council on Statistical Policy (ICSP) on methodological and statistical issues
     that affect the quality of Federal data. (fscm.sites.usa.gov)
genomic information Information based on an individual’s genome, such as a sequence
     of DNA or the results of genetic testing.



39 Here and throughout, the operational context includes the information that the entity processing (e.g., de-

  identifying) the data possesses, together with information that third parties and potential attackers can
  possess or that is in the public domain (ISO/IEC 20889:2018).
