information has been authenticated. This may violate the confidentiality and integrity of critical
information.

Organizations should periodically examine the services and information accessible on the server and
determine the necessary security requirements. While doing so, the organization should identify
information that shares the same security and protection requirements. For sensitive information, the
organization should determine the users or user groups that should have access to each set of resources.
For information that requires some level of user authentication, the organization should determine which
authentication technologies or methods would provide the appropriate level of authentication and
encryption. Each has its own unique benefits and costs that should be weighed carefully with client and
organizational requirements and policies. It may be desirable to use some authentication methods in
combination. NIST SP 800-63, Electronic Authentication Guideline, contains additional information on
authentication mechanisms.

Federal government organizations are required to use Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)-
validated cryptographic implementations when using cryptography to protect stored data and data
communications. The Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) performs validation testing of
cryptographic modules. 29 NIST provides a list of FIPS 140 compliant 30 manufacturers and
implementations. 31 Additional information on encrypting communications is available from NIST SP
800-52, Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations, NIST
SP 800-77, Guide to IPsec VPNs, and NIST SP 800-113, Guide to SSL VPNs. 32

Organizations should be prepared to migrate their servers to stronger cryptographic technologies over
time as weaknesses are identified in the serversâ€™ existing cryptographic technologies. For example, NIST
has recommended that use of the Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) be phased out by 2010 in favor of
SHA-224, SHA-256, and other larger, stronger hash functions. 33 Organizations should stay aware of
cryptographic requirements and recommendations and plan to update their servers accordingly.
