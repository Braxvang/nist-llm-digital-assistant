NIST continues to coordinate a National Cybersecurity Awareness and Education Program, as
required by the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 that includes activities such as:
•   The widespread dissemination of cybersecurity technical standards and best practices;
•   Efforts to make cybersecurity best practices usable by a variety of individuals and stakeholders;
•   Increasing public awareness of cybersecurity, cyber safety, and cyber ethics;
•   Increasing understanding of the benefits of ensuring effective risk management of information
    technology and the methods to mitigate and remediate vulnerabilities;
•   Supporting formal cybersecurity education programs at all levels to prepare and improve a
    skilled cybersecurity workforce; and
•   Promoting initiatives to evaluate and forecast future cybersecurity workforce needs of the
    Federal Government and develop strategies for recruitment, training, and retention.
National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE)
The mission of NICE is to energize, promote, and coordinate a robust community that works
together to advance an integrated ecosystem of cybersecurity education, training, and workforce
development. The NICE Strategic Plan, released in November 2020, introduces five new
strategic goals, each with a set of objectives. To more closely align with the new Strategic Plan,
updates were also made to NICE’s public working group structure, which is now called the NICE
Community Coordinating Council. The Council consists of three working groups that are aligned
to strategic goals and four communities of interest aligned to priority topic areas. Early in 2021,
the NICE Program Office and NICE Community Coordinating Council began work on drafting
an Implementation Plan for the new Strategic Plan. The Implementation Plan was published in
September 2021.
