       NIST SP 800-73pt2-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)           Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 2
       September 2023                                              PIV Card Application Card Command Interface

1448   Appendix D. Notation
1449   The 16 hexadecimal digits SHALL be denoted using the alphanumeric characters 0, 1, 2, …, 9,
1450   A, B, C, D, E, and F. A byte consists of two hexadecimal digits, such as '2D'. The two
1451   hexadecimal digits are represented in quotations '2D' or as 0x2D. A sequence of bytes MAY be
1452   enclosed in single quotation marks (e.g., 'A0 00 00 01 16') rather than given as a sequence of
1453   individual bytes (e.g., 'A0' '00' '00' '01' '16').
1454   A byte can also be represented by bits b8 to b1, where b8 is the most significant bit (MSB) and
1455   b1 is the least significant bit (LSB) of the byte. In textual or graphic representations, the leftmost
1456   bit is the MSB. Thus, for example, the most significant bit b8 of '80' is 1, and the least significant
1457   bit b1 is 0.
1458   All bytes specified as RFU SHALL be set to '00', and all bits specified as RFU SHALL be set to
1459   0.
1460   All lengths SHALL be measured in number of bytes unless otherwise noted.
1461   The expression 'X' & 'Y' is a bitwise AND operation between bytes 'X' and 'Y'.
1462   The symbol || means concatenation of byte strings. For example, if X is '00 01 02' and Y is '03 04
1463   05', then X || Y is '00 01 02 03 04 05'.
1464   Data objects in templates are described as being mandatory (M), optional (O), or conditional (C).
1465   Mandatory means that the data object SHALL appear in the template. Optional means that the
1466   data object MAY appear in the template. For conditional data objects, the conditions under
1467   which they are required are provided.
1468   In other tables, the M/O/C column identifies properties of the PIV Card Application that SHALL
1469   be present (M), may be present (O), or are conditionally required to be present (C).
1470   BER-TLV data object tags are represented as byte sequences, as described above. Thus, for
1471   example, 0x4F is the interindustry data object tag for an application identifier, and 0x7F60 is the
1472   interindustry data object tag for the Biometric Information Templates Group template.
1473   This document uses the following typographical conventions in text:
1474       •   ASN.1 data types are represented in a monospaced font. For example, SignedData and
1475           SignerInfo are data types defined for digital signatures.
1476       •   Specific terms in CAPITALS represent normative requirements. When these same terms
1477           are not in CAPITALS, the term does not represent a normative requirement.
1478       •   The terms SHALL and SHALL NOT indicate requirements to be strictly followed in
1479           order to conform to the publication and from which no deviation is permitted.
1480       •   The terms SHOULD and SHOULD NOT indicate that among several possibilities, one
1481           is recommended as particularly suitable without mentioning or excluding others, that a
1482           certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily required, or that — in the negative
1483           form — a certain possibility or course of action is discouraged but not prohibited.
1484       •   The terms MAY and NEED NOT indicate a course of action that is permissible within
1485           the limits of the publication.
