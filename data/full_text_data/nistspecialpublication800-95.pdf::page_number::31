                                                                             GUIDE TO SECURE WEB SERVICES



 W3C XML Signature. Used by WS-Security to digitally sign messages and provide message
  integrity and sender authentication
 WS-Security Tokens. Allows messages to include credentials to aid receivers in determining
  whether or not the message sender is authorized to perform the requested action. Supported token
  types include:
        –   Username/password. The most common credentials in Web applications
        –   OASIS SAML Assertion. Asserts that the sender has been authenticated and/or supply
            attributes associated with the sender
        –   IETF X.509 certificate. Coupled with XML Signature, a receiver can verify that the CA
            issued the certificate used to sign the SOAP message
        –   ISO Rights Expression Language. Used to provide public key information, attributes of
            those keys, as well as information about the sender’s license
        –   IETF Kerberos token. Allows Web services to exist in a Kerberos domain.
 W3C WS-Addressing IDs. Allows the message sender to supply a unique identifier for the message
 IETF SSL/TLS. Secures the HTTP protocol over which SOAP messages are sent and received
 SSL/TLS with client authentication. Requires both the sender and receiver to authenticate with one
  another before securing the HTTP protocol
 IETF HTTP authentication. Allows usernames, passwords (via HTTP Basic) or password digests
  (via HTTP Digest) to be sent as part of the HTTP header.
These technologies, along with other technologies that support them, are discussed in-depth in Section 3.
Table 2-2 illustrates which standards provide protection against these threats. As the table shows,
SSL/TLS and WS-Security, through XML Encryption and XML Signature, provide similar protections
against threats; Section 3.6 discusses SSL/TLS, WS-Security and WS-SecureConversation and the trade-
offs associated with each technology.
