NIST SP 800-166                                                        DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                       DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

              Key History Object,

              20 Retired X.509 Certificates for Key Management, and

              Security Object.

The containers will be validated for the following conditions:

   +   Presence of containers for the mandatory data object and all supported optional data
       objects as specified in the vendor documentation;

   +   Accessibility and storage of data objects using the appropriate BER-TLV tags (specified
       identifiers as per Section 4, Part 1 of NIST SP 800-73, Interfaces for Personal Identity
       Verification [SP800-73]);

   +   Appropriate container size allocations for each of the data objects;

   +   Data objects access rule (password vs. no password); and

   +   Security condition for data objects access/storage (cryptographic authentication).

2.2.3 Derived PIV Application Command Interface Conformance

These tests will validate that the implementation under test can successfully execute the
commands in the Derived PIV Application token command interface as mandated by [SP800-
157]. Successful execution constitutes the Derived PIV Application responding with appropriate
data and response status words to the commands sent by a test system. It also involves setting
state variables per the specification. For example, the criteria for successful execution of the
SELECT command involve the following:

   +   The response status word returned is '90 00'.

   +   The application property template is returned with the correct format and content.

   +   The “Derived PIV Application” is the value of “currently selected application” (state
       variable)

The Derived PIV Application token command interface test suite includes conformance tests for
the following commands:

   +   Data access commands–

              SELECT

              GET DATA

   +   Authentication commands–

              GENERAL AUTHENTICATE
