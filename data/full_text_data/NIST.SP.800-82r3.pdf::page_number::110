6.1.2. Governance (ID.GV)
Effective governance involves organizational leadership incorporating risk management
objectives into the strategic planning process along with resiliency, privacy, and cybersecurity
objectives, as well as providing the required resources to effectively implement and sustain the
cybersecurity program. From this process, organizational leadership develops and disseminates
policies that establish security requirements for their environments. These policies may include
the identification and assignment of roles, responsibilities, management commitment, and
compliance. The policies may also reflect coordination among the organizational entities
responsible for the different aspects of security (e.g., technical, physical, personnel, cyber-
physical, access control, media protection, vulnerability management, maintenance, monitoring).
Sections 3 and 4 provide additional details for governance. Supplemental guidance for ID.GV
can be found in the following documents:

            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should consider:
                   •   Ensuring that the cybersecurity program is given sufficient
                       resources to support the organization’s IT and OT risk
                       management strategy
                   •   Ensuring that policies take the full life cycle of the OT systems
                       into consideration
                   •   Ensuring that legal and regulatory cybersecurity requirements
                       that affect OT operations are understood and managed
                   •   Establishing one or more senior official positions that are
                       responsible and accountable for the organization’s governance
                       and risk management for IT and OT cybersecurity programs
                   •   Establishing communication and coordination between IT and
                       OT organizations
                   •   Cross-training IT and OT personnel to support the cybersecurity
                       program
