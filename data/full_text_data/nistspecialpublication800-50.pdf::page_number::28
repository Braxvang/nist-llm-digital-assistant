    Interviews with all key groups and organizations identified
    Organizational surveys
    Review and assessment of available resource material, such as current awareness and training
     material, training schedules, and lists of attendees
    Analysis of metrics related to awareness and training (e.g., percentage of users completing required
     awareness session or exposure, percentage of users with significant security responsibilities who
     have been trained in role-specific material)
    Review of security plans for general support systems and major applications to identify system and
     application owners and appointed security representatives
    Review of system inventory and application user ID databases to determine all who have access
    Review of any findings and/or recommendations from oversight bodies (e.g., Congressional inquiry,
     inspector general, internal review/audit, and internal controls program) or program reviews
     regarding the IT security program
    Conversations and interviews with management, owners of general support systems and major
     applications, and other organization staff whose business functions rely on IT
    Analysis of events (such as denial of service attacks, website defacements, hijacking of systems
     used in subsequent attacks, successful virus attacks) might indicate the need for training (or
     additional training) of specific groups of people
    Review when technical or infrastructure changes are made
    The study of trends first identified in industry, academic, or government publications or by
     training/education organizations. The use of these “early warning systems” can provide insight into
     an issue within the organization that has yet to be seen as a problem.



                Figure 3-4: Techniques for Gathering Information as Part of a Needs Assessment

Appendix A contains a sample needs assessment interview and questionnaire. (The sample provided
contains some IT security-related questions as part of a general job-oriented questionnaire for system
administrators. For situations in which the general job training requirements are known, the questionnaire
can focus on the security awareness and training needs of the job.)

Metrics are an important and effective tool that can be used to help determine an agency’s IT security
awareness and training needs. Metrics monitor the accomplishment of the awareness and training
program goals and objectives by quantifying the level of implementation of awareness and training and
the effectiveness and efficiency of the awareness and training, analyzing the adequacy of awareness and
training efforts, and identifying possible improvements. For a thorough discussion of metrics see NIST
Special Publication 800-55, Security Metrics Guide for Information Technology Systems. A sample
awareness and training metric is included in this document as Appendix B.


    similarity or diversity of mission. For example, in a small agency with one mission or similar missions, the results of an IT
    security program review and/or an informal survey or questionnaire can usually be effective in identifying the awareness
    and training program needs. However, in a large agency with a diverse mix of users and missions, a more complex
    questionnaire may have to be developed to collect information that will be analyzed to identify program needs.
