                                             GUIDE TO STORAGE ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES FOR END USER DEVICES



 Deploy virtual disk or file/folder encryption software to the user and contractor’s computers. Encrypt
  the data using the software and burn the encrypted data onto CDs or DVDs.

 Acquire USB flash drives or external hard drives that have built-in storage encryption capabilities.
  Store the copies of the data on the encrypted drives.

 Acquire USB flash drives or external hard drives. Deploy virtual disk, volume, or file/folder
  encryption software to the user and contractor’s computers. Encrypt the data using the software and
  store it on the drives.

3.3.4    Use Case 4: Traveling with a Laptop

A user occasionally travels on behalf of the organization and carries a laptop that contains sensitive data.
For this data, the major threat that the organization needs to mitigate is unauthorized disclosure of data
from the loss or theft of the laptop. Possible solutions include the following:

 Use the laptop’s OS access control features to strictly limit where the user can save files. Implement
  volume, virtual disk, or file/folder encryption on the laptop to protect the user’s files.

 Implement FDE on the laptop, and require pre-boot authentication.

 Provide the user with a loaner laptop when needed for travel. Protect the user’s sensitive data on the
  laptop using either of the methods described above. When the user returns from travel, wipe and
  rebuild the loaner laptop to remove any traces of sensitive data from it. Using a loaner laptop in this
  way is particularly helpful if the laptop is being used in hostile environments, where the laptop is at
  greater risk of being compromised.

3.3.5    Use Case 5: Traveling with a Dual-Boot Laptop

A user frequently travels on behalf of the organization and carries a laptop that contains sensitive data.
The laptop is dual-boot, using two OSs. For the user’s data, the major threat that the organization needs
to mitigate is unauthorized disclosure of data from the loss or theft of the laptop. Possible solutions
include the following:

 Use the OS access control features of each OS to strictly limit where the user can save files.
  Implement volume, virtual disk, or file/folder encryption on both of the laptop’s OSs to protect the
  user’s files.

 Implement an FDE solution that supports dual-boot configurations.

 Convert the laptop to be single-boot, and access the second (removed) OS through a virtual machine
  run by the primary OS. See use case 4 for further information on protecting the laptop.

3.4     Storage Encryption Technology Management

Most storage encryption deployments are managed centrally. Centralized management is most often
performed through special management utilities provided by the storage encryption vendor. If the storage
encryption solution is built into the devices’ OSs, then it could be managed through the mechanisms
already in place to manage OS configurations. The capabilities of centralized management utilities for
storage encryption technologies vary considerably. Examples of commonly implemented capabilities are
as follows:
