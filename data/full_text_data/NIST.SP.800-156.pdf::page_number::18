NIST SP 800-156                                                  REPRESENTATION OF PIV CHAIN-OF-TRUST
                                                                               FOR IMPORT AND EXPORT


             higher) or Tier 1 or higher federal background investigation the PIV
             cardholder underwent. There are two permitted values based on the progress
             of the background investigation. The element is set to ‘Approved’ or
             ‘Pending.’ ‘Approved’ indicates a NACI (or equivalent or higher) or Tier 1 or
             higher federal background investigation has been completed. ‘Pending’ status
             indicates the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National Criminal History
             Check (NCHC) portion of the background investigation is completed and that
             NACI background check is in process, but has not yet received final
             adjudication. The data is provided in an xs:string format.

      <NACIAdjudicationEffDate>:
           This element is optional, and occurs once when included in the
           AdjudicationInformationType complex type. The element indicates the date
           the current status of the <NACIAdjudicationValue> element went into effect.
           The data is provided in an xs:date format.

3.7     Complex Type EnrollmentPackageType

The following schema fragment defines the EnrollmentPackageType complex type:
<xs:complexType name="EnrollmentPackageType">
  <xs:sequence>
    <xs:element name="EPBiographic" type="EPBiographicType" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="EPBiometrics" type="EPBiometricsType" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/>
    <xs:element name="EPDocument" type="EPDocumentType" minOccurs="2" maxOccurs="2"/>
  </xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>


The EnrollmentPackageType complex type contains three elements that identify the
biographic and biometric properties of a PIV cardholder. The elements contained in the
EnrollmentPackageType complex type are:

      <EPBiographic>:
            This element is an instance of the EPBiographicType complex type,
            containing biographic information on the subject of the chain-of-trust
            enrollment record as described in Section 3.8. The <EPBiographic> element is
            an optional element and if present, appears once in the
            EnrollmentPackageType complex type.

      <EPBiometrics>:
            This element is an instance of the EPBiometricsType complex type,
            containing biometric information on the subject of the chain-of-trust
            enrollment record as described in Section 3.9. The < EPBiometrics> element
            is a required element that appears once in the EnrollmentPackageType
            complex type.

      <EPDocument>:
           This element is an instance of the EPDocumentType complex type as
           described in Section 3.10. The <EPDocument > element is a mandatory
           element and appears twice in the EnrollmentPackageType complex type.
