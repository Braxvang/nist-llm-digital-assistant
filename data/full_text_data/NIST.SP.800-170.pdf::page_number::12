    Security Testing, Validation, and Measurement
    Group (STVMG)
Mission Statement:
  Advance information security testing, measurement science,
and conformance.
Overview:
   Federal agencies, industry, and the public rely on cryptography
for the protection of information and communications used
in electronic commerce, critical infrastructure, and other
application areas. The STVMG supports testing and validation
of underlying cryptographic modules and cryptographic
algorithms in consideration of established standards. These
cryptographic modules and algorithms enable products and
systems to provide security services, such as confidentiality,
integrity, and authentication. Although cryptography provides
security, poor designs or weak algorithms can render a product
insecure and place highly sensitive information at risk. When
protecting sensitive data, Federal Government agencies require
a minimum level of assurance that cryptographic products meet
established security requirements and use only tested and
validated cryptographic modules.
  STVMG’s testing-focused activities include validating
cryptographic algorithm implementations, cryptographic
modules, and Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)-
compliant products; developing test suites and test methods;
providing implementation guidance and technical support
to industry forums; and conducting education, training, and
outreach programs.
