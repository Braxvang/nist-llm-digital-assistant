GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



 The ability of the tagâ€™s signal to penetrate materials. As a general rule, higher frequencies are less
  able to penetrate substances such as metals or liquids than lower frequencies. Depending on the
  application, the penetration capabilities of a particular frequency can be either a benefit or a
  shortcoming. For example, LF communication typically is a requirement when tags are placed inside
  an animal (or humans, in some emerging medical applications) because RF attenuation in living
  tissue, which is mostly water, increases significantly as frequency increases. In applications in which
  security is a significant concern, an organization may want to use a frequency range than can be
  blocked by a particular material because this enables effective security shielding that might not
  otherwise be available. Table 2-1 summarizes the ability of RF signals to penetrate various
  substances.
 The likelihood of radio interference. Radio interference is another reason why transmitted signals
  may not be properly received. Determining the potential sources of radio interference for a particular
  RFID implementation requires a site survey. RFID systems may experience radio interference from
  other systems that operate in the same or nearby frequency band. Interference often is exacerbated
  when using high power readers or when many readers are collocated. Table 2-2 lists potential sources
  of interference for RFID systems.
 The international portability of tags. The types of systems that use various portions of the
  electromagnetic spectrum can differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction because not all regulators assign
  the same frequencies for the same purposes. If an RFID application requires transporting tags across
  multiple regulatory jurisdictions, then the system needs to use a frequency range permitted in all of
  the jurisdictions. Regulations impacting RFID often change, so organizations that use or plan to use
  RFID technology internationally should monitor relevant developments. Currently, there are
  frequencies within the LF, HF, and UHF bands that are permitted in most jurisdictions. Also, some
  tags are frequency-agile, so they can respond to one frequency in one jurisdiction and another in a
  different jurisdiction. 8

    For example, EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 tags operate in the UHF band from 860 to 960 megahertz (MHz). In the
    United States, regulations permit operation from 902 to 928 MHz. In Europe, the typical operating range is from 865.6 to
    867.6 MHz. Some US and European readers can be tuned to corresponding permitted frequencies, but the tags will respond
    to both.
