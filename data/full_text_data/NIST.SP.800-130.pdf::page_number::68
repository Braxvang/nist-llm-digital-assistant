     b) Compromise-mitigation measures should be instituted to minimize key and/or
        metadata exposure,
     c) Appropriate corrective measures should be instituted to prevent the reoccurrence
        of the compromise, and
     d) The CKMS should be returned to a secure operating state.

6.8.1 Key Compromise
Depending on the key type and key usage, the compromise of a key could result in
    a) Loss of confidentiality,
    b) Loss of integrity,
    c) Loss of authentication,
    d) Loss of non-repudiation, or
    e) Some combination of these losses.

Note that the loss of a security service provided to a key is likely to result in a loss of the
same and potentially other security services for data protected by the key. For example, a
loss of the integrity for a public key transport key could impact the confidentiality of the
data encryption key protected by the public key and that, in turn, could compromise the
confidentiality of the data protected by the data encryption key. (More specifically, if a
public RSA key is changed to have the value 1 modulo n, then any data encrypted by that
altered key would be compromised.)

A key compromise could be undetected, detected or suspected. A CKMS should limit the
exposure of undetected key compromises by establishing a cryptoperiod or usage limit
for each key that it uses 18. At the end of each cryptoperiod, a new key could be
established to replace the old key. When a new key is established and activated to protect
new data, the old key should no longer be used to protect the new data. Thus, unless the
compromise recurs with the new key, the new data will be protected. Of course, the old
data that was protected with the old key could have been compromised, but the extent of
the compromise is limited, as long as the old key was not used to protect the new key
(e.g., the old key was not used to protect the new key during key transport). If a key
compromise is detected, then the compromised key and other keys whose security
depends upon the security of the compromised key should be replaced as soon as
possible. Since the compromise of a key may result in the compromise of many other
keys that it protects, it is important to design a CKMS to minimize the impact of key
compromise. [SP 800-57-part1] provides guidance as to appropriate cryptoperiods for
various key types.

If a symmetric key wrapping key, a private key transport key, or a private key agreement
key is compromised, then transported or agreed-upon keys might be compromised as
well. If the compromise is undetected, the compromise of additional keys might continue
indefinitely. Some protocols are designed to prevent or mitigate such attacks. However it

18
  The usage of keys may be limited based on a criterion such as the amount of data processed
using the key or the number of times the algorithm was initialized using the key.
