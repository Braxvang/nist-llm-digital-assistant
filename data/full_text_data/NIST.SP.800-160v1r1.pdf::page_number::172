RM-2   MANAGE THE RISK PROFILE
       RM-2.1 Define and record the security risk thresholds and conditions.
       Note: The security risk thresholds define the levels at which the appropriate treatment
       strategies are considered.
       RM-2.2 Establish and maintain the security aspects of the risk profile.
       Note: The risk profile records each security risk and opportunity, including a description of the
       security risk or opportunity, a record of the risk or opportunity parameters, the priority based on
       the risk or opportunity criteria, and the risk or opportunityâ€™s current state, treatment, and
       contingency strategy. The risk profile is updated when an individual security risk or opportunity
       state changes.
       RM-2.3 Provide the security aspects of the relevant risk profile to stakeholders.
       Note: Project planning determines the frequency of communicating the risk profile and its
       security aspects.

RM-3   ANALYZE RISK
       RM-3.1 Identify security risks in the categories described in the risk management context.
       Note: Security risks are commonly identified through various security and other analyses (e.g.,
       safety, assurance, producibility, and performance analyses); technology, architecture,
       integration, and readiness assessments; measurement reports; and trade-off studies.
       Additionally, security risks are often identified through the analysis of measures associated with
       system security goals (e.g., security-relevant Measures of Effectiveness or Measures of
       Performance).
       RM-3.2 Measure each identified security risk.
       RM-3.3 Evaluate each security risk against its risk thresholds.
       RM-3.4 Define and record recommended treatment strategies and measures for each security-
              relevant risk that exceeds its risk threshold.

RM-4   TREAT RISKS THAT EXCEED THEIR RISK THRESHOLD
       RM-4.1 Identify recommended alternatives for security risk treatment.
       RM-4.2 Define measures for determining the effectiveness of security risk treatments.
       RM-4.3 Implement selected security risk treatments.
       Note: The implemented alternative should be the one for which the security-relevant
       stakeholders determine that the actions taken will make a security-relevant risk acceptable.
       RM-4.4 Coordinate management action for selected security risk treatments.
