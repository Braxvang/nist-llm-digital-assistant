NIST SP 800-156                                                REPRESENTATION OF PIV CHAIN-OF-TRUST
                                                                             FOR IMPORT AND EXPORT


There are two use cases within the transferal scenario which this document supports:

Agency to agency: In this use case, an existing PIV cardholder from agency A is
transferring to agency B, where he/she will require a new PIV Card issued by agency B.
Rather than re-enrolling the user, the chain-of-trust record is sent, (upon Agency B’s
request) from agency A to agency B such that agency B is able to reuse the enrollment
data, thus reducing the time and effort required for agency B to issue a new PIV Card.

Agency to service provider: In this use case, an agency does not directly issue PIV Cards
to their employees and contractors, but instead utilizes a separate service provider for
issuance of PIV Cards. The agency can use the chain-of-trust to send PIV Card
enrollment data collected by the agency to the service provider.

It is anticipated that more optional elements will be populated in the chain-of-trust XML
record for the agency to service provider use case than the agency to agency use case. In
the agency to service provider exchange, the agency is likely to indicate several optional
elements that are not applicable in the agency to agency use case. Examples of these
elements include those that would be printed on a card and are provided by the agency to
the service provider, such as <EmployeeAffiliation>,
<AgencyDepartmentOrOrganization>, <AffiliationColorCode>, and <Rank>.

Regardless of the use case, the goal is to provide a common chain-of-trust schema to
facilitate information sharing and data exchange between different issuers.

1.3       Document Structure

The remainder of this document is divided into the following sections and appendices:

          Section 2, Chain-of-Trust Data Requirements and Namespaces, discusses the
           representation of chain-of-trust data in XML schemas.

          Section 3, Chain-of-Trust Schema Description, documents the detail of chain-of-
           trust XML schema.

          Section 4, Chain-of-trust Record Encryption in Transit, identifies the
           requirements for encrypting chain-of-trust data.

          Section 5, Log and Historical Data, discusses the requirement for the chain-of-
           trust producer to maintain records related to the cardholder.

          Appendix A contains the XML schema for the chain-of-trust.

          Appendix B contains a sample XML chain-of-trust data record.

          Appendix C identifies references used in this document.
