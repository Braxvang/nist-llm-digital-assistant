and other open areas. Some sensors have anti-tamper features, such as being designed to look like fire
alarms or regular APs, that can reduce the likelihood that they will be attacked. All sensors are
susceptible to physical attacks such as jamming that disrupt RF; there is no defense against such attacks
other than to establish a physical perimeter around the facility so that attackers cannot get close enough to
the WLAN to jam it.

5.3.4    Prevention Capabilities

Wireless IDPS sensors offer two types of intrusion prevention capabilities:

 Wireless. Some sensors can terminate connections between a rogue or misconfigured STA and an
  authorized AP or between an authorized STA and a rogue or misconfigured AP through the air. This
  is typically done by sending messages to the endpoints, telling them to deassociate the current
  session. The sensor then refuses to permit a new connection to be established.
 Wired. Some sensors can instruct a switch on the wired network to block network activity involving
  a particular STA or AP based on the device’s MAC address or switch port. For example, if a STA is
  sending attacks to a server on the wired network, a sensor could direct a wired switch to block all
  activity to and from the STA. This technique is only effective for blocking the malicious STA or
  AP’s wired network communications. It will not stop a STA or AP from continuing to perform
  malicious actions through wireless protocols.
Most IDPS sensors allow administrators to specify the prevention capability configuration for each type
of alert. This usually includes enabling or disabling prevention, as well as specifying which type of
prevention capability should be used. Some IDPS sensors have a learning or simulation mode that
suppresses all prevention actions, and instead indicates when a prevention action would have been
performed. This allows administrators to monitor and fine-tune the prevention capabilities’ configuration
before enabling prevention, which reduces the risk of performing prevention actions on benign activity.

An important consideration is the effect that prevention actions can have on sensor monitoring. For
example, if a sensor is transmitting signals to terminate connections, it may not be able to perform
channel scanning to monitor other communications until it has completed the prevention action. To
mitigate this, some sensors have two radios—one for monitoring and detection, and another for
performing prevention actions. When selecting sensors, organizations should consider what prevention
actions may need to be performed and how the sensor’s detection capabilities could be affected by
performing prevention actions.

5.4     Management

Most wireless IDPS products offer similar management capabilities. This section discusses major aspects
of management—implementation, operation, and maintenance—and provides recommendations for
performing them effectively and efficiently.

5.4.1    Implementation

Once a wireless IDPS product has been selected, the administrators need to design an architecture,
perform IDPS component testing, secure the IDPS components, and then deploy them. The only addition
to the material presented in Section 3.3.1 involves component testing and deployment. Implementing a
wireless IDPS can necessitate brief wireless network outages if existing APs or wireless switches need to
be upgraded or have IDPS software installed. Generally, the deployment of dedicated sensors causes no
network outages.
