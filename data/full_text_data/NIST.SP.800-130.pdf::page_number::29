SP 800-130                                                             August 2013




A Key and Metadata Retention Policy specifying the length of time that keys and
metadata are to be retained should also be part of the CKMS Security Policy. The Key
and Metadata Retention Policy should be based on the sensitivity of the information that
the keys and metadata protect. The CKMS should enforce the Key and Metadata
Retention Policy. For example, the CKMS should protect keys and metadata throughout
their security lifetimes, and then the CKMS should destroy the keys and metadata when
they are no longer desired.

A CKMS Security Policy should be written so that the people responsible for maintaining
the policy can easily understand the policy and correctly perform their roles and
responsibilities. Note that security policies could be specified in a form (e.g., tables,
formal specification languages, flow charts) that could be stored electronically and
processed automatically within a CKMS. Policies specified in a formal language could
be automatically enforced by a CKMS designed to do so. Such systems may be able to
check themselves for proper functioning, diagnose current or potential problems, report
the problem to the responsible organizational entity, and perhaps even automatically
correct the problem.

FR:4.1 The CKMS design shall specify the CKMS Security Policy, including the
configurable options and sub-policies that it is designed to enforce.

FR:4.2 The CKMS design shall specify how the CKMS Security Policy is to be enforced
by the CKMS (e.g., the mechanisms used to provide the protection required by the
policy).

FR:4.3 The CKMS design shall specify how any automated portions of the CKMS
Security Policy are expressed in an unambiguous tabular form or a formal language (e.g.,
XML or ASN.1), such that an automated security system (e.g., table driven or syntax-
directed software mechanisms) in the CKMS can enforce them.

4.4 Other Related Security Policies
A CKMS Security Policy may include or rely on other security policies. A CKMS design
should state what other policies are required to be enforced for proper and secure
operation of the CKMS. For example, a CKMS could be designed and implemented to
provide all the physical protection and access control required to assure protection of the
CKMS itself. It could also be designed assuming (and requiring) that external physical
security and access control is provided by the facility in which the CKMS is installed and
operated. Computer systems are often built to their own Computer Security Policy. An
organization should create these policies in a logical structure that assigns roles for
managing and enforcing the policies to appropriate parts of the organization.

FR:4.4 The CKMS design shall specify other related security policies that support the
CKMS Security Policy.
