NIST SP 800-215                                                            Guide to a Secure Enterprise
November 2022                                                                      Network Landscape


Executive Summary
The enterprise network landscape has undergone tremendous changes in the last decade due to
the following three drivers:
   •   Enterprise access to multiple cloud services,
   •   The geographical spread of enterprise-based (on-premises) IT resources (e.g., multiple
       data centers, headquarters, and branch offices), and
   •   Changes to application architecture from being monolithic to a set of loosely coupled
       microservices.
The impacts of these drivers on the security of the enterprise network landscape include:
   •   Disappearance of the concept of a network perimeter that can be protected and the
       necessity to protect each endpoint (device or service) that treats it as a perimeter
   •   Increase in attack surface due to sheer multiplicity of IT resources (computing,
       networking, storage) and components
   •   Escalation of attacks across several network boundaries leveraging the connectivity
       features
This document is meant to provide guidance to this new enterprise network landscape from a
secure operations perspective. The adopted methodology first considers the security challenges
that the new network landscape poses and examines the limitations of current network access
technologies. It then shows how solutions for meeting the challenges have evolved from being
security function-specific to a security framework to a comprehensive security infrastructure that
provides a holistic set of security services. Specific areas addressed include:
   •   Feature enhancements to traditional network security appliances
   •   Secure enterprise networking configurations for specific security functions
   •   Security frameworks that integrate individual network configurations
   •   Evolving wide area network (WAN) infrastructure that provides a comprehensive set of
       security services
Based on the drivers outlined above, an enterprise network in the context of this document
encompasses the following:
   •   The private virtual networks that the enterprise (cloud services subscriber) configures in
       the cloud service provider’s native network within which its compute resources will be
       provisioned (e.g., virtual network [VNet], virtual private cloud [VPC])
   •   Various local networks on enterprise premises (e.g., enterprise data centers, headquarters,
       and branch offices)
   •   The portion of a wide area network that is used by the enterprise to connect its various
       geographically dispersed locations and cloud service access points
