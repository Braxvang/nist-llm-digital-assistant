NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                  Guidelines for Media Sanitization




D.1      Example Statement of Cryptographic Erase Features

The following statements should be placed by the storage device vendor in an area accessible to
potential users of a device, such as on the vendorâ€™s website or in product literature that is widely
available. Information of a proprietary nature may not be available in published product
information.

      1. Make/Model/Version/Media Type: Acme hard drive model abc12345 version 1+.
         Media type is Legacy Magnetic media.

      2. Key Generation: A DRBG is used as specified in SP 800-90, with validation [number].

      3. Media Encryption: Media is encrypted with AES-256 media encryption in Cipher Block
         Chaining (CBC) mode as described in SP 800-38A. This device is FIPS 140 validated
         with certificate [number].

      4. Key Level and Wrapping: The media encryption key is sanitized directly during
         Cryptographic Erase.

      5. Data Areas Addressed: The device encrypts all data stored in the LBA-addressable
         space except for a preboot authentication and variable area and the device logs. Device
         log data is retained by the device following Cryptographic Erase.

      6. Key Lifecycle Management: As the MEK moves between wrapped, unwrapped, and re-
         wrapped states, the previous instance is sanitized using three inverted overwrite passes.

      7. Key Sanitization Technique: Three passes with a pattern that is inverted between
         passes.

      8. Key Escrow or Injection: The device does not support escrow or injection of the keys at
         or below the level of the sanitization operation.

      9. Error Condition Handling: If the storage device encounters a defect in a location where
         a key is stored, the device attempts to rewrite the location and the Cryptographic Erase
         operations continues, reporting success to the user if the operation is otherwise
         successful.

      10. Interface Clarity: The device has an ATA interface and supports the ATA Sanitize
          Device feature set CRYPTO SCRAMBLE EXT command and a TCG Opal interface
          with the ability to sanitize the device by cryptographically erasing the contents. Both of
          these commands apply the functionality described in this statement.
