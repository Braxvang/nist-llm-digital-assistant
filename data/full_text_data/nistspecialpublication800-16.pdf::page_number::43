                 IT Security ABC's            — Terms and Concepts             (Continued)

       •   Policies and Procedures     — IT   security safeguards are intended to achieve specific control
           objectives. These objectives are contained within security policies that should be tailored
           to the needs of each IT system. Procedures define the technical and procedural safeguards
           that have been implemented to enforce the specified policies. FT security procedures may
           be documented in a security plan.

       •   Quality Assurance/Quality Control       — Quality i\ssurance and Quality Control     are two
           processes that are used to ensure the consistency and integrity of security safeguards.
           Specifically, these processes are intended to ensure that security countermeasures perform
           as specified, under all workload and operating conditions.

       •   Risk Management       — Risk management      is the process whereby the threats, vulnerabilities,

           and potential impacts from security incidents are evaluated against the cost of safeguard
           implementation. The objective of Risk Management is to ensure that all IT assets are
           afforded reasonable protection against waste, fraud, abuse, and disruption of operations.
           Risk Management is growing in importance as the scope of potential threats is growing
           while available resources are declining.

       •   Security Training     — Security   training is the sum of the processes used to impart the body
           of knowledge associated with IT security to those who use, maintain, develop, or manage
           IT systems.   A well trained staff can often compensate for weak technical and procedural
           safeguards. Security training has been demonstrated to have the greatest return on
           investment of any technical or procedural IT security safeguard.

       •   Threats   — Threats    are actions or events (intentional or unintentional) which, if realized,
           will result in waste, fraud, abuse, or disruption of operations. Threats are always present,
           and the rate of threat occurrence can not be controlled. IT security safeguards, therefore,
           must be designed to prevent or minimize any impact on the affected IT system.
       •   Unique Identifiers    —A unique identifier is a code or set of codes that provide a positive
           association between authorities and actions to individuals. Safeguards must be in place to
           ensure that an identifier is used only by the individual to whom it is assigned.

       •   Vulnerabilities   —   Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in an IT system's security environment.
           Threats may exploit or act through a vulnerability to adversely affect the FT system.
           Safeguards are used to mitigate or eliminate vulnerabilities.

       •   Waste, Fraud, and Abuse      — Waste,    fraud, and abuse are potential adverse impacts that may
           result from a breakdown in IT security.      Waste, fraud, and abuse are specifically identified
           as potential impacts in government-wide policy.
