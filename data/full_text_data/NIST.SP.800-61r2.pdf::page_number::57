4.2     Information Sharing Techniques

Information sharing is a key element of enabling coordination across organizations. Even the smallest
organizations need to be able to share incident information with peers and partners in order to deal with
many incidents effectively. Organizations should perform such information sharing throughout the
incident response life cycle and not wait until an incident has been fully resolved before sharing details of
it with others. Section 4.3 discusses the types of incident information that organizations may or may not
want to share with others.

This section focuses on techniques for information sharing. Section 4.2.1 looks at ad hoc methods, while
Section 4.2.2 examines partially automated methods. Finally, Section 4.2.3 discusses security
considerations related to information sharing.

4.2.1    Ad Hoc

Most incident information sharing has traditionally occurred through ad hoc methods, such as email,
instant messaging clients, and phone. Ad hoc information sharing mechanisms normally rely on an
individual employeeâ€™s connections with employees in incident response teams of partner organizations.
The employee uses these connections to manually share information with peers and coordinate with them
to construct strategies for responding to an incident. Depending on the size of the organization, these ad
hoc techniques may be the most cost-effective way of sharing information with partner organizations.
However, due to the informal nature of ad hoc information sharing, it is not possible to guarantee that the
information sharing processes will always operate. For example, if a particularly well-connected
employee resigns from an incident response team, that team may temporarily lose the majority of
information sharing channels it relies on to effectively coordinate with outside organizations.

Ad hoc information sharing methods are also largely unstandardized in terms of what information is
communicated and how that communication occurs. Because of the lack of standardization, they tend to
require manual intervention and to be more resource-intensive to process than the alternative, partially
automated methods. Whenever possible an organization should attempt to formalize its information
sharing strategies through formal agreements with partner organizations and technical mechanisms that
will help to partially automate the sharing of information.

4.2.2    Partially Automated

Organizations should attempt to automate as much of the information sharing process as possible to make
cross-organizational coordination efficient and cost effective. In reality, it will not be possible to fully
automate the sharing of all incident information, nor will it be desirable due to security and trust
considerations. Organizations should attempt to achieve a balance of automated information sharing
overlaid with human-centric processes for managing the information flow.

When engineering automated information sharing solutions, organizations should first consider what
types of information they will communicate with partners. The organization may want to construct a
formal data dictionary enumerating all entities and relationships between entities that they will wish to
share. Once the organization understands the types of information they will share, it is necessary to
construct formal, machine-processable models to capture this information. Wherever possible, an
organization should use existing data exchange standards for representing the information they need to
