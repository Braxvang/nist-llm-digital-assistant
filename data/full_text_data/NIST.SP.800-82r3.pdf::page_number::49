NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

In summary, the operational and risk differences between IT and OT systems create the need for
increased sophistication in applying cybersecurity and operational strategies. A cross-functional
team of control engineers, control system operators, and IT security professionals must work
closely to understand the possible implications of the installation, operation, and maintenance of
security solutions in conjunction with control system operation. IT professionals working with
OT need to understand the reliability impacts of information security technologies before
deployment. Moreover, some of the OSs and applications that run on OT may not operate
correctly with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) IT cybersecurity solutions because of their
unique requirements.
