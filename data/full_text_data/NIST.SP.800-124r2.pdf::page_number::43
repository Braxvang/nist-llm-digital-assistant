complexity rules listed in NIST SP 800-63-3 [4]. If supported by the EMM, multi-factor
authentication also should be used. These additional layers of authentication for system
administrators can help thwart EMM credential theft.
Threats Addressed: Credential theft via phishing, device loss and theft

       Enterprise Mobile Device Deployment Life Cycle
There are many factors to consider when deploying mobile devices within an enterprise
environment. These include selecting the correct management technologies and devices,
alongside properly providing them to users. This section defines a process, as seen in Fig. 4, for
deploying devices and managing them throughout their operational life cycle, entitled the
Enterprise Mobile Device Deployment Life Cycle. Each step of the process is described below
along with the necessary implementation details. Organizations may wish to document their
decision-making process and implementation details in a mobile security policy.
Alternative process models and frameworks exist, and enterprises should adopt or combine the
ones that suit their needs while satisfying their requirements. One example is the Mobile
Computing Decision Making Framework (MCDF) – a four-stage framework that is used to
determine whether a mobile solution is necessary to support an enterprise’s overall mission.
More information on the MCDF can be found in the CIO Council’s Mobile Computing Decision
Making Framework [12].
