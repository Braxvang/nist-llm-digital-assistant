                                   GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



6.3     Develop the Test Material

Once the event is designed, the design team needs to create test documentation. The magnitude of this
work depends on the scope of the test. This documentation could include the following:

       Briefings. For larger system or comprehensive tests, an initial meeting may be used to signal the
        start of the event. Specific briefings to senior management and to the managers of others that
        might be affected by the test need to be developed to provide an understanding of what the test
        will comprise and why it is important.
       Test Guide. This document outlines the basic steps involved in conducting a test and includes a
        list of the participants. It should also include a list of all individuals and groups who might be
        affected by the test, and discuss procedures for early termination of the test should events
        necessitate this action. This guide provides an overall examination of what will occur during the
        test.
       Test Plans. For each specific test to be performed, a test plan needs to be developed that outlines
        the specific steps that will be performed. Each step should include a list of required logistical
        items and delineate the expected outcome or response from this step. The procedures for early
        test termination should be repeated in this documentation, because the evaluators or the people
        conducting the test should be using the documentation during the test. A list of emergency
        contact numbers (including cell phone and pager numbers) should also be included.
       After Action Report. An after action report is developed after the test is completed. It should
        contain the results of each individual test as well as an overall synopsis of the test activities.
        Corrective actions and recommendations are one element of this report. For larger tests, an
        executive summary for senior management should also be created that provides a synopsis of the
        test, the results of the test, and the recommendations for improvement.
When developing a comprehensive test for an IT plan, there might be significant overlap with what would
occur when developing a functional exercise for the same plan. In fact, many comprehensive tests have
test plans that include materials similar to those used for functional exercises, including a scenario, an
MSEL, and message injects. For example, during a test, participants may be told that a particular backup
tape has failed, a certain server is unusable, or a road to the backup facility is closed. The key difference
between a functional exercise and a test is that a test is conducted in an operational environment
whenever possible, and it is designed to validate the actual effectiveness of both the processes and
procedures for system recovery and restoration outlined in the plan, as well as the training that has been
conducted, to ensure personnel understand their responsibilities and know how to react in a given
situation.

6.4     Conduct the Test

The locations for tests vary based on the type of test being conducted and the test’s scope. For example, a
small component test could be conducted in a single office, while a comprehensive test of components
and systems for an IT plan could involve many different parts of an organization in various locations.

Safety and security are two elements that should be maintained during any test. The organization’s
operational systems and networks need to be protected so that they do not sustain damage. The core
function or mission of the organization should not be disrupted to the extent that the organization can no
longer function and provide the services that it was created to provide. For these reasons, the test director
should monitor all tests closely. At any sign of a possible catastrophic disruption, or in the event that the
