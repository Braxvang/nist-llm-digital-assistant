NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                                      Guidelines for Media Sanitization


3        Roles and Responsibilities

    3.1 Program Managers/Agency Heads

“Ultimately, responsibility for the success of an organization lies with its senior managers.” 14 By
establishing an effective information security governance structure, they establish the
organization’s computer security program and its overall program goals, objectives, and
priorities in order to support the mission of the organization. Ultimately, the head of the
organization is responsible for ensuring that adequate resources are applied to the program and
for ensuring program success. Senior management is responsible for ensuring that the resources
are allocated to correctly identify types and locations of information and to ensure that resources
are allocated to properly sanitize the information.

The other responsibilities in the remainder of this section are for illustrative purposes and the
intent is to ensure that organizations think through the different responsibilities for sanitizing
media and assign those responsibilities appropriately.

    3.2 Chief Information Officer (CIO)

The CIO 15 is charged with promulgating information security policy. A component of this policy
is information disposition and media sanitization. The CIO, as the information custodian, is
responsible for ensuring that organizational or local sanitization requirements follow the
guidelines of this document.

    3.3 Information System Owner

The information system owner 16 should ensure that maintenance or contractual agreements are in
place and are sufficient in protecting the confidentiality of the system media and information
commensurate with the impact of disclosure of such information on the organization.

    3.4 Information Owner/Steward

The information owner should ensure that appropriate supervision of onsite media maintenance by
service providers occurs, when necessary. The information owner is also responsible for ensuring that
they fully understand the sensitivity of the information under their control and that the users of the
information are aware of its confidentiality and the basic requirements for media sanitization.

     Per the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 (“Clinger-Cohen Act”; P.L. 104-106 (Division E) 10 Feb.
    1996), when an agency has not designated a formal CIO position, FISMA requires the associated responsibilities to be handled
    by a comparable agency official.

    16
       The role of the information system owner can be interpreted in a variety of ways depending on the particular agency and the
    system development life-cycle phase of the information system. Some agencies may refer to the information system owners as
    “program managers” or “business/asset/mission owners”.
