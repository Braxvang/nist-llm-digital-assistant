      NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                        Authentication and Lifecycle Management


422   4.   Authentication Assurance Levels
423   This section is normative.
424   To satisfy the requirements of a given AAL and be recognized as a subscriber, a claimant
425    SHALL be authenticated with a process whose strength is equal to or greater than the
426   requirements at that level. The result of an authentication process is an identifier that
427    SHALL be used each time that subscriber authenticates to that RP. The identifier MAY
428   be pseudonymous. Subscriber identifiers SHOULD NOT be reused for a different subject
429   but SHOULD be reused when a previously enrolled subject is re-enrolled by the CSP.
430   Other attributes that identify the subscriber as a unique subject MAY also be provided.
431   Detailed normative requirements for authenticators and verifiers at each AAL are
432   provided in Sec. 5.
433   See [SP800-63] Sec. 5 for details on how to choose the most appropriate AAL.
434   [FIPS140] requirements are satisfied by FIPS 140-3 or newer revisions.
435   Personal information collected during and subsequent to identity proofing MAY be made
436   available to the subscriber by the digital identity service. The release or online availability
437   of any PII or other personal information, whether self-asserted or validated, by federal
438   government agencies requires multi-factor authentication in accordance with [EO13681].
439   Therefore, federal government agencies SHALL select a minimum of AAL2 when PII or
440   other personal information is made available online.

441   4.1. Authentication Assurance Level 1
442   AAL1 provides some assurance that the claimant controls an authenticator bound to the
443   subscriber account. AAL1 requires either single-factor or multi-factor authentication
444   using a wide range of available authentication technologies. Successful authentication
445   requires that the claimant prove possession and control of the authenticator through a
446   secure authentication protocol.

447   4.1.1. Permitted Authenticator Types
448   AAL1 authentication SHALL occur by the use of any of the following authenticator
449   types, which are defined in Sec. 5:
450        • Memorized secret (Sec. 5.1.1)
451        • Look-Up secret (Sec. 5.1.2)
452        • Out-of-band device (Sec. 5.1.3)
453        • Single-factor one-time password (OTP) device (Sec. 5.1.4)
454        • Multi-factor OTP device (Sec. 5.1.5)
455        • Single-factor cryptographic software (Sec. 5.1.6)
