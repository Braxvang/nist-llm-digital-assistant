applications3 are not required because the security controls for those applications are
typically provided by the general support system or major application in which they
operate. In those cases where the minor application is not connected to a major
application or general support system, the minor application should be briefly described
in a general support system plan that has either a common physical location or is
supported by the same organization. Additional information is provided in Chapter 2.


1.6 Other Related NIST Publications
In order to develop the system security plan, it is necessary to be familiar with NIST
security standards and guidelines. It is essential that users of this publication understand
the requirements and methodology for information system categorization as described in
NIST FIPS 199 as well as the requirements for addressing minimum security controls for
a given system as described in NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for
Federal Information Systems, and FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal
information and Information System.

Other key NIST publications directly supporting the preparation of the security plan are
NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems, and
NIST SP 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal
Information Systems. All documents can be obtained from the NIST Computer Security
Resource Center website at: http://csrc.nist.gov/.


1.7 System Security Plan Responsibilities
Agencies should develop policy on the system security planning process. System security
plans are living documents that require periodic review, modification, and plans of action
and milestones for implementing security controls. Procedures should be in place
outlining who reviews the plans, keeps the plan current, and follows up on planned
security controls. In addition, procedures should require that system security plans be
developed and reviewed prior to proceeding with the security certification and
accreditation process for the system.

During the security certification and accreditation process, the system security plan is
analyzed, updated, and accepted. The certification agent confirms that the security
controls described in the system security plan are consistent with the FIPS 199 security
category determined for the information system, and that the threat and vulnerability
identification and initial risk determination are identified and documented in the system
security plan, risk assessment, or equivalent document. The results of a security
certification are used to reassess the risks, develop the plan of action and milestones
(POA&Ms) which are required to track remedial actions, and update the system security
plan, thus providing the factual basis for an authorizing official to render a security

 NIST Special Publication 800-37 defines a minor application as an application, other than a major
application, that requires attention to security due to the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from the loss,
misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of the information in the application. Minor applications
are typically included as part of a general support system.
