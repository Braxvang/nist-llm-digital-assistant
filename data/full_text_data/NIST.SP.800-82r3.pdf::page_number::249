operator response is required in emergency situations. Example compensating controls include
locating the display in an area with physical access controls that limit access to individuals with
permission and need-to-know for the displayed information.
Control Enhancement: (1) OT Discussion: Physical protection may be employed to prevent
access to a display or the attachment of a display. When the OT cannot conceal displayed
information, the organization employs nonautomated mechanisms or procedures as
compensating controls in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.
