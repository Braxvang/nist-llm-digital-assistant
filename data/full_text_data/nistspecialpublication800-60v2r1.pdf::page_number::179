property loss and in loss of human lives. Such information will have a high integrity impact
level.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
ground transportation information is low.

D.11.2 Water Transportation Information Type

Water Transportation involves the activities related to ensuring the availability of transit and the
safe passage of passengers and goods over sea and water. Note: The protection of maritime
transportation from deliberate attack is included in the Transportation Security information type
under the Homeland Security mission area. The general recommended security categorization for
the water transportation information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of water transportation
information on the ability of responsible agencies to ensure the availability of transit and the safe
passage of passengers and goods over sea and water. The protection of water transportation from
deliberate attack is included in the Transportation Security information type under the Homeland
Security mission area. Some regulatory and tariff enforcement functions associated with the safe
passage of passengers and goods over sea and water involve relatively sensitive information.
These are included in Law Enforcement. In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of water
transportation information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets,
or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of accident
investigation information that has not been adequately researched, coordinated, or edited can
result in serious economic harm to individuals and to corporations. Loss in public confidence is
a further potential consequence. Additionally, some information associated with water
transportation functions is proprietary to corporations or subject to privacy laws. In such cases,
the confidentiality impact resulting from unauthorized disclosure can be moderate.

Some military sea and water transportation information is national security information and is
outside the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for water transportation information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In most cases,
the adverse effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of water transportation
information on agency mission functions and public confidence in the agency will be limited.
