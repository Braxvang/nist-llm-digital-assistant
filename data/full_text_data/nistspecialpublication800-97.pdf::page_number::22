ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



          10 to 66 GHz band range. 11 An IEEE 802.16a addendum allows for large data transmissions with
          minimal interference. WiMAX provides throughput of up to 75 Mbps, with a range of up to 30
          miles for fixed line-of-site communication. However, there is generally a tradeoff; 75 Mbps
          throughput is possible at half a mile, but at 30 miles the throughput is much lower.
       Wireless wide area networks (WWAN): networks that connect individuals and devices over
        large geographic areas, often globally. WWANs are typically used for cellular voice and data
        communications, as well as satellite communications.
2.2     IEEE 802.11 Network Components and Architectural Models

IEEE 802.11 has two fundamental architectural components, as follows:

       Station (STA). A STA is a wireless endpoint device. Typical examples of STAs are laptop
        computers, personal digital assistants (PDA), mobile phones, and other consumer electronic
        devices with IEEE 802.11 capabilities.
       Access Point (AP). 12 An AP logically connects STAs with a distribution system (DS), which is
        typically an organizationâ€™s wired infrastructure. APs can also logically connect wireless STAs
        with each other without accessing a distribution system.
The IEEE 802.11 standard also defines the following two WLAN design structures or configurations,
which are discussed in more detail in Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2:

       Ad Hoc Mode. The ad hoc mode does not use APs. Ad hoc mode is sometimes referred to as
        infrastructureless because only peer-to-peer STAs are involved in the communications.
       Infrastructure Mode. In infrastructure mode, an AP connects wireless STAs to each other or to
        a distribution system, typically a wired network. Infrastructure mode is the most commonly used
        mode for WLANs.
2.2.1     Ad Hoc Mode

The ad hoc mode (or topology) is depicted conceptually in Figure 2-1. This mode of operation, also
known as peer-to-peer mode, is possible when two or more STAs are able to communicate directly to one
another. Figure 2-1 shows three devices communicating with each other in a peer-to-peer fashion without
any infrastructure. A set of STAs configured in this ad hoc manner is known as an independent basic
service set (IBSS).

Today, a STA is most often thought of as a simple laptop with an inexpensive network interface card
(NIC) that provides wireless connectivity; however, many other types of devices could also be STAs. In
Figure 2-1, the STAs in the IBSS are a mobile phone, a laptop, and a PDA. IEEE 802.11 and its variants
continue to increase in popularity; scanners, printers, digital cameras and other portable devices can also
be STAs. The circular shape in Figure 2-1 depicts the IBSS. It is helpful to consider this as the radio
frequency coverage area within which the stations can remain in communication. A fundamental
property of IBSS is that it defines no routing or forwarding, so, based on the bare IEEE 802.11i spec, all
the devices must be within radio range of one another.

      Technically, APs are also STAs. Some literature distinguishes between AP STAs and non-AP STAs. In this document, the
      term STA refers to non-AP STAs only.
