sounds; and critical data backup of important PIM application information and data files. The
characteristics of these four categories range from highly stable to extremely volatile. These
differences combined with the characteristics of a specific operating system, determine how
ROM and RAM are used to support each storage category.

Figure 6 illustrates the most typical arrangement. Flash ROM is used mainly to hold the
operating system code and optionally, any PIM data or files backed up by the user into the
remaining space. Flash memory has a limited life of approximately 100,000 erase cycles.
RAM is used for dynamic storage and user file storage. A soft reset (i.e., warm boot) typically
reinitializes the dynamic storage in RAM, but leaves user file storage untouched, while a hard
reset (i.e., cold boot) reinitializes both. Completely draining power from the PDA has the
same effect as a hard reset. ROM is unaffected by either a soft or hard reset.

A common alternative memory arrangement is shown in Figure 7. Here user file storage
resides in Flash ROM with the operating system code, which avoids the need for backup
utilities, since the storage is persistent and unaffected by resets and power drainage. The
relative sizes of ROM and RAM are normally sized differently (i.e., more ROM and less
RAM) when compared with the earlier arrangement to provide commensurate capacity. To
keep user file storage in ROM versus RAM, a specialized filesystem is required to avoid
quickly reaching the lifetime of that media. File systems such as JFFS2 (The Journaling Flash
File System, version 2) are designed specifically to manage flash memory usage carefully
[Woo01]. For example, JFFS2 prevents the rewrite of an entire sector to erase a single byte
and ensures that different areas of memory are used in rotation to manage wear.

Because a limited number of forensic tools exist for acquisition of ROM and RAM contents
from a PDA, the choice is often simple. One main consideration is to maintain compatibility
with the toolkit eventually used in examination and analysis, since interoperability among
different PDA tools, especially commercial case file formats, is not guaranteed.
