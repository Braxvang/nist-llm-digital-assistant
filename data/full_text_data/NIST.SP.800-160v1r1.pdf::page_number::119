meaningful only to the extent to which the trustworthiness-relevant requirements accurately
reflect the problem, accurately define the solution, and can be verified as being satisfied by the
solution.

The trustworthiness requirements about security derive from the protection needs, priorities,
constraints, and concerns associated with the system’s ability to achieve authorized and intended
behaviors and outcomes, deal with adversity, and control loss. The requirements also address the
measures used to assess trustworthiness and the evidentiary data and information required to
substantiate trustworthiness conclusions and grant trust. The requirements engineering discipline
provides the methods, processes, techniques, and tools for this to occur.


                     “A meaningful claim of trustworthiness cannot be based on an isolated
                     demonstration that the system contains a protection capability assumed to
                     be effective or sufficient. Instead, conclusions about a protection capability
                     must have their basis on evidence that the system was properly specified,
                     designed, and implemented with the rigor needed to deliver a system-level
                     function in a manner deemed to be trustworthy and secure.” [2]




F.1.2. Design Considerations
The design for a trustworthy secure system requires the application of principled engineering
concepts and methods supported by evidence that provides assurance that all security-relevant
claims about the system are satisfied (Section F.2). 87 Some considerations that apply to achieving
trustworthiness in system design are:
•    Composition
     Trustworthiness judgments are compositional. They must align with how the set of composed
     elements provides a system capability. The way that the system is composed from its system
     elements must include the design principles of Compositional Trustworthiness and, to the
     extent practical, Structured Decomposition and Composition.
•    States, Modes, and Transitions
     Ideally, the implemented system design will result in a system that continually remains in
     secure states and modes with secure transitions between states and modes (Section 3.2).
     Realistically, the system will have insecure and indeterminant (i.e., unknown if secure or
     insecure) systems states and modes. The design must account for these cases and provide the
     capability to transition from insecure and indeterminant states and modes to secure states and
     modes (Protective Recovery).

   Constraints and claims are expressed in terms of functional correctness, strength of function, concerns for asset loss and consequences, and the
protection capability derived from adherence to standards or from the use of specific processes, procedures, or methods.
