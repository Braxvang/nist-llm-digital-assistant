11.1.2.5 Verify asymmetric key pair

Purpose                 Confirms that the public key that exists in the certificate corresponds to
                        the private key on the card.
Reference(s)            1.    FIPS201, Section 5
                        2.    AS07.01.11
Precondition            1.    A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                        2.    A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and
                              the contact reader.
                        3.    The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                        4.    A PIV authentication key and corresponding certificate are present
                              on the PIV card.
Test Steps              1.    Take an arbitrary stream of data
                        2.    Hash the data using a hash algorithm
                        3.    Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                        4.    Set authenticators := <<valid authenticator>>
                        5.    Call pivLogIntoCardApplication
                              • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) authenticators
                        6. Set keyReference := <<key reference for PIV
                           Authentication Key i.e. 9A>>
                        7. Set algorithmIdentifier := <<identifier of the
                           algorithm to be used for the cryptographic operation>>
                        8. Set algorithmInput := <<hashed data from Step 2>>
                        9. Call pivCrypt with the following parameters
                           • (IN) keyReference
                              • (IN) algorithmIdentifier
                              • (IN) algorithmInput
                              • (OUT) algorithmOutput
                        10. Set OID := <<PIV Authentication Certificate
                            (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.1.1)>>
                        11. Call pivGetData with the following parameters
                            • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                        12.     Verify the signature with subjectPublicKeyInfo-
                              >subjectPublicKey from the certificate
Expected Result(s)      The private key corresponds to the public key contained in the
                        certificate as the signature verification succeeds.


11.1.2.6 Verify FASC-N

Purpose                 Confirms that the subjectAltName extension contains the FASC-N of
                        the card holder and that it matches to that present in the CHUID.
