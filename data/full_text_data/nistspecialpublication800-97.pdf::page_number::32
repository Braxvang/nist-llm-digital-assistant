ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



than cryptographic checksums, but are only designed to protect against random bit errors, not intentional
forgeries, so they do not provide the same level of integrity protection.

3.2.4      Replay Protection

The cryptographic implementation provides no protection against replay attacks because it does not
include features such as an incrementing counter, timestamp, or other temporal data that would make
replayed traffic easily detectable.

3.2.5      Availability

Individuals who do not have physical access to the WLAN infrastructure can cause a denial of service for
the WLAN. One threat is known as jamming, which involves a device that emits electromagnetic energy
on the WLAN’s frequencies. The energy makes the frequencies unusable by the WLAN, causing a denial
of service. Jamming can be performed intentionally by an attacker or unintentionally by a non-WLAN
device transmitting on the same frequency. Another threat against availability is flooding, which involves
an attacker sending large numbers of messages to an AP at such a high rate that the AP cannot process
them, or other STAs cannot access the channel, causing a partial or total denial of service. These threats
are difficult to counter in any radio-based communications; thus, the IEEE 802.11 standard does not
provide any defense against jamming or flooding. Also, as described in Section 3.2.1, attackers can
establish rogue APs; if STAs mistakenly attach to a rogue AP instead of a legitimate one, this could make
the legitimate WLAN effectively unavailable to users. Although 802.11i protects data frames, it does not
offer protection to control or management frames. An attacker can exploit the fact that management
frames are not authenticated to deauthenticate a client or to disassociate a client from the network. 19

3.3     Brief Overview of IEEE 802.11i Security

The IEEE 802.11i standard is the sixth amendment to the baseline IEEE 802.11 standards. It includes
many security enhancements that leverage mature and proven security technologies. For example, IEEE
802.11i references the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) standard, which is a means for providing
mutual authentication between STAs and the WLAN infrastructure, as well as performing automatic
cryptographic key distribution. Section 6 describes EAP in depth; EAP is a standard developed by the
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). 20 . IEEE 802.11i employs accepted cryptographic practices, such
as generating cryptographic checksums through hash message authentication codes (HMAC).

The IEEE 802.11i specification introduces the concept of a Robust Security Network (RSN). An RSN is
defined as a wireless security network that only allows the creation of Robust Security Network
Associations (RSNA). An RSNA is a logical connection between communicating IEEE 802.11 entities
established through the IEEE 802.11i key management scheme, called the 4-Way Handshake, which is a
protocol that validates that both entities share a pairwise master key (PMK), synchronizes the installation
of temporal keys, and confirms the selection and configuration of data confidentiality and integrity
protocols. The entities obtain the PMK in one of two ways—either the PMK is already configured on
each device, in which case it is called a pre-shared key (PSK), or it is distributed as a side effect of a
successful EAP authentication instance, which is a component of IEEE 802.1X port-based access control.
The PMK serves as the basis for the IEEE 802.11i data confidentiality and integrity protocols that provide

      The IEEE 802.11w Task Group is working on an extension to 802.11i that will protect some management frames, including
      disassociation frames.

      The IETF’s Working Groups produce two types of documents: Request for Comment (RFC), which are accepted standards;
      and Internet-Drafts, which are working documents that may become RFCs. The last 2 digits of the name of an Internet-
      Draft represent its version number (e.g., 00 or 05). Since this is subject to change, this document substitutes “xx” for the
      version number of referenced Internet-Drafts.
