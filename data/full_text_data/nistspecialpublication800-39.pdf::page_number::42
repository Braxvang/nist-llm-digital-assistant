The steps in the risk management process are not inherently sequential in nature. The steps are
performed in different ways, depending on the particular tier where the step is applied and on
prior activities related to each of the steps. What is consistent is that the outputs or post conditions
from a particular risk management step directly impact one or more of the other risk management
steps in the risk management process. Organizations have significant flexibility in how the risk
management steps are performed (e.g., sequence, degree of rigor, formality, and thoroughness of
application) and in how the results of each step are captured and shared—both internally and
externally. Ultimately, the objective of applying the risk management process and associated risk-
related concepts is to develop a better understanding of information security risk in the context of
the broader actions and decisions of organizations and in particular, with respect to organizational
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and Nation.

3.1 FRAMING RISK
Risk framing establishes the context and provides a common perspective on how organizations
manage risk. Risk framing, as its principal output, produces a risk management strategy that
addresses how organizations intend to assess risk, respond to risk, and monitor risk. The risk
management strategy makes explicit the specific assumptions, constraints, risk tolerances, and
priorities/trade-offs used within organizations for making investment and operational decisions.
The risk management strategy also includes any strategic-level decisions and considerations on
how risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation,
is to be managed by senior leaders/executives.

At Tier 1, senior leaders/executives, in consultation and collaboration with the risk executive
(function), define the organizational risk frame including the types of risk decisions (e.g., risk
responses) supported, how and under what conditions risk is assessed to support those risk
decisions, and how risk is monitored (e.g., to what level of detail, in what form, and with what
frequency). At Tier 2, mission/business owners apply their understanding of the organizational
risk frame to address concerns specific to the organization’s missions/business functions (e.g.,
additional assumptions, constraints, priorities, and trade-offs). At Tier 3, program managers,
information system owners, and common control providers apply their understanding of the
organizational risk frame based on how decision makers at Tiers 1 and 2 choose to manage risk.

The Risk Management Framework61 is the primary means for addressing risk at Tier 3. The RMF
addresses concerns specific to the design, development, implementation, operation, and disposal
of organizational information systems and the environments in which those systems operate. The
risk frame can be adapted at Tier 3 based on the current phase of the system development life
cycle, which further constrains potential risk responses. Initially, organizational risk frames might
not be explicit or might not be defined in terms that correspond to the risk management tiers. In
the absence of explicit risk frames (describing assumptions, constraints, risk tolerance, and
priorities/trade-offs), mission/business owners can have divergent perspectives on risk or how to
manage it. This impedes a common understanding at Tier 1 of how information security risk
contributes to organizational risk, and at Tier 2, of how risk accepted for one mission or business
function potentially affects risk with respect to other missions/business functions. Differences in
risk tolerance and the underlying assumptions, constraints, and priorities/trade-offs are grounded
in operational and/or architectural considerations and should be understood and accepted by
senior leaders/executives within their respective organizations.
