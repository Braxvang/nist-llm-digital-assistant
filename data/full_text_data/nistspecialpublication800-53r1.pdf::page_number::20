Ultimately, the responsibility for adequately mitigating risks to the organization’s operations and
assets, and to individuals, arising from the use of external information system services remains
with the authorizing official. Authorizing officials must require that an appropriate chain of trust
be established with external service providers when dealing with the many issues associated with
information system security. For services external to the organization, a chain of trust requires
that the organization establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating service
provider in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection
for the services rendered to the organization. The chain of trust can be very complicated due to
the number of entities participating in the consumer-provider relationship and the type of
relationship between the parties. External service providers may also in turn outsource the
services to other external entities, making the chain of trust even more complicated and difficult
to manage. Depending on the nature of the service, it may simply be unwise for the organization
to wholly trust the provider—not due to any inherent untrustworthiness on the provider's part, but
due to the intrinsic level of risk in the service. Where a sufficient level of trust cannot be
established in the external services and/or service providers, the organization employs
compensating controls or accepts the greater degree of risk to its operations and assets, or to
individuals.

2.5 SECURITY CONTROL ASSURANCE
Assurance is the grounds for confidence 28 that the security controls implemented within an
information system are effective in their application. Assurance can be obtained in a variety of
ways including: (i) actions taken by developers and implementers 29 of security controls in the
design, development, and implementation techniques and methods; and (ii) actions taken by
security control assessors during the testing and evaluation process to determine the extent to
which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system. Assurance
considerations related to developers and implementers of security controls are addressed in this
special publication. Assurance considerations related to assessors of security controls (including
certification agents, evaluators, auditors, inspectors general) are addressed in NIST Special
Publication 800-53A.

Appendix E describes the minimum assurance requirements for security controls listed in the low,
moderate, and high baselines. For security controls in the low baseline, the emphasis is on the
control being in place with the expectation that no obvious errors exist and that, as flaws are
discovered, they are addressed in a timely manner. For security controls in the moderate baseline,
the emphasis is on increasing grounds for confidence in control correctness. While flaws are still
likely to be uncovered (and addressed expeditiously), the control developer or control
implementer incorporates, as part of the control, specific capabilities to increase grounds for
confidence that the control meets its function or purpose. For security controls in the high
baseline, the emphasis is on requiring within the control the capabilities that are needed to support
ongoing, consistent operation of the control and to support continuous improvement in the
control’s effectiveness. There are additional assurance requirements available to developers and
28
   Confidence that the necessary security controls have been effectively implemented in organizational information
systems provides a foundation for trust between organizations that depend upon the information processed, stored, or
transmitted by those information systems.
29
  In this context, a developer/implementer is an individual or group of individuals responsible for the development or
implementation of security controls for an information system. This may include, for example, hardware and software
vendors providing the controls, contractors implementing the controls, or organizational personnel such as information
system owners, information system security officers, system and network administrators, or other individuals with
security responsibility for the information system.
