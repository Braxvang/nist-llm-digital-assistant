 Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) is an updated
version of the current Internet Protocol, IPv4. The
primary motivations for the development of IPv6
were to increase the number of unique IP addresses
and to handle the needs of new Internet applications
and devices. In addition, IPv6 was designed with the
following goals: increased ease of network management
