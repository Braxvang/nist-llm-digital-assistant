                                                                                                     network communications; determining which computers, networks, and data are part of
                                                                                                     the communications; and identifying related requirements (e.g., minimum performance
                                                                                                     criteria). This phase also involves determining how that need can best be met (e.g., IPsec,
                                                                                                     TLS, SSH) and deciding where and how the security should be implemented.
                                                                                                  2. Design the Solution. The second phase involves all facets of designing the IPsec
                                                                                                     solution. For simplicity, the design elements are grouped into five categories:
                                                                                                     architectural considerations, authentication methods, cryptography policy, performance,
                                                                                                     and packet filters.
                                                                                                  3. Implement and Test a Prototype. The next phase involves implementing and testing a
                                                                                                     prototype of the designed solution in a lab or test environment. The primary goals of
                                                                                                     testing are to evaluate the functionality, performance, scalability, and security of the
                                                                                                     solution and to identify any issues with the components, such as interoperability issues.
                                                                                                  4. Deploy the Solution. Once the testing is completed and all issues are resolved, the next
                                                                                                     phase includes the gradual deployment of IPsec throughout the enterprise.
                                                                                                  5. Manage the Solution. After the IPsec solution has been deployed, it is managed
                                                                                                     throughout its lifecycle. Management includes maintenance of the IPsec components and
                                                                                                     support for operational issues. The lifecycle process is repeated when enhancements or
                                                                                                     significant changes need to be incorporated into the solution.

                                                                                              Organizations should also implement other measures that support and complement IPsec
                                                                                              implementations. These measures help to ensure that IPsec is implemented in an environment
                                                                                              with the technical, management, and operational controls necessary to provide adequate security
                                                                                              for the IPsec implementation. Examples of supporting measures include the following:

                                                                                                  •    Establish and maintain control over all entry and exit points for the protected network,
                                                                                                       which helps to ensure its integrity.
                                                                                                  •    Ensure that all IPsec endpoints (gateways and hosts) are secured and maintained
                                                                                                       properly, which should reduce the risk of IPsec compromise or misuse.
                                                                                                  •    Revise organizational policies as needed to incorporate appropriate usage of the IPsec
                                                                                                       solution. Policies should provide the foundation for the planning and implementation of
