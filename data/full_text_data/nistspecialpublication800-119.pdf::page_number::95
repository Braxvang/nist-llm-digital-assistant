                                                               GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


    4.7.1   Specification Overview

DHCPv6 is defined in RFC 3315, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6. It is a quite
sophisticated protocol with many message types, options, status codes, and timers. It performs three
services:

    Address configuration: allocating addresses and providing a network prefix and address of the default
     router

    Providing other configuration information: primarily, a DNS server’s address, but potentially many
     other types of information

    Allocating prefixes to routers.
In addition to RFC 3315, many other standards supplement or modify DHCPv6:

    RFC 3319, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv6) Options for Session Initiation Protocol
     (SIP) Servers, defines an option for DHCPv6 clients to obtain a list of domain names or addresses for
     SIP servers.

    RFC 3633, IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) version 6,
     describes using DHCPv6 between routers for delegation of address prefixes, which is not discussed
     further this document.

    RFC 3646, DNS Configuration Options, defines options for configuring a list of DNS name servers
     and domain search lists.

    RFC 3736, Stateless Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Service for IPv6, defines the
     subset of RFC 3315 that needs to be implemented for stateless DHCPv6.

    RFC 3898, Network Information Service (NIS) Configuration Options, defines four options for
     configuring NIS services.

    RFC 4014, Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) Attributes Suboption for the
     Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Relay Agent Information Option, specifies an option
     for a DHCPv6 relay agent to pass information obtained during authentication of the client to the
     DHCP server.

    RFC 4075, Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Configuration Option for DHCPv6, defines an
     option for obtaining a list of SNTP servers’ addresses.

    RFC 4361, Node-specific Client Identifiers for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Version Four
     (DHCPv4), updates DHCPv4 to be compatible with naming and DNS updates used in DHCPv6, so
     that systems running both IPv4 and IPv6 can work with both versions of DHCP separately but
     compatibly.
Three primary configuration options are available for IPv6 interfaces:

     1. Use autoconfiguration and not DHCPv6.
     2. Use DHCPv6 and not autoconfiguration.
     3. Get an address with autoconfiguration and then use DHCPv6 to retrieve additional information.
