3.2 Security and Compliance Issues
3.2.1 Cryptographic Algorithms
Table 3-2 below gives cryptographic algorithm recommendations for use within IPsec.
The algorithms that are specified for IKE are used to protect IKEâ€™s own traffic. The
algorithms used in ESP and AH are used to provide IPsec protection to data traffic; for
these algorithms to be used within ESP or AH, IKE must be capable of negotiating their
use.

In Table 3-2 below, column four lists the IETF conformance requirements as specified in
the RFCs by using the three IETF requirement levels: MUST, SHOULD and MAY to
indicate whether the algorithm needs to be implemented. See [RFC 2119] for definitions
of these requirement levels and further information on IETF Conformance language.
Column five, however, states federal conformance requirements using two levels:
Mandatory and Optional. Mandatory means that the feature is required to be available in
an implementation, and Optional means that implementation of the technique is
permitted.
