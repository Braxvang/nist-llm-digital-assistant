5.3     Develop the Functional Exercise Material

Once the event is designed, the exercise director should assign roles and responsibilities to the team to
develop the functional exercise material. Functional exercises typically include the following
documentation:

       Briefings. Briefings and/or briefing books are usually created for participants and the exercise
        staff; briefings may be conducted in person or through read-ahead packages. Depending on the
        nature of the exercise, a single briefing might be presented approximately one week before the
        exercise, or multiple briefings might be presented in the weeks and months before the exercise,
        with the final briefing typically occurring a week or more before the exercise. The briefings
        document any information pertaining to the scope and objectives of the exercise, rules of
        engagement, and administrative aspects of the event. In addition, briefings are conducted to
        provide the exercise staff with information pertaining to management aspects of the event, the
        level of activities that are simulated, and the level of activities that are directed by player action.
       Scenario. The scenario is designed to add realism to the exercise by providing participants with
        situations that will inspire responses that help participants achieve exercise objectives. The
        scenario chosen should be crafted to adequately address the broad topic areas and specific
        objectives selected in the design phase. In addition, exercise developers should ensure the
        scenario does not stray outside the scope of the exercise. Exercise scenarios may be crafted to
        explore worst-case situations; however, it is often useful to develop scenarios that cause
        participants to respond to topical issues they are apt to encounter in the real world. For example,
        an exercise of an IT contingency plan for an organization that is prone to disruptions from natural
        disasters may consider a scenario involving a significant power outage caused by a hurricane. A
        narrative scenario is documented and typically distributed to participants via handouts or an oral
        presentation on the day of the exercise.
       Master Scenario Events List (MSEL). The MSEL is a chronologically sequenced outline of the
        simulated events and key event descriptions that participants will be asked to respond to during
        the course of exercise play. It also contains a list of expected actions resulting from the events
        and objectives that should be met based on the events. The MSEL regulates simulated events by
        coordinating the actions of participants and defining the schedule of events. The MSEL should
        be planned carefully to ensure that key events lead to the achievement of exercise objectives and
        that all participants remain active throughout the duration of the event. The MSEL is for exercise
        development and management purposes only.
       Message Injects. A message inject, also known as an implementer or an event inject, is a pre-
        scripted message that will be provided to participants during the course of an exercise. An
        example of a message inject is “The vehicle transporting the backup tapes to the restoration site is
        in a traffic jam, and is expected to arrive 3 hours later than originally scheduled.” Message
        injects can be provided in many forms, including e-mails, letters, memoranda, telephone calls,
        and radio call scripts. Each message inject contains information designed to supplement the
        scenario and prompt additional actions. They expand on the outline of key events portrayed in
        the MSEL; therefore, each MSEL entry may have multiple injects associated with it. The intent
        of each inject is in concert with the storyline of the overall scenario and MSEL, and prompts a
        player to take an action that will ultimately lead to achievement of an exercise objective(s). Each
        inject includes the time at which the message will be injected, to whom it will go, from whom the
        message will come, the means by which it will be delivered (e.g., fax, phone, e-mail), and the
        actual text of the message. The number of injects selected should be designed to keep
        participants adequately occupied but should not be so many that participants will become
