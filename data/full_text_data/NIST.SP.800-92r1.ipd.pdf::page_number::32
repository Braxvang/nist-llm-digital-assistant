830   Appendix A. Glossary
831   active storage
832   Data that is stored in a manner that facilitates frequent use and ease of access. ([OMB21-31], adapted)

833   cold data storage
834   Data that is stored in a manner that minimizes costs while still allowing some level of access and use. ([OMB21-31],
835   adapted)
836            Note: The original NIST SP 800-92 [SP800-92] used the term “log archival” instead of “cold data storage.”

837   event aggregation
838   The consolidation of similar log entries into a single entry containing a count of the number of occurrences of the
839   event. [SP800-92]

840   event correlation
841   Finding relationships between two or more log entries. [SP800-92]

842   event forwarding
843   Obtaining events from logging sources in near real-time on an automated basis, and storing them centrally.
844   ([OMB21-31], adapted)

845   log
846   A record of events occurring within an organization’s computing assets, including physical and virtual platforms,
847   networks, services, and cloud environments. ([SP800-92], adapted)

848   log access
849   Reading log entries.

850   log analysis
851   Studying log entries to identify events of interest or suppress log entries for insignificant events. [SP800-92]

852   log clearing
853   Removing all entries from a log that precede a certain date and time. [SP800-92]

854   log destruction
855   Deleting a log or a log’s entries in such a way that the deleted log data cannot be recovered.

856   log entry
857   An individual record within a log of an event that has occurred within a system or network. ([EO14028], adapted)

858   log generation
859   Creating new log entries.

860   log management
861   The process for generating, transmitting, storing, accessing, and disposing of log data. ([SP800-92], adapted)

862   log management infrastructure
863   The hardware, software, networks, and media used to generate, transmit, store, analyze, and dispose of log data.
864   [SP800-92]

865   log normalization
866   Converting each log data field to a particular data representation and categorizing it consistently. [SP800-92]

867   log preservation
868   Keeping logs that normally would be discarded because they contain records of activity of particular interest.
869   [SP800-92]

870   log reduction
871   Removing unneeded entries from a log to create a new log that is smaller. [SP800-92]
