only write files to an encrypted container or volume, then the user does not need to take steps to ensure
that files are saved to the appropriate location. However, if the OS is not configured this way, permitting
users to save files to various locations, or if the encrypted device is removable media that is not protected
through OS access control features, then users will be responsible for ensuring that they save files in the
appropriate location. In this case, if users fail to follow the necessary procedures, then some files that
should be protected may not be.

3.1.3    File/Folder Encryption

File encryption is the process of encrypting individual files on a storage medium and permitting access to
the encrypted data only after proper authentication is provided. Folder encryption is very similar to file
encryption, only it addresses individual folders instead of files. Some OSs offer built-in file and/or folder
encryption capabilities, 24 and many third-party programs are also available. Although folder encryption
and virtual disk encryption sound similar—both a folder and a container are intended to contain and
protect multiple files—there is a difference. A container is a single opaque file, meaning that no one can
see what files or folders are inside the container until the container is decrypted. File/folder encryption is
transparent, meaning that anyone with access to the filesystem can view the names and possibly other
metadata for the encrypted files and folders, including files and folders within encrypted folders, if they
are not protected through OS access control features. File/folder encryption is used on all types of storage
for end user devices.

File/folder encryption can be implemented in many ways, including through drivers, services, and
applications. When a user attempts to open an encrypted file (either encrypted by itself or located in an
encrypted folder), the software requires the user to first authenticate successfully. Once that has been
done, the software will automatically decrypt the chosen file. Because it decrypts a single file at a time,
the performance impact of file/folder encryption should be minimal. File/folder encryption is most
commonly used on user data files, such as word processing documents and spreadsheets. File/folder
encryption solutions can sometimes encrypt swap files, but typically not OS executables and hibernation
files.

Many file/folder encryption products offer several options for selecting which files and folders should be
encrypted and defining the user’s role in using the solution—manually enabling encryption for each new
file or folder that needs protection, remembering to store files and folders in the proper locations, or doing
nothing differently because the files and folders are encrypted automatically. Common options include:

 Relying on the user to specifically designate the files and folders

 Automatically encrypting the contents of administrator-designated folders

 Automatically encrypting certain types of files, such as those with a particular file extension

 Automatically encrypting all files written to by particular applications

 Automatically encrypting all data files for particular users.

There are also various applications, such as file compression utilities and office productivity suites, that
offer limited file/folder encryption capabilities. Such applications are usually completely dependent on
the user to ensure that the necessary files are encrypted, and these applications are often not centrally
managed, which can complicate key management and other aspects of managing the use of the
24
     For example, New Technology File System (NTFS) supports file and folder encryption using the Encrypting File System
     (EFS).
