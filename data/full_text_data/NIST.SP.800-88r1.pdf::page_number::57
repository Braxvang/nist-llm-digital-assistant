Appendix D—Cryptographic Erase Device Guidelines

The determination of whether to use Cryptographic Erase on a given device depends on an
organization’s sanitization requirements. It also depends on the end user’s ability to determine
whether the implementation offers sufficient assurance against future recovery of the data. The
level of assurance depends in large part on the factors described in Table D-1.

          Wrapping                 Encryption Key (MEK), but instead a key used             SP 800-38A
                                   to wrap (that is, encrypt) the MEK or another            SP 800-38F
                                   key. In this case, the security strength and level       SP 800-131A
                                   of assurance of the wrapping techniques used
                                   should be commensurate with the level of
                                   strength of the CE operation.



Before relying on Cryptographic Erase for media sanitization, users should identify the
mechanisms implemented by the storage device to address these areas:

   1. Make/Model/Version/Media Type: The product and versions the statement applies to,
      and the type of media the device uses (ie. magnetic, SSD, hybrid, other).

        Many devices store the Target Data in several different media - e.g. a DRAM (Dynamic
        Random Access Memory) cache in addition to rotating platters. It is important to identify
        the storage locations and how each is sanitized.
