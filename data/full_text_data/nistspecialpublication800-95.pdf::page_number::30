                                                                                             GUIDE TO SECURE WEB SERVICES



By offloading some of the processing to these core services, the implementation of the loan, rate and
credit services is simplified when compared to a single Web service with similar functionality. This
further improves security by lowering the number of possible defects that could exist in the individual
services, but it introduces a slight performance penalty associated with the communication with the core
services. Core services may also introduce a single point of failure in the SOA.

2.6     Threats Facing Web Services

Security decisions must always be made with an understanding of the threats facing the system to be
secured. While there are a wealth of security standards and technologies available for securing Web
services, they may not be adequate or necessary for a particular organization or an individual service. For
that reason, it is important to understand the threats that face Web services so that organizations can
determine which threats their Web services must be secured against. According to WS-I, the top threats
facing Web services are: 18

 Message alteration. An attacker inserts, removes or modifies information within a message to
  deceive the receiver
 Loss of confidentiality. Information within a message is disclosed to an unauthorized individual
 Falsified messages. Fictitious messages that an attacker intends the receiver to believe are sent from
  a valid sender
 Man in the middle. A third party sits between the sender and provider and forwards messages such
  that the two participants are unaware, allowing the attacker to view and modify all messages
 Principal spoofing. An attacker constructs and sends a message with credentials such that it appears
  to be from a different, authorized principal
 Forged claims. An attacker constructs a message with false credentials that appear valid to the
  receiver
 Replay of message. An attacker resends a previously sent message
 Replay of message parts. An attacker includes portions of one or more previously sent messages in
  a new message
 Denial of service. An attacker causes the system to expend resources disproportionately such that
  valid requests cannot be met.
The importance of these threats may vary depending on an organizationâ€™s needs and purpose. In some
instances, messages need not be kept confidential, so loss of confidentiality is not a concern. Similarly,
organizations may offer a Web service to the public. For example, a Web service that provides
information about the current weather forecast need not be concerned if a request is from a falsified
sender. Regardless, it is important to understand these threats and what technologies are available to
mitigate them.

The following Web services and HTTP standards can protect against many of these threats:

 W3C XML Encryption. Used by WS-Security to encrypt messages and provide confidentiality of
  part or all of a SOAP message
