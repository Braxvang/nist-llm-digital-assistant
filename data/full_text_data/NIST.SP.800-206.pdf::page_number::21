     IMPERATIVE 4
     Advancing Cybersecurity Research and Applications Development

     Beyond cryptography-related priorities, NIST’s cybersecurity research and applications
     development activities include identifying emerging and high-priority technologies,
     developing security solutions that will have a high impact on the U.S. critical information
     infrastructure, and developing and showing how to manage foundational building-block
     security mechanisms and techniques that can be integrated into organizations’ mission-
     critical information systems. Accomplishments included:
          •    Cloud Computing Security and Forensics. During FY18, NIST continued to develop
               publications, promote national and international standards and specifications,
               and demonstrate how to meet those standards and specifications to support the
               effective and secure use of cloud computing.21 NIST collaborated with industry22
               to implement the Cloud Security Architecture Tool (CSAT),23 leveraging the
               NIST Cybersecurity Framework to architect a cloud-based information system
               and identify necessary security controls. Aiding transition to practice, NIST
               collaborated with industry to initiate a cloud security project to show one way
               to increase security and privacy for cloud workloads on hybrid cloud platforms.
               Based on public comments, NIST also updated a guide that shows how to reduce
               opportunities for bad actors to attack enterprises via the cellular and WiFi
               connections on mobile devices; final publication is planned for FY19.24 In addition,
               the Cloud Forensic Science Working Group continued to define a cloud forensics
               reference architecture. Continuation of a trusted cloud capability demonstration,
               CSAT, and forensics activities are planned for FY19.
          •    Low Power Wide Area Networks. Diverse applications of Internet of Things
               and Cyber-physical Systems (IoT/CPS) require various network technologies
               be optimized for specific use cases. A low-power wide-area network (LPWAN)
               is a set of telecommunication specifications and protocols that satisfy both
               low power consumption (i.e., network of inexpensive sensors) and wide area
               coverage (i.e., smart city deployments). In order to build an understanding
               of the security and trust issues of LPWAN-based telecommunications, NIST
               prototyped two use cases for LPWAN-based sensor networks in FY18. The use
               case prototypes included a remote access adapter for a NIST climate monitoring
               station and a real-time tracking system for the NIST Campus Shuttle that was
