NIST SP 800-166                                                                      DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                                     DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

2.3.3 PKI Conformance

The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) conformance tests ensure that the mandatory Derived PIV
Authentication certificate, the optional digital signature certificate, key management certificates,
and the Derived PIV Credential Issuer’s (content signing) certificate, conform to the certificate
profiles as specified in the X.509 Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Extensions
Profile for the Shared Service Providers (SSP) Program [PROF]. Additionally, the Derived PIV
Application is also tested to check if asymmetric keys are pairs (public and private components)
and are using the appropriate cryptographic algorithms in accordance with NIST SP 800-78,
Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for Personal Identity Verification [SP800-78].

2.4       Test Setup

The test setup for the application and data model tests for the Derived PIV Application consists
of the following components:

      +    Test toolkit application software that resides on a personal computer (PC) with a
           Universal Serial Bus (USB) port;

      +    Readers and appropriate drivers:

              o For implementations on an SD, MiniSD or microSD token 5–

                          A Secure Digital (SD) Memory Card Reader

                          A Memory Card Reader Adapter (for Mini, and Micro SD Cards)

              o For implementation on an UICC token–

                          A PC/SC compliant UICC/SIM Card Reader

              o For implementations on micro USB–

                          A Universal Micro USB to USB Cable;

      +    The implementation under test (IUT), which could be either:

              •   A Derived PIV Application, or

              •   The data object stored on a Derived PIV Application token. 6



5
  [SP800-157] does not specify a transport layer protocol for SD, miniSD or microSD tokens. Since all
implementations have to be tested from a common test toolkit application, vendors may be asked to provide a
wrapper driver/middleware that utilizes a standard interface such as PC/SC to ensure that all tests can be performed
without any modification or custom code development by the testing entities.
6
  Individual credentials (e.g., Derived PIV Authentication certificate, digital signature certificate, key management
certificate) and associated private keys on embedded tokens may also be tested for conformity using functional
testing. Refer to Appendix A for details.
