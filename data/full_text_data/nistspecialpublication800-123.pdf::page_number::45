                                                                             GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



      –    Reconfigure network security elements (e.g., firewall, router, IDPS) to provide additional
           protection and notification.

 Test the server to ensure security.

 Reconnect the server to the network.

 Monitor the server and network for signs that the attacker is attempting to access the server or
  network again.

 Document lessons learned.

Based on the organization’s policy and procedures, system administrators should decide whether to
reinstall the OS of a compromised server or restore it from a backup. Factors that are often considered
include the following:

 Level of access that the attacker gained (e.g., root, user, guest, system)

 Type of attacker (internal or external)

 Purpose of compromise (e.g., Web page defacement, illegal software repository, platform for other
  attacks, data exfiltration)

 Method used for the server compromise

 Actions of the attacker during and after the compromise (e.g., log files, intrusion detection reports)

 Duration of the compromise

 Extent of the compromise on the network (e.g., the number of hosts compromised)

 Results of consultation with management and legal counsel.

The lower the level of access gained by the intruder and the more the server administrator understands
about the attacker’s actions, the less risk there is in restoring from a backup and patching the
vulnerability. For incidents in which there is less known about the attacker’s actions and/or in which the
attacker gains high-level access, it is recommended that the OS, server software, and other applications be
reinstalled from the manufacturer’s original distribution media and that the server data be restored only
from a known good backup.

If legal action is pursued, server administrators need to be aware of the guidelines for handling a host
after a compromise. Consult legal counsel and relevant law enforcement authorities as appropriate.

6.4       Security Testing Servers

Periodic security testing of servers is critical. Without periodic testing, there is no assurance that current
protective measures are working or that the security patch applied by the server administrator is
functioning as advertised. Although a variety of security testing techniques exists, vulnerability scanning
is the most common. Vulnerability scanning assists a server administrator in identifying vulnerabilities
and verifying whether the existing security measures are effective. Penetration testing is also used, but it
