      NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1
      September 2023                                 PIV Card Application Namespace, Data Model, and Representation

722   3.4.2. Cardholder UUID
723   As defined in Section 3.1.2, the CHUID MAY optionally include a Cardholder UUID. When
724   present, the Cardholder UUID SHALL be a 16-byte binary representation of a valid UUID, and
725   it SHALL be version 1, 4, or 5, as specified in [RFC4122, Section 4.1.3].

726              Data Object Containers and Associated Access Rules and Interface Modes
727   Table 2 defines a high-level view of the data model. Each on-card storage container is labeled as
728   mandatory (M), optional (O), or conditional (C). The conditional data objects are the digital
729   signature key and the key management key, which are mandatory if the cardholder has a
730   government-issued email account at the time of credential issuance. This data model is designed
731   to enable and support dual interface cards. For dual chip implementations for any container that
732   can be accessed over both the contact interface and the contactless interface (including the virtual
733   contact interface), the data object SHALL be copied into the corresponding containers on both
734   chips. 8

        As a consequence of this requirement, any keys that have to be generated on card CANNOT be made available over the contactless interface
      (including the virtual contact interface) in a dual chip implementation. In addition, the asymmetric CAK needs to be generated off-card and
      loaded onto both chips for dual chip implementations.

        The term “virtual contact interface (VCI)” is used in this document as shorthand for the following security condition: (command is submitted
      over secure messaging) AND (the Discovery Object is present) AND (Bit 4 of the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy is one) AND ((the security
      status indicator associated with the pairing code is TRUE) OR (Bit 3 of the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy is one)).
