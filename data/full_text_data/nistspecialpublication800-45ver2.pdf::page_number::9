Executive Summary

Electronic mail (email) is perhaps the most popularly used system for exchanging business information
over the Internet (or any other computer network). At the most basic level, the email process can be
divided into two principal components: (1) mail servers, which are hosts that deliver, forward, and store
email; and (2) mail clients, which interface with users and allow users to read, compose, send, and store
email. This document addresses the security issues of mail servers and mail clients, including Web-based
access to mail.

Mail servers and user workstations running mail clients are frequently targeted by attackers. Because the
computing and networking technologies that underlie email are ubiquitous and well-understood by many,
attackers are able to develop attack methods to exploit security weaknesses. Mail servers are also
targeted because they (and public Web servers) must communicate to some degree with untrusted third
parties. Additionally, mail clients have been targeted as an effective means of inserting malware into
machines and of propagating this code to other machines. As a result, mail servers, mail clients, and the
network infrastructure that supports them must be protected. Examples of email security issues include
the following:

 To exchange email with the outside world, a requirement for most organizations, it is allowed through
  organizations’ network perimeter defenses. At a basic level, viruses and other types of malware may
  be distributed throughout an organization via email. Increasingly, however, attackers are getting
  more sophisticated and using email to deliver targeted zero-day attacks in an attempt to compromise
  users’ workstations within the organization’s internal network.
 Given email’s nature of human to human communication, it can be used as a social engineering
  vehicle. Email can allow an attacker to exploit an organization’s users to gather information or get
  the users to perform actions that further an attack.
 Flaws in the mail server application may be used as the means of compromising the underlying server
  and hence the attached network. Examples of this unauthorized access include gaining access to files
  or folders that were not meant to be publicly accessible, and being able to execute commands and/or
  install software on the mail server.
 Denial of service (DoS) attacks may be directed to the mail server or its support network
  infrastructure, denying or hindering valid users from using the mail server.
 Sensitive information on the mail server may be read by unauthorized individuals or changed in an
  unauthorized manner.
 Sensitive information transmitted unencrypted between mail server and client may be intercepted.
  All popular email communication standards default to sending usernames, passwords, and email
  messages unencrypted.
 Information within email messages may be altered at some point between the sender and recipient.
 Malicious entities may gain unauthorized access to resources elsewhere in the organization’s network
  via a successful attack on the mail server. For example, once the mail server is compromised, an
  attacker could retrieve users’ passwords, which may grant the attacker access to other hosts on the
  organization’s network.
 Malicious entities may attack external organizations from a successful attack on a mail server host.
