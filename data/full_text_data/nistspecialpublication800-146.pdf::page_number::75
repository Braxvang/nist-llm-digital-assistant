Appendix C—Glossary

Selected terms used in the publication are defined below.

Authentication: Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a prerequisite to allowing
access to resources in an information system.

Certificate: A digital representation of information which at least: (1) identifies the certification authority
issuing it, (2) names or identifies its consumer, (3) contains the consumer's public key, (4) identifies its
operational period, and (5) is digitally signed by the certification authority issuing it.

Compliance: Conformity in fulfilling official requirements.

IaaS: Defined in the NIST Cloud Computing Definition, excerpted in Section 2.

PaaS: Defined in the NIST Cloud Computing Definition, excerpted in Section 2.

Public key cryptography: An encryption method that uses a two-part key: a public key and a private key.
Users generally distribute their public key, but keep their private key to themselves. This is also known as
“Asymmetric Cryptography.”

SaaS: Defined in the NIST Cloud Computing Definition, excerpted in Section 2.

Service agreement: A legal document specifying the rules of the legal contract between the cloud user and
the cloud provider.

Service-level agreement: A document stating the technical performance promises made by the cloud
provider, how disputes are to be discovered and handled, and any remedies for performance failures.

Virtual machine (VM): "an efficient, isolated duplicate of a real machine" [Pop74].

Virtualization: "The simulation of the software and/or hardware upon which other software runs" [NIST
SP 800-125].
