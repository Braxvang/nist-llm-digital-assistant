                                                                GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


        Additional restrictions may be applied to using the tunnel. For example, the tunnel endpoints
         may accept encapsulated packets only from a list of approved senders.
        Tunnel endpoints handling multiple configured tunnels must treat each one as a separate
         interface. Treating each tunnel endpoint as a separate interface prevents violating scoping
         rules and isolates neighbor discovery traffic.
        If the encapsulated packet uses IPsec for integrity or confidentiality, little is gained by
         applying IPsec again for the same services through the tunnel, but if IPsec along the tunnel is
         desired, then the methods in RFC 4891 may be used.

  6.5.3   Automatic Tunneling

Due to the administrative overhead of maintaining configured tunnels, and because configured tunnels do
not cover all transition scenarios, the IETF defined additional automatic tunneling mechanisms. As
transition problems were encountered, the IETF created additional transition mechanisms to solve them.

The general automatic tunneling model consists of isolated hosts with limited communications needing
dynamic tunneling capabilities. With automatic tunnels, one tunnel endpoint can find the other end
without pre-configuration. One way for IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels to accomplish this is by embedding IPv4
addresses in IPv6 addresses. This may be a good method for jump-starting a transition to IPv6, but it is
not recommended as a long-term solution. Besides the overhead involved with establishing the tunnels,
this approach limits the use of new IPv6 capabilities, does not solve the IPv4 address space problem, and
imports the IPv4 routing table into IPv6. Automatic tunneling is more likely needed in the earlier stages
of IPv6 transition.

Deployment and security considerations for the following automatic tunneling mechanisms are discussed
in subsequent sections:

        6over4 - host to router or router to host
        6to4 and 6rd - router to router
        ISATAP - intra-site tunnels
        Teredo - UDP encapsulation intended for tunneling through IPv4 NATs
        Tunnel brokers - using a server for automatic tunneling
        DSTM (Dual Stack Transition Mechanism)
        Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) and Dual-Stack Lite
  6.5.4   6over4 Protocol

The 6over4 protocol (RFC 2529) is a relatively old and simple transition mechanism that relies on IPv4
multicast as a virtual link layer. Also known as IPv4 multicast tunneling or virtual Ethernet, it is a host-
to-host, host-to-router, and router-to-host automatic tunneling technology supplying unicast and multicast
IPv6 connectivity between IPv6 nodes within an IPv4 site. It is not intended for connecting an isolated
IPv6 user to the rest of the IPv6 Internet. Because of its dependence on IPv4 multicast, it has not been
widely implemented or deployed.
