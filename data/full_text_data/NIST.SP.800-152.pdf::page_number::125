SP 800-152                                                A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


11.1.3 Functional and Security Testing
Functional and security testing of an FCKMS should be performed prior to initial
deployment, during subsequent periodic security reviews, and during incremental
security assessments. Functional and security tests could be performed by the CKMS
developer, CKMS implementer, the FCKMS service provider, or a trusted third-party.
These tests could also be performed, or the results reviewed, by an FCKMS-using
organization.

Functional testing should include usability tests for users whose knowledge and
experience with an FCKMS range from novice to expert. An FCKMS is considered to be
“user-friendly” when it can be easily used by novice users, or when the services are
automatically provided and controlled by an FCKMS that is “transparent” to the user.

FR:11.7 The CKMS design shall specify all required functional and security testing of
the CKMS.

FR:11.8 The CKMS design shall report the results of all functional and security tests
performed to date.

             SA-11         A Federal CKMS shall undergo functional and security
PR:11.6
                           testing, including ease-of-use tests before initial operation.


                           A Federal CKMS could automatically test the security and
PF:11.1
                           functionality of all of its services that are intended to support
                           and interact with other security domains and report the results
                           to all participating security domain administrators.

11.1.4 Penetration Testing
Penetration tests are used to determine the extent to which a system resists active
attempts to compromise its security. This type of testing requires security experts who are
knowledgeable about typical system weaknesses and attacks against them, and who can
create new or unsuspected attack methods. The penetration-testing team for an FCKMS
should include some individuals who are not part of the CKMS design or implementation
team and who do not have preconceived notions about its security.

FR:11.9 The CKMS design shall specify the results of any completed penetration testing
performed to date.

                CA-8       Penetration testing shall be performed on High impact-level
PR:11.7
                           Federal CKMSs.
              CA-8 (+1)    When penetration testing is to be performed on a Federal
PR:11.8
              SA-11 (5)    CKMS, the penetration testing team shall include individuals
                           who did not assist in the CKMS design or implementation.
