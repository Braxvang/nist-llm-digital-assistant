1.    Introduction

1.1   Authority
This document has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-
347.
NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for providing adequate
information security for all agency operations and assets, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to
national security systems. This recommendation is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as analyzed in A-130,
Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.
This recommendation, prepared for use by federal agencies, may be used by non-governmental organizations on a
voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright. Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and
guidelines made mandatory and binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority.
Nor should this recommendation be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of
Commerce, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, or any other Federal official.

1.2   Purpose and scope
FIPS 201 [FIPS], Personal Identity Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors, defines procedures for the
PIV lifecycle activities including identity proofing, registration, PIV Card issuance and re-issuance, chain-of-trust
operations, and PIV Card usage. [FIPS] also defines an identity credential that includes biometric data. Requirements
on interfaces are described in [800-73, parts 1-3]. Those on cryptographic protection of the biometric data are
described in [FIPS] and in [800-78].
This document contains technical specifications for biometric data mandated or allowed in [FIPS]. These
specifications reflect the design goals of interoperability, performance and security of the PIV Card and PIV processes.
This specification addresses iris, face and fingerprint image acquisition to variously support background checks,
fingerprint template creation, retention, and authentication. These goals are addressed by normatively citing and
mandating conformance to biometric standards and by enumerating requirements where the standards include
options and branches. In such cases, a biometric profile can be used to declare what content is required and what is
optional. This document goes further by constraining implementers' interpretation of the standards. Such
restrictions are designed to ease implementation, assure conformity, facilitate interoperability, and ensure
performance, in a manner tailored for PIV applications.
The biometric data specifications herein are mandatory for biometric data carried in the PIV Data Model (Appendix A
of [800-73, Part 1]). Biometric data used outside the PIV Data Model is not within the scope of this standard.
This document does however specify that most biometric data in the PIV Data Model shall be embedded in the
Common Biometric Exchange Formats Framework [CBEFF] structure of Section 9. This supports record integrity
(using digital signatures) and multimodal encapsulation.
This document provides an overview of the strategy that can be used for testing conformance to the standard. It is
not meant to be a comprehensive set of test requirements that can be used for certification or demonstration of
compliance to the specifications in this document. NIST Special Publications 800-85A and 800-85-B [800-85]
implements those objectives.

1.3   Audience and assumptions
This document is targeted at Federal agencies and implementers of PIV systems. In addition, it should be of interest
to the biometric access control industry. Readers are assumed to have a working knowledge of biometric standards
and applications.
