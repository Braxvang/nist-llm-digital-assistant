    FOCUS AREA 2



    initial alignment with the constructs in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, the integration
    of privacy risk management processes, an alignment with system life-cycle security
    engineering processes, and the incorporation of supply chain risk management processes.
    This is the first NIST publication to include a full integration of privacy risk management
    into the existing information security risk management processes. The addition of a new
    Prepare step is one of the key changes to the RMF and was incorporated to achieve
    more effective, efficient, and cost-effective security and privacy risk management
    processes. The new step works in harmony with the Framework for Improving Critical
    Infrastructure Cybersecurity (commonly referred to as the NIST Cybersecurity
    Framework) and the NIST Privacy Framework [3] [4]. The use of these models together
    institutionalizes organization-level and system-level preparation by:
      •   Facilitating communication across the organizational risk management levels;
      •   Encouraging the organization-wide identification of common controls and the
          development of organizationally tailored control baselines;
      •   Reducing the complexity of the IT infrastructure; and
      •   Providing additional methods to identify, prioritize, and focus resources on high-
          value assets commensurate with risk.
    NIST has also continued to support public and private-sector outreach and products for
    the risk management community. For example, NIST hosted a well-attended webcast
    about the RMF updates and developed an online reference site for multiple electronic
    formats of the security and privacy controls from NIST SP 800-53, Security and Privacy
    Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations [5].

    Advancement of Privacy Engineering and Risk Management
    NIST made significant advances in guidance and models for managing privacy risks in
    FY 2019. These privacy risks can have direct adverse consequences at both the individual
    and societal levels, with follow-on effects on organizations’ brands, bottom lines, and
    future growth prospects. NIST is dedicated to supporting innovation that provides the
    benefits of information processing while simultaneously applying methods that help
    protect the privacy of individuals.
    While managing cybersecurity risk contributes to managing privacy risk, it is
    not sufficient. Cybersecurity and privacy have both unique and overlapping risk
    management needs, as illustrated by Figure 1: Cybersecurity and Privacy Risk. Having
    a general understanding of the different origins of cybersecurity and privacy risks is
    important for determining the most effective solutions to address the risks.
