CHAPTER 14                                                               Configuration Management


process should contain procedures and techniques to change a system without
detrimentally impacting it, change any interconnected systems, or change the
network while accounting for the established security level of the network.
    Through Phase 3, Implementation/Assessment, security controls that are
selected in Phase 2 are being tested. Also, the security certification and accreditation
process takes place. NIST SP 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and
Accreditation of Federal Information Systems, defines security accreditation as “the
official management decision given by a senior agency official to authorize operation
of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk to agency operations,
agency assets, or individuals based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of
security controls.” Within the security certification and accreditation process are four
phases (Initiation, Security Certification, Security Accreditation, and Continuous
Monitoring). The fourth phase, Continuous Monitoring, primarily deals with CM. “With
regard to configuration management and control, it is important to document the
proposed or actual changes to the information system and to subsequently
determine the impact of those proposed or actual changes on the security of the
system. …. Documenting information system changes and assessing the potential
impact those changes may have on the security of the system is an essential aspect
of continuous monitoring and maintaining the security accreditation.” 87
   Lastly, in Phase 4, Operations/Maintenance, CM change control and auditing
steps take place. If there was a significant change addressed in the CM process,
then the system must be recertified and reaccredited. Constant monitoring of the
system is performed to identify possible risks to the system so these can be
addressed through the risk management, security certification and accreditation, and
CM processes.

14.2 Configuration Management Roles and Responsibilities
    There are many roles associated with implementing an effective CM process.
Note that an individual is not limited to a single role (e.g., an individual can be both
the system owner and the CM manager). An organization must ensure that
management is aware of proposed changes and verify that a thorough review and
approval process is in place. Also, separation of duties must be addressed to ensure
that changes are being implemented only after being tested and approved. An
example of the roles and responsibilities for a sample CM process are listed below: 88
       • Chief information officer (CIO). The CIO is responsible for setting forth
         policies concerning CM and implementing CM at the highest level for the
         organization.
       • System owner. The system owner serves as the authority for all matters of
         CM for the system. The system owner is responsible for developing functional
         requirements and verifying that the requirements are implemented
         appropriately.
       • Information systems security officer (ISSO). The ISSO is primarily
         responsible for addressing security concerns related to the CM program and for
         providing expertise and decision support to the Configuration Control Review
         Board (CCRB).
