2297             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
2298             Determine if:
2299             A.03.12.02.a.01: a plan of action and milestones for the system is developed to document the
2300             planned remediation actions for correcting weaknesses or deficiencies noted during security
2301             assessments.
2302             A.03.12.02.a.02: a plan of action and milestones for the system is developed to reduce or
2303             eliminate known system vulnerabilities.
2304             A.03.12.02.b[01]: the existing plan of action and milestones is updated periodically based on
2305             the findings from security assessments.
2306             A.03.12.02.b[02]: the existing plan of action and milestones is updated periodically based on
2307             the findings from independent audits or reviews.
2308             A.03.12.02.b[03]: the existing plan of action and milestones is updated periodically based on
2309             the findings from continuous monitoring activities.
