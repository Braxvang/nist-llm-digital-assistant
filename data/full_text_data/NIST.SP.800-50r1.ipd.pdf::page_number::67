2047   Appendix A. Examples of Cybersecurity and Privacy Learning Program Maturity Levels
2048   The following example is adapted from the FY21 Inspector General FISMA Metrics for Security Training [12] and provides one
2049   method for assessing the maturity of a Learning Program. Similar to other business or quality maturity models, this example can help
2050   measure progress and set strategic goals for optimizing the Learning Program. A fully “mature” program is an integrated operational
2051   element of the system and processes and is continually monitored and improved.
