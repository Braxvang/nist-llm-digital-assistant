consequences of unauthorized modification to or destruction of facilities, fleet, and equipment
management information may depend on the urgency with which the information is needed or
the immediacy with which the information is used. In most cases, it is unlikely that the
information will be time-critical or acted upon immediately.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Exceptions may include emergency
response aspects of disaster management or leadership protection. In such cases, the integrity
impact level associated with unauthorized modification or destruction of facilities, fleet, and
equipment management information can be high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
facilities, fleet, and equipment management information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the facilities, fleet, and equipment
management information. Functions supported by most facilities, fleet, and equipment
management information are tolerant of delays. Typically, disruption of access to facilities, fleet,
and equipment management information has a limited adverse effect on agency operations
(including mission functions and public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Exceptions may include emergency
response aspects of disaster management or leadership protection. In such cases, delays
measured in seconds can cost lives and major property damage. Consequently, the availability
impact level associated with unauthorized modification or destruction of facilities, fleet, and
equipment management information needed to respond to emergencies will be high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
facilities, fleet, and equipment management information is low.
C.3.1.2 Help Desk Services Information Type

Help Desk Services involves the management of a service center to respond to government
employees' technical and administrative questions. Subject to exception conditions described
below, the recommended provisional security categorization for the help desk service
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of help desk service
information on the ability of responsible agencies to manage of service center responses to
government employees' technical and administrative questions. The consequences of
unauthorized disclosure of most help desk service information are likely to have only a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Information associated with service
center responses can provide useful information to adversaries seeking to penetrate Federal
