NIST SP 800-124r2                                                  Guidelines for Managing the Security

recipients, the enterprise cannot control or have knowledge of what servers its emails are
transmitted through, and it cannot apply enterprise-level security protection for its emails.
Another concern is litigation against the enterprise; the inability to back up or archive personal
email accounts could make it difficult for an enterprise to respond to a demand for discovery or a
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. If an employee resigns or is terminated, the
enterprise is unable to remove that person’s access to enterprise emails that were sent to their
personal email address. This security gap could allow a former employee to retain access to
sensitive enterprise data.
Enterprise email is the prime option for establishing account access for individuals because – as
mentioned above – enterprise email addresses give an enterprise optimum control over its data.
Access-control policies and privileges can be provisioned to a specified enterprise email account
that coincide with the employee who uses the email address. Personal email addresses can be
used in a similar fashion, but enterprises are left with less control of information sent to them.
Finally, shared—emails accounts – enterprise or personal – make it difficult to manage access.
Each employee on the shared account is given the same access privileges and repudiate
responsibility unless there is another way of monitoring individual access.

5.3.4.2.       Device Configuration
Device configuration is the system configuration of a mobile device before it is provisioned to
the user. The system configuration may include updating the OS to the most recent release and
establishing password length requirements. How devices are configured depends on the device
deployment model used by the enterprise.
The device configuration process for enterprise-issued and BYOD devices is different because of
how devices are ultimately provided to users. Enterprise-issued devices can be preconfigured in-
house, or the enterprise can have a mobile device vendor preconfigure the devices prior to
shipping them to the users, such as Apple’s Automated Device Enrollment and Android’s Zero
Touch enrollment. In the case of BYOD devices, an enterprise can request that each device
owner bring their device into the enterprise to be properly configured for enterprise access.
The requirements for device configuration may vary per enterprise. An enterprise may reference
suggested secure mobile device configuration guidance from established entities. The Defense
Information Systems Agency (DISA) provides Security Technical Implementation Guides
(STIGs) that dictate detailed configuration standards for the Department of Defense (DOD). The
Center for Internet Security (CIS) offers the CIS benchmarks, which are “best-practice security
configuration guides both developed and accepted by government, business, industry and
academia” [35][36]. NIST hosts the National Checklist Program (NCP) [39], which supplies
checklists for securely configuring specific types of technology. Device manufacturers may also
provide suggested configurations for their mobile products.

5.3.4.3.       Device Provisioning
Device provisioning is often implemented by enrolling a device into the EMM by installing an
EMM certificate onto each device that provides in-depth security features and privileged device
access to the enterprise. Provisioning a mobile device requires a device to have the necessary
certificate to be enrolled in an EMM service. This certificate is installed on a device and allows
