Establishment of effectiveness/efficiency and impact measures baselines and targets of
performance can be facilitated if historic data that pertains to these measures is available. Trends
observed in the past will provide insight into ranges of performance that have existed previously,
and guide the creation of realistic targets for the future. In the future, expert recommendations
and standards within the industry, when published, may provide a means of setting targets.
Figure 5-2 provides an example of an implementation measure that is based on the percentage of
approved system security plans.
