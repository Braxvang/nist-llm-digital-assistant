      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022


706   The CSP then establishes a subscriber account to uniquely identify each subscriber and
707   record any authenticators registered (bound) to that subscriber account. The CSP may:
708       • issue one or more authenticators to the subscriber at the time of enrollment,
709       • bind authenticators provided by the subscriber, and/or
710       • bind authenticators to the subscriber account at a later time as needed.
711   CSPs generally maintain subscriber accounts according to a documented lifecycle, which
712   defines specific events, activities, and changes that affect the status of a subscriber
713   account. CSPs generally limit the lifetime of a subscriber account and any associated
714   authenticators in order to ensure some level of accuracy and currency of attributes
715   associated with a subscriber. When there is a status change or when the authenticators
716   near expiration and any renewal requirements are met, they may be renewed and/or re-
717   issued. Alternately, the authenticators may be invalidated and destroyed according to the
718   CSPs written policy and procedures.
719   Subscribers have a duty to maintain control of their authenticators and comply with CSP
720   policies in order to remain in good standing with the CSP.
721   In order to request issuance of a new authenticator, typically the subscriber authenticates
722   to the CSP using their existing, unexpired authenticators. If the subscriber fails to request
723   authenticator re-issuance prior to their expiration or revocation, they may be required to
724   repeat the identity proofing (either complete or abbreviated) and enrollment processes in
725   order to obtain a new authenticator.
726   Figure 3 shows a sample of interactions for identity proofing and enrollment.
