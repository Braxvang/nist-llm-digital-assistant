     IMPERATIVE 9 – Advancing Security Test and Measurement Tools



                  to services from NIST’s NVD and DHS’s Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS)86 tool.
                  The research effort’s output will be an initial proposed set of cyber incident data
                  points with associated metrics. A common lexicon is being explored through
                  collaboration with the Department of Defense and its DoD Cybersecurity Analysis
                  and Review (DoDCAR)87 program to incorporate the Open Security Controls
                  Assessment Language (OSCAL) to support the automation of reporting for
                  cybersecurity assessment-related information.
              •   Asset Management. One of the immediate challenges most frequently cited by
                  organizations is how they can establish and maintain complete records of their
                  hardware, software, and information assets. Without knowing what hardware
                  and software assets are in their inventories, they cannot effectively ascertain
                  and monitor the security status of systems. NIST is collaborating with industry
                  partners to promote the adoption of ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015,88 which establishes
                  a specification for representing software identification and management
                  information, and with DHS to produce guidelines for interoperable software
                  identification (SWID) tags (NISTIR 8060).89 In FY18, NIST worked with the
                  IETF to integrate SWID tags into the Network Endpoint Assessment (NEA)90
                  protocol (RFC 8412),91 helped to develop a draft software inventory message and
                  attributes (SWIMA) specification,92 and released project webpages93 to provide
                  information on tagging. In FY18, NIST also finalized a guide that shows healthcare
                  organizations how to protect electronic health records from being exploited in a
                  manner that endangers patient health or compromises identity and privacy (SP
                  1800-1).94 NIST also released a guide that shows financial service organizations a
                  way to more securely and efficiently monitor and manage their many information
                  technology hardware and software assets (SP 1800-5).95 In FY19, NIST plans to
                  continue its SWID standardization activity and begin work on a Practice Guide
                  for using cybersecurity mechanisms to protect systems from exploitation from
                  internal and external network access.
