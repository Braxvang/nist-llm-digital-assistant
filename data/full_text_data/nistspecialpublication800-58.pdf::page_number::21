NIST SP 800-58                                              Voice Over IP Security
_____________________________________________________________________________

       Figure 1 illustrates the basic flow of voice data in a VOIP system. Once the
       called party answers, voice must be transmitted by converting the voice into
       digitized form, then segmenting the voice signal into a stream of packets. The
       first step in this process is converting analog voice signals to digital, using an
       analog-digital converter. Since digitized voice requires a large number of bits, a
       compression algorithm can be used to reduce the volume of data to be transmitted.
       Next, voice samples are inserted into data packets to be carried on the Internet.
       The protocol for the voice packets is typically the Real-time Transport Protocol,
       RTP (RFC 3550). RTP packets have special header fields that hold data needed
       to correctly re-assemble the packets into a voice signal on the other end. But
       voice packets will be carried as payload by UDP protocols that are also used for
       ordinary data transmission. In other words, the RTP packets are carried as data by
       the UDP datagrams, which can then be processed by ordinary network nodes
       throughout the Internet. At the other end, the process is reversed: the packets are
       disassembled and put into the proper order, digitized voice data extracted from the
       packets and uncompressed, then the digitized voice is processed by a digital-to-
       analog converter to render it into analog signals for the called party’s handset
       speaker.


 2.3   Cost

       The feature of VOIP that has attracted the most attention is its cost-saving
       potential. By moving away from the public switched telephone networks, long
       distance phone calls become very inexpensive. Instead of being processed across
       conventional commercial telecommunications line configurations, voice traffic
       travels on the Internet or over private data network lines.

       VOIP is also cost effective because all of an organization’s electronic traffic
       (phone and data) is condensed onto one physical network, bypassing the need for
       separate PBX tie lines. Although there is a significant initial startup cost to such
       an enterprise, significant net savings can result from managing only one network
       and not needing to sustain a legacy telephony system in an increasingly
       digital/data centered world. Also, the network administrator’s burden may be
       lessened as they can now focus on a single network. There is no longer a need for
       several teams to manage a data network and another to mange a voice network.
       The simplicity of VOIP systems is attractive, one organization / one network; but
       as we shall see, the integration of security measures into this architecture is very
       complex.

 2.4   Speed and Quality

       In theory, VOIP can provide reduced bandwidth use and quality superior to its
       predecessor, the conventional PSTN. That is, the use of high bandwidth media
       common to data communications, combined with the high quality of digitized
       voice, make VOIP a flexible alternative for speech transmission. In practice,
       however, the situation is more complicated. Routing all of an organization’s
