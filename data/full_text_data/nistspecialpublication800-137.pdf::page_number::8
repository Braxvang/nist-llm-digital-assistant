CHAPTER ONE

INTRODUCTION

I   nformation security continuous monitoring (ISCM) is defined as maintaining ongoing
    awareness of information security, vulnerabilities, and threats to support organizational risk
    management decisions. 2 This publication specifically addresses assessment and analysis of
security control effectiveness and of organizational security status in accordance with
organizational risk tolerance. Security control effectiveness is measured by correctness of
implementation and by how adequately the implemented controls meet organizational needs in
accordance with current risk tolerance (i.e., is the control implemented in accordance with the
security plan to address threats and is the security plan adequate).3 Organizational security status
is determined using metrics established by the organization to best convey the security posture of
an organization’s information and information systems, along with organizational resilience given
known threat information. This necessitates:
    •    Maintaining situational awareness of all systems across the organization;

    •    Maintaining an understanding of threats and threat activities;
    •    Assessing all security controls;

    •    Collecting, correlating, and analyzing security-related information;
    •    Providing actionable communication of security status across all tiers of the organization;
         and
    •    Active management of risk by organizational officials.
Communication with all stakeholders is key in developing the strategy and implementing the
program. This document builds on the monitoring concepts introduced in NIST SP 800-37 Rev.

Security Life Cycle Approach. An ISCM program helps to ensure that deployed security controls
continue to be effective and that operations remain within stated organizational risk tolerances in
light of the inevitable changes that occur over time. In cases where security controls are
determined to be inadequate, ISCM programs facilitate prioritized security response actions based
on risk.

An ISCM strategy is meaningful only within the context of broader organizational needs,
objectives, or strategies, and as part of a broader risk management strategy, enabling timely

    The terms “continuous” and “ongoing” in this context mean that security controls and organizational risks are
    assessed and analyzed at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based security decisions to adequately protect
    organization information. Data collection, no matter how frequent, is performed at discrete intervals.

    NIST SP 800-53A, as amended, defines security control effectiveness as “the extent to which the controls are
    implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the
    security requirements for the system.”
