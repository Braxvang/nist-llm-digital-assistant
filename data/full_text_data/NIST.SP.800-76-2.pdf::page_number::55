Annex A.      Fingerprint minutiae performance testing and certification procedures

A.1 Scope
This Annex gives normative specifications for tests used to certify implementations that generate and/or match the
mandatory minutia-based biometric elements specified by [FIPS], i.e., the two fingerprint minutiae templates placed
on the PIV Card for either off-card comparison, or on-card. That is, this annex regulates the test itself, and the testing
laboratory, not the products under test, and the data specifications here should not be confused with those given in
Section 2.3 for fielded PIV implementations.

A.2 PIV authentication
The fingerprint templates conform to [MINUSTD] as profiled in Section 3.2.2. The use cases given in [800-73,
Appendix C] detail how the templates and the PIV Card are used for interoperable authentication. Authentication
may involve one or both of the fingers whose data is encoded in a PIV Card record. These will be compared with
newly acquired (i.e., live) fingerprint images of either or both of the primary and secondary fingers. The inclusion of
the finger position in the [MINUSTD] header allows the system to prompt the user for one or more specific fingers.
Authentication performance is quantified in terms of both the false reject rate (FRR) and the false accept rate (FAR).
In PIV, FRR is the proportion of legitimate cardholders incorrectly denied access; the latter would be the proportion of
impostors incorrectly allowed access. The error rates depend on a number of factors including: the environment, the
number of attempts (i.e., finger placements on the sensor), the sensor itself, the quality of the PIV Card templates'
parent images, the number of fingerprints invoked, and the familiarity of users with the process. The use of two
fingers in all authentication transactions offers substantially improved performance over single-finger authentication.
The intent of the [FIPS] specification of an interoperable biometric is to support cross-vendor and cross-agency
authentication of PIV Cards. This plural aspect introduces a source of accuracy variation [MINEX04] because template
generators report minutia (locations) idiosyncratically.

A.3 Test overview
This Section specifies procedures for the certification of generators and matchers of [MINUSTD] templates.
Interoperability testing requires exchange of templates between products, which shall therefore be tested as a
group. Accordingly, the testing laboratory shall conduct a first round of testing to establish a primary group of
interoperable template generators and matchers. Certification shall be determined quantitatively at the conclusion
of the test. Thereafter certification requires interoperability with previously certified products.
The certification procedure shall be conducted offline. This allows products to be certified using very large biometric
data sets, in repeatable, deterministic and therefore auditable evaluations. Offline evaluation is needed to measure
performance when template data is exchanged between all pairs of interoperable products. Large populations shall
be used to quantify the effect of sample variance on performance. A template generator is logically a converter of
images to templates. A template matcher logically compares one or two templates with one or two templates to
produce a similarity score. Template generators and template matchers shall be certified separately. This aspect is
instituted because:
    1.   Template generation is procedurally, algorithmically and physically distinct from matching.
    2.   Template generation is required by [FIPS], but matching is not.
    3.   Fingerprint template interoperability is dependent on the quality of the PIV Card templates. The full benefits
         of an interoperable template will not be realized if a supplier is required to produce both a high performing
         generator and a high performing matcher.
    4.   Once a template generator is certified and deployed, its templates will be in circulation. It is necessary for all
         matchers to be able to process these templates. Subsequent certification rounds will be complicated if
         generators and matchers are certified together.
Separate certification means that a supplier may submit one or more template generators and zero or more matchers
for certification. Zero or more of the submitted products shall ultimately be certified.
