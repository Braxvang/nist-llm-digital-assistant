  NO                           SECURITY RECOMMENDATION                                        BASELINE
                                                                                              FUNCTION
  HY-SR-1    The hypervisor that is launched should be part of a platform                     N/A
             and an overall infrastructure that contains: (a) Hardware that
             supports a MLE with standards-based cryptographic measurement
             capability and storage device and (b) Attestation process that should
             contain capabilities to take advantage of these to provide a chain of
             trust starting from the Hardware to all Hypervisor components. The
             measured elements (components) should include at the minimum the
             following: the core kernel, kernel support modules, device drivers and
             the hypervisor’s native management applications (for VM Lifecycle
             Management and Management of Hypervisor). The chain of trust should
             provide assurance that all measured components have not been
             tampered with and that their versions are correct (i.e., overall boot
             integrity). If the chain of trust is to be extended to guest VMs, the
             hypervisor should provide a virtual interface to the hardware-based
             MLE.

  HY-SR-2     The hardware of the virtualized host should provide assistance for HY-BF1 (VM
              virtualization for instruction sets and memory management using MMU Process Isolation)
              since the hardware support provides the following security assurances that
              cannot be guaranteed with purely software-based virtualization:

              •   Better memory management controls can prevent attacks such as buffer
                  overflow.
              •   The feature for re-mapping of DMA transfers in IOMMU provides
                  better isolation of I/O devices. Further, the feature to directly assign
                  I/O devices to a specific VM and enable direct access to those resources
                  eliminates the need for providing emulated device drivers for that VM,
                  thus reducing the size of trusted code.
              •   Guest OS code and hypervisor code execute in different processor
                  modes, providing better isolation.
              •   Privilege-level isolation can provide better protection for device access
                  mediation functions, and hardware-based memory protection can
                  provide better VM-level protection.
              •   By supporting full virtualization, COTS versions of OSs can allow for
                  easier patching and updating than having to perform the same
                  operations on modified or ported versions of OSs that are the only types
                  that can be run on para-virtualized platforms.
              •   Since many features of virtualization are now available in hardware,
                  the size of the hypervisor code will be small, enabling better security
                  attestation and verification.
