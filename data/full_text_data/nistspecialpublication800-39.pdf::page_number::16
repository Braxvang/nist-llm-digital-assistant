The second component of risk management addresses how organizations assess risk within the
context of the organizational risk frame. The purpose of the risk assessment component is to
identify: (i) threats to organizations (i.e., operations, assets, or individuals) or threats directed
through organizations against other organizations or the Nation; (ii) vulnerabilities internal and
external to organizations;14 (iii) the harm (i.e., consequences/impact) to organizations that may
occur given the potential for threats exploiting vulnerabilities; and (iv) the likelihood that harm
will occur. The end result is a determination of risk (i.e., the degree of harm and likelihood of
harm occurring). To support the risk assessment component, organizations identify: (i) the tools,
techniques, and methodologies that are used to assess risk; (ii) the assumptions related to risk
assessments; (iii) the constraints that may affect risk assessments; (iv) roles and responsibilities;
(v) how risk assessment information is collected, processed, and communicated throughout
organizations; (vi) how risk assessments are conducted within organizations; (vii) the frequency
of risk assessments; and (viii) how threat information is obtained (i.e., sources and methods).

The third component of risk management addresses how organizations respond to risk once that
risk is determined based on the results of risk assessments. The purpose of the risk response
component is to provide a consistent, organization-wide, response to risk in accordance with the
organizational risk frame by: (i) developing alternative courses of action for responding to risk;
(ii) evaluating the alternative courses of action; (iii) determining appropriate courses of action
consistent with organizational risk tolerance; and (iv) implementing risk responses based on
selected courses of action. To support the risk response component, organizations describe the
types of risk responses that can be implemented (i.e., accepting, avoiding, mitigating, sharing, or
transferring risk). Organizations also identify the tools, techniques, and methodologies used to
develop courses of action for responding to risk, how courses of action are evaluated, and how
risk responses are communicated across organizations and as appropriate, to external entities
(e.g., external service providers, supply chain partners).15

The fourth component of risk management addresses how organizations monitor risk over time.
The purpose of the risk monitoring component is to: (i) verify that planned risk response
measures are implemented and information security requirements derived from/traceable to
organizational missions/business functions, federal legislation, directives, regulations, policies,
and standards, and guidelines, are satisfied; (ii) determine the ongoing effectiveness of risk
response measures following implementation; and (iii) identify risk-impacting changes to
organizational information systems and the environments in which the systems operate.16 To
support the risk monitoring component, organizations describe how compliance is verified and
how the ongoing effectiveness of risk responses is determined (e.g., the types of tools, techniques,
and methodologies used to determine the sufficiency/correctness of risk responses and if risk
mitigation measures are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
effect with regard to reducing risk). In addition, organizations describe how changes that may
impact the ongoing effectiveness of risk responses are monitored.

  Organizational vulnerabilities are not confined to information systems but can include, for example, vulnerabilities in
governance structures, mission/business processes, enterprise architecture, information security architecture, facilities,
equipment, system development life cycle processes, supply chain activities, and external service providers.
15
     Supply chain risk management guidance is provided in NIST Interagency Report 7622.
16
  Environments of operation include, but are not limited to: the threat space; vulnerabilities; missions/business
functions; mission/business processes; enterprise and information security architectures; information technologies;
personnel; facilities; supply chain relationships; organizational governance/culture; procurement/acquisition processes;
organizational policies/procedures; organizational assumptions, constraints, risk tolerance, and priorities/trade-offs).
