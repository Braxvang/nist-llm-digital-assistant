       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                                  Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1184   5.5.4. Identity Veriﬁcation Requirements
1185   The CSP SHALL verify the binding of the applicant to the claimed identity by one of the
1186   following:
1187      1. Comparison of a collected biometric characteristic, such as a facial image, to the
1188         associated reference biometric characteristic contained on a piece of presented
1189         SUPERIOR or STRONG evidence
1190      2. Demonstrated association with a digital account through, at a minimum, an AAL2
1191         authentication or an AAL2 and FAL2 federation protocol

1192   5.5.5. Notiﬁcation of Prooﬁng Requirement
1193   Upon the successful completion of identity proofing at IAL3, the CSP SHALL send a
1194   notification of proofing to a validated address for the applicant, as specified in Sec. 5.1.7.

1195   5.5.6. Biometric Collection
1196   The CSP SHALL collect and record a biometric sample at the time of proofing (e.g.,
1197   facial image, fingerprints) for the purposes of non-repudiation and re-proofing.

1198   5.5.7. In-person Prooﬁng Requirements
1199   In-person proofing at IAL3 SHALL be conducted in one of two ways:
1200       • An in-person interaction between the applicant and a CSP operator, or
1201       • A remote interaction with the applicant, supervised by an operator, based on the
1202         requirements in Sec. 5.5.8, IAL3 Supervised Remote Identity Proofing.
1203   Regardless of which of the two methods the CSP employs, the following requirements
1204   apply to identity proofing at IAL3:
1205      1. The CSP SHALL have the operator view the biometric source (e.g., fingers, face)
1206         for the presence of any non-natural materials.
1207      2. The CSP SHALL collect biometrics in such a way that ensures that the biometric is
1208         collected from the applicant, and not another subject.

1209   5.5.8. Requirements for IAL3 Supervised Remote Identity Prooﬁng
1210   IAL3 Supervised Remote Identity Proofing is intended to achieve comparable levels of
1211   confidence and security to an in-person interaction with the applicant.
1212   The following requirements apply to all IAL3 Supervised Remote Identity Proofing
1213   sessions:
1214      1. The CSP SHALL monitor the entire identity proofing session, and SHALL ensure
1215         the applicant is continuously present during the entire identity proofing session —
1216         for example, by a continuous high-resolution video transmission of the applicant.
