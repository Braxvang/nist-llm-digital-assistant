to conduct the update. This requirement for physical presence mitigates the risk of a remote attacker
conducting a malicious update to an inauthentic system BIOS image.

Interacting with a server via a remote console does not satisfy this requirement for physical presence. A
secure local update mechanism can be used, for example, to recover from a corrupted BIOS that cannot
be updated using an authenticated update or an automated recovery mechanism. The secure local update
mechanism could also be used by a physically-present administrator to update to an earlier BIOS version
on a system that does not allow rollback.

However, note that systems that implement the secure local update mechanism are potentially vulnerable
to attacks by rogue administrators or other attacks with physical access to the server. Therefore, additional
physical, environmental and technical security measures are essential to protecting these servers, but they
are beyond the scope of this document.

3.3   Firmware Integrity Protection

To prevent the execution of inauthentic or malicious BIOS code, the integrity of the system BIOS shall be
maintained between the verification of the system BIOS by the RTU and the execution of the system
BIOS during the boot process.

To prevent unintended or malicious modification of the system BIOS outside the authenticated BIOS
update process, the system flash memory containing BIOS (i.e., BIOS flash), excluding configuration
data used by the system BIOS that is stored in non-volatile memory, should be protected from
modifications outside the authenticated BIOS update mechanisms. If implemented, BIOS flash
protections shall be engaged prior to execution of code outside of the RTU and shall be enforced by
hardware mechanisms that are disengaged only by an authorized mechanism (e.g., system reset).

If BIOS flash protections are not implemented, then BIOS integrity shall be verified prior to each
execution, using the Verification Component of the RTU to authenticate the BIOS image. If the
verification fails, then the system shall initiate a recovery procedure, which may involve operator
intervention or be automatic. Automatic recovery mechanisms which initiate recovery to a protected
authentic BIOS should be supported. Automatic recovery mechanisms mitigate the risk of a denial of
service attack, whereby an attacker would load an inauthentic BIOS and put the system in an unbootable
state. The system may allow authorized administrators to configure security policies on the server that
drive these recovery procedures.

Each RTU shall be protected from modifications outside the authenticated update mechanisms. Protection
mechanisms that ensure the integrity of the RTU shall be engaged prior to execution of code outside of
the RTU. RTU integrity protections shall be enforced by hardware mechanisms that are disengaged only
by an authorized mechanism, for example system reset.

3.4   Non-Bypassability

The design of the system and accompanying system components and firmware shall ensure that there are
no mechanisms to install and execute unauthenticated BIOS code, except through physical intervention
and the secure local update mechanism.

In particular, the authenticated update mechanisms shall be the exclusive mechanisms for modifying the
RTU absent physical intervention through the secure local update mechanism. The design of the system
and accompanying system components and firmware shall ensure that there are no mechanisms that allow
