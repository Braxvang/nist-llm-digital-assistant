                                                                      GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



      Completed                                              Action
                  Protect against brute force attacks
                  Use strong authentication if possible
                  Use a delay after failed login attempts
                  Lock out an account after a set number of failed login attempts
                  Enforce a password policy
                  Blacklist IP addresses or domains known to attempt brute force attacks
                  Use log monitoring software to detect brute force attacks



Implementing a Secure Network Infrastructure

      Completed                                              Action
                  Identify network location
                  Web server is located in a DMZ, or Web server hosting is outsourced
                  Assess firewall configuration
                  Web server is protected by a firewall; if it faces a higher threat or is more vulnerable, it
                  is protected by an application layer firewall
                  Firewall controls all traffic between the Internet and the Web server
                  Firewall blocks all inbound traffic to the Web server except TCP ports 80 (HTTP)
                  and/or 443 (HTTPS), if required
                  Firewall blocks (in conjunction with the IDPS) IP addresses or subnets that the IDPS
                  reports are attacking the organizational network
                  Firewall notifies the network or Web server administrator of suspicious activity through
                  an appropriate means
                  Firewall provides content filtering (application layer firewall)
                  Firewall is configured to protect against DoS attacks
                  Firewall detects malformed or known attack URL requests
                  Firewall logs critical events
                  Firewall and firewall OS are patched to latest or most secure level
                  Evaluate intrusion detection and prevention systems
                  Host-based IDPS is used for Web servers that operate primarily using SSL/TLS
                  IDPS is configured to monitor network traffic to and from the Web server after firewall
                  IDPS is configured to monitor changes to critical files on Web server (host-based IDPS
                  or file integrity checker)
                  IDPS blocks (in conjunction with the firewall) IP addresses or subnets that are
                  attacking the organizational network
                  IDPS notifies the IDPS administrators or Web server administrator of attacks through
                  appropriate means
                  IDPS is configured to maximize detection with an acceptable level of false positives
                  IDPS is configured to log events
                  IDPS is updated with new attack signatures frequently (e.g., on a daily basis)
                  Host-based IDPS is configured to monitor the system resources available in the Web
                  server host
                  Assess network switches
                  Switches are used to protect against network eavesdropping
