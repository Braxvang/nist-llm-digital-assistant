       •    Training organization;
       •    Human resources/personnel organization;
       •    Inspectors General (IG); and
       •    Chief Privacy Officer or other designated official with privacy responsibilities.

Stakeholder interests will differ, depending on the information security aspects of their particular
role and their position within the organizational hierarchy. Each stakeholder may require an
additional set of customized measures that provides a view of the organization’s information
security performance within their area of responsibility. Interests may be determined through
multiple venues, such as interviews, brainstorming sessions, and mission statement reviews. In
many cases, stakeholder interests are driven by laws and regulations. As referenced in Section
3.4.2, each stakeholder should initially be responsible for two to three measures. It is
recommended that fewer measures per stakeholder be used when an organization is establishing
an information security program; the number of measures per stakeholder should gradually
increase as the information security program and information security measurement program
mature.

Stakeholders should be involved in each step of information security measures development to
ensure organizational buy-in to the concept of measuring information security performance.
This involvement will also ensure that a sense of ownership of the information system security
measures exists at multiple levels of the organization to encourage the program’s overall success.

The three measurable aspects of information security—business impact, efficiency/effectiveness,
and implementation—speak to different stakeholders. For example, an executive will be
interested in the business and mission impact of information security activities (e.g., What is the
monetary and public trust cost of the latest incident? Is there an article about us in a major
newspaper?), information security and program managers will be interested in the
effectiveness/efficiency of information security programs (e.g., Could we have prevented the
incident? How fast did we respond to it?), and information systems or network administrators
will want to know what went wrong (e.g., Have we performed all necessary steps to avoid or
minimize the impact of the incident?).

5.2         Goals and Objectives Definition

Phase 2 of the measures development process (see Figure 5-1) is to identify and document
information system security performance goals and objectives that would guide security control
implementation for the information security program of a specific information system. For
federal information systems, these goals and objectives may be expressed in the form of high-
level policies and requirements, laws, regulations, guidelines, and guidance. 7
