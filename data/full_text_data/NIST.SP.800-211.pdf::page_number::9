FOREWORD
Last year’s annual report on cybersecurity noted that NIST is “picking up the pace” in
advancing cybersecurity and privacy, and a look back at Fiscal Year 2019 proved that to
be an understatement. The year witnessed a significant increase in the degree and kind
of our collaborations to expand and improve the building blocks of cybersecurity.
That greater collaboration helped us deal with the ever-quickening speed of
technological changes that present one challenge after another in cybersecurity. By
working closely with partners in the private sector, universities, and other agencies both
in the United States and abroad, NIST made great progress in researching and providing
practical methods to achieve improved security and privacy risk management, stronger
cryptography, more secure communications, more reliable automation, and to better
understand, advance, and utilize other foundational elements of cybersecurity.
Helping organizations to better manage security and privacy risk, we updated the Risk
Management Framework to even more fully support organizational security and privacy
at all levels. Through a series of workshops and online forums, we brought industry
and government together to create the NIST Privacy Framework: A Tool for Improving
Privacy through Enterprise Risk Management. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework
continues to gain users as companies and government organizations around the world
have recognized the value of that model and are translating it, tailoring it to adapt to
local needs, and using it to provide a common language for communicating about and
achieving good cybersecurity risk management practices.
The world of cryptography is getting larger and smaller at the same time. This report
describes some of the notable accomplishments in NIST’s continuing quest with our
collaborators to evaluate and standardize quantum-resistant public-key cryptographic
algorithms. At the other end of the spectrum, we advanced lightweight cryptography
to balance the security needs for circuits smaller than were even dreamed of just a few
years ago.
NIST’s work on secure software development and systems engineering reinforces the
need to design and implement software and systems that are secure, resilient, and
trustworthy from the start—a theme that runs throughout many of the resources we
produced and updated in FY 2019 and describe in this report.
Advances in new and emerging technologies and approaches like blockchain, artificial
intelligence, 5th Generation (5G) communications, secure infrastructure, zero trust
architecture, and the Internet of Things are enabling new and remarkable products. The
accomplishments and activities in this report demonstrate how NIST continues to work
with industry partners to ensure that evolving technologies are secure, reliable, and
trustworthy—now and into the future.
