                                   ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



Organizations that want to establish IEEE 802.11 RSNs should configure their APs so that they permit the
establishment of RSNAs only. During the discovery phase, if an AP permits a WEP-based association
with any STA, then not only is that association not an RSNA, but the WLAN is no longer an RSN. All
associations must be RSNAs for the WLAN to be considered an RSN. Allowing any WEP-based
associations creates significant security holes that can negatively impact the security of the other
components of the WLAN. The communications between some STAs and APs will not be protected
strongly, and having APs configured to permit the use of pre-RSN capabilities could allow attackers
within range of the AP to establish unauthorized connections to it, potentially gaining access to other
resources.
