Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management
NIST continued work on the Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) program. C-SCRM
is the process of identifying, assessing, and responding to risks associated with the distributed
and interconnected nature of information, communications, and operational technology product
and service supply chains. C-SCRM is integrated into Systems Security Engineering (SSE) and
covers the entire system life cycle (including research and development, design, manufacturing,
acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, and disposal) since supply chain
threats and vulnerabilities may (intentionally or unintentionally) compromise a technology
product or service at any stage.
C-SCRM work in FY 2020 included the following:
• NISTIR 8272, Impact Analysis Tool for Interdependent Cyber Supply Chain Risks,
  describes a prototype solution for filling the gap between an organization’s risk appetite
  and supply chain risk posture by providing a basic measurement of the potential impact
  of a cyber supply chain event. This tool does not represent a complete C-SCRM solution
  but is intended to be integrated into or used in concert with tools such as third-party
  management, enterprise resource planning, and supply chain management.
• The Federal Acquisition Security Council, which was created as a requirement of the
  U.S. Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act of 2018, helps develop policies and
  processes for agencies to use when purchasing technology products. It recommends
  C-SCRM standards, guidelines, and practices that NIST should develop.
• The Initial Public Draft of NISTIR 8276, Key Practices in Cyber Supply Chain Risk
  Management: Observations from Industry, provides a high-level summary of practices
  deemed by subject matter experts to be foundational to an effective C-SCRM program. It
  is based on an analysis of interviews with companies over several years (leading to the
  development of 24 case studies), prior NIST research in C-SCRM, and several standards
  and industry best practices documents. This work builds on the Roadmap for Improving
  Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, a companion document to the NIST Cybersecurity
  Framework. The NISTIR is based on an analysis of interviews with companies over several
  years (leading to the development of 24 case studies), prior NIST research in cyber supply
  chain risk management, and several standards and industry best practices documents.
• Since NIST SP 800-161, Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Federal
  Information Systems and Organizations, was published in 2015, many aspects of the
  laws, regulations, tools, technologies, and practices that encompass the information,
  communications, and operational technology supply chain risk management (SCRM)
  ecosystem have changed. NIST has initiated an update of SP 800-161 to incorporate
  lessons learned over the past several years, updates to relevant NIST guidance, and
  evolving security and privacy priorities.
• A National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) demonstration project identified
  methods by which organizations can verify that their purchased computing devices are
  genuine and have not been altered.
