                                 GUIDE TO MALWARE INCIDENT PREVENTION AND HANDLING FOR DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS


        for signs of a current infection, such as a particular configuration setting or a system file with a
        certain size that indicates an infection. Security automation technologies are generally the
        preferred method for active identification.
     Custom Network-Based IPS or IDS Signature. Writing a custom IPS or IDS signature that
      identifies infected hosts is often a highly effective technique. Some organizations have separate
      IPS or IDS sensors with strong signature-writing capabilities that can be dedicated to identifying
      malware infections. This provides a high-quality source of information while keeping other
      sensors from becoming overloaded with malware alerts.
     Packet Sniffers and Protocol Analyzers. Configuring packet sniffers and protocol analyzers to
      look only for network traffic matching the characteristics of a particular malware threat can be
      effective at identifying infected hosts. An example of what to monitor is to look for botnet
      command and control communications being carried over IRC. These packet examination
      techniques are most helpful if most or all malware-generated network traffic attempts to pass
      through the same network device or a few devices.
Although active approaches can produce highly accurate results, active approaches need to be used
repeatedly because the status of infections changes constantly and the data is gathered over a period of
time.

4.2.2.3 Manual Identification

Another method for identifying infected hosts is the manual approach. This is by far the most labor-
intensive of the three methods. It should only be considered in those situations where automated methods
are not feasible, such as when networks are completely overwhelmed by infection-related traffic using
spoofed addresses. Also, if users have full control over their hosts, as they do in many non-managed
environments, the characteristics of hosts may be so different that the results of automated identification
methods are quite incomplete and inaccurate. In such situations, a manual approach might be needed to
supplement automated approaches.

There are a few possible techniques for implementing a manual approach. One is to ask users to identify
infections themselves by providing them with information on the malware and the signs of an infection,
as well as antivirus software, OS or application patches, or scanning tools. These items may need to be
distributed on removable media. A similar manual technique is to have local IT staffers (including
individuals who normally do not participate in malware incident handling) either check all hosts or check
hosts that are suspected of being infected. In some cases, non-IT staff might fulfill this duty at remote
offices that do not have available IT staff. Any staff who might need to assist during major malware
incidents should be designated in advance and provided with documentation and periodic training on their
possible duties.

4.2.2.4 Identification Recommendations

Although active approaches typically produce the most accurate results, they are often not the fastest way
of identifying infections. It might take considerable time to scan every host in an organization, and
because hosts that have been disconnected or shut off will not be identified, the scan will need to be
repeated. If forensic data is very recent, it might be a good source of readily available information,
although the information might not be comprehensive. Manual methods are generally not feasible for
comprehensive enterprise-wide identification, but they are a necessary part of identification when other
methods are not sufficient. In many cases, it is most effective to use multiple approaches simultaneously
or in sequence to provide the best results.
