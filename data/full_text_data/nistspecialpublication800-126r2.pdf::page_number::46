                The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



            <oval-res:definition_true content="full" reported="true"/>
            <oval-res:definition_false content="full" reported="true"/>
            <oval-res:definition_unknown content="full" reported="true"/>
            <oval-res:definition_error content="full" reported="true"/>
            <oval-res:definition_not_evaluated content="full" reported="true"/>
            <oval-res:definition_not_applicable content="full" reported="true"/>
         </oval-res:directives>

         When creating the OVAL System Characteristics as defined by the <oval-
         sc:oval_system_characteristics> element, the <oval-sc:collected_objects> and
         <oval-sc:system_data> elements SHALL be provided.

      3. Single Machine With Thin Results – A single result file that includes the results of all OVAL
         Definitions evaluated and “thin” results types as described in the OVAL Results schema. A value
         of “thin” means only the minimal amount of information will be provided.
         For this format, the values for the <oval-res:directives> element SHALL be:
         <oval-res:directives include_source_definitions="false">
            <oval-res:definition_true content="thin" reported="true"/>
            <oval-res:definition_false content="thin" reported="true"/>
            <oval-res:definition_unknown content="thin" reported="true"/>
            <oval-res:definition_error content="thin" reported="true"/>
            <oval-res:definition_not_evaluated content="thin" reported="true"/>
            <oval-res:definition_not_applicable content="thin" reported="true"/>
         </oval-res:directives>

When specifying OVAL system characteristics, a reference SHOULD be made to the target asset in the
ARF report collection. Specifically, the <oval-sc:oval_system_characteristics>/<oval-
sc:system_info>/##any SHOULD be populated with a <con:asset-identification>
element. That element MUST be populated with a single <arf:object-ref> element that points to
the <ai:asset> element in the ARF report collection pertaining to the OVAL result. See [ARF] for
details on populating the <arf:object-ref> element.

4.7     OCIL Results
The following requirements and recommendations pertain to content consumers generating OCIL result
data stream components.
An SCAP OCIL result data stream component SHALL include the results of every
<ocil:questionnaire>, <ocil:question_test_action>, and <ocil:question>
element used to generate the reported results.

4.8     Result Data Stream Signing
Digitally signing result data stream content is important to ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of
results. Leveraging [TMSAD] for SCAP can improve the legitimacy of results of SCAP content and
create a more secure environment. As such, content consumers MAY digitally sign result content
following the guidelines in [TMSAD], along with the following requirements.
One XML digital signature MAY be included in an <arf:extended-info> element in the ARF
report. The signature MUST be represented as a <dsig:Signature> element and MUST follow the
W3C recommendation [DSIG]. The <dsig:Signature> element MUST sign the ARF report
collection root element.
