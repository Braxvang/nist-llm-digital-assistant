NIST SP 800-82r3                                              Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

6.3.2.4.       Vulnerability Scanning (DE.CM-8)
Vulnerabilities can be identified through a combination of automated and manual techniques.
These vulnerability scans should be performed on an ongoing basis to capture new
vulnerabilities as they are discovered.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Some common ways to achieve vulnerability identification in the OT
            environment are:
                   •   Continuous monitoring using passive or active scanning
                       capabilities. Organizations should consider how vulnerability
                       scanning tools may impact OT components and communications
                       by testing them in an offline environment prior to implementing
                       them in production.
                          o Passive scanning tools typically utilize network traffic
                            analyzers to detect assets and determine possible
                            vulnerabilities affecting the assets.
                          o Active scanning tools typically utilize an agent to connect
                            to networked assets and perform detailed queries and
                            analysis of the components to determine possible
                            vulnerabilities affecting the assets.
                   •   Performance testing, load testing, and penetration testing if the
                       test will not adversely impact the production environment
                   •   Regular audits, assessments, and peer reviews to identify gaps in
                       security

6.3.3. Detection Process (DE.DP)
The detection process includes maintaining and testing processes, procedures, and tools to ensure
that anomalous events are identified in a prompt manner and responsible parties (individuals) are
alerted and held accountable for adequate responses. To ensure the ongoing awareness of
anomalous events, define roles and responsibilities for accountability, periodically review that
detection activities comply with the requirements, test the detection processes regularly,
communicate detected events to appropriate personnel to act, and continuously improve
detection capabilities.
