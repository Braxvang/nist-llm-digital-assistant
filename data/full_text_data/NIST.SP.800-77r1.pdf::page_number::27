                                                                                              VPNs do not remove all risk from networking, particularly for communications that occur over
                                                                                              public networks. One potential problem is the strength of the implementation. For example,
                                                                                              flaws in an encryption algorithm or the software implementing the algorithm could allow
                                                                                              attackers to decrypt intercepted traffic, and random number generators that do not produce
                                                                                              sufficiently random values as keys could provide additional attack possibilities. Another issue is
                                                                                              encryption key disclosure; an attacker who discovers a symmetric key could decrypt previously
                                                                                              recorded or current traffic. An attacker obtaining the private key of a public/private key pair (or
                                                                                              PSK) used for identity authentication could potentially pose as a legitimate user.
