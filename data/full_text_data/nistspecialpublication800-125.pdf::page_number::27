                                                      GUIDE TO SECURITY FOR FULL VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGIES



Organizations typically take advantage of these types of desktop virtualization solutions to reduce the
security concerns associated with connecting unmanaged systems to internal resources, as well as to
lessen dependence on distributing managed computers to individuals and trying to ensure that unmanaged
computers meet security requirements. An often overlooked concern about checking personally owned
computers is that scans and other checks may affect privacy. For the data and resources the guest OS
accesses, it can provide some protection from threats in the host OS—for example, by establishing a VPN
to the organization and by encrypting stored data. However, it cannot fully protect against threats in the
host OS unless the host OS is bypassed altogether (e.g., by booting the computer to run a hypervisor from
removable media).

Another benefit of using managed guest OS images is that they can be updated by the organization as
needed without requiring user intervention. However, image distribution can be problematic because a
single guest OS image can be many gigabytes in size, making it difficult to download. Organizations may
choose to lessen the frequency of full image updates by configuring images to patch and update their
operating systems and applications automatically. Organizations that manage guest OSs for multiple users
should also be particularly careful that any changes made by one user do not propagate back to the main
image and then appear in the images used by other users.

Another common use of desktop virtualization is supporting an application that only runs on a legacy OS
that cannot be properly secured on its own. In this case, the hypervisor or host OS may be able to monitor
the guest OS’s actions using various compensating controls that the legacy OS cannot run. Legacy
applications may have vulnerabilities that may be exposed if it is granted network access. Legacy
applications (and the OSs on which they run) may also be more susceptible to insider attack due to a lack
of stringent auditing mechanisms. An additional layer of authentication and auditing could be added, such
as at the host OS level. Virtualization can also be used to strengthen network communications involving
the legacy applications—options for accessing an application include accessing a standalone guest OS via
a console and using a remote connection protocol to the guest OS. In cases where the legacy application
must be provided full network access, care must be taken to ensure that the data it receives is not
malicious and, when policy requires, that the information is encrypted and signed.
