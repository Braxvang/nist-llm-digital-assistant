6.4   Key and Metadata Management Functions

In an FCKMS, an entity can initiate key and metadata management functions. The functions
themselves are performed entirely within an FCKMS module, which contains a
cryptographic module to perform the cryptographic functions used by the FCKMS module.
An Access Control System (ACS) (see Section 6.7.1) performs the authentication and
authorization of an entity initiating a function.

An FCKMS should provide for the creation, modification, replacement, and destruction of
keys and their metadata. Depending on the impact-level and key type, the input and/or output
could have integrity authentication, source authentication, and/or confidentiality services
applied to them.

A trusted channel is a protected communication link established between the cryptographic
module and a sender or receiver to securely communicate unprotected plaintext CSPs, keys,
and authentication data. A trusted channel protects its contents from unauthorized
modification and disclosure along the communication link (see [ISO19790]).

A trusted channel exhibits a verification capability that permits the operator or the module to
confirm that the trusted channel has been established. The trusted channel must use only
NIST-approved security functions (see [FIPS 140]) to establish the channel and transfer data.

In the following subsections, the use of "key" applies to a symmetric key and an asymmetric
key pair, as appropriate, unless otherwise indicated.

Parameters for a cryptographic function should be verified during input to an FCKMS and a
cryptographic module by verifying the protections (e.g., integrity codes) that have been
placed on the parameters.

FR:6.17 The CKMS design shall specify the key and metadata management functions to be
implemented and supported.

FR:6.18 The CKMS design shall identify the integrity, confidentiality, and source
authentication services that are applied to each key and metadata management function
parameter implemented in the CKMS.

                           A Federal CKMS shall support all key and metadata
