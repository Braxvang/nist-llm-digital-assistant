NIST SP 800-167                                                                              GUIDE TO APPLICATION W HITELISTING


3.       Application Whitelisting Planning and Implementation

This section discusses considerations for planning and implementing application whitelisting technologies
for end user devices. As with any new technology deployment, application whitelisting technology
planning and implementation should be addressed in a phased approach. A successful deployment can be
achieved by following a clear, step-by-step planning and implementation process. The use of a phased
approach for deployment can minimize unforeseen issues and identify potential pitfalls early in the
process. This model also allows for incorporating advances in new technology and adapting the
technology to the ever-changing enterprise. The following is an example of planning and implementation
phases:

      1. Initiate the Solution. The first phase involves identifying current and future needs for application
         whitelisting; specifying requirements for performance, functionality, and security; and developing
         necessary policies.

      2. Design the Solution. The second phase involves all facets of designing the application
         whitelisting solution. Examples include architectural considerations, whitelist management,
         cryptography policy, and security aspects of the solution itself.

      3. Implement and Test a Prototype. The next phase involves implementing and testing a prototype
         of the designed solution in a lab or test environment. The primary goals of the testing are to
         evaluate the functionality, management, performance, and security of the solution.

      4. Deploy the Solution. Once the testing is completed and all issues are resolved, the next phase
         includes the gradual deployment of the application whitelisting technology throughout the
         enterprise.

      5. Manage the Solution. After the solution has been deployed, it is managed throughout its
         lifecycle. Management includes solution maintenance and support for operational issues. The
         lifecycle process is repeated when enhancements or significant changes need to be incorporated
         into the solution.

This document does not describe the planning and implementation process in depth because the same
basic steps are performed for any security technology. This section only highlights those considerations
that are of particular interest for application whitelisting technologies.9 These considerations are not
intended to be comprehensive, nor is there any implication that particular security elements not listed here
are unimportant or unnecessary. In addition to following the security recommendations presented in this
publication, organizations implementing application whitelisting technologies should also follow the
recommendations from NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4, Security and Privacy Controls
for Federal Information Systems and Organizations10, which defines minimum recommended
management, operational, and technical controls for information systems based on impact categories.

3.1      Initiation

The purpose of this phase is to identify the current and future needs for application whitelisting and to
determine how those needs can best be met. Requirements specific to application whitelisting that should


9     Section 3 only addresses application whitelisting technology planning and implementation, not other phases such as solution
      retirement, because there is nothing unique to application whitelisting to discuss for other phases. Organizations can simply
      follow their existing processes for solution retirement and for any other security technology phases.
