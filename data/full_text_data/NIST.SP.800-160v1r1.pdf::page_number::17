November 2022



     Introduction
Today’s systems 1 are inherently complex. The growth in the size, number, and types of
components and technologies 2 that compose those systems as well as the system dependencies
result in a range of consequences from inconvenience to catastrophic loss due to adversity 3
within the operating environment. Managing the complexity of trustworthy secure systems
requires achieving the appropriate level of confidence in the feasibility, correctness-in-concept,
philosophy, and design of a system to produce only the intended behaviors and outcomes. This
provides the foundation to address stakeholder protection needs and security concerns with
sufficient confidence that the system functions only as intended while subjected to different
types of adversity and to realistically bound those expectations with respect to constraints and
uncertainty. The failure to address complexity and security will leave the Nation susceptible to
potentially serious, severe, or catastrophic consequences.

The term security is used in this publication to mean freedom from the conditions that can cause
a loss of assets with unacceptable consequences. 4 Stakeholders must define the scope of security
in terms of the assets to which security applies and the consequences against which security is
assessed. 5 Systems engineering provides a foundation for a disciplined and structured approach to
building assured, trustworthy secure systems. As a systems engineering subdiscipline, systems
security engineering addresses security-relevant considerations intended to produce secure
outcomes. The engineering efforts are conducted at the appropriate level of fidelity and rigor
needed to achieve trustworthiness and assurance objectives.


             Peter Neumann described the concept of trustworthiness in [2] as follows:
             “By trustworthiness, we mean simply worthy of being trusted to fulfill whatever critical
             requirements may be needed for a particular component, subsystem, system, network,
             application, mission, enterprise, or other entity. Trustworthiness requirements might
             typically involve (for example) attributes of security, reliability, performance, and
             survivability under a wide range of potential adversities. Measures of trustworthiness
             are meaningful only to the extent that (a) the requirements are sufficiently complete
             and well defined, and (b) can be accurately evaluated.”




1
  A system is an arrangement of parts or elements that exhibit a behavior or meaning that the individual constituents do not [3]. The elements that
compose a system include hardware, software, data, humans, processes, procedures, facilities, materials, and naturally occurring entities [4].
2
  The term technology is used in the broadest context in this publication to include computing, communications, and information technologies, as
well as any mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, or structural components in systems that contain or are enabled by such technologies. This view of
technology provides an increased recognition of the digital, computational, and electronic machine-based foundation of modern complex systems
and the growing importance of an assured trustworthiness of that foundation in providing the system’s functional capability and interaction with
its physical machine and human system elements.
3
  The term adversity refers to those conditions that can cause asset loss (e.g., threats, attacks, vulnerabilities, hazards, disruptions, and exposures).
4
  The phrasing used in this definition of security is intentional. Ross Anderson noted in [5] that “now that everything’s acquiring connectivity,
you can’t have safety without security, and these ecosystems are emerging.” Reflecting on this observation, the security definition was chosen to
achieve alignment with a prevailing safety definition.
