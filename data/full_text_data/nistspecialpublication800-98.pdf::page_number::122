GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



 Anyone eavesdropping on RFID transactions could compromise the privacy of patient medical
  records.
 The CRC could be held liable for violations of the privacy provisions of Health Insurance Portability
  and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
 The radio frequencies used by the RFID system could interfere with wireless patient sensors and
  medical telemetry devices, which could impact quality of care and research results.
 Dermal contact with RFID tags might be a potential vector for the transmission of some highly
  contagious diseases.
The risk assessment also concluded that some RFID risks were minimal or nonexistent in the CRC
environment. The worst case for expected patient and staff exposure to RF radiation was forecasted to be
significantly below any level that might adversely affect their health. CRC already had a well-enforced
policy that prohibits the storage of fuel or ordnance at the facility, and the use of potentially explosive
material such as ether and oxygen tanks was tightly controlled. The likelihood that an adversary would
attempt to use the CRC RFID system to gather intelligence or target personnel was deemed negligible.

As a result of the risk assessment, the CRC enhanced its network security policy to require that the RFID
system be separated from other network systems using a firewall that permits only required data and
management traffic to traverse the network boundary. The network security policy also was amended to
require user authentication to all non-stationary RFID readers and encryption of wireless traffic between
mobile readers and access points. Existing policy regarding secure server configurations and least
privilege 89 data access would extend to the RFID systems without requiring any modifications. The CRC
also decided that it would not institute a new requirement for wireless intrusion detection, but it would
revisit this decision during the following fiscal year.

The CRC also conducted a privacy assessment based on information collected during the risk assessment.
As a result, the CRC privacy policy was revised to account for the introduction of RFID technology. The
revision noted that any patient data collected by the RFID system would be subject to the CRCâ€™s internal
procedures implementing HIPAA regulations. A final determination was made to update patient release
forms to include a statement that inherent risks exist with wireless communications and that network
security controls were implemented to help mitigate these risks.

Based on the project charter and the updated security and privacy policies, the CIO led an
interdisciplinary team of medical practitioners and information technology professionals to develop the
business and functional requirements for the RFID system. These requirements formed the basis for the
phases of the project that followed.

8.1.2     Phase 2: Acquisition/Development

The acquisition and design phase of the project involved planning the RFID system. One design decision
was to select the tag type for each application. Many of the items to be tracked, including laboratory
samples and disposable supplies, were numerous and would be scanned at very close ranges (within 10
centimeters). For these items, passive tags made the most sense, given their low cost. People, high-value
assets, and mobile equipment such as carts, gurneys, and wheelchairs needed to be tracked as they moved
around the facility. The readable range for these applications needed to be at least a few meters. The
team considered active tags, but worried that they could cause interference problems when located in the
radiology unit. Accordingly, they selected semi-active tags, which are less likely to emit radiation

     The principle of least privilege in computer security refers to the concept of granting each user and each module of a system
     only the necessary resources to perform authorized actions.
