   1. The parameter a was set to a ≡ −3 mod p, which allows for optimizations of the group
      law if implemented via projective coordinates in Weierstrass form.
   2. The parameter b was derived in a hard-to-invert way using the procedure in Appendix
      C.3.1 from a pseudorandom Seed value so that the following conditions were satisfied
      simultaneously:
           a. 4a3 + 27b2 ≠ 0 in GF(p);
           b. The curve has prime order n, which implies that h = 1; and
           c. The curve satisfies the cryptographic criteria in Appendix C.1.
   3. Select a base point G = (Gx, Gy) of order n.

C.2.1.2.          Curves W-25519 and W-448
The curves W-25519 (Section 3.2.1.6) and W-448 (Section 3.2.1.7) were obtained from
Curve25519 and Curve448 via an isomorphic mapping (see Appendix B.1).

C.2.2. Montgomery Curves

C.2.2.1.          Curve25519
Curve25519 was specified in IETF 7748 by the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG). This
curve is a Montgomery curve MA,B defined over the field GF(p), where p = 2255−19, the curve
has cofactor h = 8, and the quadratic twist E1 has cofactor h1 = 4. The prime number is of a
special form to allow efficient modular reduction and finite field operations that try and
minimize carry effects of operands. The curve parameters A and B are:
   1. The parameter B was set to B = 1.
   2. The parameter A was selected as the minimum value of |A| so that the following
      conditions were satisfied simultaneously:
           a. The group is cyclic, which implies that A2−4 is not a square in GF(p);
           b. The curve has cofactor h = 8, which implies that A+2 is a square in GF(p);
           c. The quadratic twist has cofactor h1 = 4;
           d. A has the form A ≡ 2 mod 4, which allows optimized implementations of the
              group law using the Montgomery ladder; and
           e. The curve and the quadratic twist both satisfy the cryptographic criteria in
              Appendix C.1.
   3. Select the base point G = (Gx, Gy) of order n, where |Gx| is minimal, and Gy is even.

C.2.2.2.          Curve448
This curve is a Montgomery curve MA,B defined over the field GF(p), where p = 2448−2224−1, the
curve has cofactor h = 4, and the quadratic twist E1 has cofactor h1 = 4. The prime number is of a
