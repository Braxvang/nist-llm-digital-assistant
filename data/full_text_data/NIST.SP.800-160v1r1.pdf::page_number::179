I.8.1. Security Purpose
-      Ensure the effective application of the organization’s Quality Management process to the
       security aspects of the project.
       Note: The security aspects for Quality Assurance should account for the assurance tenets
       detailed in Appendix F.2.

I.8.2. Security Outcomes
-      Security aspects of quality assurance procedures, including security criteria and methods for
       quality assurance evaluations, are implemented.
-      Evaluations of the products, services, and processes of the project are performed in a manner
       consistent with security quality management policies, procedures, and requirements.
-      Security results of evaluations are provided to relevant stakeholders.
-      Security-relevant incidents are resolved.
-      Prioritized security-relevant problems are treated.

I.8.3. Security Activities and Tasks
QA-1      PREPARE FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE
          QA-1.1 Define the security aspects of the quality assurance strategy.
          Note: The security aspects are informed by and consistent with the quality management
          policies, objectives, and procedures and include:
          - Project security quality assurance procedures
          - Security roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities
          - Security activities appropriate to each life cycle process
          - Security activities appropriate to each supplier (including subcontractors)
          - Required security-oriented verification, validation, monitoring, measurement, inspection,
              and test activities specific to the product or service
          - Security criteria for product or service acceptance
          QA-1.2 Establish the independence of security quality assurance from other life cycle processes.
