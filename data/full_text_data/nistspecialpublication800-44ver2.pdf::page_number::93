                                                                   GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



The only “pure” network layer firewalls available today are small office/home office (SOHO) firewall
appliances and personal firewalls [NIST02a] that may only perform basic packet-level filtering.

Stateful inspection firewalls are transport layer devices that incorporate “awareness” of the state of a TCP
connection. Stateful inspection firewalls maintain internal information, such as the state of the
connections passing through them and the contents of some of the data streams. This allows better and
more accurate rule sets and filtering to be specified. Stateful inspection firewalls add the capability to
enforce rules based on connection state to the capabilities of a filtering router.

Application layer firewalls (sometimes called application-proxy gateway firewalls) are advanced firewalls
that combine network and transport layer access control with application layer functionality. Application
layer firewalls permit no traffic directly between the Internet and the internal network. They can usually
perform extensive logging and access control.

Application layer firewalls are considered the most secure type of firewall and have numerous advantages
over packet filtering routers and stateful inspection firewalls, including the following:

 Logging capabilities

 Filtering capabilities (can filter specific types of Web content and specific HTTP commands)

 Protocol conformance

 Validation of protocol behaviors

 Integrated signature-based detection of application layer attacks

 Ease of configuration

 User authentication capabilities.

The primary disadvantages that application layer firewalls have when compared to packet filtering routers
and stateful inspection firewalls are as follows:

 Speed of throughput (if platform is not adequately sized)

 Cost (if high-end hardware is required to operate efficiently)

 Inadequate support for less popular and new protocols.

Although not strictly a limitation, some application layer firewalls are implemented on hosts running
general-purpose OSs (e.g., Windows, Linux, Unix). This arrangement introduces an added layer of
complexity and some additional risk because the general-purpose OS must also be secured in addition to
the firewall software itself. Application layer firewalls are increasingly being deployed as appliance-
based devices, which may use specialized OSs. Routers and stateful inspection firewalls also typically
run on specialized OSs.

To successfully protect a Web server using a firewall, ensure that the firewall is patched to the latest or
most secure level (both the application and the underlying OS) and is configured to perform the
following:

 Control all traffic between the Internet and the Web server
