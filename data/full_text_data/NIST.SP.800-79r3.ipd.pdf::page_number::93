NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                     Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
December 2023                                                                            and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

      AI-4      If one or more optional items are printed on the back of the PIV Card, they    [FIPS201], Sec. 4.1.4.4 – Optional
                comply with the requirements for the optional items on the back on the PIV     Items on the Back of the Card
                Card.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                 (i) The PIV Card meets the specific requirements in [FIPS201] if it
                     includes optional items on the back of the card, such as (i) a
                     magnetic stripe (deprecated); (ii) a return address (iii) the physical
                     characteristics of the cardholder; (iv) additional language for
                     emergency responder officials; (v) standard Section 499, Title 18
                     language; (vi) linear 3 of 9 bar code (deprecated); and (vii) agency-
                     specific text (zones 9B and 10B) (observe, test).
     AI-5       The PIV Card includes mechanisms to block activation of the card after a       [FIPS201], Sec. 4.3.1 – Activation
  (UPDATED)     number of consecutive failed activation attempts. A maximum of 10              by Cardholder
                consecutive activation retries for each of the activation methods (i.e., PIN
                and OCC attempts) are permitted.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                  (i) The PIV Card blocks activation after 10 consecutive failed attempts
                      unless a lower limit is imposed by the issuer (observe, test).
      AI-6      The PIV Card is valid for no more than six years.                              [FIPS201], Sec. 2.8 – PIV Card
                                                                                               Issuance Requirements
                Assessment
                Determine that:                                                                [FIPS201], Sec. 2.9.1 – PIV
                   (i) The expiration date printed on the PIV Card is no more than six         Reissuance Requirements
                       years from the issuance date (observe).
                  (ii) The expiration date is printed in the CHUID (test).
                 (iii) The date printed on the card and the expiration date in the CHUID
                       are the same (test).
                 (iv) The biometric that is used for reissuance is not older than 12 years
                       (review).
     AI-7       Before the PIV Card is provided to the applicant, the operator performs a   [FIPS201], Sec. 2.8 – PIV Card
  (UPDATED)     one-to-one comparison of the applicant against the biometric data records Issuance
                available on the PIV Card or in the PIV enrollment record. If the biometric
                verification decision is negative, or if no biometric data records are
                available, the cardholder provides two identity source documents (as
                specified in [FIPS201], Sec 2.7), which are inspected and compared by the
                operator with the photograph printed on the PIV Card.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                   (i) The PIV Card is released to the applicant only after a positive
                       biometric verification decision (review, observe).
                  (ii) The issuer has alternate processes in place if biometric matches are
                       not possible (review, observe).
      AI-9      The issuer advises applicants in selecting a strong PIN value. The PIN is (i) [FIPS201], Sec. 4.3.1 – Activation
                a minimum of six digits in length, (ii) not easily guessable, (iii) not       by Cardholder
                individually identifiable (e.g., part of a Social Security Number or phone
                number), and (iv) not commonly used (e.g., 000000, 123456).

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                  (i) The issuer has trained operators to advise applicants on PIN
                      selection (review).
