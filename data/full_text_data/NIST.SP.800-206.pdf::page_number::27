     IMPERATIVE 5 – Improving Cybersecurity Awareness, Training, Education, and Workforce Development

       •   Usability and Cybersecurity. Too often, sound cybersecurity components and
           practices are not employed because of user resistance. In FY18, NIST advanced
           research that examined usability attributes and reasons for user resistance.
           The topics addressed included phishing, password policies, usable privacy,
           cryptographic development, and youth password perceptions and behaviors. FY18
           marked the beginning of a multi-year research effort to examine youth security
           practices, behaviors, and perceptions with the goal of developing useful guidance
           to help youth learn, understand, and ultimately practice good cybersecurity
           behaviors. In FY18, a paper documenting the results of the first school district
           surveyed (Ohio)—which included students in grades 3 to 8—was completed.
           Further analysis of all five school systems’ survey data is being conducted in
           FY19 and will include descriptive statistics and a follow-up survey that examines
           parents’ password practices and their involvement (or lack of involvement) with
           the password usage of their grade school children.


        RESULTS OF ONLINE SURVEYS
        OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC DEVELOPERS
        During FY18, the Usability and Cybersecurity team published a paper reporting the
        results of online surveys of organizations involved in cryptographic development.
        Findings revealed that organizations used cryptography for a wide range of
        purposes. Most relied on generally accepted, standards-based implementations
        as guides while others developed their own implementations by drawing from
        non-standards resources. The results highlighted the challenges for organizations
        that undertake cryptographic development, including difficulties in recruiting
        and managing talent, disruptions to the product lifecycle, and trouble explaining
        the security value of products to customers. Interviews of representatives
        from organizations that include cryptography in their products suggested a
        strong security mindset demonstrated by robust organizational security culture
        and the deep expertise of those performing cryptographic development. The
        results encourage additional research initiatives to explore variations in those
        implementing cryptography, which can aid in transferring lessons learned from
        more security-mature organizations to the broader development community
        through educational opportunities, tools, and other mechanisms.
