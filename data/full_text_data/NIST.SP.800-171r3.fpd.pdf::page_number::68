       NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                       Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
       November 2023

1944             DISCUSSION
1945             There are many publicly available sources of system security alerts and advisories. For
1946             example, the Department of Homeland Securityâ€™s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
1947             Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation
1948             (FBI) generate security alerts and advisories to maintain situational awareness across the
1949             Federal Government and in nonfederal organizations. Software vendors, subscription services,
1950             and industry Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) may also provide security
1951             alerts and advisories. Compliance with security directives is essential due to the critical nature
1952             of many of these directives and the potential immediate adverse effects on organizational
1953             operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation should the directives not
1954             be implemented in a timely manner.

1962   3.14.6. System Monitoring
1963             REQUIREMENT: 03.14.06
1964             a. Monitor the system to detect:
1965                  1. Attacks and indicators of potential attacks; and
1966                  2. Unauthorized connections.
1967             b. Identify unauthorized use of the system.
1968             c.   Monitor inbound and outbound communications traffic to detect unusual or unauthorized
1969                  activities or conditions.

1970             DISCUSSION
1971             System monitoring involves external and internal monitoring. External monitoring includes the
1972             observation of events that occur at the system boundary. Internal monitoring includes the
1973             observation of events that occur within the system. Organizations can monitor the system, for
1974             example, by observing audit record activities in real time or by observing other system aspects,
1975             such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives
1976             may guide determination of the events.
1977             A system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., audit
1978             record monitoring software, intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems,
1979             malicious code protection software, scanning tools, network monitoring software). Strategic
1980             locations for monitoring devices include selected perimeter locations and near server farms that
1981             support critical applications with such devices being employed at managed system interfaces.
