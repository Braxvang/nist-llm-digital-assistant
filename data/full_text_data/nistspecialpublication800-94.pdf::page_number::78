GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



 Log Analysis. Some agents can monitor and analyze OS and application logs to identify malicious
  activity. 44 These logs may contain information on system events, which are operational actions
  performed by OS components (e.g., shutting down the system, starting a service); audit records,
  which contain security event information such as successful and failed authentication attempts and
  security policy changes; and application events, which are significant operational actions performed
  by applications, such as application startup and shutdown, application failures, and major application
  configuration changes.
 Network Configuration Monitoring. Some agents can monitor a host’s current network
  configuration and detect changes to it. Typically all network interfaces on the host are monitored,
  including wired, wireless, virtual private network (VPN), and modem. Examples of significant
  network configuration changes are network interfaces being placed in promiscuous mode, additional
  TCP or UDP ports being used on the host, or additional network protocols being used, such as non-IP
  protocols. These changes could indicate that the host has already been compromised and is being
  configured for use in future attacks or for transferring data.
Organizations should determine which aspects of hosts need to be monitored and select IDPS products
that provide adequate monitoring and analysis for them.

Because host-based IDPSs often have extensive knowledge of hosts’ characteristics and configurations, a
host-based IDPS agent can often determine whether or not an attack against a host would succeed if not
stopped. Agents can use this knowledge to select prevention actions and to assign appropriate priorities
to alerts.

7.2.2.2 Detection Accuracy

Like any other IDPS technology, host-based IDPSs often cause false positives and false negatives.
However, the accuracy of detection is more challenging for host-based IDPSs because several of the
possible detection techniques, such as log analysis and filesystem monitoring, do not have knowledge of
the context under which detected events occurred. For example, a host may be rebooted, a new
application installed, or a system file replaced. These actions could be done by malicious activity, or they
could be part of normal host operation and maintenance. The events themselves are detected accurately,
but their benign or malicious nature cannot always be determined without additional context. Some
products, particularly those intended for desktop/laptop use, prompt users to provide context, such as
whether or not the user is currently upgrading a particular application. If a user does not respond to the
prompt in a set period of time (typically a few minutes), the agent chooses a default action (allow or
deny).

Host-based IDPSs that use combinations of several detection techniques should generally be capable of
achieving more accurate detection than products that use one or a few techniques. Because each
technique can monitor different aspects of a host, using more techniques allows agents to collect more
information on the activities occurring. This provides a more complete picture of the events, and may
also provide additional context that can be helpful in assessing the intent of certain events.

7.2.2.3 Tuning and Customization

Host-based IDPSs usually require considerable tuning and customization. For example, many rely on
observing host activity and developing baselines or profiles of expected behavior. Others need to be

     Some products only perform log analysis and log management activities, such as log consolidation. Although these
     products are often referred to as host-based IPS, some of them are actually security information and event management
     (SIEM) products. Section 9 contains additional information on SIEM.
