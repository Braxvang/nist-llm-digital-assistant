A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



Appendix B—Empirical Results for Sample Data

The user is urged to validate that the statistical test suite is operating properly. For this reason, five
sample files have been provided. These five files are: (1) data.pi, (2) data.e, (3) data.sha1, (4)
data.sqrt2, and (5) data.sqrt3. For each data file, all of the statistical tests were applied, and the results
recorded in the following tables. The Block Frequency, Non-overlapping Template Matching,
Overlapping Template Matching, Approximate Entropy, Serial, and Linear Complexity tests require user
prescribed input parameters. The exact values used in these examples have been included in parenthesis
beside the name of the statistical test. In the case of the random excursions and random excursions
variant tests, only one of the possible 8 and 18 P-values, respectively, has been reported. Each sample is
1,000,000 bits in length. Additionally, the p-values reported in the tables can be found in the results.txt
files for each of the individual test – not in the finalAnalysisReport.txt file.
