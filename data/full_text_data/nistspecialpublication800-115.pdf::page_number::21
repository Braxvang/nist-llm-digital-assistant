3.5     Network Sniffing

Network sniffing is a passive technique 10 that monitors network communication, decodes protocols, and
examines headers and payloads to flag information of interest. Besides being used as a review technique,
network sniffing can also be used as a target identification and analysis technique (see Section 4.1).
Reasons for using network sniffing include the following:

       Capturing and replaying network traffic
       Performing passive network discovery (e.g., identifying active devices on the network)
       Identifying operating systems, applications, services, and protocols, including unsecured (e.g.,
        telnet) and unauthorized (e.g., peer-to-peer file sharing) protocols
       Identifying unauthorized and inappropriate activities, such as the unencrypted transmission of
        sensitive information
       Collecting information, such as unencrypted usernames and passwords.
Network sniffing has little impact on systems and networks, with the most noticeable impact being on
bandwidth or computing power utilization. The sniffer—the tool used to conduct network sniffing—
requires a means to connect to the network, such as a hub, tap, or switch with port spanning. Port
spanning is the process of copying the traffic transmitted on all other ports to the port where the sniffer is
installed. Organizations can deploy network sniffers in a number of locations within an environment.
These commonly include the following:

       At the perimeter, to assess traffic entering and exiting the network
       Behind firewalls, to assess that rulesets are accurately filtering traffic
       Behind IDSs/IPSs, to determine if signatures are triggering and being responded to appropriately
       In front of a critical system or application to assess activity
       On a specific network segment, to validate encrypted protocols.
One limitation to network sniffing is the use of encryption. Many attackers take advantage of encryption
to hide their activities—while assessors can see that communication is taking place, they are unable to
view the contents. Another limitation is that a network sniffer is only able to sniff the traffic of the local
segment where it is installed. This requires the assessor to move it from segment to segment, install
multiple sniffers throughout the network, and/or use port spanning. Assessors may also find it
challenging to locate an open physical network port for scanning on each segment. In addition, network
sniffing is a fairly labor-intensive activity that requires a high degree of human involvement to interpret
network traffic.

3.6     File Integrity Checking

File integrity checkers provide a way to identify that system files have been changed computing and
storing a checksum for every guarded file, and establishing a file checksum database. Stored checksums
are later recomputed to compare their current value with the stored value, which identifies file

      Sniffers may perform domain name lookups for the traffic they collect, during which they generate network traffic. Domain
      name lookups can be disabled for stealthy network sniffing.
