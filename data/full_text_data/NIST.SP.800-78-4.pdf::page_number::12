Note: As of January 1, 2011, only SHA-256 may be used to generate RSA signatures on PIV
objects. RSA signatures may use either the PKCS #1 v1.5 padding scheme or the Probabilistic
Signature Scheme (PSS) padding as defined in [PKCS1]. The PSS padding scheme object
identifier (OID) is independent of the hash algorithm; the hash algorithm is specified as a
parameter (for details, see [PKCS1]).

The secure messaging CVC shall be signed using ECDSA (Curve P-256) with SHA-256 if it
contains an ECDH (Curve P-256) subject public key, and shall be signed using ECDSA (Curve
P-384) with SHA-384 otherwise. The Intermediate CVC shall be signed using RSA with SHA-
256 and PKCS #1 v1.5 padding.

FIPS 201-2, SP 800-73-4, and SP 800-76-2 specify formats for the CHUID, the Security Object,
the biometric information, and X.509 public key certificates, which rely on OIDs to specify
which signature algorithm was used to generate the digital signature. The object identifiers
specified in Table 3-3, below, must be used in FIPS 201-2 implementations to identify the
signature algorithm. 4,5

3.2.2   Specification of Public Keys In X.509 Certificates

FIPS 201-2 requires generation and storage of an X.509 certificate to correspond with each
asymmetric private key contained on the PIV Card, except the PIV Secure Messaging key. X.509
certificates include object identifiers to specify the cryptographic algorithm associated with a


4
  The OID for RSA with SHA-1 and PKCS #1 v1.5 padding is included in Table 3-3 since applications may
encounter X.509 certificates that were signed before January 1, 2011, using this algorithm.
5
  For the CHUID, Security Object, and biometric information the signatureAlgorithm field of SignerInfo shall
contain rsaEncryption (1.2.840.113549.1.1.1) when the signature algorithm is RSA with PKCS #1 v1.5 padding.
