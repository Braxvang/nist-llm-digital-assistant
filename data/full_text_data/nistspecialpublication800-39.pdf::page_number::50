communicated to the decision makers responsible for risk response. In certain situations, there are recurring cycles
between the risk assessment step and the risk response step until particular objectives are achieved. Based on the course
of action selected during the risk response step, some residual risk may remain. Under certain circumstances, the level
of residual risk could trigger a reassessment of risk. This reassessment is typically incremental (assessing only the new
information) and differential (assessing how the new information changes the overall risk determination).
The aggregation of risk assessment results from all three tiers drives the management of portfolios of risks undertaken
by organizations. Identified risks common to more than one mission/business function within organizations may also be
the source for future assessment activities at Tier 1, such as root-cause analysis. Gaining a better understanding of the
reasons why certain risks are more common or frequent assists decision makers in selecting risk responses that address
underlying (or root-cause) problems instead of solely focusing on the surface issues surrounding the existence of the
risks. The results of risk assessments can also shape future design and development decisions related to enterprise
architecture (including embedded information security architecture), and organizational information systems. The
extent to which missions/business functions are vulnerable to a set of identified threats and the relative ease with which
those vulnerabilities can be exploited, contribute to the risk-related information provided to senior leaders/executives.
Outputs from the risk assessment step can be useful inputs to the risk framing and risk monitoring steps. For example,
risk determinations can result in revisiting the organizational risk tolerance established during the risk framing step.
Organizations can also choose to use information from the risk assessment step to inform the risk monitoring step. For
example, risk assessments can include recommendations to monitor specific elements of risk (e.g., threat sources) so
that if certain thresholds are crossed, previous risk assessment results can be reviewed and updated, as appropriate.
Particular thresholds established as part of risk monitoring programs can also serve as the basis for reassessments of
risk. If organizations establish criteria as a part of the risk framing step for when risk assessment results do not warrant
risk responses, then assessment results could be fed directly to the risk monitoring step as a source of input.


3.3 RESPONDING TO RISK
Risk response identifies, evaluates, decides on, and implements appropriate courses of action to
accept, avoid, mitigate, share, or transfer risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals,
other organizations, and the Nation, resulting from the operation and use of information systems.
Identifying and analyzing alternative courses of action63 typically occurs at Tier 1 or Tier 2. This
is due to the fact that alternative courses of action (i.e., potential risk responses) are evaluated in
terms of anticipated organization-wide impacts and the ability of organizations to continue to
successfully carry out organizational missions and business functions. Decisions to employ risk
response measures organization-wide are typically made at Tier 1, although the decisions are
informed by risk-related information from the lower tiers. At Tier 2, alternative courses of action
are evaluated in terms of anticipated impacts on organizational missions/business functions, the
associated mission/business processes supporting the missions/business functions, and resource
requirements. At Tier 3, alternative courses of action tend to be evaluated in terms of the system
development life cycle or the maximum amount of time available for implementing the selected
course(s) of action. The breadth of potential risk responses is a major factor for whether the
activity is carried out at Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3. Risk decisions are influenced by organizational
risk tolerance developed as part of risk framing activities at Tier 1. Organizations can implement
risk decisions at any of the risk management tiers with different objectives and utility of
information produced.

STEP 3: RISK RESPONSE

Inputs and Preconditions
Inputs from the risk assessment and risk framing steps include: (i) identification of threat sources and threat events; (ii)
identification of vulnerabilities that are subject to exploitation; (iii) estimates of potential consequences and/or impact if

   A course of action is a time-phased or situation-dependent combination of risk response measures. A risk response
measure is a specific action taken to respond to an identified risk. Risk response measures can be separately managed
and can include, for example, the implementation of security controls to mitigate risk, promulgation of security policies
to avoid risk or to accept risk in specific circumstances, and organizational agreements to share or transfer risk.
