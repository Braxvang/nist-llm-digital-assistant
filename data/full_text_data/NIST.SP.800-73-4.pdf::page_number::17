Special Publication 800-73-4      Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification â€“ Part 1: PIV
                               Card Application Namespace, Data Model and Representation

3.         PIV Data Model Elements

This section contains the description of the data elements for personal identity verification, the PIV
data model.

A PIV Card Application shall contain seven mandatory interoperable data objects, two conditionally
mandatory data objects, and may contain twenty-seven optional data objects. The seven mandatory
data objects for interoperable use are as follows:

      1.    Card Capability Container
      2.    Card Holder Unique Identifier
      3.    X.509 Certificate for PIV Authentication
      4.    X.509 Certificate for Card Authentication
      5.    Cardholder Fingerprints
      6.    Cardholder Facial Image
      7.    Security Object

The two data objects that are mandatory if the cardholder has a government-issued email account at
the time of credential issuance are:

      1. X.509 Certificate for Digital Signature
      2. X.509 Certificate for Key Management

The twenty-seven optional data objects are as follows:

      1.    Printed Information
      2.    Discovery Object
      3.    Key History Object
      4.    20 retired X.509 Certificates for Key Management
      5.    Cardholder Iris Images
      6.    Biometric Information Templates Group Template
      7.    Secure Messaging Certificate Signer
      8.    Pairing Code Reference Data Container

3.1        Mandatory Data Elements

This section describes the seven mandatory data objects for interagency interoperable use.

3.1.1       Card Capability Container

The Card Capability Container (CCC) is a mandatory data object whose purpose is to facilitate
compatibility of Government Smart Card Interoperability Specification (GSC-IS) applications with
PIV Cards.

The CCC supports minimum capability for retrieval of the data model and optionally the application
information as specified in [GSC-IS]. The data model of the PIV Card Application shall be identified
by data model number 0x10. Deployed applications use 0x00 through 0x04. This enables the GSC-IS
application domain to correctly identify a new data model namespace and structure as defined in this
document.
