GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



Some NBA sensors that directly monitor network traffic are able to log limited payload information from
packets, such as authenticated user identifiers. This allows actions to be traced to specific user accounts.

6.2.3   Detection Capabilities

NBA technologies typically have the capability to detect several types of malicious activity. Most
products use primarily anomaly-based detection, along with some stateful protocol analysis techniques, to
analyze network flows. Most NBA technologies offer no signature-based detection capability, other than
allowing administrators to manually set up custom filters that are essentially signatures to detect or stop
specific threats. This section discusses the following aspects of NBA software detection capabilities:

 Types of events detected
 Detection accuracy
 Tuning and customization
 Technology limitations.
6.2.3.1 Types of Events Detected

The types of events most commonly detected by NBA sensors include the following:

 Denial of service (DoS) attacks (including distributed denial of service [DDoS] attacks). These
  attacks typically involve significantly increased bandwidth usage or a much larger number of packets
  or connections to or from a particular host than usual. By monitoring these characteristics, anomaly
  detection methods can determine if the observed activity is significantly different than the expected
  activity. Some NBA sensors are aware of the characteristics of common DoS tools and methods,
  which can help them to recognize the threats more quickly and prioritize them more accurately.
 Scanning. Scanning can be detected by atypical flow patterns at the application layer (e.g., banner
  grabbing), transport layer (e.g., TCP and UDP port scanning), and network layer (e.g., ICMP
  scanning).
 Worms. Worms spreading among hosts can be detected in more than one way. Some worms
  propagate quickly and use large amounts of bandwidth. Worms can also be detected because they can
  cause hosts to communicate with each other that typically do not, and they can also cause hosts to use
  ports that they normally do not use. Many worms also perform scanning; this can be detected as
  previously explained.
 Unexpected application services (e.g., tunneled protocols, backdoors, use of forbidden application
  protocols). These are usually detected through stateful protocol analysis methods, which can
  determine if the activity within a connection is consistent with the expected application protocol.
 Policy violations. Most NBA sensors allow administrators to specify detailed policies, such as which
  hosts or groups of hosts a particular system may or may not contact, and what types of activity are
  permissible only during certain hours or days of the week. Most sensors also detect many possible
  policy violations automatically, such as detecting new hosts or new services running on hosts, which
  could be unauthorized.
Most NBA sensors can reconstruct a series of observed events to determine the origin of a threat. For
example, if worms infect a network, NBA sensors can analyze the worm’s flows and find the host on the
organization’s network that first transmitted the worm to other hosts.
