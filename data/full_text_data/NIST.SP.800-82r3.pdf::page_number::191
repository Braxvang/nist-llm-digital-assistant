               Table 15. Architecture and design vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions

             Vulnerability                                                 Description
  Inadequate incorporation of            Incorporating security into the OT architecture and design must start with
  security into architecture and         a budget and schedule designated for OT. The architectures must address
  design                                 the identification and authorization of users, access control mechanism,
                                         network topologies, and system configuration and integrity mechanisms.
  Inadequate management of change        The network infrastructure within the OT environment has often been
  that allows insecure architecture to   developed and modified based on business and operational requirements
  evolve                                 with little consideration for the potential security impacts of the changes.
                                         Over time, security gaps may have been inadvertently introduced within
                                         the infrastructure. Without remediation, these gaps may represent
                                         backdoors into the OT.
                                         Sensors and controllers that were historically simple devices are now often
                                         manufactured as intelligent devices. In some cases, sensors and controllers
                                         may be replaced with IIoT devices that allow direct internet connections.
                                         Security should be incorporated into change management for all OT
                                         devices, not just traditional IT components.
  No security perimeter defined          If the OT does not have a security perimeter clearly defined, it is not
                                         possible to ensure that the necessary security controls are deployed and
                                         configured properly. This can lead to unauthorized access to systems and
                                         data, as well as other problems.
  Control networks used for non-         Control and non-control traffic have different requirements, such as
  control traffic                        determinism and reliability. Having both types of traffic on a single
                                         network creates challenges for meeting the requirements of control traffic.
                                         For example, non-control traffic could inadvertently consume resources
                                         that control traffic needs, causing disruptions in OT functions.
  Control network services               When IT services such as a Domain Name System (DNS) and Dynamic
  dependent on a non-control             Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) are used by control networks, they
  network                                are often implemented in the IT network. This causes the OT network to
                                         become dependent on the IT network, which may not have the reliability
                                         and availability requirements needed by OT.
  Inadequate collection of event data    Forensic analysis depends on the collection and retention of sufficient
  history                                data. Without proper and accurate data collection, it may be impossible to
                                         determine what caused a security incident to occur. Incidents might go
                                         unnoticed, leading to additional damage and/or disruption. Regular
                                         security monitoring is also needed to identify problems with security
                                         controls, such as misconfigurations and failures.
                                         Event data for an OT environment could include physical process data,
                                         system use data, and network data.


           Table 16. Configuration and maintenance vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions

             Vulnerability                                                 Description
  Hardware, firmware, and software       The organization does not know what it has (e.g., make, model), where
  that are not under asset               they are, or what version it is, resulting in an inconsistent and ineffective
  management                             defense posture. To properly secure an OT, there should be an accurate
                                         inventory of the assets in the environment. Procedures should be in place
                                         to manage additions, deletions, and modifications of assets, which include
                                         asset inventory management. These procedures are critical to executing
                                         business continuity and disaster recovery plans.
