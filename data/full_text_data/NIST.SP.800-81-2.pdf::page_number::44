SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



Because this threat is low impact, the only protection approach required is to configure the secondary
name servers to receive DNS NOTIFY message only from the enterpriseâ€™s primary name server.
However, if TSIG is set up for use for all communication between a set of hosts, TSIG will be used with
NOTIFY messages as well.

Table 6-1 summarizes the DNS transactions and their associated threats, security objectives, and IETF
security mechanism specifications to meet those goals.
