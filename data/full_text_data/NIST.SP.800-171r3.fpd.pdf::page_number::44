       NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                       Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information

1047           b. Select and assign an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role, service, or device.
1048           c.   Prevent reuse of identifiers for [Assignment: organization-defined time period].
1049           d. Uniquely identify the status of each individual with an identifying characteristic.

1050           DISCUSSION
1051           Identifiers are provided for users, processes acting on behalf of users, and devices. Prohibiting the
1052           reuse of identifiers prevents the assignment of previously used individual, group, role, service, or
1053           device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, services, or devices. Characteristics that
1054           identify the status of individuals include contractors, foreign nationals, and non-organizational
1055           users. Identifying the status of individuals by these characteristics provides useful information
1056           about the people with whom organizational personnel are communicating. For example, is useful
1057           for an employee to know that one of the individuals on an email message is a contractor.

1062   3.5.7. Password Management
1063           REQUIREMENT: 03.05.07
1064           a. Maintain a list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords and update the list
1065              periodically and when organizational passwords are suspected to have been compromised.
1066           b. Verify, when users create or update passwords, that the passwords are not found on the list
1067              of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords.
1068           c.   Transmit passwords only over cryptographically-protected channels.
1069           d. Store passwords in a cryptographically-protected form.
1070           e. Select a new password upon first use after account recovery.
1071           f.   Enforce the following composition and complexity rules for passwords: [Assignment:
1072                organization-defined composition and complexity rules].

1073           DISCUSSION
1074           Password-based authentication applies to passwords used in single-factor or multi-factor
1075           authentication. Long passwords or passphrases are preferable to shorter passwords. Enforced
1076           composition rules provide marginal security benefits while decreasing usability. However,
1077           organizations may choose to establish certain rules for password generation (e.g., minimum
1078           character length) under certain circumstances and can enforce this requirement. For example,
1079           account recovery can occur when a password is forgotten. Cryptographically protected passwords
1080           include salted one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords. The list of commonly used,
1081           compromised, or expected passwords includes passwords obtained from previous breach
1082           corpuses, dictionary words, and repetitive or sequential characters. The list includes context-
1083           specific words, such as the name of the service, username, and derivatives thereof. Changing
1084           temporary passwords to permanent passwords immediately after system logon ensures that the
1085           necessary strength of the authentication mechanism is implemented at the earliest opportunity and
