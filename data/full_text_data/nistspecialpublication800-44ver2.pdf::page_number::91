                                                                   GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



 The network can be optimized solely for the support and protection of Web servers.

The disadvantages of outsourcing from a security standpoint are as follows:

 It requires trusting a third party with Web server content.

 It is more difficult to remotely administer the Web server or remotely update Web server content.

 Less control can be provided over the security of the Web server.

 The Web server may be affected by attacks aimed at other Web servers hosted by the outsourcer on
  the same network.

Outsourcing often makes sense for smaller organizations that cannot afford to support the necessary Web
server staff. It may also be appropriate for larger organizations that do not wish to host their own Web
servers. Outsourcing usually does not make sense for organizations that wish to maintain tight control
over their Web servers.

8.1.4    Management Network

Web servers and other important components can be connected to each other and managed through an
organization’s standard networks or through a separate network known as a management network. If a
management network is used, each host being managed through the network has an additional network
interface known as a management interface that connects to the management network. Also, each host
being managed is unable to pass any traffic between its management interface and any of its other
network interfaces. Consoles and other hosts that are used to manage the Web components are attached
to the management network only. This architecture effectively isolates the management network from the
production networks. The benefits of doing this are to protect the components from some attacks and to
ensure that the components can be managed under adverse conditions (e.g., DDoS attack). Disadvantages
of using a management network include the additional costs of networking equipment and other hardware
(e.g., personal computers [PC] for the consoles) and the inconvenience for Web component administrators
of using separate computers for management and monitoring.

8.2     Network Element Configuration

Once the Web server has been positioned in the network, the network infrastructure elements should be
configured to support and protect it. The primary elements of a network infrastructure that affect Web
server security are firewalls, routers, IDSs, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), switches, load balancers,
and reverse proxies. Each has an important role to play and is critical to the overall strategy of protecting
the Web server through defense-in-depth. Unfortunately, when it comes to securing a Web server, there
is no single “silver bullet” solution. A firewall or IPS alone cannot adequately protect a public Web
server from all threats or attacks.

8.2.1    Router/Firewall Configuration

Several types of firewalls exist. The most basic firewalls are routers that can provide access control for IP
packets. In the middle are stateful firewalls that can provide access control based on TCP and User
