(government agency, citizen, corporation) that would be admissible in a court of law, in an
attempt to prove guilt or innocence.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The consequences of unauthorized
disclosure of legal investigation information depend 1] on the seriousness of the crime involved,
2] timing (e.g., the ability of the criminal 40 to access the information and use it to commit a
crime or to evade detection or surveillance), and 3] on the capability criminal to injure witnesses
or law enforcement officials. In cases where 1) the crimes are not violent and do not involve
extraordinarily large property losses, and 2) there is no indication of a record of violence on the
part of the criminal, the confidentiality impact may be low or moderate.

Given the nature of many of the crimes that are the responsibility of Federal law enforcement
agencies, the consequences associated with unauthorized disclosure of legal investigation
information will pose a threat to human life or result in a loss of major assets. Additionally, when
the disclosure concerns matters of multi-national interest, such as trade enforcement, tariff
agreements, etc., or where foreign nationals might be involved, the confidentiality impact will be
high. Information that reveals the identity and/or location of informants may be of particular
concern.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Given potentially serious to severe legal consequences
of unauthorized disclosure, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for legal
investigation information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of legal investigation information may
depend on whether the information is time-critical. Unauthorized modification or destruction of
information affecting external communications associated with legal investigative organizations
(e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the
agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Where unauthorized modification or destruction of information has an adverse effect on the
granting/executing of a search or wiretap warrant or on the success of the subsequent
prosecution, a serious adverse effect on agency operations may result. This can place the agency
at a significant disadvantage.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Legal investigation mission requirements
may include time-critical information. In such cases, major investigations can be jeopardized by
the unauthorized modification or destruction of legal investigation information. Where the
criminal case under investigation involves major property losses, large-scale financial frauds,
poses a threat to key national assets or human life, the integrity impact level recommended for
legal investigation information is high.

40
     In this case, the term “criminal entity” includes both the criminal and legal representative(s) of the criminal (i.e.,
     council).
