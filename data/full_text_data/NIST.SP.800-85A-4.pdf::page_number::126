NIST SP 800-85A-4                                         PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                   INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

                      5. Global PIN (if supported) is recorded.
                      6. The PIV Card Application is the currently selected application on
                         the card.
                      7. Secure messaging session keys have been established and secure
                         messaging is used in the test scenario.
 Test Scenario        Repeat steps 2-7 of test C.2.2.2 using the '0C' CLA byte
 Expected Result(s)   Commands return the same results as in C.2.2.2.
 Postcondition(s)     PIN remains unchanged.


C.2.2.4        Virtual Contact Interface
 Purpose               Validates that the PIV Card executes the CHANGE REFERENCE
                       DATA command for the following conditions:
                       1. Without the proper security condition (PIV Card Application PIN
                          and (if supported) Global PIN).
                       2. After the security condition is satisfied.
                       3. With an incorrect PIN until the retry counter reaches zero.
                       4. Ensure that length and format of PIN data is enforced.
 Reference(s)          1. SP 800-73-4 Part 2, Section 3.2.2
                       2. AS05.01, AS05.23 through AS05.27, and AS05.24A-R4
 Precondition(s)       1. PIV Application PIN and Global PIN (if supported) reset retry
                          counter values (maximum number of PIN tries allowed) are
                          recorded.
                       2. PIV Card Application PIN is recorded.
                       3. Global PIN (if supported) is recorded.
                       4. The IUT is placed within the reading range of the contactless
                          reader.
                       5. There exists a valid PC/SC connection between the test system
                          and the contactless reader.
                       6. No other contactless card is within the proximity of the reader.
                       7. The PIV Card Application is the currently selected application on
                          the card.
                       8. There exists a valid VCI connection to the card.
                       9. No application is currently connected to the PIV Card
                          Application.
 Test Scenario         1. Repeat test steps from C.2.2.1, with the exception of
                         steps 1 (selecting PIV Card Application) and 3 (PUK
                         tests), using the '0C' CLA byte
                      2. Repeat test 4 from C.2.2.2 using the '0C' CLA byte
 Expected Result(s)   1. The results for steps are the same as the results in C.2.2.1.
                      2. The command returns an error status word.
 Postcondition(s)     The card is blocked.
