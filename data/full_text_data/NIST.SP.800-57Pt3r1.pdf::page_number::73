[RFC 6187] specifies the use of X.509 version 3 certificates to convey public keys for the
digital-signature algorithms. It also formally defines 2048-bit RSA with SHA-256 as a
method for use in SSH. This combination provides 112 bits of security and is allowed. It
is important to note that the hash algorithm used with the digital signature algorithms for
authentication can be different than the hash function HASH in the key exchange and the
key-derivation functions of SSH TLP.

10.2.1.4 Encryption Algorithms
Several encryption algorithms are available for SSH; Federal Government applications
shall use NIST-approved algorithms. The currently specified encryption algorithms and
mode(s) of operation for SSH that are NIST-approved are 3DES-CBC, AES-128-CBC,
AES-192-CBC and AES-256-CBC [RFC 4253], and AEAD_AES_128_GCM and
AEAD_AES_256_GCM [RFC 5647]. 3DES-CBC is mandatory for IETF
implementation.

In the protocol, when either AEAD_AES_128_GCM or AEAD_AES_256_GCM is
selected as the encryption algorithm for protecting an encrypted tunnel (client-to-server
or server-to-client), it is also chosen as the MAC algorithm. A different algorithm or set
of algorithms may be selected for communication in each direction. It should be noted
that when AEAD_AES_128_GCM or AEAD_AES_256_GCM is chosen (for encryption
and MAC generation), the algorithm is executed only once (rather than once for
encryption and another time for integrity protection), because these modes provide both
confidentiality and integrity protections at the same time.

When AEAD_AES_128_GCM or AEAD_AES_256_GCM is used, the SSH packet-
length field is not encrypted, but is processed as additional authenticated (plaintext) data.
See [RFC 5647] for more details on using these algorithms in SSH.

10.2.1.5 Message Authentication Codes (MAC) Algorithms
Several MAC algorithms are available for SSH; Federal Government applications shall
use NIST-approved algorithms. The currently specified MAC algorithms for SSH that are
NIST-approved are HMAC-SHA1 (with MAC tags of 160 bits), HMAC-SHA1-96 (with
MAC tags of 96 bits [RFC 4253]), AEAD_AES_128_GCM and AEAD_AES_256_GCM
[RFC 5647].

As explained in Section 10.2.1.4, AEAD_AES_128_GCM or AEAD_AES_256_GCM
can only be chosen as the MAC algorithm when also chosen as the encryption algorithm.

10.2.1.6 Public Host-Key Verification
After the algorithm negotiation is completed, the TLP authenticates the server to the
client in a key-exchange process [RFC 4253, Sec. 8]. In this key exchange, a Diffie-
Hellman (DH) key exchange is performed, producing two values: a DH value45 K and an
exchange hash value called H. H is the hash value of K and other data [RFC 4253, Sec. 8]
for a complete specification of H). The generated H and K are subsequently used as
inputs to a key-derivation function [RFC 4253, Sec. 7.2] for the specification of this
function) to generate IVs and keys for the selected cryptographic algorithms.

     In the key-agreement schemes in [SP 800-56A], K would be considered to be the shared secret.
