A.1.6 Classified Systems
A system is a national security system if it processes, stores, or communicates classified
information. Executive orders and Acts of Congress have directed that some specific
systems are to be protected at all times by procedures that have been established for
information that is to be kept classified 8 in order to protect national defense or foreign
policy interests. Authority to assign security classifications to information is delegated in
Executive Order 12958 as amended by Executive Order 13292. Any system processing
information that is determined to be classified based upon one or more agency
classification guides is a classified system. Box 6 of the National Security System
Identification Checklist should be marked yes if and only if the system contains or
processes classified information.

A.2 Optional Checklist Material
The six questions included in the Appendix A checklist is only the minimum set of
questions on which a national security designation may be based. Individual departments
and agencies may choose to include additional questions so long as the decision
regarding designation of a system as a national security system is based exclusively on
the definition provided in Section 2.0 of this guideline. Examples of questions that a
department or agency may employ to provide clarification, amplification, and/or
justification follow:

      •    Does this system process, store, or transmit military plans?
      •    Does this system process, store, or transmit information on weapon systems?
      •    Does this system process, store, or transmit information regarding military
           operations?
      •    Does this system process, store, or transmit information on intelligence activities,
           sources or methods?
      •    Does this system involve cryptologic activities related to national security?
      •    Does this system process, store, or transmit information regarding foreign
           relations or foreign activities?
      •    Does this system process, store, or transmit information regarding scientific,
           technological, or economic matters relating to national security, including defense
           against transnational terrorism?
      •    Does this system involve programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or
           facilities?
      •    Does this system process, store, or transmit information on weapons of mass
           destruction?
      •    Does this system process, store, or transmit information on vulnerabilities or
           capabilities of systems, installations, infrastructures, projects, plans, or protection
           services relating to national security, including defense against transnational
           terrorism?
