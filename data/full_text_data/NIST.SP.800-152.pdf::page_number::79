SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


FR:6.104 The CKMS design shall specify the means by which other compromised keys can
be identified when a key is compromised. For example, when a key derivation key is
compromised, how are the derived keys determined?

                           A Federal CKMS shall revoke compromised keys.
PR:6.77

                           A Federal CKMS shall not use a key whose compromise is
PR:6.78
                           known or suspected to apply cryptographic protection.
                           A Federal CKMS shall support reporting and investigating a
PR:6.79
                           key compromise.


                           A Federal CKMS should destroy compromised keys.
PA:6.21

             AC-17 (9)     A Federal CKMS should have the capability of remotely
PA:6.22
              SC-7         deactivating mobile FCKMS devices and destroying sensitive
                           keys and metadata within those devices.
                           A Federal CKMS should replace compromised/revoked keys
PA:6.23
                           with new keys and metadata when continuity of operations is
                           required.
                           A Federal CKMS should not use a key whose compromise is
PA:6.24
                           known or suspected to process cryptographically protected
                           information.

6.8.2 Metadata Compromise
Some metadata may be considered sensitive, while other metadata is not. Metadata
compromise refers only to the compromise of the sensitive metadata. Depending on the
metadata element and how it is used, its compromise could result in the compromise of one
or more keys and the data protected by those keys. If different keys have common sensitive
metadata elements, then the compromise of one sensitive metadata element may compromise
the data protected by each of the keys. Metadata elements that are sensitive to unauthorized
modification should be cryptographically bound to their associated keys so that the integrity
of the metadata can be easily verified. Metadata elements that are sensitive to disclosure
should be physically or cryptographically protected.

FR:6.105 For each key type employed, the CKMS design shall specify which metadata
elements are sensitive to compromise (confidentiality, integrity, or source).

FR:6.106 The CKMS design shall specify the potential security consequences, given the
compromise (confidentiality, integrity or source) of each sensitive metadata element of a key.

FR:6.107 The CKMS design shall specify how each sensitive metadata element compromise
can be remedied.
