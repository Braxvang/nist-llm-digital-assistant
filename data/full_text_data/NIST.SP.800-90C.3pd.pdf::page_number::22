      NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                         Recommendation for RBG Constructions
      September 2022

590   Figure 2 shows an RBG implemented within a [FIPS 140]-validated cryptographic module. The
591   RBG security boundary shall either be the same as the cryptographic module boundary or be
592   completely contained within that boundary. The data input may be a personalization string or
593   additional input (see Section 2.4.1). The data output is status information and possibly random bits
594   or a state handle. Within the RBG security boundary of the figure are an entropy source and a
595   DRBG − each with its own (conceptual) security boundary. An entropy-source security boundary
596   includes a noise source, health tests, and (optionally) a conditioning component. A DRBG security
597   boundary contains the chosen DRBG, memory for the internal state, and health tests. An RBG
598   security boundary contains health tests and may also contain an (optional) external conditioning
599   function. The RBG2 and RBG3 constructions in Sections 5 and 6, respectively, use this model.

602   Note that in the case of the RBG1 construction in Section 4, the security boundary containing the
603   DRBG does not include a randomness source (shown as an entropy source in Figure 2).
604   A cryptographic primitive (e.g., an approved hash function) used by an RBG may be used by
605   other applications within the same cryptographic module. However, these other applications shall
606   not modify or reveal the RBG’s output, intermediate values, or internal state.
