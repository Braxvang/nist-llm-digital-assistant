       Identify Mobile Requirements
In the first stage of this life cycle, the organization’s decision makers define the mission needs
and requirements for mobile devices, inventory the mobile devices already in use, and identify
the mobile deployment model that fits their organization. This is all in an effort to gather
requirements for managing current and future mobile devices to meet mission needs for
functionality, security, and privacy. The participation of both IT-focused and business-focused
decision makers is necessary at this stage to ensure that the needs of the mission will drive the
technology choices in later stages.

5.1.1. Explore Mobile Use Cases
Many organizations find that mobile devices are essential to enabling their staff to meet evolving
mission requirements. Tasks that might have once been accomplished in the office (at a much
slower pace) are now handled “in the field,” often while requiring access to enterprise data or
apps and through interaction with colleagues from partner organizations. This need to meet
challenging and fast-paced mission requirements should be weighed against the need to protect
sensitive data and address privacy concerns, financial costs, and other issues. Developing use
cases specific to an organization’s needs for mobile devices can help to identify and clearly
describe requirements. Common elements of use cases include understanding who users are, why
they need mobile devices, and what apps or device features will be necessary for them to meet
their organizational objectives.
For example, a disaster management organization may send staff members to sites affected by
natural disasters – such as tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes – to provide assessments and
assistance. Mobile devices are essential to reaching back to enterprise data sources and to
enabling the submission of information gathered on site. Staff may also share information with
members of the public; local first responders; representatives of other local, state, and federal
organizations; and staff from various other non-governmental organizations (NGOs). In this use
case example, the strong need for a mobile capability is clear. Backend systems may need to be
restructured to enable appropriate security characteristics to support these interactions, such as
ensuring the availability of transmission towers or similar in the affected site. The characteristics
(e.g., durability will be important for rough worksites) and cost of the selected mobile devices
should be considered carefully to ensure that all staff have the necessary equipment and that
expensive devices are not too fragile for a rough worksite.

5.1.2. Survey Current Inventory
When modern mobile devices were first introduced into enterprises, management platforms were
less mature and had likely not been managed in a centralized manner. These sorts of practices
may have continued over time. Therefore, an inventory of the mobile systems alongside other
information systems within an organization’s network can be valuable when deploying a new
mobile infrastructure. This can be performed by directly asking employees for the mobile
devices they are using and performing network scans to understand the devices on a network.
Together, these two sources of information provide a picture of the devices that are actually
being used and need to be protected and/or upgraded.
