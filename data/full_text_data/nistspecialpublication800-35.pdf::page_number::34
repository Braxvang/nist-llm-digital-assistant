4.3   Phase 3: Solution

Figure 4-4 illustrates Phase 3, Solution, of the IT security services life cycle.




                                          Figure 4-4. Solution Phase

Choosing a service arrangement and service level solution is only one part of this phase. Before
specifying the solution, decision makers will need to develop a detailed business case for each possibility
to be considered.

The business case will provide managers with the cost, benefit, and organizational risk perspective of
each alternative. Comparing the costs, benefits and organizational risks will allow managers to identify a
preferred solution. The implementation plan will provide managers with the means for identifying the
service provider and implementing the service.
