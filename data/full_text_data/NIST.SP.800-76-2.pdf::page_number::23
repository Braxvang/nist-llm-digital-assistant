8.   Determination of the minutia direction can be extracted from each skeleton bifurcation. The three legs of every
     skeleton bifurcation must be examined and the endpoint of each leg determined. Figures 2A through 2C illustrate
     the three methods used for determining the end of a leg. The ending is established according to the event that
     occurs first:
                  o    The 32nd pixel – see Figures 2A and 2B – or
                  o    The end of skeleton leg if greater than 10 pixels (legs shorter are not used) – see Figure 2B – or
                  o    A second bifurcation is encountered before the 32nd pixel – see Figure 2C.
     The angle of the minutiae is determined by constructing three virtual rays originating at the bifurcation point and
     extending to the end of each leg. The smallest of the three angles formed by the rays is bisected to indicate the
     minutiae direction.

     Extensive, refined and complete guidance on minutia detection and estimation appears in INCITS 378:2009 Clause
     6. That standard is the revision of INCITS 378-2004 [MINUSTD]. While PIV still requires [MINUSTD] for off-card
     comparison template formatting, the 2009 standard might be consulted because it gives elaborate information
     on the semantic (placement + selection) aspects associated with this note.
9.   The mandatory value of zero codifies the PIV specification that templates shall not include extended data.
10. Per [MINUSTD, 6.5.1.2] this view number field shall have value 0 for the primary finger and 0 for the secondary
    finger. The combination of view number and finger position uniquely identifies each template.
11. [MINUSTD] does not specify how to report the image sizes in the header when two or more views are included in
    the record and these were derived from images of different sizes. For PIV, the width on Line 20 shall be the
    larger of the widths of the two input images. Similarly the height on Line 21 shall be the larger of the heights of
    the two input images.

4.4.3      Special case for individuals who cannot be fingerprinted
If two fingerprints have never been collected (e.g., because of injury, amputation, or persistent poor quality), or all
fingerprint authentication attempts fail during Section 4.3 card issuance, then the PIV Card shall be populated with
the standardized minutia record of Section 4.4 which
―    has two empty views (i.e., there are zero minutiae, such that Table 6, Line 31 shall be zero),
―    is digitally signed as usual using the properly populated CBEFF structure of Section 9,
―    has fingerprint qualities (Table 6, Line 30) assigned 255 for temporarily unusable, or 254 for permanently
     unusable, fingerprints, and
―    overrides the CBEFF quality values (Table 14, Line 11) with -1 indicating temporarily, and -2 permanently unusable
     fingerprints.
[FIPS] allows iris or face biometrics (see Sections 6 and 7) for some PIV operations for applicants with unavailable or
unusable fingerprints.
