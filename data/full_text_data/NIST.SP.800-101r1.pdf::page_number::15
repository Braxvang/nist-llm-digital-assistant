      Feature phones typically use a closed operating system with no published documentation. A
      number of companies specializing in embedded software also offer real-time operating system
      solutions for manufacturers of mobile devices. Smartphones generally use either a proprietary
      or an open source operating system. Nearly all smartphones use one of the following operating
      systems: Android, BlackBerry OS, iOS, Symbian, WebOS or Windows Phone. Unlike the
      more limited kernels in feature phones, these operating systems are multi-tasking and full-
      featured, designed specifically to match the capabilities of high-end mobile devices. Many
      smartphone operating systems manufacturers offer a Software Development Kit (SDK) (e.g.,
      the Android1 or iOS2 SDKs).

2.2   Memory Considerations

      Mobile devices contain both non-volatile and volatile memory. Volatile memory (i.e., RAM)
      is used for dynamic storage and its contents are lost when power is drained from the mobile
      device. Non-volatile memory is persistent as its contents are not affected by loss of power or
      overwriting data upon reboot. For example, solid-state drives (SSD) that stores persistent data
      on solid-state flash memory.

      Mobile devices typically contain one or two different types of non-volatile flash memory.
      These types are NAND and NOR. NOR flash has faster read times, slower write times than
      NAND and is nearly immune to corruption and bad blocks while allowing random access to
      any memory location. NAND flash offers higher memory storage capacities, is less stable and
      only allows sequential access.
