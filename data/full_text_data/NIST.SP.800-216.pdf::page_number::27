NIST SP 800-216                                                                   Federal Vulnerability

3.2.3. Processing and Resolution of Source Vulnerability Reports
Each VDPO should develop the ability to communicate and coordinate with their FCB member
to resolve vulnerability reports, which requires the development of both technical and
personnel/procedural capabilities. If the FCB member provides technical mechanisms to
streamline this process, the VDPO should use the provided mechanisms. It is also possible to
procure commercial VDP services, particularly for reporting, tracking, and researcher
communications.
If a VDPO chooses to conduct its own vulnerability research and testing, it should forward all
pertinent information to its FCB member for inclusion in an FCB vulnerability report database.
This capability may be used to generate vulnerability reports for internally discovered
vulnerabilities (i.e., reporters within the agency) or for external reports sent directly to the ITSO
closest to the affected system (i.e., reporters that notify an IT system of a vulnerability in that
system). By doing this, agencies can choose to handle vulnerability disclosure duties themselves
for their own systems while keeping their associated FCB member apprised of incoming reports
and leveraging them for vulnerability advisory publications.
VDPOs should implement operational security throughout the process of receiving and
communicating vulnerability reports. Reporting mechanisms and ongoing communications
should be secure and restrict unauthorized access to sensitive, non-public vulnerability
information. The internal operational security should also restrict non-public vulnerability
information and any PII obtained about reporters to staff and organizational units on a need-to-
know basis.

3.2.4. Development of Vulnerability Disclosure Handling Procedures
Each VDPO should develop and maintain internal vulnerability handling procedures for how it
will investigate and remediate vulnerabilities in coordination with external and internal
vulnerability disclosure policies. The internal vulnerability handling procedures should define
who is responsible at each stage of the vulnerability handling process and how they should
handle reports about potential vulnerabilities. It should include the guidance, principles, and
responsibilities for managing potential vulnerabilities in products or services; a list of internal
organizations and roles responsible for handling potential vulnerabilities; safeguards to prevent
the premature disclosure of information about potential vulnerabilities; and a target schedule for
remediation development.
VDPO policies may leverage FCB-provided templates (created to encourage a uniform approach
within multiple agencies). They should, to the extent possible, use the same vulnerability
disclosure terminology, technical severity ratings, technologies, and standards utilized by their
associated FCB member.

3.2.5. Vulnerability Disclosure Program Office Operational Duties
This section provides details on the steps that VDPOs should take to receive, process, and
resolve vulnerability reports. This guidance applies primarily to report handling in the U.S.
Government environment. Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 work together to describe the coordination between
an FCB member and a VDPO in the vulnerability disclosure process.
