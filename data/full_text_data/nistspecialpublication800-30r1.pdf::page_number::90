INFORMING RISK RESPONSE
APPROACHES TO REFINING RISK ASSESSMENT RESULTS




A
          risk assessment may identify a number of risks that have similar scores (e.g., 78, 82, 83)
          or levels (e.g., moderate, high). When too many risks are clustered at or about the same
          value, organizations need a method to refine the presentation of risk assessment results,
prioritizing within sets of risks with similar values, to better inform the risk response component
of the risk management process. 56 Such a method should be associated with the mission/business
requirements of the organization, consistent with the organizational risk tolerance, and maximize
the use of available resources. Prioritization is a key component of risk-based protection and
becomes necessary when requirements cannot be fully satisfied or when resources do not allow
all risks to be mitigated within a reasonable time frame. To facilitate informed risk response
decisions by senior leaders/executives (e.g., why certain risks were or were not mitigated), the
risk assessment results are annotated to enable those decision makers to know or obtain the
answers to the following questions about each risk in a set with similar scores:

Time Frame
In the event the identified risk materialized—
•    How high would the immediate impact be to organizational operations (including mission,
     functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the
     Nation?
•    How high would the future impact be to organizational operations (including mission,
     functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the
     Nation?

The answers to the above questions, together with the risk tolerance of the organization, provide
the basis for a risk prioritization that is based on current and future organizational needs. When
weighing immediate impacts versus future impacts, senior leaders must decide whether a critical
mission/business need today warrants jeopardizing the future capabilities of the organization.
Mission/business owners and mission/business subject matter experts can be consulted to obtain
the most complete and up-to-date information on mission/business impacts. Other subject matter
experts or stakeholder representatives can be consulted to obtain information on immediate versus
future impacts (e.g., consulting the Privacy Office for impacts to individuals).

Total Cumulative Impact
•    What is the expected impact from a single occurrence of the threat?
•    If the risk can materialize more than once, what is the overall expected impact (i.e.,
     cumulative loss) for the time period of concern?

Note that one aspect of the total impact to organizations is the cost of recovery from a loss of
confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

56
   The risk executive (function) provides policy-level guidance on organizational risk tolerance and other factors that
inform and guide the risk-based decisions of authorizing officials. This guidance can also influence the prioritization of
risk responses including for example, mitigation activities.
