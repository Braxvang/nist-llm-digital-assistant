NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

       VA-1.4 Develop the security aspects of the validation strategy.
       Note: The security aspects of the validation strategy address the approach to incorporate
       security considerations into all validation actions, while considering the trade-offs between
       scope, depth, and rigor needed for the desired level of assurance and the given constraints.
       VA-1.5 Identify the security-relevant system constraints that result from the security aspects of
              the validation strategy to be incorporated in the stakeholder protection needs and the
              requirements transformed from those needs.
       Note: These constraints are associated with the clarity and accuracy of the expression of needs
       and requirements to achieve the desired level of assurance with certainty and repeatability.
       VA-1.6 Identify the security aspects for enabling systems or services needed to support
              validation.
       VA-1.7 Identify and plan for enabling systems or services to support the security aspects of
              validation.
       VA-1.8 Obtain or acquire access to the security aspects of enabling systems or services to be
              used to support validation.

VA-2   PERFORM VALIDATION
       VA-2.1 Define the security aspects of the validation procedures, each supporting one or a set of
              validation actions.
       Note: This includes identification of the validation methods or techniques to be employed, the
       qualifications of the individuals conducting the validation, and any specialized equipment that
       may be needed, such as what may be required to emulate environmental adversities.
       VA-2.2 Perform security validation procedures.
       Note 1: Security-focused validation actions from the execution of validation procedures
       contribute to demonstrating that the system is sufficiently trustworthy.
       Note 2: The performance of a security-focused validation action consists of capturing a result
       from the execution of the procedure, comparing the obtained result with the expected result,
       deducing the degree of compliance of the element, and deciding about the acceptability of
       compliance if uncertainty remains.

VA-3   MANAGE RESULTS OF VALIDATION
       VA-3.1 Record the security aspects of validation results and any anomalies encountered.
       Note: The recorded validation results include nonconformance issues, anomalies, or problems
       that are potentially security related. These results inform the analyses to determine causes and
       enable corrective or improvement actions. Corrective actions may affect the security aspects of
       the system architecture definition, design definition, system security requirements and
       associated constraints, the level of assurance that can be obtained, and/or the implementation
       strategy, including its security aspects.
