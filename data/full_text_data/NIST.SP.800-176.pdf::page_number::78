     Meanwhile, the draft guideline is being used as the
basis for an effort with the National Cybersecurity Center of
Excellence (NCCoE) to encourage the adoption of stronger
security technologies in mobile devices. Using draft SP
800-164 as a foundational document, the NCCoE and
CSD developed the Mobile Device Security for Enterprises
building block, which will demonstrate commercially
available technologies that provide protection to both
organization-issued and personally owned mobile platforms.
The NCCoE will invite mobile device, operating system,
and management software vendors, as well as application
developers, to participate in this building block activity and
demonstrate how their technologies could be used together
to meet existing security requirements.
     The CSD also continued its work to protect platform
firmware in FY 2014. Boot firmware, commonly known as
the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS), is a critical firmware
component, due to its unique and privileged position within
modern computing architectures. CSD has been working
with key members of the computer industry on the use of
roots of trust to improve the security of BIOS. In order to
encourage the continued adoption of BIOS protections,
The CSD submitted SP 800-147, BIOS Protection Guidelines,
to ISO for international standardization. CSD will continue
these standards efforts in FY 2015, and conduct research on
protections for other critical platform firmware.
