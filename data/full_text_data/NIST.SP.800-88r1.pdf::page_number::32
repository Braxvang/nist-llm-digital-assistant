5     Summary of Sanitization Methods

Several different methods can be used to sanitize media. Four of the most common are presented
in this section. Users of this guide should categorize the information to be disposed of, assess the
nature of the medium on which it is recorded, assess the risk to confidentiality, and determine the
future plans for the media. Then, using information in Table 5-1, decide on the appropriate
method for sanitization. The selected method should be assessed as to cost, environmental
impact, etc., and a decision should be made that best mitigates the risks to an unauthorized
disclosure of information.

     Method                                                     Description



      Clear     One method to sanitize media is to use software or hardware products to overwrite user-
                addressable storage space on the media with non-sensitive data, using the standard read
                and write commands for the device. This process may include overwriting not only the logical
                storage location of a file(s) (e.g., file allocation table) but also should include all user-
                addressable locations. The security goal of the overwriting process is to replace Target Data
                with non-sensitive data. Overwriting cannot be used for media that are damaged or not
                rewriteable, and may not address all areas of the device where sensitive data may be
                retained. The media type and size may also influence whether overwriting is a suitable
                sanitization method. For example, flash memory-based storage devices may contain spare
                cells and perform wear levelling, making it infeasible for a user to sanitize all previous data
                using this approach because the device may not support directly addressing all areas where
                sensitive data has been stored using the native read and write interface.
                The Clear operation may vary contextually for media other than dedicated storage devices, where
                the device (such as a basic cell phone or a piece of office equipment) only provides the ability to
                return the device to factory state (typically by simply deleting the file pointers) and does not directly
                support the ability to rewrite or apply media-specific techniques to the non-volatile storage contents.
                Where rewriting is not supported, manufacturer resets and procedures that do not include rewriting
                might be the only option to Clear the device and associated media. These still meet the definition
                for Clear as long as the device interface available to the user does not facilitate retrieval of the
                Cleared data.


      Purge     Some methods of purging (which vary by media and must be applied with considerations
                described further throughout this document) include overwrite, block erase, and
                Cryptographic Erase, through the use of dedicated, standardized device sanitize commands
                that apply media-specific techniques to bypass the abstraction inherent in typical read and
                write commands.
                Destructive techniques also render the device Purged when effectively applied to the
                appropriate media type, including incineration, shredding, disintegrating, degaussing, and
                pulverizing. The common benefit across all these approaches is assurance that the data is
                infeasible to recover using state of the art laboratory techniques. However, Bending, Cutting,
                and the use of some emergency procedures (such as using a firearm to shoot a hole through
                a storage device) may only damage the media as portions of the media may remain
                undamaged and therefore accessible using advanced laboratory techniques.
                Degaussing renders a Legacy Magnetic Device Purged when the strength of the degausser is
                carefully matched to the media coercivity. Coercivity may be difficult to determine based only on
                information provided on the label. Therefore, refer to the device manufacturer for coercivity details.
                Degaussing should never be solely relied upon for flash memory-based storage devices or for
                magnetic storage devices that also contain non-volatile non-magnetic storage. Degaussing
