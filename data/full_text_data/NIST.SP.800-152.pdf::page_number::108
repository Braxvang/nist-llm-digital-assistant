SP 800-152                                               A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


                           The functional and security testing performed on a Federal
PF:9.1
                           CKMS could be automated.

9.7   Environmental Testing

CKMS designers often assume a particular environment (e.g., temperature range and
voltage range) in which a proposed CKMS product will operate. The CKMS is then
designed, built and tested for use within that environment. If the products are used in a
different environment, secure operation could be lost. A CKMS being considered for
procurement for Moderate and High impact-level systems should either employ
environmental failure protection mechanisms or pass environmental testing before
becoming operational. Note that at security level 4, [FIPS 140] requires environmental
failure testing of cryptographic modules.

FR:9.8 The CKMS design shall specify the environmental conditions in which the
CKMS is designed to be used.

FR:9.9 The CKMS design shall specify the conditions that are required for its secure
operation.

FR:9.10 The CKMS design shall specify the results of environmental testing that was
performed on the CKMS devices, including the results of all tests stressing the devices
beyond the conditions for which they were designed.

                           For Moderate and High impact-level systems, Federal CKMS
PA:9.6
                           modules should either employ environmental failure
                           protection mechanisms or pass environmental testing before
                           becoming operational.

9.8   Ease-of-Use Testing

An FCKMS should be easy to use, manage, and maintain. In order to evaluate ease-of-
use, a panel of people having different expertise and experience typically creates
evaluation criteria, and selects and monitors user-device-interface ease-of-use evaluation
tests that are performed by a test group of users.

An FCKMS could support a demonstration of correct FCKMS usage, and could be
designed to adapt to a userâ€™s experience and abilities. An FCKMS must automatically
detect incorrect user input, including the length, format and range of the expected input
(see PR:3.2 in Section 3.4.2).

                            Federal CKMS interfaces shall be tested and approved by the
PR:9.14
                            service provider and the service using organization for ease-
                            of-use (including the features designed to detect and/or
                            mitigate incorrect user input) prior to procurement and when
                            any human-to-FCKMS interface changes are made.
