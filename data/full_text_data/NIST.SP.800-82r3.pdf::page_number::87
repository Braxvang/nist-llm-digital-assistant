NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

A defense-in-depth solution to physical security should consider the following attributes:
   •   Protection of physical locations. Classic physical security considerations typically
       include an architecture of layered security measures that create several physical barriers
       around buildings, facilities, rooms, equipment, and other informational assets. Physical
       security controls should be implemented to protect physical locations and may include
       fences, anti-vehicle ditches, earthen mounds, walls, reinforced barricades, gates, door and
       cabinet locks, guards, or other measures.
   •   Physical access control. Equipment cabinets should be locked when not required for
       operation or safety, and wiring should be neat and contained within cabinets or under
       floors. Additionally, consider keeping all computing and networking equipment in
       secured areas. Keys of OT assets, like PLCs and safety systems, should be in the “Run”
       position at all times unless they are being actively programmed.
   •   Access monitoring systems. Access monitoring systems include electronic surveillance
       capabilities, such as still and video cameras, sensors, and identification systems (e.g.,
       badge readers, biometric scanners, electronic keypads). Such devices do not typically
       prevent access to a particular location. Rather, they store and record either the physical
       presence or the lack of physical presence of individuals, vehicles, animals, or other
       physical entities. Adequate lighting should be provided based on the type of access
       monitoring device deployed. These systems can also sometimes alert or initiate action
       upon the detection of unauthorized access.
   •   People and asset tracking. Locating people and vehicles in a facility can be important
       for both safety and security reasons. Asset location technologies can be used to track the
       movements of people and vehicles to ensure that they stay in authorized areas, to identify
       personnel who may need assistance, and to support emergency response.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should consider whether the physical security of remote
            assets is implemented at differing levels and whether those differences
            could create cyber risks. For example, one remote location may utilize
            only a padlock with minimal electronic surveillance to secure access to
            network equipment that, if bypassed, could allow a malicious actor to
            gain access to an OT network segment from the remote location.
            Organizations should also consider whether secondary services, such as
            the communications and power that support physical security devices
            (e.g., cameras, sensors, etc.), require additional redundancy, isolation,
            protection, and monitoring.
