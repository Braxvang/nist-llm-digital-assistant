keys. This could be done either through PKI or the individual entities. Adding a new service is as simple
as adding its key to the PKI.

Signed SAML assertions have the same security shortcomings as any technology that uses public key
cryptography: the private key must not be compromised. The best way to protect against this situation is
to keep keys secured and generate new keys on a regular basis. Once an attacker has compromised an
entity’s private key, that entity can be impersonated. 32

Whether Web services need to trust one another within a single organization or across multiple
organizational boundaries, trust federation frameworks provide support for all of the aforementioned trust
models. Section 3.3.2 discusses the various frameworks available for federation of trust.

3.3.1    Federation of Trust

Trust in distributed computing environments is usually verified using PKI certificates signed by a
certificate authority or by passing custom tokens generated by a TTP, as is done in a Kerberos
environment. Traditionally, these trust mechanisms have worked well within a single organization. Once
information sharing crosses organizational boundaries, entities communicating with one another do not
necessarily have the same source of trust. Before the advent of Web services, information sharing across
organizational boundaries traditionally was handled by using a proxy that bridges the boundary or by
cross-signing certificates.

In a SOA, Web services from multiple organizations should be able trust one another without requiring
extensive restructuring of the trust environment. To this end, trust federation frameworks can be
configured to use an organization’s pre-existing authentication mechanisms. Liberty Alliance provides
both Web application and Web service federation using SAML to perform the trust brokering. WS-
Federation allows different security realms to federate by defining trust brokers, who will validate
security tokens used between Web services using WS-Trust.

The following subsections provide additional information on the trust frameworks identified above. It
must be noted, however, that these frameworks continue to evolve. Thus, the material provided is meant
to offer a current snapshot of the features they offer as of this guide’s date of publication.

3.3.2    Trust Federation Frameworks

The following subsections provide additional details of the Liberty Alliance and WS-Trust frameworks.
These standards provide similar features and functionality using different techniques and have been
designed with different goals in mind. Determining which framework is best for a particular organization
depends greatly on what is deployed and on the organization’s architectural goals.
3.3.2.1 Liberty Alliance

The Liberty Alliance aims to develop a standards-based identity federation framework suitable for
businesses and governments. Liberty Alliance-compliant products can interact with one another within a
federated environment, allowing organizations to federate identities without having to agree on the same
providers.
