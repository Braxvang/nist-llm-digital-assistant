Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The recommended provisional confidentiality impact
level for user fee collection information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. For example,
there may be some circumstances when the unauthorized modification or destruction of user fee
collection information is undertaken as part of a scheme to divert payments, conceal
underpayment of failure to make payment of fees, or otherwise defraud the government. In
addition, the consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of user fee collection
information may depend on the urgency with which the information is needed or the immediacy
with which the information is used. In most cases, it is unlikely that the information will be
needed urgently or acted upon immediately.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of information affecting external communications might have an adverse effect on agency
operations, image and reputation. The integrity impact level assigned may be moderate.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for user
fee collection information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the user fee collection information.
The missions supported by user fee collection information are generally tolerant of delay.
However, any extended period of unavailability would likely be seriously disruptive to the
operations for which fees are collected.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
user fee collection information is moderate.
C.2.5.3 Federal Asset Sales Information Type

Federal Asset Sales encompasses the activities associated with the acquisition, oversight,
tracking, and sale of non-internal assets managed by the Federal Government with a commercial
value and sold to the private sector. The recommended security categorization for the Federal
asset sales information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of the unauthorized disclosure of Federal asset sales
information on the ability of responsible agencies to properly and efficiently acquire, oversee,
track, and sell non-internal assets managed by the Federal Government with a commercial value
and sold to the private sector. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of Federal asset
sales information are generally dependent on the nature and value of the property being disposed.
