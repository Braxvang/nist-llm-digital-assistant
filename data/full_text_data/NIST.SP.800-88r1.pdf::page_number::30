NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                Guidelines for Media Sanitization


    items sanitized) should be verified. The secondary verification provides assurance that the
    primary operation is working as expected.

 4.8 Documentation

Following sanitization, a certificate of media disposition should be completed for each piece of
electronic media that has been sanitized. A certification of media disposition may be a piece of
paper or an electronic record of the action taken. For example, most modern hard drives include
bar codes on the label for values such as model and serial numbers. The person performing the
sanitization might simply enter the details into a tracking application and scan each bar code as
the media is sanitized. Automatic documentation can be important as some systems make
physical access to the media very difficult.

The decision regarding whether to complete a certificate of media disposition and how much
data to record depends on the confidentiality level of the data on the media. For a large number
of devices with data of very low confidentiality, an organization may choose not to complete the
certificate.

When fully completed, the certificate should record at least the following details:

      Manufacturer

      Model

      Serial Number

      Organizationally Assigned Media or Property Number (if applicable)

      Media Type (i.e., magnetic, flash memory, hybrid, etc.)

      Media Source (i.e., user or computer the media came from)

      Pre-Sanitization Confidentiality Categorization (optional)

      Sanitization Description (i.e., Clear, Purge, Destroy)

      Method Used (i.e., degauss, overwrite, block erase, crypto erase, etc.)

      Tool Used (including version)

      Verification Method (i.e., full, quick sampling, etc.)

      Post-Sanitization Confidentiality Categorization (optional)

      Post-Sanitization Destination (if known)

      For Both Sanitization and Verification:

           o Name of Person

                                                 22
