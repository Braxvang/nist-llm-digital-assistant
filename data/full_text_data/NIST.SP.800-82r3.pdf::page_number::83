   OT Cybersecurity Architecture
When designing a security architecture for an OT environment, it is generally recommended to
separate the OT network(s) from the corporate network. The nature of network traffic on these
two network types is different. For example, internet access, email, and remote access are
typically permitted on the corporate network but not allowed on OT networks. There may also be
differences in the degree of rigor associated with corporate and OT environment change control
procedures. Additionally, using the corporate network for OT communication protocols could
expose the OT components to cyber attacks (e.g., DoS, adversary-in-the-middle or other
network-based attacks). Utilizing separate networks allows for greater flexibility to address
security and performance requirements between the two environments.
Practical considerations – such as digital transformation, the cost of OT installation, or
maintaining a homogenous network infrastructure – often mean that a connection is required
between OT and corporate or other IT networks. This connection represents additional risk, and
organizations may want to minimize these connections and consider additional security controls
for them. This section outlines security strategies for organizations to consider when engineering
their OT environments to support cybersecurity objectives.

       Cybersecurity Strategy
The adoption of a cybersecurity strategy can result in a more systematic implementation of risk
decisions into system development and operation. A comprehensive and accepted cybersecurity
strategy can assist an organization with consistently maintaining acceptable risk management
throughout the life cycle of an OT system.
System security is optimized by engineering design that is based on a proactive loss prevention
strategy. Such a strategy includes planned measures that are engineered to address what can
happen rather than what is likely to happen in order to proactively identify and rid the system of
weaknesses and defects that lead to security vulnerabilities, understand the certainty and
uncertainty of adversarial and non-adversarial threats, and put in place the means and methods to
protect against adverse consequences. Proactive systems security engineering also includes
planning for failure regardless of whether the failure results from adversarial or non-adversarial
events and ensuring that the system is resilient to such events.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            When planning a security strategy, organizations may need to consider
            critical infrastructure standards and regulatory requirements. Based on
            guidance from CISA, organizations may find that both IT and OT
            environments fall within the critical infrastructure sectors. These
            standards and requirements are typically designed to protect critical
            cyber assets to support reliability and may carry additional legal
            obligations for the organization.
