   Specify Requirements. The organization must identify its security, privacy, and other
    requirements for cloud services, as a criterion for the selection of a cloud provider.
    Common security requirements include coverage for the following areas [CSA11b,
    Len03]:

          Personnel requirements, including clearances, roles, and responsibilities
          Regulatory requirements
          Service availability
          Problem reporting, review, and resolution
          Information handling and disclosure agreements and procedures
          Physical and logical access controls
          Network access control, connectivity, and filtering
          Data protection
          System configuration and patch management
          Backup and recovery
          Data retention and sanitization
          Security and vulnerability scanning
          Risk management
          Incident reporting, handling, and response
          Continuity of operations
          Resource management
          Certification and accreditation
          Assurance levels
          Independent auditing of services.

    Part of the requirements analysis should narrow the choice among IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS
    service models to a single selection that is appropriate for the agency’s specific needs and
    objectives. The responsibilities of both the organization and the cloud provider vary
    depending on the service model. For example in IaaS, the cloud provider’s responsibility
    typically stops at the hypervisor. Organizations consuming cloud services must
    understand the delineation of responsibilities and how they must tie into the cloud
    provider’s processes to ensure that organizational governance practices are extended over
    this environment, and that mechanisms and tools are provided for managing those aspects
    that fall under the organization’s responsibility.

    Establishing an exit strategy is an important part of the planning process and should be
    factored into the requirements analysis. It also relates to the organization’s contingency
    and continuity planning activities. The exit strategy should cover a normal termination,
    such as that at expiration of the service agreement, and also an unexpected termination,
    such as that due to service provider bankruptcy or poor performance [Gra03]. The ability
    to export all of the organization’s data in a usable format through a secure, reliable, and
    efficient means, and in a timely manner, is a vital aspect of an exit strategy. Other
    aspects include addressing application dependencies on proprietary programming
    interfaces, system calls, and database technologies, as well as the recovery of useful
    metadata that may have accumulated within the cloud environment.
