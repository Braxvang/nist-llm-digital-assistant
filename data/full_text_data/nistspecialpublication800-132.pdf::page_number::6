SP 800-132        Recommendation for Password-Based Key Derivation         December 2010



Conformance testing for implementations of this Recommendation will be conducted
within the framework of the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) and the
Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP). The requirements of this
Recommendation are indicated by the word “shall”. Some of these requirements may be
out-of-scope for CMVP or CAVP validation testing, and thus are the responsibility of
entities using, implementing, installing or configuring applications that incorporate this
Recommendation.

3.1    Definitions

Approved               FIPS-approved and/or NIST-recommended. An algorithm or
                       technique that is 1) specified in a FIPS or NIST Recommendation;
                       or 2) adopted in a FIPS or NIST Recommendation; or 3) specified
                       in a list of NIST-approved security functions.
Authenticated          A function in which plaintext is encrypted into ciphertext, and a
encryption             MAC is generated on the plaintext or ciphertext and, optionally, on
                       associated data that is not encrypted.
Cryptographic          A well-defined computational procedure that takes variable inputs
algorithm              that may include a cryptographic key to provide confidentiality,
                       data integrity, authentication and/or non-repudiation.
Cryptographic key      A binary string that is used as a parameter by a cryptographic
(key)                  algorithm.
Data protection key    A key or a set of keys used to protect or recover data, verify the
                       authenticity or integrity of the protected data or to protect the
                       private key used to generate digital signatures.
Decryption             The process of transforming ciphertext into plaintext using a
                       cryptographic algorithm and key.
Digest size            The output length of a hash function.
Encryption             The process of transforming plaintext into ciphertext using a
                       cryptographic algorithm and key.
Entropy                A measure of the amount of uncertainty in an unknown value.
Iteration count        The number of times that the pseudorandom function is called to
                       generate a block of keying material.
Key                    See cryptographic key.
