                                                                  GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



7.7   Checklist for Using Authentication and Encryption Technologies for Web Servers

           Completed                                            Action
                        Configure Web authentication and encryption technologies
                        For Web resources that require minimal protection and for which there is a small,
                        clearly defined audience, configure address-based authentication
                        For Web resources that require additional protection but for which there is a
                        small, clearly defined audience, configure address-based authentication as a
                        second line of defense
                        For Web resources that require minimal protection but for which there is no
                        clearly defined audience, configure basic or digest authentication (better)
                        For Web resources that require protection from malicious bots, configure basic
                        or digest authentication (better) or implement mitigation techniques discussed in
                        Section 5.2.4
                        For organizations required to comply with FIPS 140-2, ensure the SSL/TLS
                        implementation is FIPS-validated
                        For Web resources that require maximum protection, configure SSL/TLS
                        Configure SSL/TLS
                        Ensure the SSL/TLS implementation is fully patched
                        Use a third-party issued certificate for server authentication (unless all systems
                        using the server are organization-managed, in which case a self-signed
                        certificate could potentially be used instead)
                        For configurations that require a medium level of client authentication, configure
                        server to require username and password via SSL/TLS
                        For configurations that require a high level of client authentication, configure
                        server to require client certificates via SSL/TLS
                        Ensure weak cipher suites are disabled (see Table 7.1 for the recommended
                        usage of Federal cipher suites)
                        Configure file integrity checker to monitor Web server certificate
                        If only SSL/TLS is to be used in the Web server, ensure access via any TCP port
                        other than 443 is disabled
                        If most traffic to the Web server will be via encrypted SSL/TLS, ensure that
                        appropriate logging and detection mechanisms are employed in the Web server
                        (because network monitoring is ineffective against encrypted SSL/TLS sessions)
                        Protect against brute force attacks
                        Use strong authentication if possible
                        Use a delay after failed login attempts
                        Lock out an account after a set number of failed login attempts
                        Enforce a password policy
                        Blacklist IP addresses or domains known to attempt brute force attacks
                        Use log monitoring software to detect brute force attacks
