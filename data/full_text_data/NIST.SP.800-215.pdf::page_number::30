NIST SP 800-215                                                             Guide to a Secure Enterprise

   c. Identity-based microsegmentation: Identity-based microsegmentation policies use
      contextual, application-driven identifiers (e.g., order processing front-end service can
      communicate with inventory back-end service) instead of network parameters (permit
      calls from 192.168.10.x subnet to 10.0.0.31) [24]. The identifiers assigned to services are
      cryptographic identities (as discussed in Section 5.1.1), which they use for mutual
      authentication and authorization during each service request and response.
The advantages of this type of microsegmentation are:
   •   Policies based on service/application identities do not use any infrastructure-related
       variables (e.g., IP addresses, subnets), so these policies are environment-agnostic and
       provide the freedom for the services/applications to be migrated to different
       environments and still maintain the same policies.
   •   Policies being independent of infrastructure enables them to be tested by merely
       exercising the application and observing the outcomes (e.g., trace of the sequence of
       service calls and requests/responses instead of configuring the infrastructure correctly for
       test runs).
   •   With the availability of tools for the declarative specification of policies through “policy
       as code” tools (PaC), microsegmentation policies can be defined and implemented by
       incorporating the code into automated workflows, such as CI/CD pipelines.
   •   Microsegmentation enables granular (fine-grained) access control by providing visibility
       into application call sequences/interdependencies and data flows through host-level
       tracking, thus enabling the enforcement of security policies for application traffic that is
       both north-south and east-west, irrespective of the environment (e.g., corporate data center
       or cloud infrastructure).
The reason that identity-based microsegmentation is to be included under the enterprise network
landscape is that it enables only valid network traffic between the various component services of
the application due to the mutual authentication and authorization of the service identities, thus
enabling the goals of ZTNA to be met [25].

5.2 Software-defined Perimeter (SDP)
One conceptual underpinning for secure network access to IT resources is the software-defined
perimeter (SDP) [31]. In SDP, the separation between networks is not defined by network
address group or VLANs, making it network-agnostic. It is logically and dynamically defined for
each user and each particular request. In other words, for each user request, the subset of IT
resources to which the user has access is dynamically allocated irrespective of the location of the
resource (e.g., corporate data center, branch office, private or public cloud). The salient
principles of SDP include:
   •   The SDP concept involves making all IT resources invisible (e.g., ports, workloads, and
       applications) and making them known and accessible only after the user is authenticated
       and authorized. Only a network connection between the user and the allowed IT
       resources is established, thus following the least privilege principle.
