NIST SP 800-216                                                                   Federal Vulnerability
May 2023                                                                          Disclosure Guidelines

(e.g., between the military and civilian sectors) and represent the current state of existing
vulnerability disclosure coordination capabilities.
A VDPO represents the operational unit that is responsible for information technology (IT)
systems and coordinating with other actors to identify, resolve, and issue advisories on reported
vulnerabilities. Ideally, it is part of an existing vulnerability management program closest to the
affected products and/or services. Agencies may also consider sharing resources between
coordinating offices to alleviate the shortages of necessary vulnerability or technology expertise,
while maintaining VDPO services adjacent to the products and services provided. Large
organizations may choose to utilize a hierarchical structure for each sub-agency or division to
coordinate vulnerability reporting between the FCB and VDPOs. Additionally, an agency may
have many VDPOs since implementation technologies, support levels, and mission requirements
may vary widely. For simplicity, this document will primarily focus on each operational unit
having a single VDPO.
Note that a particular vulnerability may affect a system that supports multiple services across
multiple agencies. When a system serves multiple agencies, the other agencies help determine
how and when to address the vulnerability. The relevant system owner will work with the
impacted agencies to coordinate and appropriately address a vulnerability. The responsibility for
every vulnerability should reside in a particular system covered by a single, lowest-level VDPO.
A “reporter” is an entity who submits a source vulnerability report to a government organization.
The reporter may be an entity outside of the Government, within the Government, or even within
the specific system that has the vulnerability. In any case, when a user of a government system
finds a security-related vulnerability in a deployed government system, the reporting, resolution,
and possible public announcement of that vulnerability should follow these guidelines.
The “public” is anyone who might be impacted by or needs to take action for (e.g., mitigation or
remediation) a specific vulnerability. For some vulnerabilities, the public might be the entire
world (e.g., when an advisory about a vulnerability is placed on a public website like NVD). At
other times, the public might be more constrained, such as the user base of a government system.
The “external coordinator” (EC) refers to any vulnerability disclosure entity not within the FCB
or the VDPO that receives the source vulnerability report. The EC may be a private, academic, or
non-profit vulnerability program with no relation to the Government or be another VDPO within
the Government. It also may be the developer of commercial or open-source software that is used
in or by the government system.
Existing vulnerability disclosure programs within the Federal Government predate these
guidelines, and the publicly available policies and guidelines for these programs appear to be
largely compliant with the ISO/IEC standards. Appendix C provides a partial list of such
programs, as well as links to their websites, policies, and procedures. NIST also maintains a list
of examples and actual policies and procedures on the Vulnerability Disclosure Guidance project
webpage. 1 Although this site is updated as more resources become available, it is not intended to
be an exhaustive list of all government VDPOs and FCB guidance.
