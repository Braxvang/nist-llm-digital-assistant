 An application logs multiple failed login attempts from an unfamiliar remote system.
 An email administrator sees a large number of bounced emails with suspicious content.
 A network administrator notices an unusual deviation from typical network traffic flows.
3.2.3    Sources of Precursors and Indicators

Precursors and indicators are identified using many different sources, with the most common being
computer security software alerts, logs, publicly available information, and people. Table 3-2 lists
common sources of precursors and indicators for each category.

                             Table 3-1. Common Sources of Precursors and Indicators

     Source                                                        Description
                                                           Alerts
 IDPSs              IDPS products identify suspicious events and record pertinent data regarding them, including the
                    date and time the attack was detected, the type of attack, the source and destination IP
                    addresses, and the username (if applicable and known). Most IDPS products use attack
                    signatures to identify malicious activity; the signatures must be kept up to date so that the
                    newest attacks can be detected. IDPS software often produces false positives—alerts that
                    indicate malicious activity is occurring, when in fact there has been none. Analysts should
                    manually validate IDPS alerts either by closely reviewing the recorded supporting data or by
                    getting related data from other sources.31
 SIEMs              Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) products are similar to IDPS products, but
                    they generate alerts based on analysis of log data (see below).
 Antivirus and      Antivirus software detects various forms of malware, generates alerts, and prevents the malware
 antispam           from infecting hosts. Current antivirus products are effective at stopping many instances of
 software           malware if their signatures are kept up to date. Antispam software is used to detect spam and
                    prevent it from reaching users’ mailboxes. Spam may contain malware, phishing attacks, and
                    other malicious content, so alerts from antispam software may indicate attack attempts.
 File integrity     File integrity checking software can detect changes made to important files during incidents. It
 checking           uses a hashing algorithm to obtain a cryptographic checksum for each designated file. If the file
 software           is altered and the checksum is recalculated, an extremely high probability exists that the new
                    checksum will not match the old checksum. By regularly recalculating checksums and comparing
                    them with previous values, changes to files can be detected.
 Third-party        Third parties offer a variety of subscription-based and free monitoring services. An example is
 monitoring         fraud detection services that will notify an organization if its IP addresses, domain names, etc.
 services           are associated with current incident activity involving other organizations. There are also free
                    real-time blacklists with similar information. Another example of a third-party monitoring service
                    is a CSIRC notification list; these lists are often available only to other incident response teams.
                                                            Logs
 Operating          Logs from operating systems, services, and applications (particularly audit-related data) are
 system,            frequently of great value when an incident occurs, such as recording which accounts were
 service and        accessed and what actions were performed. Organizations should require a baseline level of
 application        logging on all systems and a higher baseline level on critical systems. Logs can be used for
 logs               analysis by correlating event information. Depending on the event information, an alert can be
                    generated to indicate an incident. Section 3.2.4 discusses the value of centralized logging.
 Network            Logs from network devices such as firewalls and routers are not typically a primary source of
 device logs        precursors or indicators. Although these devices are usually configured to log blocked
                    connection attempts, they provide little information about the nature of the activity. Still, they can
                    be valuable in identifying network trends and in correlating events detected by other devices.
