Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some of
the background information that supports development of Federal enterprise architecture can
reveal sensitive vulnerabilities, capabilities, or methods of anti-terrorism, law enforcement, or
national security activities. 13 Depending on the information in question, the confidentiality
impact can be moderate, high, or involve national security information (outside the scope of this
guideline). Also, some enterprise architecture plans of some Federal agencies are themselves
national security information. Finally, important financial decisions and planning information
may be included in this category of information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for enterprise architecture information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of information affecting external communications that contain enterprise architecture
information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public
confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited. Public
confidence consequences will be more serious for agencies that have national defense,
intelligence, or information security missions. In such cases, the impact may be at least
moderate.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: In general, the provisional integrity level recommended
for enterprise architecture information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the enterprise architecture information.
The enterprise architecture processes are usually tolerant of delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
enterprise architecture information is low.
C.2.3.4 Strategic Planning Information Type

Strategic Planning entails the determination of long-term goals and the identification of the best
approach for achieving those goals. The recommended provisional security categorization for
strategic planning information is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}




13
   The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has placed some emphasis on protecting repositories of this
information. Among other things it may contain details of the technology and security of an agencyâ€™s network and
include information about critical repositories of highly sensitive and/or even National Security information.
