SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


4.11.7 Changing FCKMS Security Policies
It may be desirable to change an FCKMS Security Policy. Some FCKMSs could have been
designed so that their FCKMS Security Policies can be configured to permit changes. The
domain authority should approve any policy change before it is made. It is the responsibility
of the Domain Authority initiating the change to inform other affected Security Domain
Authorities (e.g., other domains that have been determined to be equivalent or compatible)
when such changes to a security policy are made.

FR:4.26 The CKMS design shall specify if and how its key and/or metadata management
functions may be configured to support differing FCKMS Security Policies and differing
applications.

FR:4.27 The CKMS design shall specify if and how it can support changes in its FCKMS
Security Policy by being reconfigured to accommodate communications with entities in
different security domains.

               SA-11       A Federal CKMS shall perform the following actions before
PR:4.21
                           a changed FCKMS Security Policy is put into effect:
                               a) Document the new FCKMS Security Policy;
                               b) Evaluate its potential security consequences;
                               c) Approve the changes for the modified security
                                  domain;
                               d) Approve and implement the required FCKMS
                                  modifications, validate their correct implementation,
                                  and then test the modified FCKMS;
                               e) Verify the correct and secure operation of the changed
                                  security-domain protection mechanisms; and
                               f) Coordinate with the domain authorities of other
                                  domains with which an equivalence or compatibility
                                  has previously been determined.

                           A Federal CKMS could support the manual configuration
PF:4.9
                           and/or automated negotiation of modified FCKMS Security
                           Policies for interaction with entities in different domains that
                           are approved by all affected Security Domain authorities.
