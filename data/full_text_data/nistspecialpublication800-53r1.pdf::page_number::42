 External Information                An information system or component of an information system
 System (or Component)               that is outside of the accreditation boundary established by the
                                     organization and for which the organization typically has no
                                     direct control over the application of required security controls or
                                     the assessment of security control effectiveness.
 External Information                An information system service that is implemented outside of the
 System Service                      accreditation boundary of the organizational information system
                                     (i.e., a service that is used by, but not a part of, the organizational
                                     information system).
 External Information                A provider of external information system services to an

                                     relationships including but not limited to: joint ventures; business
                                     partnerships; outsourcing arrangements (i.e., through contracts,

 Federal Enterprise                  A business-based framework for governmentwide improvement
 Architecture                        developed by the Office of Management and Budget that is
 [FEA Program Management             intended to facilitate efforts to transform the federal government
 Office]                             to one that is citizen-centered, results-oriented, and market-based.
 Federal Information                 An information system used or operated by an executive agency,
 System                              by a contractor of an executive agency, or by another
 [40 U.S.C., Sec. 11331]             organization on behalf of an executive agency.
 General Support System              An interconnected set of information resources under the same
 [OMB Circular A-130,                direct management control that shares common functionality. It
 Appendix III]                       normally includes hardware, software, information, data,
                                     applications, communications, and people.
 Guard (System)                      A mechanism limiting the exchange of information between
 [CNSS Inst. 4009, Adapted]          information systems or subsystems.
 High-Impact System                  An information system in which at least one security objective
 [FIPS 200]                          (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, or availability) is assigned a FIPS
                                     199 potential impact value of high.
 Incident                            An occurrence that actually or potentially jeopardizes the
 [FIPS 200]                          confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system
                                     or the information the system processes, stores, or transmits or
                                     that constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of
                                     security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies.
 Industrial Control System           An information system used to control industrial processes such
                                     as manufacturing, product handling, production, and distribution.
                                     Industrial control systems include supervisory control and data
                                     acquisition (SCADA) systems used to control geographically
                                     dispersed assets, as well as distributed control systems (DCS) and
                                     smaller control systems using programmable logic controllers to
                                     control localized processes.
