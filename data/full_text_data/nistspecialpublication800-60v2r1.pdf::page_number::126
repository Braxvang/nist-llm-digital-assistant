severe consequences for the agencyâ€™s mission and critical business functions. The integrity
impact level recommended for system and network monitoring information associated with
highly critical information is high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: Potentially serious adverse effects can be expected in most
government organizations resulting from the unauthorized modification or deletion of system
and network monitoring information. Therefore, the provisional integrity impact level
recommended for system and network monitoring information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to system and network monitoring
information. The effects of disruption of access to system and network monitoring information
may temporarily impair or blind agency operations personnel from actual network and security
performance. The level of impact depends on the sensitivity of the information and the criticality
of the system to the agency mission. In most cases [the exception dual-fault situations], disruption
of access to system and network monitoring information can be expected to have only a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Not many system and network
monitoring systems perform functions for which loss of availability can cause significant
degradation in mission capability, place the agency at a significant disadvantage, result in major
damage to assets, or pose a threat to human life.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
system and network monitoring information is low.
C.3.5.9 Information Sharing Information Type

The BRM provided in the FEA Consolidated Reference Model Document, Version 2.3, October
2007 specifies Information Sharing as relating to any method or function, for a given business
area, facilitating: data being received in a usable medium by one or more departments or
agencies as provided by a separate department or agency or other entity; and data being
provided, disseminated or otherwise made available or accessible by one department or agency
for use by one or more separate departments or agencies, or other entities, as appropriate.

Since Information Sharing, as a function, is receiving and disseminating data [other information
types] from business areas already identified, this BRM information type will not require its own
impact assessment. Therefore, agency personnel should identify the information sharing
information type as a pure resource management support activity for the evaluated information
system. With the information sharing information type identified, agency personnel can track
the flow of information to interfacing systems. The recommended security categorization for the
information sharing information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, N/A), (integrity, N/A), (availability, N/A)}
