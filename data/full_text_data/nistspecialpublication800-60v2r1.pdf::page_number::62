Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: The unauthorized modification or
destruction of product outreach information may result in distribution of false and misleading
information. Such events may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency
and may significantly degrade the product marketing mission capability. In such cases, a
moderate integrity impact may exist.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
product outreach information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the product outreach information.
Product outreach processes are generally tolerant of limited delays. In most cases, disruption of
access to product outreach information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on
agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
product outreach information is low.
C.2.6.4 Public Relations Information Type

Public Relations activities involve the efforts to promote an organizations image through the
effective handling of citizen concerns. The recommended security categorization for the public
relations information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of public relations
information on the ability of responsible agencies to promote an organizations image through the
effective handling of citizen concerns. Public relations information itself is usually in the public
domain and poses no confidentiality impact.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Internal correspondence associated
with development of public relations information can contain information, the unauthorized
disclosure of which can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations. This can result in
assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for public relations information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In most cases,
the adverse effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of public relations information on
overall agency mission functions will be limited.
