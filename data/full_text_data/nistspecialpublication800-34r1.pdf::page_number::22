vary from the descriptions below. This guide applies the descriptions and references in sections below to
security and emergency management-related plans. The plans listed are in alphabetical order, and do not
imply any order of importance.

2.2.1   Business Continuity Plan (BCP)

The BCP focuses on sustaining an organization’s mission/business processes during and after a
disruption. An example of a mission/business process may be an organization’s payroll process or
customer service process. A BCP may be written for mission/business processes within a single business
unit or may address the entire organization’s processes. The BCP may also be scoped to address only the
functions deemed to be priorities. A BCP may be used for long-term recovery in conjunction with the
COOP plan, allowing for additional functions to come online as resources or time allow. Because
mission/business processes use information systems (ISs), the business continuity planner must
coordinate with information system owners to ensure that the BCP expectations and IS capabilities are
matched.

2.2.2   Continuity of Operations (COOP) Plan

COOP focuses on restoring an organization’s mission essential functions (MEF) at an alternate site and
performing those functions for up to 30 days before returning to normal operations. Additional functions,
or those at a field office level, may be addressed by a BCP. Minor threats or disruptions that do not
require relocation to an alternate site are typically not addressed in a COOP plan.

Standard elements of a COOP plan include:

       Program plans and procedures                          Continuity communications
       Risk management                                       Vital records management
       Budgeting and acquisition of resources                Human capital
       Essential functions                                   Test, training, and exercise
       Order of succession                                   Devolution
       Delegation of authority                               Reconstitution
       Continuity facilities

COOP plans are mandated for organizations by HSPD-20/NSPD-51, National Continuity Policy and FCD
1, Federal Executive Branch National Continuity Program and Requirements. Federal directives
distinguish COOP plans as a specific type of plan that should not be confused with Information System
Contingency Plans, Disaster Recovery Plans or BCPs. Nongovernment organizations typically use BCPs
rather than COOP plans to address mission/business processes.
