NIST SP 800-125A REV. 1                                                      SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
                                                                         SERVER-BASED HYPERVISOR PLATFORMS

2.2.5   Potential Threats to HY-BF5

The tasks under this function relate to the overall administration of a hypervisor host (i.e., virtualized host)
and the hypervisor software and are usually performed through user-friendly web interfaces or network-facing
virtual consoles. Threats to the secure execution of these tasks are common in any remote administration and
are therefore not addressed in this document. However, the core requirement in a data center with virtualized
hosts is to have a uniform configuration for hypervisors based on different criteria such as sensitivity of
applications based on the set of hosted VMs, line of business or client in cloud service environments, etc.
Thus, the security recommendations include a centralized management of hypervisor configuration (HY-SR-
19) and a dedicated network segment for management traffic (HY-SR-20).

Some conventional security fixes may not be practical in the case of hosts hosting a hypervisor. For example,
in the case of a network attack on a physical server that is not virtualized, merely turning off the offending port
is a solution to preventing the server from spamming the network with a bot attack. However, such a solution
is not practical in the case of a hypervisor host since the same port in the physical network interface card of
the hypervisor host could be shared by several running VMs. Instead, a specialized security fix, such as
disabling the virtual NICs of VMs that use those ports, is needed.
