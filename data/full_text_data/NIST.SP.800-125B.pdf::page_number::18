NIST SP 800-125B                                                SECURE VIRTUAL NETWORK CONFIGURATION
                                                                                   FOR VM PROTECTION


VM-NS-R1: In environments using virtual switches for network segmentation, it is strongly
recommended that distributed virtual switches are used instead of standalone virtual switches for the
following reasons: (a) to ensure consistency of configuration across virtualized hosts and reduce chances
of configuration errors, and (b) to eliminate constraints on VM migration, since a distributed virtual
switch (defined for a particular sensitivity level) by definition spans multiple virtualized hosts.

VM-NS-R2: Isolation of the hypervisor’s management network using virtual switches needs special
configuration. In addition to dedicated virtual switches, the management traffic pathway should have
separate pNICs and separate physical network connections (besides the traffic itself being encrypted).
Also, it is preferable that the dedicated virtual switch is a standalone virtual switch (so that it can be
configured at the virtualized host level) instead of a distributed virtual switch. This is due to the close
dependency between distributed virtual switches and the centralized virtualization management servers.
Distributed virtual switches can only be configured using a virtualization management server (requiring
high availability for these servers), and in some situations bringing up a virtualization management server
may require distributed virtual switch modification.

VM-NS-R3: In all VLAN deployments, the switch (physical switch connecting to virtualized host) port
configuration should be VLAN aware – i.e., its configuration should reflect the VLAN profile of the
connected virtualized host.

VM-NS-R4: Large data center networks with hundreds of virtualized hosts and thousands of VMs and
requiring many segments should deploy overlay-based virtual networking because of scalability (Large
Namespace) and virtual/physical network independence. However, it is highly advisable that the overall
traffic generated by overlay-based network segmentation technique (e.g., VXLAN network traffic) is
isolated on the physical network using a technique such as VLAN in order to maintain segmentation
guarantees.

VM-NS-R5: Large overlay-based virtual networking deployments should always include either
centralized or federated SDN controllers using standard protocols for configuration of overlay modules in
various hypervisor platforms.
