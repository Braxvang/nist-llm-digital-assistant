harm Any adverse effects that would be experienced by an individual (i.e., that may be
    socially, physically, or fnancially damaging) or an organization if the confdentiality
    of PII were breached.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) A federal statute
     that called on the federal Department of Health and Human Services to establish reg-
     ulatory standards to protect the privacy and security of individually identifable health
     information. See https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/index.html.
HIPAA Privacy Rule Establishes national standards to protect individuals’ medical records
    and other personal health information and applies to health plans, health care clear-
    inghouses, and those health care providers that conduct certain health care trans-
    actions electronically. (HIPAA Privacy Rule, 45 CFR 160, 162, 164). See https:
    //www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html.
identifcation The process of using claimed or observed attributes of an entity to single
      out the entity among other entities in a set of identities. (ISO/TS 25237:2008)
identifer Set of attributes in a dataset that enables unique identifcation of a data principal
      within a specifc operational context. (ISO/TS 20889:2018)
identifying information information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individ-
      ual’s identity, either alone or when combined with other information that is linked or
      linkable to a specifc individual. (OMB M-17-12)
imputation A procedure for entering a value for a specifc data item where the response is
     missing or unusable. (OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms)
inference Refers to the ability to deduce the identity of a person associated with a set of
      data through “clues” contained in that information. This analysis permits determi-
      nation of the individual’s identity based on a combination of facts associated with
      that person even though specifc identifers have been removed, like name and social
      security number. (ASTM E1869-04)[17]
information Knowledge concerning objects, such as facts, events, things, processes, or
     ideas, including concepts, that within a certain context has a particular meaning.
     (ISO 8000-2:2012(E))
k-anonymity A technique “to release person-specifc data such that the ability to link to
     other information using the quasi-identifer is limited” [151]. The k-anonymity tech-
     nique achieves this through suppression of identifers and output perturbation, al-
     though recent work has shown that the k-anonymity mechanism can be reversed in
     some instances [32].
l-diversity A refnement to the k-anonymity approach that assures that groups of records
      specifed by the same identifers have suffcient diversity to prevent inferential dis-
      closure. [98]
