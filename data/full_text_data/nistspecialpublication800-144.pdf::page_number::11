1.        Introduction
Interest in cloud computing has grown rapidly in recent years due to the advantages of greater
flexibility and availability in obtaining computing resources at lower cost. Security and privacy,
however, are a concern for agencies and organizations considering transitioning applications and
data to public cloud computing environments, and form the impetus behind this document.

1.1       Authority
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in
furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management
Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements,
for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; but such
standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent
with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section
8b(3), “Securing Agency Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of
Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by federal agencies. It may be used by
nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though
attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made
mandatory and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory
authority, nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing
authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.

1.2       Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of public cloud computing and the
security and privacy challenges involved. The document discusses the threats, technology risks,
and safeguards for public cloud environments, and provides the insight needed to make informed
information technology decisions on their treatment. The document does not prescribe or
recommend any specific cloud computing service, service arrangement, service agreement,
service provider, or deployment model. Each organization must perform its own analysis of its
needs, and assess, select, engage, and oversee the public cloud services that can best fulfill those
needs.

1.3       Audience
The intended audience for this document includes the following categories of individuals:

          System managers, executives, and information officers making decisions about cloud
           computing initiatives
