Each AP and STA on a WLAN can be identified by its media access control (MAC) address, which is a
unique 48-bit value that is assigned to a wireless network interface card. Part of the MAC address can be
used to identify the card’s vendor; the rest of the address acts as a serial number from the vendor. Ideally,
MAC addresses could be used to uniquely identify every wireless device; however, it is relatively trivial
to spoof a MAC address.

Nearly all organization WLANs use infrastructure mode. Each AP in a WLAN has a name assigned to it
called a service set identifier (SSID). The SSID allows STAs to distinguish one WLAN from another.
SSIDs are broadcast in plaintext by APs, so any listening wireless device can easily learn the SSID for
each WLAN in its range. 29 Organizations may have no WLANs, one WLAN, or multiple WLANs. Also,
many organizations have facilities that are within range of other organizations’ WLANs.

5.1.3     Threats against WLANs

Although wireless and wired networks face the same general types of threats, the relative risk of some
threats varies significantly. For example, wireless attacks typically require the attacker or a device placed
by the attacker to be within close physical proximity to the wireless network; many attacks on wired
networks can be performed remotely from any location. However, many WLANs are configured so that
they do not require any authentication or require only weak forms of authentication; this makes it much
easier for local attackers to perform several types of attacks, such as a man-in-the-middle attack.

Most WLAN threats involve an attacker with access to the radio link between a STA and an AP (or
between two STAs, in ad hoc mode). Many attacks rely on an attacker’s ability to intercept network
communications or inject additional messages into them. This highlights the most significant difference
between protecting wireless and wired LANs: the relative ease of accessing and altering network
communications. In a wired LAN, an attacker would have to gain physical access to the LAN or remotely
compromise systems on the LAN; in a wireless LAN, an attacker simply needs to be within range of the
WLAN infrastructure. 30

5.2     Components and Architecture

This section describes the major components of typical wireless IDPS solutions and illustrates the most
common network architectures for these components. It also provides recommendations for the
placement of certain components.

5.2.1     Typical Components

The typical components in a wireless IDPS are the same as a network-based IDPS: consoles, database
servers (optional), management servers, and sensors. All of the components except sensors have
essentially the same functionality for both types of IDPSs. Wireless sensors perform the same basic role
as network-based IDPS sensors, but they function very differently because of the complexities of
monitoring wireless communications.

Unlike a network-based IDPS, which can see all packets on the networks it monitors, a wireless IDPS
works by sampling traffic. There are two frequency bands to monitor (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz), and each

      Two WLANs within range of each other could have the same SSID. In such a case, the WLANs could be distinguished
      through the MAC addresses of their APs.
