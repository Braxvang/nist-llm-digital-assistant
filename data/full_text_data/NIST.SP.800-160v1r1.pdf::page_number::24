Figure 2 is a general hierarchical model for the representation of a system. Not all systems, such
as networks, are hierarchical in nature. Non-hierarchical systems have models that can more
accurately reflect the relationships of their constituent elements. A system element may itself be
considered a system (i.e., comprised of other system elements). Realizing a system of interest
involves recursively resolving its structure to the point where understandable and manageable
system elements can be implemented (i.e., developed, bought, or reused) and subsequently
integrating those elements into the system.




                             Fig. 2. Model for a System and its Elements

A system of systems is a system whose interacting system elements are themselves systems. It
provides a unique capability that the constituent systems cannot provide on their own. A system
of systems may include inter-system infrastructure, facilities, and processes necessary to enable
the constituent systems to integrate or interoperate [10].

2.1.2. Interfacing, Enabling, and Interoperating Systems
Interfacing systems are systems that interact with the system of interest. Interfacing systems have
an interface for exchanging data, energy, or other resources with the system of interest. An
interfacing system exchanges resources with the system of interest during one or more system
life cycle stages, such as a system that interfaces for maintenance purposes or a system used to
develop the system of interest. The relationships with interfacing systems can be either bi-
directional or one way. Interfacing systems have two specific subsets: enabling systems and
interoperating systems.
â€¢   Enabling systems provide the essential services required to create and sustain the system of
    interest. Examples of enabling systems include software development environments,
    production systems, training systems, and maintenance systems.
