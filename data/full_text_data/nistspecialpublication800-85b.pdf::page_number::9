Special Publication 800-85B                                                  PIV Data Model Testing Specification




1.        Introduction


1.1       Authority
This document has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in
furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act
(FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This recommendation is consistent with the
requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3),
Securing Agency Information Systems, as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections.
Supplemental information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This recommendation has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by non-
governmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright. Nothing in this
document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and binding on
Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should this
recommendation be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of
Commerce, Director of OMB, or any other Federal official.


1.2       Purpose and Scope
The Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS201) establishes a system for verifying an
individual employee or contractorâ€™s identity in a reliable, secure, and interoperable manner across the
Federal government. Credentials are issued to individuals whose true identity has been verified and
whose need for the credential has been established and authorized by proper authorities. FIPS201 also
describes a variety of authentication mechanisms, including the use of cryptographic mechanisms and
biometric data belonging to cardholders.

In order to build the necessary Personal Identity Verification (PIV) infrastructure to support common
unified processes and systems for government-wide use, there must be a robust testing framework to
provide assurance that a particular component or system is compliant with FIPS201 and companion
specifications. This test guidance document specifies the derived test requirements, detailed test
assertions, and conformance tests for testing the data elements of the PIV system as per specifications
laid out in FIPS201, SP80073, SP80076, and SP80078.

This document does not provide conformance tests for any other software used in the PIV system such
as the back-end access control software, card issuance software, and specialized service provider
software. Specifically, this document does not provide test requirements for the PIV card interface,
FIPS 140-2 validation, key generation and certificate binding, cryptographic algorithms, biometric
enrollment and verification processes1, performance of biometric products, and non-PIV aspects of
external biometric standards and profiles.

    Testing of biometric processing performance using measures such as False Accept Rate (FAR) is described in Section 7 of SP80076.
