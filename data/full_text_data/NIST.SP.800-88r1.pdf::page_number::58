NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                        Guidelines for Media Sanitization


      2. Key Generation: Identify whether a Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG), such
         as one of those listed in SP 800-90, 28 was used, and whether it was validated.

      3. Media Encryption: Identify the algorithm, key strength, mode of operation, and any
         applicable validation(s).

      4. Key Level and Wrapping: Identify if the MEK (either wrapped with another value or
         not wrapped) is directly sanitized, or if a key that wraps the MEK (a key encryption key,
         or KEK) is sanitized. A description of the wrapping techniques only applies where a
         KEK (and not the MEK) is sanitized. Wrapping details, when provided, should include
         the algorithm used, strength, and (if applicable) mode of operation.

      5. Data Areas Addressed: Describe which areas are encrypted and which areas are not
         encrypted. For any unencrypted areas, describe how sanitization is performed.

      6. Key Life Cycle Management: The key(s) on a device may have multiple wrapping
         activities (wrapping, unwrapping, and rewrapping) throughout the device’s lifecycle.
         Identify how the key(s) being sanitized are handled during wrapping activities that are
         not directly part of the Cryptographic Erase operation. For example, a user may have
         received an SED that was always encrypting, and simply turned on the authentication
         interface. Identify how the previous instance of the MEK was sanitized when it was
         wrapped with the user’s authentication credentials.

      7. Key Sanitization Technique: Describe the media-dependent sanitization method for the
         key being sanitized. Some examples might include one or more inverted overwrite passes
         if the media is magnetic, a block erase for an SSD, or other media-specific techniques for
         other types of media.

      8. Key Escrow or Backup: Identify whether the device supports key escrow or backup.
         Identify whether the device supports discovery of whether any key(s) at or below the
         level of the key escrowed has/have ever been escrowed from or injected into the device.If
         the MEK is directly sanitized and only a KEK can be escrowed, clearly identify that fact.

      9. Error Condition Handling: Identify how the device handles error conditions that
         prevent the Cryptographic Erase operation from fully completing. For example, if the
         location where the key was stored cannot be sanitized, does the Cryptographic Erase
         operation report success or failure to the user?

      10. Interface Clarity: Identify which interface commands support the features described in
          the statement. If the device supports the use of multiple MEKs, identify whether all
          MEKs are changed using the interface commands available and any additional commands
          or actions necessary to ensure all MEKs are changed. Note that under certain conditions,
          not all MEKs have to be cleared (e.g., partial sanitization of target data).
