NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                             Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                    Generation Using Deterministic RBGs




                         Figure 4: Distributed DRBG Mechanism Functions

When DRBG mechanism functions are distributed, a physically or cryptographically secure
channel shall be used to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the internal state or parts of
the internal state that are transferred between the distributed DRBG mechanism sub-boundaries.
The security provided by the secure channel shall be consistent with the security required by the
consuming application. See Section 4 for a more complete definition of a secure channel.
For distributed DRBGs, each sub-boundary is the same as or is fully contained within a
cryptographic module boundary.

8.6 Seeds

When a DRBG is used to generate pseudorandom bits, a seed shall be acquired prior to the
generation of output bits by the DRBG. The seed is used to instantiate the DRBG and determine
the initial internal state that is used when calling the DRBG to obtain the first output bits.
Reseeding is a means of restoring the secrecy of the output of the DRBG if a seed or the internal
state becomes known. Periodic reseeding is a good way of addressing the threat of either the
DRBG seed, entropy input or working state being compromised over time. In some
implementations (e.g., smartcards), an adequate reseeding process may not be possible. In these
cases, the best policy might be to replace the DRBG, obtaining a new seed in the process (e.g.,
obtain a new smart card).
The seed and its use by a DRBG mechanism shall be generated and handled as specified in the
following subsections.
