      NIST SP 800-92r1 ipd                                                  Cybersecurity Log Management
      October 2023                                                                         Planning Guide



157   Executive Summary
158   A log is a record of the events that occur within an organization’s computing assets, including
159   physical and virtual platforms, networks, services, and cloud environments. Log management is
160   the process for generating, transmitting, storing, accessing, and disposing of log data. It
161   facilitates log usage and analysis for many purposes, including identifying and investigating
162   cybersecurity incidents, finding operational issues, and ensuring that records are stored for the
163   required period of time. Logging and log management practices are part of many cybersecurity
164   and privacy-related laws and regulations. They are also an important part of numerous standards,
165   guidance, and other sets of recommendations for every sector.
166   The purpose of this document is to help all organizations improve their log management so that
167   they have the log data they need. This document’s scope is organization-wide cybersecurity log
168   management planning; all other aspects of logging and log management are out of scope. The
169   document defines a playbook for cybersecurity log management planning with actionable steps
170   that organizations can take for planning improvements to their log management practices. While
171   the plays in the playbook are not comprehensive, they are noteworthy and generally beneficial to
172   organizations. The plays intentionally avoid any recommendations on the details of log
173   management. Log management needs are incredibly variable from one organization to another
174   and frequently change.
175   This playbook can help organizations identify and prioritize their needs and determine how to
176   best meet those needs. There is no “correct” way for an organization to use the playbook. An
177   organization may choose to use it as the start of its own new playbook for log management
178   planning, integrate it with an existing log management playbook, or use its information as
179   reference material when considering its plans, policies, and processes.
