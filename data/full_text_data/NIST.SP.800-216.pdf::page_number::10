May 2023                                                                       Disclosure Guidelines



Executive Summary
This document provides a guideline for managing vulnerability disclosure for information
systems within the Federal Government. The document follows the IoT Cybersecurity
Improvement Act of 2020, Public Law 116-207, Section 5 [CYB_IMPR_ACT], which directs
NIST to provide guidelines:
       (1) for the reporting, coordinating, publishing, and receiving information about –
               a. a security vulnerability relating to information systems owned or controlled by
                   an agency (including Internet of Things devices owned or controlled by an
                   agency); and
               b. the resolution of such security vulnerability; and
       (2) for a contractor providing to an agency an information system (including an Internet
           of Things device) and any subcontractor thereof at any tier providing such
           information system to such contractor, on –
               a. receiving information about a potential security vulnerability relating to the
                   information system; and
               b. disseminating information about the resolution of a security vulnerability
                   relating to the information system.

The guidelines published under subsection (a) shall –
       (1) to the maximum extent practicable, be aligned with industry best practices and
           Standards 29147 and 30111 of the International Standards Organization (or any
           successor standard) or any other appropriate, relevant, and widely-used standard;
       (2) incorporate guidelines on –
               a. receiving information about a potential security vulnerability relating to an
                   information system owned or controlled by an agency (including an Internet
                   of Things device); and
               b. disseminating information about the resolution of a security vulnerability
                   relating to an information system owned or controlled by an agency (including
                   an Internet of Things device); and
       (3) be consistent with the policies and procedures produced under section 2009(m) of the
           Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 659(m)).

This document defines the Federal Coordination Body (FCB) as the primary interface for
vulnerability disclosure reporting and oversight. It also defines Vulnerability Disclosure Program
Offices (VDPOs), which should be part of the information technology security offices (ITSOs)
closest to the products and services provided. The FCB and VDPOs work together to address
vulnerability disclosure in the Federal Government.
