file system partition). Level 3, Hex Dumping/JTAG Extraction methods, entail performing a
“physical acquisition” of mobile device memory in situ and require advanced training. Level 4
Chip-Off methods involve the physical removal of memory from a mobile device to extract
data, requiring extensive training in electronic engineering and file system forensics. Level 5,
Micro Read methods involve the use of a high-powered microscope to view the physical state
of gates. Level 5 methods are the most invasive, sophisticated, technical, expensive, and time
consuming of all the methodologies.

There are pros and cons to performing extraction types at each layer. For example, hex
dumping allows deleted objects and any data remnants present to be examined (e.g., in
unallocated memory or file system space), which otherwise would be inaccessible through the
use of logical acquisition methods. However, the extracted device images require parsing,
decryption and decoding. Logical acquisition methods, though more limited than Hex
Dumping/JTAG methods, have the advantage in that the system data structures are at a higher
level of abstraction and are normally easier for a tool to extract and render. These differences
are due to the underlying distinction between memory as seen by a process via the operating
system facilities (i.e., a logical view), versus memory as seen in raw form by the processor or
another hardware component (i.e., a physical view). Based upon a wide variety of
circumstances (e.g., type of data needed, time available, urgency, available tools, etc.), an
examiner may select a specific level to begin their examination. It is important to note that
once a level is used, alternate levels may not be possible. For example, after performing chip-
off (level 4) lower level tools may not be physically possible. Forensic examiners should be
aware of such issues and perform the appropriate level of extraction commensurate with their
training and experience. With each methodology, data may be permanently destroyed or
modified if a given tool or procedure is not proper utilized. The risk of alteration and
destruction increases in tandem with the levels. Thus, proper training and mentoring is critical
in obtaining the highest success rate for data extraction and analysis of the data contained
within mobile devices.
