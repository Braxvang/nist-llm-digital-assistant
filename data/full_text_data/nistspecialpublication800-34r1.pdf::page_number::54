                                                 CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



Procedures should be assigned to the appropriate recovery team and typically address the following
actions:

       Obtaining authorization to access damaged facilities and/or geographic area;
       Notifying internal and external business partners associated with the system;
       Obtaining necessary office supplies and work space;
       Obtaining and installing necessary hardware components;
       Obtaining and loading backup media;
       Restoring critical operating system and application software;
       Restoring system data to a known state;
       Testing system functionality including security controls;
       Connecting system to network or other external systems; and
       Operating alternate equipment successfully.

Recovery procedures should be written in a straightforward, step-by-step style. To prevent difficulty or
confusion in an emergency, no procedural steps should be assumed or omitted. A checklist format is
useful for documenting the sequential recovery procedures and for troubleshooting problems if the system
cannot be recovered properly. Figure 4-3 provides a partial example of a procedural checklist for a LAN
Recovery Team.


   SAMPLE Recovery Process for the LAN Recovery Team:
   These procedures are used for recovering a file from backup tapes. The LAN Recovery

   Team is responsible for reloading all critical files necessary to continue production.

         1. Identify file and date from which file is to be recovered.
         2. Identify tape number using tape log book.
         3. If tape is not in tape library, request tape from recovery facility; fill out with
              appropriate authorizing signature.
         4. When tape is received, log date and time.
         5. Place tape into drive and begin recovery process.
         6. When file is recovered, notify LAN Recovery Team Leader.

4.3.3   Recovery Escalation and Notification

As identified as part of the BIA, system components, infrastructure, and associated facilities are critical
components supporting daily mission/business processes. The systems, applications, and infrastructure
that connect users to these are subject to events causing service interruptions and outages. Including an
escalation and notification component within the Recovery Phase helps to ensure that overall, a
repeatable, structured, consistent, and measurable recovery process is followed.
