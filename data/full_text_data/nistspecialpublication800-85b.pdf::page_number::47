Special Publication 800-85B                                PIV Data Model Testing Specification


AS07.04.10: The piv-interim extension (OID = 2.16.840.1.101.3.6.9.1) shall be present
contain an interim_indicator field which is populated with a Boolean value. This extension
is not critical.
VE07.04.10.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the use of this extension as part
of the card authentication certificate profile.
TE07.04.10.01: The tester shall validate that the piv-interim extension is present in the card
authentication certificate issued by the vendor.

7.4.2   Key Pair and Certificate Conformance


AS07.04.11: The size of the public key for card authentication shall be determined by the
expiration of the certificate in accordance with Table 3-1 of SP 800-78.
VE07.04.11.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the allowable public key size to
be used while generating card authentication keys.
TE07.04.11.01: The tester shall validate that the public key size is in accordance with Table 3-1
of SP80078.

AS07.04.12: The public key present in the card authentication certificate correspond to the
card authentication private key.
No requirement for vendor.
TE07.04.12.01: The tester shall validate that the public key present in the card authentication
certificate is part of the key pair corresponding to the private key on the PIV card.

AS07.04.13: The FASC-N in the subjectAltName field in the card authentication certificate
is the same as the FASC-N present in the CHUID.
No requirement for vendor.
TE07.04.13.01: The tester shall validate that the FASC-N in the subjectAltName field in the
card authentication certificate is the same as the FASC-N present in the CHUID in the PIV card.

AS07.04.14: If the public key algorithm is RSA, the exponent shall be greater than or equal
to 65,537.
VE07.04.14.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the size of the exponent permitted
while generating an RSA key pair for card authentication.
TE07.04.14.01: The tester shall validate that the RSA public key exponent size is greater than or
equal to 65,537.
