CHAPTER 13                                                                         Incident Response


         handling priority process should include a description of how the incident
         response team should react under various circumstances, as well as a service-
         level agreement (SLA) that documents appropriate actions and maximum
         response times. This prioritization should facilitate faster and more consistent
         decision making.

13.1.2 Preparing to Collect Incident Data
    Organizations should be prepared to collect a set of objective and subjective data
for each incident. Over time, the incident data collected by the organization can be
used for many ends. For example, data on the total number of hours the incident
response team has dedicated to incident response activities and its cost over a
particular period of time, may be used to justify additional funding of the incident
response team. A study of incident characteristics may reveal systemic security
weaknesses and threats, changes in incident trends, or other data that can be used
in support of the risk assessment process. Another good use of the data is
measuring the success of the incident response team. If incident data is collected
and stored properly, it should provide several measures of the success (or at least
the activities) of the incident response team. Furthermore, organizations that are
required to report incident information will need to collect the necessary data to
meet their requirements (e.g., FISMA reporting of annual incident statistics). 81
    In the process of preparing to collect incident data, organizations should focus on
collecting data that is actionable, rather than collecting data simply because it is
available. Absolute numbers are not informative—understanding how they represent
threats to and vulnerabilities of the business processes of the organization is what
matters. Organizations should decide what incident data to collect based on
reporting requirements and on the expected return on investment from the data
(e.g., identifying a new threat and mitigating the related vulnerabilities before they
can be exploited).

13.1.3 Preventing Incidents
    Preventing problems is normally less costly and more effective than reacting to
them after they occur. Thus, incident prevention is an important complement to an
incident response capability. If security controls are insufficient, high volumes of
incidents may occur, overwhelming the resources and capacity for response, which
would result in delayed or incomplete recovery, possibly more extensive damage,
and longer periods of service unavailability. Incident handling can be performed
more effectively if organizations complement their incident response capability with
adequate resources to actively maintain the security of networks, systems, and
applications. This process is intended to reduce the frequency of incidents, thereby
allowing the incident response team to focus on handling serious incidents.
Examples of practices that help to prevent incidents are as follows:
       • Having a patch management program to assist system administrators in
         identifying, acquiring, testing, and deploying patches that eliminate known
         vulnerabilities in systems and applications;
       • Hardening all hosts appropriately to eliminate vulnerabilities and configuration
         weaknesses;
       • Configuring the network perimeter to deny all activity that is not expressly
         permitted;
