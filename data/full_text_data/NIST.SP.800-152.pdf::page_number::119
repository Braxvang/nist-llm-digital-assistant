SP 800-152                                                 A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


FR:10.5 The CKMS design shall specify all techniques provided by the CKMS to verify
the correctness of the system software.

FR:10.6 The CKMS design shall specify all techniques provided by the CKMS to detect
alterations or garbles to the software once it is loaded into memory.

FR:10.7 The CKMS design shall specify the strategy for backup and recovery from a
major software failure.

                SA-4        A Federal CKMS shall use software that has passed pre-
PR:10.19
                            operational self-tests that verify its integrity before becoming
                            operational.
                            A Federal CKMS shall perform backups of its software only
PR:10.20
                            after the current software passes its integrity self-tests.
                            A Federal CKMS shall perform software and critical-data
PR:10.21
                            backups daily or in accordance with a Service-Level
                            Agreement.
                            A Federal CKMS shall reload its software from the latest
PR:10.22
                            FCKMS secure-state backup or the original code itself after a
                            software failure is detected or suspected.
                            A Federal CKMS shall perform full secure-state backups at
PR:10.23
                            least weekly or in accordance with a Service Level
                            Agreement.
                            A Federal CKMS shall ensure that all software errors are
PR:10.24
                            analyzed and repaired before the system is returned to a fully
                            operational state.

                            A Federal CKMS could automatically verify correct
PF:10.6
                            operation of the FCKMS software and hardware by randomly
                            performing supported key-management functions
                            simultaneously in the primary and backup facilities and
                            verifying that the results are identical.

10.6 Cryptographic Module Failure

Cryptographic modules should have built-in tests that are adequate to detect hardware,
software, or firmware failures. [FIPS-140]-validated modules perform pre-operational,
conditional, and periodic self-tests. If a failure is detected, the module enters an error
state that outputs an error indicator and determines if the error is a non-recoverable type
(i.e. one that requires service, repair, or replacement) or a recoverable type (i.e., one that
requires initialization or resetting). If the error is recoverable, the module should be
rebooted and pass all power-up self-tests before performing normal processing. If the
error recurs after repeated attempts to reboot, then the module should be replaced.
