                  Figure 10: Management Function Access Control

The ACS makes the decision to perform the requested function or not. This decision is
primarily based on the authenticated identity (or role) of the calling entity, the
authorizations of the entity, the security policies of the CKMS, the function, the key, and
its metadata. The metadata of a key may play a critical role in determining the controls
that are to be enforced. For example, an organization may decide that multiple users will
be permitted to use a shared key to encrypt and decrypt a particular file, while another
file can be decrypted only by a single user. The CKMS policies should support and
enforce the information management policies of the managing organization. Therefore, it
is highly desirable that a CKMS access control system be flexible enough to
accommodate the requirements of the CKMS Security Policy.
