6.3      Mitigating Indirect Attacks on Content

Indirect content attacks are not direct attacks on a Web server or its contents; they involve roundabout
means to gain information from users who normally visit the Web site maintained on the Web server.
The common theme of these attacks is to coerce users into visiting a malicious Web site set up by the
attacker and divulging personal information in the belief that the site they visited is the legitimate Web
site. While customers of electronic commerce and financial institutions are often targeted, such attacks
are not limited to those Web sites. Besides acquiring personal information related to the targeted Web
site, attacks may also be directed against the user’s computer from the malicious Web site visited. The
types of indirect attacks described in this section are phishing and pharming.

6.3.1      Phishing

Phishing attackers use social engineering techniques to trick users into accessing a fake Web site and
divulging personal information. In some phishing attacks, attackers send a legitimate-looking e-mail
asking users to update their information on the company’s Web site, but the URLs in the e-mail actually
point to a false Web site. 35 Other phishing attacks may be more advanced and take advantage of
vulnerabilities in the legitimate Web site’s application. 36

Although phishing cannot be prevented entirely through technical means employed on a Web server,
many techniques can reduce the likelihood that a Web site’s users will be lured into a phishing attack 37

 Ensuring customer awareness of the dangers of phishing attacks and how to avoid them. The Federal
  Trade Commission (FTC) has posted a consumer alert outlining steps that users should take
  [FTC06a]:

       Do not reply to email messages or popup ads asking for personal or financial information.

       Do not trust telephone numbers in e-mails or popup ads. Voice over Internet Protocol technology
           can be used to register a telephone with any area code.

       Use antivirus, anti-spyware, and firewall software. These can detect malware on a user’s
           machine that is participating in a phishing attack.

       Do not email personal or financial information.

       Review credit card and bank account statements regularly.

       Be cautious about accessing untrusted Web sites because some Web browser vulnerabilities can
           be exploited simply by visiting such sites. Users should also be cautious about opening any
           attachment or downloading any file from untrusted emails or Web sites.

       Forward phishing-related emails to spam@uce.gov and to the organization that is impersonated in
           the email.

      NIST SP 800-45 version 2, Guidelines on Electronic Mail Security, contains information on detecting phishing emails. It is
      available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/.
36
      An example of an advanced phishing attack occurred on the PayPal Web site [Netcraft06].
37
      Organizations should ensure that their internal users are also made aware of these techniques so that they can avoid phishing
      attacks directed at them.
