9.2.3     The Long-term Solution: Acquisition/Development and Implementation

With the interim solution in place, the next stage of the project was to move from the interim solution to
the long-term solution. There were three major challenges, as follows:

       Migrate to a centralized authentication infrastructure
       Replace all the APs that were not WPA2-Enterprise certified and therefore could not support
        CCMP with IEEE 802.1X port-based access control
       Install common client software on all STAs.
With regard to the first challenge, the team was divided as to the approach, with advocates for each of the
following proposals:

       Procure a proprietary security policy and key management solution
       Expand the EAP-TLS smart card solution to the entire bureau
       Use the existing RADIUS-based AAA server with EAP-TTLS and MD5-Challenge as the inner
        EAP method.
The proprietary solution involved agent software on each STA that would periodically obtain a new PSK
from a central management server. Proponents of this approach stated that establishing RSNAs based on
PSKs was much faster than doing so with IEEE 802.1X and EAP. The team heard sales presentations
from several vendors and eventually narrowed on a product suite from Acme Networks. Acmeâ€™s product
suite included a number of productivity-enhancing management tools, including graphical displays of the
