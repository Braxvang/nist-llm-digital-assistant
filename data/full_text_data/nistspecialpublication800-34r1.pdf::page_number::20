    Âƒ   Availability ensures timely and reliable access to and use of information.

The impact for each security objective is determined to be high, moderate, or low, based on definitions
provided in FIPS 199. The highest of the individual security objective impact levels are used to
determine the overall information system security impact level.

Contingency planning considerations and strategies address the impact level of the availability security
objective of information systems. Strategies for high-impact information systems should consider high-
availability and redundancy options in their design. Options may include fully redundant load balanced
systems at alternate sites, data mirroring, and offsite database replication. High-availability options are
normally expensive to set up, operate, and maintain and should be considered only for those high-impact
information systems categorized with a high-availability security objective. Lower-impact information
systems may be able to use less expensive contingency options and tolerate longer downtimes for
recovery or restoration of data.

Effective contingency planning includes incorporating security controls early in the development of an
information system, and maintaining these controls on an ongoing basis. NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 3,
identifies nine Contingency Planning (CP) security controls for information systems. Not all controls are
applicable to all systems. The FIPS 199 security categorization determines which controls apply to a
particular system. For example, information systems that have availability as a security objective
categorized as low-impact do not require alternate processing or storage sites, and information systems
that have an availability security objective categorized as moderate-impact require compliance with only
the first system backup control enhancements. Using the FIPS 199 security categorization allows for
tailoring of the CP security controls in NIST SP 800-53 to those applicable to the appropriate security
control baselines. Table 2-1 provides a summary of the CP controls from NIST SP 800-53 and their
applicability to the security control baselines. Further details and descriptions of the contingency
planning controls are provided in Appendix E.

Several CP controls reference environmental controls, which are part of the NIST SP 800-53 Physical and
Environmental Protection (PE) control family. Environmental controls considerations are only for the
location or building that houses the information system. The environment includes the hardware and
technology assets that support the information system. Section 3.3 of NIST SP 800-53 provides more
information on environmental controls and their relationship to information systems.

There are options available to organizations to facilitate compliance with the CP controls. NIST SP 800-
53 allows for compensating security controls to provide comparable protection for an information system
to comply with the intent of a CP control. An organization may use a compensating security control in
lieu of a CP control as long as there is justification for the use of the compensating control and
willingness to accept the risk of the compensating control implementation. Further explanation of
compensating security controls is available in Section 3.3 of NIST SP 800-53.
