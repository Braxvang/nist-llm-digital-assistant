NIST SP 800-215                                                          Guide to a Secure Enterprise
November 2022                                                                    Network Landscape

   Summary and Conclusions
The purpose of this document is to provide insights into the current enterprise network landscape
in terms of topology, traffic flows, and security threats. It posits that changes in application
architecture and technologies (e.g., monolithic to microservices-based, bare metal to
virtualization/containers) and increased subscriptions to various types of cloud services (e.g.,
IaaS, SaaS) are drivers of the current state of enterprise networks.
This document outlines the limitations of existing network access security assumptions and
technologies due to changes in network topologies in modern enterprise networks. The
emergence of new network appliances (e.g., CASB), enhanced features in existing appliances
(e.g., firewalls), network automation tools for gathering data for visibility/monitoring, threat
detection and remedial actions, and tools for automated network provisioning for different public
CSP environments (enabled by IaC tools invoked as part of the smart workflows called CI/CD
pipelines defined under the DevSecOps paradigm) are all discussed under point security
solutions. This is followed by a discussion of various networking configurations that each
implement a specific security function (e.g., user authentication, device authentication). A
separate section is devoted to discussing the salient features of an evolving security framework
for an enterprise-wide network called ZTNA, as well as the two predominant network
configurations (i.e., microsegmentation and SDP) for preventing attack escalation to meet one of
the goals of ZTNA.
Finally, this document discusses the latest WAN technologies that form part of the current
enterprise network landscape, as well as the features of WAN offerings with global PoP and
integrated security services called SASE.
