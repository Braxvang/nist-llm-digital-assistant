Appendix C—Example Issuance Processes (Informative)

The issuance process for a Derived PIV Credential varies depending whether the Derived PIV Credential
is issued at LOA-3 or LOA-4. Section 2.2 specifies the requirements for initial issuance. This appendix
provides two example issuance processes that satisfy those requirements, one at LOA-3 and another at
LOA-4.

C.1   Example Issuance of Derived PIV Credentials at Level of Identity Assurance 3

An employee requires a mobile device for work. The mobile device is ordered and a request for the
issuance of a Derived PIV Credential is submitted to the agency’s approval authority.

Once the employee has received the device and the request has been approved the employee starts the
issuance process by visiting a Web site operated by a registration authority (RA) that is associated with
the certification authority (CA) that will issue the Derived PIV Credential. The Web site requires TLS
client authentication using the PIV Authentication certificate on the employee’s PIV Card. Since the
employee cannot use the PIV Card with the mobile device the employee performs this step from a
desktop computer. By requiring the use of the PIV Authentication certificate when connecting to the Web
site and by validating the certificate, the server not only authenticates the employee, but also verifies that
the employee is still eligible to possess a PIV credential. If the employee successfully authenticates to the
server then the RA issues the employee a one-time password (OTP).

The employee then runs a provisioning application on the mobile device. The application asks the
employee to enter the OTP that was previously provided and to create a password, which will
subsequently be used to authenticate to the cryptographic module. The application generates a key pair
within the device’s cryptographic module and submits the OTP and newly generated public key to the RA
as part of a certificate request. The RA authenticates the employee by verifying that the OTP in the
certificate request matches the one that it previously issued, signs the certificate request, and forwards it
to the CA, which issues the Derived PIV Credential (i.e., the Derived PIV Authentication certificate). The
provisioning application loads the Derived PIV Authentication certificate on the mobile device.

C.2   Example Issuance of Derived PIV Credentials at Level of Identity Assurance 4

An employee requests a mobile device and Derived PIV Credential for work. The request is approved by
the agency’s approval authority.

The IT department sets up an appointment for Derived PIV Credential issuance and device pickup. At the
appointment, the IT staff directs the employee to an issuance station where the employee is asked to insert
the PIV Card into the issuance workstation and provide the password and a fingerprint. The issuance
station performs the PKI-AUTH and BIO authentication mechanisms from Section 6.2 of [FIPS201].

An IT staff member assigns a USB token to the employee and inserts it into the USB port of the issuance
station. The issuance station generates the Derived PIV Credential’s key pair on the USB token, creates a
certificate request that includes the newly generated public key, and forwards the request to the CA,
which issues the Derived PIV Credential (i.e., the Derived PIV Authentication certificate). The employee
is asked to set the password to activate the cryptographic module on the USB token. As a last step, the
issuance station loads the Derived PIV Authentication certificate on the USB token.
