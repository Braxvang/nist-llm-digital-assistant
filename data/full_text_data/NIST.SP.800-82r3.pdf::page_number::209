D.1.7. National Council of Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs)
Formed in 2003, the NCI is comprised of 25 organizations and is a coordinating body designed
to maximize information flow across private-sector critical infrastructures and with government.
Information Sharing and Analysis Centers help critical infrastructure owners and operators
protect their facilities, personnel, and customers from cyber and physical security threats and
other hazards. ISACs collect, analyze, and disseminate actionable threat information to their
members and provide tools to mitigate risks and enhance resiliency. ISACs reach deep into their
sectors, communicating critical information far and wide and maintaining sector-wide situational
awareness.

D.1.8. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
NIST promotes U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement
science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve quality
of life. From the smart electric power grid and electronic health records to atomic clocks,
advanced nanomaterials, and computer chips, innumerable products and services rely on NIST’s
technology, measurements, and standards. NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL)
develops and maintains an extensive collection of computer security standards, guidelines,
recommendations, and research, which are released through SPs and other reporting mediums.

D.1.8.1.       NIST SP 800 Series Cybersecurity Guidelines
The NIST SP 800 series on information technology reports on the NIST ITL research, guidance,
and outreach efforts in computer security and its collaborative activities with industry,
government, and academic organizations. Focus areas include cryptographic technology and
applications, advanced authentication, public key infrastructure, internetworking security, criteria
and assurance, and security management and support.
