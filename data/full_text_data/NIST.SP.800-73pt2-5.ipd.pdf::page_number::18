      NIST SP 800-73pt2-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                    Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 2
      September 2023                                                                       PIV Card Application Card Command Interface

419                contact interface (VCI) has been established. The VCI 4 is established when the following
420                security condition is met:
421                          (command is submitted over secure messaging) AND (the Discovery Object is
422                          present) AND (Bit 4 of the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy is one) AND ((the
423                          security status indicator associated with the pairing code is TRUE) OR (Bit 3 of the
424                          first byte of the PIN Usage Policy is one))

425                PIV Card Application Card Commands for Data Access

426   3.1.1. SELECT Card Command
427   The SELECT card command sets the currently selected application. The PIV Card Application
428   SHALL be selected by providing its application identifier (see Part 1, Section 2.2) in the data
429   field of the SELECT command.
430   There SHALL be at most one PIV Card Application on any ICC. The PIV Card Application
431   CAN also be made the currently selected application by providing the right-truncated version
432   (see Part 1, Section 2.2) â€” that is, without the 2-byte version number in the data field of the
433   SELECT command.
434   The complete AID, including the 2-byte version, of the PIV Card Application that became the
435   currently selected card application upon successful execution of the SELECT command (using
436   the full or right-truncated PIV AID) SHALL be returned in the application property template.
437   If the currently selected application is the PIV Card Application when the SELECT command is
438   given and the AID in the data field of the SELECT command is either the AID of the PIV Card
439   Application or the right-truncated version thereof, then the PIV Card Application SHALL
440   continue to be the currently selected card application, and the setting of all security status
441   indicators in the PIV Card Application SHALL be unchanged.
442   If the currently selected application is the PIV Card Application when the SELECT command is
443   given and the AID in the data field of the SELECT command is not the PIV Card Application (or
444   the right-truncated version thereof) but a valid AID supported by the ICC, then the PIV Card
445   Application SHALL be deselected, and all the PIV Card Application security status indicators in
446   the PIV Card Application SHALL be set to FALSE.
447   If the currently selected application is the PIV Card Application when the SELECT command is
448   given and the AID in the data field of the SELECT command is an invalid AID not supported by
449   the ICC, then the PIV Card Application SHALL remain the currently selected application, and
450   all PIV Card Application security status indicators SHALL remain unchanged.
