       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                                    Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

2887   the randomness is produced by a deterministic source (e.g., a DRBG), the unpredictability is based on the capability of
2888   an adversary to break the cryptographic algorithm for producing the pseudorandom bitstring.

2889   randomness input
2890   An input bitstring from a randomness source that provides an assessed minimum amount of randomness (e.g., entropy)
2891   for a DRBG. See min-entropy.

2892   randomness source
2893   A source of randomness for an RBG. The randomness source may be an entropy source or an RBG construction.

2894   RBG1 construction
2895   An RBG construction with the DRBG and the randomness source in separate cryptographic modules.

2896   RBG2 construction
2897   An RBG construction with one or more entropy sources and a DRBG within the same cryptographic module. This
2898   RBG construction does not provide full-entropy output.

2899   RBG2(NP) construction
2900   A non-physical RBG2 construction. An RBG2 construction that obtains entropy from one or more validated non-
2901   physical entropy sources and possibly from one or more validated physical entropy sources. This RBG construction
2902   does not provide full-entropy output.

2903   RBG2(P) construction
2904   A physical RBG2 construction. An RBG construction that includes a DRBG and one or more entropy sources in the
2905   same cryptographic module. Only the entropy from validated physical entropy sources is counted when fulfilling an
2906   entropy request within the RBG. This RBG construction does not provide full-entropy output.

2907   RBG3 construction
2908   An RBG construction that includes a DRBG and one or more entropy sources in the same cryptographic module.
2909   When working properly, bitstrings that have full entropy are produced. Sometimes called a non-deterministic random
2910   bit generator (NRBG) or true random number (or bit) generator.

2911   reseed
2912   To refresh the internal state of a DRBG with seed material. The seed material should contain sufficient entropy to
2913   allow recovery from a possible compromise.

2914   sample space
2915   The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.

2916   secure channel
2917   A physically protected secure path for transferring data between two cryptographic modules that ensures
2918   confidentiality, integrity, and replay protection as well as mutual authentication between the modules.

2919   security boundary
2920   For an entropy source: A conceptual boundary that is used to assess the amount of entropy provided by the values
2921   output from the entropy source. The entropy assessment is performed under the assumption that any observer
2922   (including any adversary) is outside of that boundary during normal operation.
2923   For a DRBG: A conceptual boundary that contains all of the DRBG functions and internal states required for a DRBG.
2924   For an RBG: A conceptual boundary that is defined with respect to one or more threat models that includes an
2925   assessment of the applicability of an attack and the potential harm caused by the attack.

2926   security strength
2927   A number associated with the amount of work (i.e., the number of basic operations of some sort) that is required to
2928   “break” a cryptographic algorithm or system in some way. In this Recommendation, the security strength is specified
2929   in bits and is a specific value from the set {128, 192, 256}. If the security strength associated with an algorithm or
2930   system is s bits, then it is expected that (roughly) 2s basic operations are required to break it.
