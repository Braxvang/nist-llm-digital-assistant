GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



security controls needed to protect financial transactions in automated payment systems are different than
those needed for tracking applications. The personnel should also understand that an adversary may
leverage RFID technology for an unintended purpose. For example, a warehouse may use RFID
technology to determine what items it has in its current inventory, but an adversary may use the same
system to track an item’s whereabouts after it leaves the warehouse. In this case, an asset management
system is later used to enable an unauthorized tracking application, perhaps used by an adversary to locate
high value targets.

The remainder of Section 3.1 examines each of the application types mentioned in Table 3-1, as well as
supply chain management. The section uses hypothetical examples to illustrate the key characteristics of
each application type and highlights how they differ from one another. The section also incorporates
other examples of each application to provide additional information on current and potential applications
of the technology.

3.1.1    Asset Management

RFID-based asset management systems are used to manage inventory of any item that can be tagged.
Asset management systems using RFID technology offer significant advantages over paper-based or bar
code systems, including the ability to read the identifiers of multiple items nearly simultaneously without
optical line of sight or physical contact. These features increase the speed of common asset management
tasks, which improves operational efficiency and effectiveness.

Perhaps the simplest form of asset management is Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS), which accounts
for items in retail stores. 23 For example, EAS tags are placed on electronic equipment, clothing, books,
and many other consumer goods at major retailers. After a customer purchases an item, the sales clerk
deactivates the tag. If a person attempts to leave the shop with unpurchased goods, readers at the doors
will detect the activated tag and trigger an alarm. In this case, the RFID technology determines only one
thing: whether or not the EAS tag is still operating, indicating that the item has not been properly checked
out.

Most RFID-based asset management systems provide additional functionality. For example, at a doctor’s
office, the medical records clerk can quickly scan the filing system on a monthly or quarterly basis to
determine how many medical records are present or missing. The records clerk can also instantly
compare the list of missing records with a list of those known to be checked out of the filing system.
Without RFID technology, this task could take hours or days to complete by hand. Bar code technology,
such as that found at a supermarket, would require physical handling of each medical record, which is
labor-intensive.

RFID is also an enabling technology for smart shelves and smart cabinets, which automatically maintain
continuous inventories of the items they hold by tracking items entering and leaving. Items are reordered
automatically when inventory is low. The smart shelves and cabinets can also be used for theft
prevention, alerting personnel when many high-value items are taken at the same time, and perhaps
activating a camera to record the event.

3.1.2    Tracking

Tracking applications are used to identify the location of an item, or more accurately, the location of the
last reader that detected the presence of the tag associated with the item. Many tracking applications are

     which is not based on RFID. Source: K. Finkenzeller, RFID Handbook: Fundamentals and applications in contactless
