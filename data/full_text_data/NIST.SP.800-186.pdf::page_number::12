NIST SP 800-186                                                 Discrete Logarithm-based Cryptography:
February 2023                                                         Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters



Executive Summary
This Recommendation specifies the set of elliptic curves recommended for U.S. Government
use. It includes:
   − Specification of elliptic curves previously specified in Federal Information Processing
     Standard (FIPS) 186-4, Digital Signature Schemes [FIPS_186-4]. This includes both
     elliptic curves defined over a prime field and curves defined over a binary field. Although
     the specifications for elliptic curves over binary fields are included, these curves are now
     deprecated. It is strongly recommended to use the other prime curves.
   − Specification of new Montgomery and Edwards curves, which are detailed in Elliptic
     Curves for Security [RFC_7748].
   − A reference for the Brainpool curves specified in [RFC_5639]. These curves are allowed
     to be used for interoperability reasons (i.e., to accommodate inclusion in FIPS-validated
     products).
   − A reference for the curve secp256k1 specified in [SEC_2]. This curve is allowed to be
     used for blockchain-related applications.
   − Elliptic curves in FIPS 186-4 that do not meet the current bit security requirements put
     forward in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-57, Part 1, Recommendation for Key
     Management: Part 1 – General [SP_800-57], are now legacy-use. They may be used to
     process already protected information (e.g., decrypt or verify) but not to apply protection
     to information (e.g., encrypt or sign). Also see NIST SP 800-131A, Transitions:
     Recommendation for Transitioning the Use of Cryptographic Algorithms and Key
     Lengths [SP_800-131A].

This Recommendation provides details regarding the group operations for each of the specified
elliptic curves and the relationship between the various curve models, allowing for flexibility
regarding the use of curves most suitable in particular applications. It also gives cryptographic
criteria for the selection of suitable elliptic curves and provides more details on finite field
arithmetic and data representation than were available in FIPS 186-4.
