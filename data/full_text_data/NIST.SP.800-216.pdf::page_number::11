   U.S. Government Vulnerability Disclosure
Thousands of security vulnerabilities in computer software and systems are discovered and
publicly disclosed every year. Likely, even more are discovered by developers and quietly fixed
without anyone ever being aware. In 2021 alone, there were over 20,000 new vulnerabilities
reported to the NIST National Vulnerability Database [NVD].
Vulnerabilities are discovered by a variety of sources. Developers of software may find security
bugs in already deployed code. Security researchers and penetration testers may find
vulnerabilities by scanning or manually testing software and accessible systems (following
published rules of behavior). While identifying an issue, users of systems may stumble across a
vulnerability. Malicious actors may seek out unknown or unpublished vulnerabilities and use
them in malware. Evidence of these attacks may then be discovered and analyzed by security
experts, resulting in an identified vulnerability being reported. Regardless of who finds these
vulnerabilities, it is critical that they are reported so that the owners of vulnerable software and
systems can resolve or identify ways to mitigate the reported vulnerabilities. In many cases,
owners should issue advisories to notify users of any actions to be taken (e.g., patches to be
installed) or of potential damage to systems (i.e., potential consequences of the vulnerability
having existed).
International standard [ISOIEC_29147] provides guidance for coordinating the reporting of
vulnerabilities and the creation of advisories to notify the public. It is designed to work in
coordination with [ISOIEC_30111], which addresses the process of handling a reported
vulnerability. Relevant topics in both ISO/IEC 29147 and ISO/IEC 30111 are referenced within
this guidance. Hereafter, these two standards are referred to as ‘the ISO/IEC standards’ or simply
‘the standards.’
NIST has been directed under the Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2020 [CYB_IMPR_ACT]
to create guidelines for vulnerability disclosure for federal agencies in alignment with both
ISO/IEC standards. Per the legislation, this document provides guidelines for:
   1. Receiving information about a potential security vulnerability in a federal information
      system,
   2. Coordinating with stakeholders, and
   3. Resolving and disseminating information about such security vulnerabilities.
In order to define vulnerability disclosure guidelines, this document describes a framework for
the U.S. Government to establish and maintain a unified and flexible collection and management
process for vulnerability disclosures. The framework can be applied at all levels, from a central
oversight body down to the individual program offices. The framework can also be applied to all
government-developed, commercial, and open-source software used by government systems. All
government data and information systems that include development or support services benefit
from vulnerability disclosure program coverage.
