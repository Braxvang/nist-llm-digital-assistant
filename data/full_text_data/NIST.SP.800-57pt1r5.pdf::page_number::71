                                                                                                    2. When a hash function and digital signature algorithm are used in combination to compute
                                                                                                       a digital signature, the security strength of the signature is determined by the weaker of the

                                                                                                       combination can provide no more than 112 bits of security because a 2048-bit RSA key
                                                                                                       cannot provide more than 112 bits of security strength even though SHA-256 can support

                                                                                                       that is intended to provide X bits of security, an approved random bit generator shall be
                                                                                                       used that supports at least X bits of security. For example, if AES-128 and its key are
                                                                                                       intended to provide 128 bits of security strength, then the RBG needs to support at least
                                                                                                       128 bits of security.
                                                                                                 To support a given security strength, the combination of algorithms and key sizes must be carefully
                                                                                                 selected. For example, if 128 bits of security strength is required to protect data that is to be
