       Despite the PDA family, all devices support a set of basic Personal Information Management
       (PIM) applications, which provide Address Book, Appointment, Mailbox, and Memo
       Management capabilities. Most devices also provide the ability to communicate wirelessly,
       review electronic documents, and surf the Web. PIM data residing on a PDA can be
       synchronized with a desktop computer and automatically reconciled and replicated between
       the two devices, using synchronization protocols such as Microsoft’s Pocket PC ActiveSync
       protocol and Palm’s HotSync protocol. Synchronization protocols can also be used to
       exchange other kinds of data (e.g., individual text, images, and archive file formats).
       Information not obtainable directly from the PDA can often be retrieved from a personal
       computer to which the device has been synchronized [Cas04].

2.2   Palm OS

       Palm established itself early in the PDA market with devices built around its operating system,
       Palm OS. Early Palm OS devices use 16- and 32-bit processors based on the Motorola
       DragonBall MC68328-family of microprocessors. More recent devices use StrongArm and
       XScale microprocessors.5 Older Palm OS devices tend to be driven by alkaline batteries
       instead of lithium-ion batteries, used in new models.

       The Palm OS and built-in applications are stored in ROM, while application and user data are
       stored in RAM. Add-on utilities also exist to back up PIM data (e.g., Address Book, Date
       Book, To Do List, Memo Pad) onto available ROM [Bob04, Pie99]. Palm OS system
