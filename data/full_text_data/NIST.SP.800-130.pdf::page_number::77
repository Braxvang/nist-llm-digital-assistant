8. Security Controls
A CKMS requires security controls to protect its components and devices, along with the
data that they contain. For example:

   a) A CKMS should be physically protected so that its components, devices, and the
      sensitive data contained within the CKMS are protected from unauthorized
      disclosure and modification.
   b) A CKMS will likely require computer systems to perform functions, such as key
      generation, key storage, key recovery, key distribution, cryptographic module
      control, and metadata management. Controls should exist to ensure that these
      functions are correctly performed.
   c) A CKMS will likely be networked to distribute keys and metadata to users and
      other end entities. In such situations, the CKMS should be protected using
      network security control devices.
   d) A CKMS should generate, store, use and protect cryptographic keys using a
      cryptographic module.
   e) A CKMS should apply necessary cryptographic protections to keys before they
      are output from a cryptographic module.

The following subsections of this section describe requirements for each of these types of
security controls.

8.1 Physical Security Controls
CKMS components and devices should be physically protected in order to ensure
information security. Without good physical security, the components and devices could
be tampered with and the hardware and/or software could be modified to bypass security.

A CKMS may include facilities that provide third-party key management services, such
as a Certification Authority, Key Distribution Center, Registration Authority, or
Certificate Directory and also end-to-end communication devices, such as personal
computers, personal digital assistants, smart phones, and intelligent sensing devices.

A CKMS may include one or more primary facilities and one or more backup facilities
that provide disaster recovery capabilities. Each of these facilities should have physical
protection, either by controlling access to the entire facility or by controlling access to the
sensitive components or devices within the facility. The use of backup systems for
disaster recovery is discussed in Section 10.4.

One or more of the following mechanisms should be chosen to physically protect a
CKMS facility, depending on the security criticality of its components and devices. The
following are examples of physical security mechanisms. Some of the mechanisms listed
below are detection mechanisms that should be augmented with appropriate prevention
mechanisms.
