SP 800-152                                                  A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS



                          A Federal CKMS should use trust anchor formats as
PA:6.16
                          specified in [RFC 5914] or its revisions.

6.5   Cryptographic Key and/or Metadata Security: In Storage

Cryptographic keys are typically stored with their metadata. An FCKMS should verify the
authorization of the submitting entity and the integrity of the submitted key and metadata
before they are stored. For Moderate and High impact-level systems, identity-based
authentication is required, and for Low impact-level systems either identity-based or role
based authentication is required. See Section 6.5 of the Framework for further discussion.

An FCKMS must only allow authorized users to have access to stored keys. Thus, an Access
Control System (ACS) (see Section 6.7.1) should protect stored keys and metadata.

FR:6.73 The CKMS design shall specify the methods used to authenticate the identity and
verify the authorization of the entity submitting keys and/or metadata for storage.

FR:6.74 The CKMS design shall specify the methods used to verify the integrity of keys
and/or metadata submitted for storage.

FR:6.75 The CKMS design shall specify the methods used to protect the confidentiality of
symmetric and private stored keys and metadata.

FR:6.76 If a key-wrapping key (or key pair) is used to protect stored keys, then the CKMS
design shall specify the methods used to protect the key-wrapping key (or key pair) and
control its use.

FR:6.77 The CKMS design shall specify the methods used to protect the integrity of stored
keys and metadata.

FR:6.78 The CKMS design shall specify how access to stored keys is controlled.

FR:6.79 The CKMS design shall specify the techniques used for correcting or recovering all
stored keys.

                AC-3      Before keys and metadata are stored or retrieved from
PR:6.65
                          storage, a Federal CKMS shall verify the authorization of the
                          entity submitting or requesting keys and/or metadata.
                          A Federal CKMS supporting Moderate or High impact-level
PR:6.66
                          systems shall support identity-based authentication in order to
                          verify the identity and authorization of the entity making a
                          key or metadata storage or retrieval request.
                          A Federal CKMS supporting Low impact-level systems shall
PR:6.67
                          support either identity-based authentication or role-based
                          authentication in order to verify the authorization of the entity
