organization’s awareness and training program, and that of the overall IT security program, depend on the
ability of these people to work toward a common goal of protecting the organization’s information and
IT-related resources.

1.3     Scope

The scope of this guideline covers what an organization should do to design, develop, implement, and
maintain an IT security awareness and training program, as a part of the IT security program. The scope
includes awareness and training needs of all users of an organization’s IT, from employees to supervisors
and functional managers, to executive-level managers. The guideline also discusses professional
development (i.e., professionalization) and certification issues – topics that continue to gain acceptance in
organizations. While it mentions and defines IT security education, this document does not address the
topic in-depth.

The document is a companion publication to NIST Special Publication 800-16, Information Technology
Security Training Requirements: A Role- and Performance-Based Model. The two publications are
complementary – SP 800-50 works at a higher strategic level, discussing how to build an IT security
awareness and training program, while SP 800-16 is at a lower tactical level, describing an approach to
role-based IT security training.

1.4     Policy

OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, addresses training as an element of a system security plan for a
general support system and as an element of an application security plan for a major application.2
Regarding the training element of a system security plan, the Circular states, “Ensure that all individuals
are appropriately trained in how to fulfill their security responsibilities before allowing them access to
the system. Such training shall ensure that employees are versed in the rules of the system . . . and
apprise them about available technical assistance and technical security products and techniques.
Behavior consistent with the rules of the system and periodic refresher training shall be required for
continued access to the system.” The Circular states that as part of an application security plan, “Before
allowing individuals access to the application, ensure that all individuals receive specialized training
focused on their responsibilities and the application rules. This may be in addition to the training
required for access to a system. Such training may vary from a notification at the time of access (e.g., for
members of the public using an information retrieval application) to formal training (e.g., for an
employee that works with a high-risk application).”

Additionally, the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 tasks the head of each
agency with the responsibility to “ensure that the agency has trained personnel sufficient to assist the
agency in complying with (these requirements) and related policies, procedures, standards, and
guidelines(.)” FISMA also requires that the head of each agency “delegate to the agency Chief
Information Officer (CIO) (or a comparable official), the authority to ensure compliance with the
requirements imposed on the agency, including . . . training and oversee personnel with significant
responsibilities for information security . . . (.)” FISMA also states that the required “agency wide
information security program” shall include “security awareness training to inform personnel, including
contractors and other users of information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency,
of:

     (i) information security risks associated with their activities; and

2
      Knowing what security training is necessary for users, system/network administrators, and managers of a system or
      application will help the system or application owner/manager properly budget for those security-related needs.
