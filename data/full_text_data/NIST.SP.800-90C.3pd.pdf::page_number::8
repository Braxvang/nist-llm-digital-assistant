      NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                          Recommendation for RBG Constructions
      September 2022

163   Call for Patent Claims
164   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use
165   would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information
166   Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or requirements may be
167   directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another publication. This call also includes
168   disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending U.S. or foreign patent applications relating
169   to this ITL draft publication and of any relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.
170   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its behalf, in
171   written or electronic form, either:
172       a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not hold and
173          does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
174       b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available to
175          applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the guidance or
176          requirements in this ITL draft publication either:
177              i.   under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
178                   discrimination; or
179             ii.   without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
180                   demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.
181   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make assurances
182   on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents subject to the
183   assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the assurance are binding on
184   the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of
185   future transfers with the goal of binding each successor-in-interest.
186   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
187   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.
188   Such statements should be addressed to: rbg_comments@nist.gov
