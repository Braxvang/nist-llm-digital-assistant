                                                      GUIDE TO SECURITY FOR FULL VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGIES



5.    Secure Virtualization Planning and Deployment

A critical aspect of deploying a secure virtualization solution is careful planning prior to installation,
configuration, and deployment. This helps ensure that the virtual environment is as secure as possible and
in compliance with all relevant organizational policies. Many virtualization security and performance
problems can be traced to a lack of planning or management controls. Security should be considered from
the initial planning stage at the beginning of the systems development life cycle to maximize security and
minimize costs. It is much more difficult and expensive to address security after deployment and
implementation. The guidelines found in Section 4 and other general resources on security practices
should aid organizations in making appropriate decisions for deploying virtualization solutions.

This section brings together the concepts presented in the previous sections of the guide and explains how
they should be incorporated throughout the entire life cycle of virtualization solutions, involving
everything from policy to operations. This section references a five-phase life cycle model to help
organizations determine at what point in their virtualization deployments a recommendation may be
relevant. This model is based on one introduced in NIST SP 800-64, Security Considerations in the
Information System Development Life Cycle. Organizations may follow a project management
methodology or life cycle model that does not directly map to the phases in the model presented here, but
the types of tasks in the methodology and their sequencing are probably similar. The phases of the life
cycle are as follows:

 Phase 1: Initiation. This phase includes the tasks that an organization should perform before it starts
  to design a virtualization solution. These include identifying needs for virtualization, providing an
  overall vision for how virtualization solutions would support the mission of the organization, creating
  a high-level strategy for implementing virtualization solutions, developing virtualization policy,
  identifying platforms and applications that can be virtualized, and specifying business and functional
  requirements for the solution.
 Phase 2: Planning and Design. In this phase, personnel specify the technical characteristics of the
  virtualization solution and related components. These include the authentication methods and the
  cryptographic mechanisms used to protect communications. At the end of this phase, solution
  components are procured.
 Phase 3: Implementation. In this phase, equipment is configured to meet operational and security
  requirements, installed and tested as a prototype, and then activated on a production network.
  Implementation includes altering the configuration of other security controls and technologies, such
  as security event logging, network management, and authentication server integration.
 Phase 4: Operations and Maintenance. This phase includes security-related tasks that an
  organization should perform on an ongoing basis once the virtualization solution is operational,
  including log review, attack detection, and incident response.
 Phase 5: Disposition. This phase encompasses tasks that occur when a virtualization solution is
  being retired, including preserving information to meet legal requirements, sanitizing media, and
  disposing of equipment properly.
This section highlights security considerations of particular interest for virtualization solutions. These
considerations are not intended to be comprehensive, nor is there any implication that security elements
not listed here are unimportant or unnecessary. In addition to following the security recommendations
presented in this publication, organizations implementing full virtualization solutions should also follow
the recommendations from NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information
