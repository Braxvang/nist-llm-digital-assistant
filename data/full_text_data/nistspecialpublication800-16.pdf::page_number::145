 Definition   —       The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an IT system
                      from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                      model includes six phases: Liitiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                      Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                      ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                      needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                      The implementation phase is the installation of the system into the
                      operational environment in a manner that does not compromise the integrity
                      and effectiveness of the successfully tested security safeguards.

 Beliavioral Outcome      — Individuals responsible       for review and evaluation are able to analyze
                               system and test documentation to determine whether the system
                               provides adequate and appropriate IT security to support
                               certification and accreditation.
