AC-8      SYSTEM USE NOTIFICATION

          Control: The information system displays an approved, system use notification message before
          granting system access informing potential users: (i) that the user is accessing a U.S. Government
          information system; (ii) that system usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit; (iii)
          that unauthorized use of the system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties; and
          (iv) that use of the system indicates consent to monitoring and recording. The system use
          notification message provides appropriate privacy and security notices (based on associated
          privacy and security policies or summaries) and remains on the screen until the user takes explicit
          actions to log on to the information system.
          Supplemental Guidance: Privacy and security policies are consistent with applicable laws, Executive
          Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. System use notification
          messages can be implemented in the form of warning banners displayed when individuals log in to
          the information system. For publicly accessible systems: (i) the system use information is
          available and when appropriate, is displayed before granting access; (ii) any references to
          monitoring, recording, or auditing are in keeping with privacy accommodations for such systems
          that generally prohibit those activities; and (iii) the notice given to public users of the information
          system includes a description of the authorized uses of the system.
          Control Enhancements: None.
