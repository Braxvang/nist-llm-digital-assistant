                                                 GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



Host-based IDPSs have some significant limitations. Some detection techniques are performed only
periodically, such as hourly or a few times a day, to identify events that have already happened, causing
significant delay in identifying certain events. Also, many host-based IDPSs forward their alert data to
the management servers in batches a few times an hour, which can cause delays in initiating response
actions. Because host-based IDPSs run agents on the hosts being monitored, they can impact host
performance because of the resources the agents consume. Installing an agent can also cause conflicts
with existing host security controls, such as personal firewalls and VPN clients. Agent upgrades and
some configuration changes can also necessitate rebooting the monitored hosts.

Host-based IDPSs offer various intrusion prevention capabilities; these vary based on the detection
techniques used by each product. Code analysis techniques can prevent code from being executed; this
can be very effective at stopping both known and previously unknown attacks. Network traffic analysis
can stop incoming and outgoing network traffic containing network, transport, or application layer
attacks, wireless networking protocol attacks, and the use of unauthorized applications and protocols.
Network traffic filtering works as a host-based firewall and stops unauthorized access and acceptable use
policy violations. Filesystem monitoring can prevent files from being accessed, modified, replaced, or
deleted, which can stop malware installation and other attacks involving inappropriate file access. Other
host-based IDPS detection techniques generally do not support prevention actions because they identify
events well after they have occurred.

Some host-based IDPSs offer additional capabilities related to intrusion detection and prevention, such as
enforcing restrictions on the use of removable media, detecting the activation or use of audiovisual
devices, automatically hardening hosts on an ongoing basis, monitoring the status of running processes
and restarting failed ones, and performing network traffic sanitization.
