       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                  Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                         and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1955   Appendix D. Operations Plan Templates
1956   Appendices D.1 and D.2 are suggested outlines for a PCI and DPCI, respectively. It is highly
1957   recommended that an organization follow these templates to comprehensively document its
1958   operations in support of a successful authorization. An issuer of both PIV Cards and derived PIV
1959   credentials can develop a single operations plan that addresses all requirements without repeating
1960   common elements of the plan.
