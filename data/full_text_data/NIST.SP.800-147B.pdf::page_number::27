Appendix Dâ€”Example of Update Mechanism 3

This appendix provides an example of how Update Mechanism 3 could be implemented in a server. In
this example, the BIOS flash is not strongly protected and therefore the integrity of the BIOS code is
verified during the boot process. An example system block diagram for update mechanism 3 shows the
BIOS flash SPI controller accessible by both the host and the SP. Because it has write access to the BIOS
flash memory, the SP environment in this example must be a secure, protected environment as described
in Section 5.

In this example, to initiate a BIOS update, system management software on the host can interact with the
SP to send a BIOS update image to the SP. Alternatively, the BIOS update image can arrive at the SP
through out of band communication via the SP Ethernet. The SP, acting as part of the RTU, then
