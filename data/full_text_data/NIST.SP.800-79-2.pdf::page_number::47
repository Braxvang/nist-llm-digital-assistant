Special Publication 800-79-2                             Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



                 Responsibility: DAO
                 Guidance: After the completion of the assessment review, the DAO has a clear
                 understanding of the impact of deficiencies. This helps the DAO to judge which
                 deficiencies are of greatest concern to the organization and which can be tolerated
                 without creating unreasonable organization-level risk. The CAP is also considered
                 in determining the risk to the organization in terms of when and how the OIMO
                 intends to address the known deficiencies. The DAO may consult the OIMO,
                 Assessor, or other organization officials before completing the final risk
                 evaluation. This risk evaluation in turn determines the degree of acceptability of
                 issuer operations. The logic for using the latter as the basis for an authorization
                 decision is described in Section 2.9.

                 Subtask 6.3: Provide the authorization package to an independent party for
                 review and arrive at an authorization decision.
                 Responsibility: DAO
                 Guidance: Before providing the final authorization decision, the DAO seeks an
                 independent review of the risks involved its issuer operations. The DAO shares
                 the results of the assessment and the perceived risks with another issuer (e.g.,
                 another agency that issues PIV Cards or Derived PIV Credentials) to get their
                 opinion and establish trustworthiness in the issued credentials.


        Task 7: Authorization Documentation
The authorization documentation task includes— (i) completing and transmitting the
authorization decision package to the appropriate individuals and organizations; and (ii) updating
the issuer’s operations plan.

                 Subtask 7.1: Provide copies of the authorization decision package, in either
                 paper or electronic form, to the OIMO and any other organization officials having
                 interests, roles, or responsibilities in the issuer’s operations.
                 Responsibility: DAO
                 Guidance: The authorization decision package, including the authorization
                 decision letter, should be transmitted to the OIMO. Upon receipt of the
                 authorization decision package, the OIMO must review the authorization and its
                 terms and conditions. The original authorization decision package must be kept on
                 file by the OIMO. The DAO shall retain copies of the contents of the
                 authorization decision package. The authorization decision package must be
                 appropriately safeguarded and stored, whenever possible, in a centralized
                 organization filing system to ensure accessibility. The authorization decision
                 package shall be available to authorized auditors and oversight organizations upon
                 request. The authorization decision package must be retained in accordance with
                 the organization’s records retention policy. The issuer and specific facilities are
                 authorized for a maximum of three (3) years from the date of the ATO. After the
                 period ends, re-authorization must be performed.
