                                                                                           GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



 File and printer sharing services (e.g., Windows Network Basic Input/Output System [NetBIOS] file
  and printer sharing, Network File System [NFS], FTP)

 Wireless networking services

 Remote control and remote access programs, particularly those that do not strongly encrypt their
  communications (e.g., Telnet) 17

 Directory services (e.g., Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [LDAP], Network Information
  System [NIS])

 Web servers and services

 Email services (e.g., SMTP)

 Language compilers and libraries

 System development tools

 System and network management tools and utilities, including Simple Network Management Protocol
  (SNMP).

Removing unnecessary services and applications is preferable to simply disabling them through
configuration settings because attacks that attempt to alter settings and activate a disabled service cannot
succeed when the functional components are completely removed. Disabled services could also be
enabled inadvertently through human error.

Removing or disabling unnecessary services enhances the security of a server in several ways: 18

 Other services cannot be compromised and used to attack the host or impair the services of the server.
  Each service added to a host increases the risk of compromise for that host because each service is
  another possible avenue of access for an attacker. Less is more secure in this case.

 Other services may have defects or may be incompatible with the server itself. By removing or
  disabling them, they should not affect the server and should potentially improve its availability.

 The host can be configured to better suit the requirements of the particular service. Different services
  might require different hardware and software configurations, which could lead to unnecessary
  vulnerabilities or negatively affect performance.

 By reducing services, the number of logs and log entries is reduced; therefore, detecting unexpected
  behavior becomes easier (see Section 6.1).

Organizations should determine the services to be enabled on a server. Additional services that might be
installed include web servers, database access protocols, file transfer protocols, and remote administration
services. These services may be required in certain instances, but they may increase the risks to the
server. Whether the risks outweigh the benefits is a decision for each organization to make.

17
     If a remote control or remote access program is absolutely required and it does not strongly encrypt its communications, it
     should be tunneled over a protocol that provides encryption, such as secure shell (SSH) or Internet Protocol Security (IPsec).
