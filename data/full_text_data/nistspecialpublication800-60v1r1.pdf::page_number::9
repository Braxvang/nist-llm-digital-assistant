1.0 INTRODUCTION
The identification of information processed on an information system is essential to the proper
selection of security controls and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the
system and its information. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special
Publication (SP) 800-60 has been developed to assist Federal government agencies to categorize
information and information systems.

1.1 Purpose and Applicability
NIST SP 800-60 addresses the FISMA direction to develop guidelines recommending the types
of information and information systems to be included in each category of potential security
impact. This guideline is intended to help agencies consistently map security impact levels to
types of: (i) information (e.g., privacy, medical, proprietary, financial, contractor sensitive, trade
secret, investigation); and (ii) information systems (e.g., mission critical, mission support,
administrative). This guideline applies to all Federal information systems other than national
security systems. National security systems store, process, or communicate national security
information. 2

1.2 Target Audience
This publication is intended to serve a diverse federal audience of information system and
information security professionals including: (i) individuals with information system and
information security management and oversight responsibilities (e.g., chief information officers,
senior agency information security officers, authorizing officials); (ii) organizational officials
having a vested interest in the accomplishment of organizational missions (e.g., mission and
business area owners, information owners); (iii) individuals with information system
development responsibilities (e.g., program and project managers, information system
developers); and (iv) individuals with information security implementation and operational
responsibilities (e.g., information system owners, information owners, information system
security officers).

1.3 Relationship to Other Documents
NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-60 is a member of the NIST family of security-related
publications including:
    •    FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and
         Information Systems;
    •    FIPS Publication 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and
         Information Systems;

  FISMA defines a national security system as any information system (including telecommunications system) used
or operated by an agency or by a contractor on behalf of an agency, or any other organization on behalf of an agency
– (i) the function, operation, or use of which: involves intelligence activities; involves cryptologic activities related
to national security; involves command and control of military forces; involves equipment that is an integral part of
a weapon or weapon system; or is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions (excluding a
routine administrative or business system used for applications such as payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel
management); or (ii) that processes classified information. [See Public Law 107-347, Section 3542 (b)(2)(A).]
