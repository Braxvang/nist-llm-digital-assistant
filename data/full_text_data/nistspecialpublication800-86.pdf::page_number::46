GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



      ! Identifying Known Files. The benefit of finding files of interest is obvious, but it is also often
        beneficial to eliminate unimportant files, such as known good OS and application files, from
        consideration. Analysts should use validated hash sets, such as those created by NIST’s National
        Software Reference Library (NSRL) project56 or personally created hash sets57 that have been
        validated, as a basis for identifying known benign and malicious files. Hash sets typically use the
        SHA-1 and MD5 algorithms to establish message digest values for each known file.
      ! Performing String Searches and Pattern Matches. String searches aid in perusing large
        amounts of data to find key words or strings. Various searching tools are available that can use
        Boolean, fuzzy logic, synonyms and concepts, stemming, and other search methods. Examples of
        common searches include searching for multiple words in a single file and searching for
        misspelled versions of certain words. Developing concise sets of search terms for common
        situations can help the analyst reduce the volume of information to review. Some considerations
        or possible difficulties in performing string searches are as follows:

           –    Some proprietary file formats cannot be string searched without additional tools. In addition,
                compressed, encrypted, and password-protected files require additional pre-processing before
                a string search.

           –    The use of multi-character data sets that include foreign or Unicode characters can cause
                problems with string searches; some searching tools attempt to overcome this by providing
                language translation functions.

           –    Another possible issue is the inherent limitations of the search tool or algorithm. For
                example, a match might not be found for a search string if part of the string resided in one
                cluster and the rest of the string resided in a nonadjacent cluster. Similarly, some search tools
                might report a false match if part of a search string resided in one cluster and the remainder of
                the string resided in another cluster that was not part of the same file that contained the first
                cluster.
      ! Accessing File Metadata. File metadata provides details about any given file. For example,
        collecting the metadata on a graphic file might provide the graphic’s creation date, copyright
        information, and description, and the creator’s identity.58 Metadata for graphics generated by a
        digital camera might include the make and model of the digital camera used to take the image, as
        well as F-stop, flash, and aperture settings. For word processing files, metadata could specify the
        author, the organization that licensed the software, when and by whom edits were last performed,
        and user-defined comments. Special utilities can extract metadata from files.
4.4      Analysis

After the examination has been completed, the next step is to perform analysis of the extracted data. As
mentioned in Section 4.3.3, there are many tools available that can be helpful in analysis of different types
of data. When using these tools or performing manual reviews of data, analysts should be aware of the
value of using system times and file times. Knowing when an incident occurred, a file was created or
modified, or an e-mail was sent can be critical to forensic analysis. For example, such information can be
used to reconstruct a timeline of activities. Although this may seem like a simple task, it is often

      Analysts may also create hashes of system files periodically; these hash sets are then available when an event occurs so that
      the analyst can quickly eliminate known benign files from examination. Analysts should rely on standard hash sets such as
      those from the NSRL project whenever possible, and create custom hash sets primarily for organization-specific files.
58
      Only certain types of graphics files include metadata; for example, JPEG-format graphics might have metadata, but bitmap-
      format graphics cannot.
