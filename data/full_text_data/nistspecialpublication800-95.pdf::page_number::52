3.5.1.4 Risk Adaptive Access Control

Risk adaptive access control (RAdAC) is another variation on traditional access control methods. As
opposed to RBAC, ABAC, and PBAC, however, RAdAC makes access control decisions on the basis of
a relative risk profile of the subject and not necessarily strictly on the basis of a predefined policy rule.
Figure 3-7 illustrates the logical process governing RAdAC, which uses a combination of a measured
level of risk the subject poses and an assessment of operational need as the primary attributes by which
the subjectâ€™s access rights are determined.

As a policy-driven mechanism, RAdAC is ostensibly an abstraction of PBAC. Unlike PBAC, however, a
RAdAC framework requires associations with sources that are able to provide real-time, situation aware
information upon which risk can be assessed with each authentication request.

3.5.2   Enforcing Least Privilege for Services

Trust and privilege are not synonymous. This said, trusted objects are often used to perform privileged
functions. Least privilege can and should be applied regardless of what access control methodology is in
use. In a Web services environment, each Web service should be designed to not request or expect to
obtain privileges that exceed the minimum privileges it needs to perform its current operation.
