GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



2.2   RFID System Components

RFID systems can be very complex, and implementations vary greatly across industries and sectors. For
purposes of discussion in this document, an RFID system is composed of up to three subsystems:

 An RF subsystem, which performs identification and related transactions using wireless
  communication,
 An enterprise subsystem, which contains computers running specialized software that can store,
  process, and analyze data acquired from RF subsystem transactions to make the data useful to a
  supported business process, and
 An inter-enterprise subsystem, which connects enterprise subsystems when information needs to be
  shared across organizational boundaries.
Every RFID system contains an RF subsystem, and most RFID systems also contain an enterprise
subsystem. An RFID system supporting a supply chain application is a common example of an RFID
system with an inter-enterprise subsystem. In a supply chain application, a tagged product is tracked
throughout its life cycle, from manufacture to final purchase, and sometimes even afterwards (e.g., to
support targeted product recalls).

The characteristics of RFID enterprise and inter-enterprise subsystems are very similar to those of any
networked IT system in terms of the types of computers that reside on them, the protocols they support,
and the security issues they encounter.

Sections 2.3 through 2.5 review each of the subsystems in more detail.

2.3   RF Subsystem

To enable wireless identification, the RF subsystem consists of two components:

 RFID tags (sometimes referred to as transponders), which are small electronic devices that are
  affixed to objects or embedded in them. Each tag has a unique identifier and may also have other
  features such as memory to store additional data, environmental sensors, and security mechanisms.
 RFID readers, which are devices that wirelessly communicate with tags to identify the item
  connected to each tag and possibly associate the tagged item with related data.
Both the tag and the reader are two-way radios. Each has an antenna and is capable of modulating and
demodulating radio signals. Figure 2-1 shows a simple RF subsystem configuration.
