                                     An RFID usage policy is the foundation on which subsequent security
                                     controls are based. The policy should cover all components of the
                                     RFID system, including tags, readers, and support systems (e.g.,
                                     middleware and analytic systems). The policy should distinguish
                                     between the levels of access provided to those that use the system,
                                     those that administer it, and those that need access to its data,
       Establish an RFID usage       including external business partners. For instance, logistics
       policy that specifies what    administrators may be granted the ability to modify a reader’s
       assets should be tagged,      configuration (duty cycle, power output, network settings, RF

       RFID technology, and for      while operations personnel may only be able to scan tags. External
       what business purposes this   parties should almost never get access to an organization’s readers,
       authorization applies.        but they might need read access to certain database elements. The
                                     policy should also address the collection and handling of sensor data
                                     that might be transmitted over the RFID system.
                                     The RFID usage policy should also integrate privacy policies and
                                     practices. All statements made in privacy compliance documentation
                                     should be reflected in and supported by the RFID usage policy.
                                     Federal government agencies are required to create a Privacy Impact
                                     Assessment (PIA) if the RFID system will store or manage personal
                                     information. While privacy policy is not within the scope of this
                                     publication, the technical security controls that result from the policy
                                     are within the scope of the publication. For example, implementation

       policy.
                                     alternative means to disable tags. Requirements related to data
                                     sharing limitations may need to be supported by certain
                                     authentication and access control methods. A privacy policy should
                                     be in place before RFID system architects determine the appropriate
                                     security controls.
