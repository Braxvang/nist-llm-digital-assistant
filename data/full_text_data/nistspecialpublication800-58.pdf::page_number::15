NIST SP 800-58                                              Voice Over IP Security
_____________________________________________________________________________


 1     Introduction


        Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) refers to the transmission of speech across
        data-style networks. This form of transmission is conceptually superior to
        conventional circuit switched communication in many ways. However, a plethora
        of security issues are associated with still-evolving VOIP technology. This
        publication introduces VOIP, its security challenges, and potential
        countermeasures for VOIP vulnerabilities.

 1.1    Authority

        The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this
        document in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal
        Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347.
        NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum
        requirements, for providing adequate information security for all agency
        operations and assets, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to
        national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements of
        the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3),
        “Securing Agency Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV:
        Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental information is provided in A-130,
        Appendix III.

        This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by
        nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to
        copyright, though attribution is desired.

        Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines
        made mandatory and binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce
        under statutory authority, nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or
        superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the
        OMB, or any other Federal official.

 1.2    Document Scope and Purpose

        The purpose of this document is to provide agencies with guidance for
        establishing secure VOIP networks. Agencies are encouraged to tailor the
        recommended guidelines and solutions to meet their specific security or business
        requirements. VOIP security considerations for the public switched telephone
        network are largely outside the scope of this document. Although legal issues
        regarding VOIP are beyond the scope of this document, readers should be aware
        that laws and rulings governing interception or monitoring of VOIP lines, and
        retention of call records, may be different from those for conventional telephone
        systems. Agencies should review these issues with their legal advisors. See
        Section 2.5 for more on this issue.
