SP 800-130                                                                      August 2013



should also have the ability to detect and report to the audit administrator role any
unusual events that should be investigated as soon as possible. The audit capability and
audit log should be protected from unauthorized modification so that the integrity of the
audit system can be assured.

Automated assessment tools, such as those specified in the Security Content Automation
Protocol (SCAP), are becoming increasingly useful in assessing the current status and
integrity of computer systems. These tools can interrogate an operating system to
determine its status in real time (see [SP 800-126]). Software version numbers can be
checked for currency, and the integrity and confidentiality of the data files can be
verified. Monitoring tools may execute on the platform being monitored or on another
platform dedicated to monitoring other hosts. These monitoring tools can detect
modifications to system files or their access control attributes and post alerts and audit
events (see Section 6.8.5).

FR:8.10 The CKMS design shall specify the auditable events supported and indicate
whether each event is fixed or selectable.

FR:8.11 For each selectable, auditable event, the CKMS design shall specify the role(s)
that has the capability to select the event.

FR:8.12 For each auditable event, the CKMS design shall specify the data to be
recorded 21.

FR:8.13 The CKMS design shall specify what automated tools are provided to assess the
correct operation and security of the CKMS.

FR:8.14 The CKMS design shall specify system-monitoring requirements for sensitive
system files to detect and/or prevent their modification or any modification to their
security attributes, such as their access control lists.

8.3 Network Security Control Mechanisms
This section addresses the network security control mechanisms for each of the computer
systems involved in the CKMS. Examples of network security control mechanisms
include:
    a) Firewalls,
    b) Filtering Routers,
    c) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs),
    d) Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS),
    e) Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS),
    f) Adaptive Network Security Controls,

   Examples of recorded data include the unique event identifier, the date and time of the event,
the subject (e.g., user, role or software process) causing the event, the success or failure of the
event and the event-specific data.
