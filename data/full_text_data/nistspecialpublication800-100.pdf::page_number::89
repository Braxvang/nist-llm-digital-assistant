can be without the critical resource then provides a recourse recovery priority around
which an organization can plan recovery activities. The balancing point between the
MAO and the cost to recover establishes the information system’s recovery time
objective (RTO). Recovery strategies must be created to meet the RTO.
   The strategy must also address recovering information system critical
components within a priority, as established by their individual RTOs.
9.3 Step 3: Identify Preventive Controls
   In some cases, implementing preventive controls might mitigate outage impacts
identified by the BIA. Preventive controls are measures that detect, deter, and/or
reduce impacts to the system. When cost-effective, preventing an impact is desired
over implementing recovery strategies (and therefore risking data loss and impact to
the organization). Preventive measures are specific to individual components and
the environment in which the components operate. Common controls include:
    • Uninterruptible power supply (UPS);
    • Fire suppression systems;
    • Gasoline or diesel-powered generators;
    • Air conditioning systems with excess capacity to permit failure of certain
      components;
    • Heat-resistant and waterproof containers for backup media and vital
    • nonelectronic records; and
    • Frequent, scheduled data backups.

within the RTO period. The recovery strategy is designed from a combination of
methods, which together address the full spectrum of information system risks.
Several options may be evaluated during the Development phase; the most cost-
effective option, based on potential impact, should be selected and integrated into
the information system architecture and operating procedures.

for conducting data backups.
The frequency of backup methods—daily or weekly, incremental or full—should be
selected based on system criticality when new information is introduced. The backup
method selected should be based on system and data availability and integrity
requirements (as defined in the BIA). Data that is backed up may need to be stored
offsite and rotated frequently, depending upon the criticality of the system.
    Major disruptions to system operations may require restoration activities to be
implemented at an alternate site. The type of alternate site selected must be based
on RTO requirements and budget limitations. Equipment for recovering and/or
replacing the information system must be provided as part of the recovery strategy.
Cost, delivery time, and compatibility factors must also be considered when
