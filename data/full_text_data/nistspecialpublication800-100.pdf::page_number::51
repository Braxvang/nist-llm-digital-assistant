CHAPTER 5                                          Capital Planning and Investment Control


       • Compliance gap: the difference between the desired and actual compliance
         with the security requirements. For example, if an information system has
         completed 80 percent of security certification and accreditation activities, that
         investment would have a security certification and accreditation compliance gap
         of 20 percent. (The actual compliance of 80 percent is subtracted from the
         desired compliance of 100 percent to yield a 20 percent compliance gap.) The
         smaller the compliance gap, the more compliant the system or enterprise
         control. For key information security activities, this information is part of the
         FISMA report.
       • Corrective action impact: the ratio of compliance gap to corrective action
         cost. As shown in Figure 5-5, the corrective action impact is calculated by
         dividing the compliance gap percentage by the cost to implement the
         corresponding corrective
         action(s). This ratio
         provides a proportion of
         result to cost. The
         higher the impact
         proportion, the more
         “bang for the buck” the        Figure 5-5. Corrective Action Impact Calculation
         corrective action will provide. The resulting proportion is multiplied by 100,000
         to facilitate further calculations.
    After assembling process inputs, conduct the following four steps to complete the
prioritization process:
           1. Rank-order prioritized corrective action categories according to selected
              prioritization criteria in order of importance to the agency;
           2. Rank-order agency systems according to system category;
           3. Calculate the security compliance gaps at the enterprise and investment
              levels; and
           4. Calculate the corrective action impact at the enterprise and investment
              levels.
    Both enterprise- and system-level prioritization should be performed and then
overlapped to ensure that appropriate agency priorities receive funding
commensurate with their risk levels. Prioritization may be facilitated using a
spreadsheet or a more sophisticated automation tool. 41 Visualization of the
prioritization may be used to facilitate the decision-making process.
    Figure 5-6 demonstrates an example of a corrective action prioritization
visualization approach using notional data. From a system-level perspective, Figure
5-6 plots system category along the vertical axis and corrective action impact along
the horizontal axis. The notional agency systems are denoted as the small letters at
the top of each quadrant. In this example, systems “N” and “F” were found to have
category rankings of “high” and corrective action impacts of “great.”

     Figures 4-6 and 4-8 on pages 31 and 34 (respectively) in NIST SP 800-65 provide examples of how
     spreadsheets can be used to facilitate the prioritization process.
