136   Call for Patent Claims

137   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims
138   whose use would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this
139   Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or
140   requirements may be directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another
141   publication. This call also includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending
142   U.S. or foreign patent applications relating to this ITL draft publication and of any
143   relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.
144   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its
145   behalf, in written or electronic form, either:
146      a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not
147         hold and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
148     b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available
149        to applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the
150        guidance or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:
151            i. under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
152               discrimination; or
153           ii. without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
154               demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.
155   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make
156   assurances on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents
157   subject to the assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the
158   assurance are binding on the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include
159   appropriate provisions in the event of future transfers with the goal of binding each
160   successor-in-interest.
161   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
162   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.
163   Such statements should be addressed to: mailto:piv comments@nist.gov.
