methods of address assignment and authentication. These issues are discussed in RFC 4640.36 A
distinction is made between the case in which the same service provider offers mobility and provides
authorization and the case in which these functions are split between service providers. Proposals for
providing bootstrapping information with DHCPv6 and making bootstrapping work with RADIUS
(Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service ) authentication are under discussion. A solution has been
developed for the split case (different home network and mobile providers) in RFC 5026, Mobile IPv6
Bootstrapping in Split Scenario.

A MN with dual IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stacks could run both MIPv4 and MIPv6, but this would be
expensive and also awkward if the mobility protocols are not integrated. It also raises security issues, not
the least of which is the need to include the completely different approaches to security in MIPv4 and
MIPv6. One immediate question is which versions of IP the foreign link supports. A second is whether
the same HA supports both MIPv4 and MIPv6. A third is which protocols the CNs are capable of using.
None of the tunneling mechanisms designed to help IPv4-to-IPv6 transition includes specific support for
mobility. Because mobility is essentially a tunneling protocol, ways exist, in principle, to use a single HA
and a single CoA (IPv4 or IPv6) to deliver either IPv4 or IPv6 packets. One such solution, documented in
RFC 5555, allows dual stack systems to run both IPv6 and IPv4 over MIPv6. It also handles Network
Address Translation (NAT) in the IPv4 networks.

The MIPv6 HA is a single point of failure. Switching HAs requires detecting failure, finding an
alternative HA, transferring state, and reestablishing security. Different solutions are possible: a MN
could maintain connectivity with a ―hot spare‖ HA, the HA could share state with backup systems, or the
MN could, in effect, start over when a failure is detected. These involve different tradeoffs, and solutions
are under discussion37. Another case being considered is when, for load balancing, planned outages, or
other reasons, a HA can announce that it will no longer be available.

4.5      Jumbograms

RFC 2675 defines an IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Option called jumbograms, which allows an IPv6 packet to
contain a payload longer than 65,535 octets. Jumbograms are only defined for IPv6 interfaces that may
be attached to links with a MTU greater than 65,575 octets. Other interfaces can ignore jumbograms.
Many IPv6 implementations allow jumbograms but do not support any link layers that can handle them
(except the loopback interface).

     4.5.1   Specification Overview

The 16-bit Payload Length in the IPv6 Header is set to zero and the Hop-by-Hop Jumbo Payload Option,
Type C2 base 16 (1100 0010), must be included right after the header. It specifies a 32-bit Payload
Length. Jumbograms must be at least 65,536 bytes and must not be fragmented.

Common transport payloads such as TCP and UDP have packet size limits (in the UDP length field and
the TCP MSS [Maximum Segment Size] option and Urgent field), so modifications are needed for them
to use jumbograms.

     4.5.2   Security Ramifications

RFC 2675 says, ―The Jumbo Payload option and TCP/UDP jumbograms do not introduce any known new
