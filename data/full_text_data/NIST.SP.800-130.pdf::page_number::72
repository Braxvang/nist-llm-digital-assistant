FR:6.114 The CKMS design shall specify the mechanisms used to detect unauthorized
modifications to the CKMS system hardware, software and data.

FR:6.115 The CKMS design shall specify how the CKMS recovers from unauthorized
modifications to the CKMS system hardware, software and data.

6.8.6 Network Security Controls and Compromise Recovery
The compromise of network security controls that provide protection to the CKMS could
result in the compromise of the CKMS itself. The scope of network security controls
includes boundary devices, such as a firewall, a VPN, an intrusion detection system, and
an intrusion protection system. The scope of network security controls excludes
cryptographic functions, cryptographic protocols, and cryptographic services, except
when used for the operation of the aforementioned network security control devices.

The following are some of the examples of compromises of network security controls:

   a) The physical compromise of a network security control device,
   b) A compromise of one or more cryptographic keys used by a network security
      control device,
   c) A compromise of one or more keys used to administer the network security
      control device,
   d) A change in the network architecture resulting in a compromise (e.g., someone
      connecting a VPN-connected workstation to an unsecure network and the VPN
      workstation being used to attack the Intranet),
   e) A compromise of a privileged user password (e.g., a system administratorâ€™s
      password),
   f) A compromise of a platform operating system,
   g) A compromise of a network security application (e.g., a firewall, IDS, etc.), and
   h) A compromise due to a new attack on a protocol.

If physical security is compromised, the device should be replaced with a new device and
physical security controls should be reviewed, repaired, and enhanced, as appropriate.

If device or administration keys are compromised, the keys should be replaced. An
assessment should be conducted to determine the cause of the compromise, the extent of
the damage, and corrective actions should be taken. In the unlikely event of the security
strength of the key being an issue, the key sizes may need to be increased and/or more
secure cryptographic algorithms may need to be used.

If the network architecture assumptions are violated, the cause of the violation should be
reviewed, and appropriate actions should be taken.

Compromised network devices should be restored to a secure state before normal
operation is continued.
