NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                                Guidelines for Media Sanitization


                             necessary to cause all MEKs to be changed (if the requirements described in this
                             document have been satisfied). Refer to the TCG and device manufacturers for more
                             information.
                             Optionally: After Cryptographic Erase is successfully applied to a device, use the
                             overwrite command (if supported) to write one pass of zeros or a pseudorandom
                             pattern across the media. If the overwrite command is not supported, the Secure
                             Erase or the Clear procedure could alternatively be applied following Cryptographic
                             Erase.
                        4.   Degauss in an organizationally approved automatic degausser or disassemble the hard
                             disk drive and Purge the enclosed platters with an organizationally approved
                             degaussing wand.

   Destroy:         Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:           Verification must be performed for each technique within Clear and Purge, except degaussing.
                    The assurance provided by degaussing depends on selecting an effective degausser, applying it
                    appropriately and periodically spot checking the results to ensure it is working as expected.
                    When using the three pass ATA sanitize overwrite procedure with the invert option, the
                    verification process would simply search for the original pattern (which would have been written
                    again during the third pass).
                    The storage device may support configuration capabilities that artificially restrict the ability to
                    access portions of the media as defined in the ATA standard, such as a Host Protected Area
                    (HPA), Device Configuration Overlay (DCO), or Accessible Max Address. Even when a
                    dedicated sanitization command addresses these areas, their presence may affect the ability to
                    reliably verify the effectiveness of the sanitization procedure if left in place. Any configuration
                    options limiting the ability to access the entire addressable area of the storage media should be
                    reset prior to applying the sanitization technique. Recovery data, such as an OEM-provided
                    restoration image may have been stored in this manner, and sanitization may therefore impact
                    the ability to recover the system unless reinstallation media is also available.
                    When Cryptographic Erase is applied, verification must be performed prior to additional
                    sanitization techniques (if applicable), such as a Clear or Purge technique applied following
                    Cryptographic Erase, to ensure that the cryptographic operation completed successfully. A quick
                    sampling verification as described in section 4.7 should also be performed after any additional
                    techniques are applied following Cryptographic Erase.
                    Not all implementations of encryption are necessarily suitable for reliance upon Cryptographic
                    Erase as a Purge mechanism. The decision regarding whether to use Cryptographic Erase
                    depends upon verification of attributes previously identified in this guidance and in Appendix D.
                    Given the variability in implementation of the ATA Security feature set SECURITY ERASE UNIT
                    command, use of this command is not recommended without first consulting with the
                    manufacturer to verify that the storage deviceâ€™s model-specific implementation meets the needs
                    of the organization.
                    This guidance applies to Legacy Magnetic media only, and it is critical to verify the media type
                    prior to sanitization. Note that emerging media types, such as HAMR media or hybrid drives may
                    not be easily identifiable by the label. Refer to the manufacturer for details about the media type
                    in a storage device.
                    Degaussing the media in a storage device typically renders the device unusable.

   SCSI Hard Disk Drives This includes Parallel SCSI,Serial Attached SCSI (SAS), Fibre Channel, USB Attached
   Storage (UAS), and SCSI Express Partial sanitization is not supported in this section.

   Clear:           Overwrite media by using organizationally approved and validated overwriting
                    technologies/methods/tools. The Clear procedure should consist of at least one pass of writes
                    with a fixed data value, such as all zeros. Multiple passes or more complex values may
                    optionally be used.

   Purge:           Four options are available:
                        1. Apply the SCSI SANITIZE command, if supported. One or both of the following options
