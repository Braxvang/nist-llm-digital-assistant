3.2.2       Identify Resource Requirements

Realistic recovery efforts require a thorough evaluation of the resources required to resume
mission/business processes as quickly as possible. Working with management and internal and external
POCs associated with the system, the ISCP Coordinator should ensure that the complete information
system resources are identified. 21 A simple table such as the one shown in Table 3-1 can be used to
capture relevant information system resources.

                               Table 3-1: Information System Resource/Component Table

                        System                    Platform/OS/Version (as                    Description
               Resource/Component                        applicable)
              Application Server                 Sun V245/ Solaris / v10.0             Serves as the main
                                                                                       application server




3.2.3       Identify System Resource Recovery Priorities

Developing recovery priorities is the last step of the BIA process. Recovery priorities can be effectively
established taking into consideration mission/business process criticality, outage impacts, tolerable
downtime, and system resources. The result is an information system recovery priority hierarchy. The
ISCP Coordinator should consider system recovery measures and technologies to meet the recovery
priorities.

3.3         Identify Preventive Controls

In some cases, the outage impacts identified in the BIA may be mitigated or eliminated through
preventive measures that deter, detect, and/or reduce impacts to the system. Where feasible and cost-
effective, preventive methods are preferable to actions that may be necessary to recover the system after a
disruption. Step 2 of the RMF includes the identification of effective contingency planning preventive
controls and maintaining these controls on an ongoing basis. A variety of preventive controls are
identified in NIST SP 800-53, depending on system type and configuration; some common measures are
listed below:

           Appropriately sized uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) to provide short-term backup power to
            all system components (including environmental and safety controls);
           Gasoline- or diesel-powered generators to provide long-term backup power;
           Air-conditioning systems with adequate excess capacity to prevent failure of certain components,
            such as a compressor;
           Fire suppression systems;
           Fire and smoke detectors;
           Water sensors in the computer room ceiling and floor;

     To avoid duplication of effort, this information may be obtained from the system component inventory and the system software
     inventory.
