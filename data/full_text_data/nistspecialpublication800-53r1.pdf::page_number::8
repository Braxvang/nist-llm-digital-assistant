CHAPTER ONE

INTRODUCTION
THE NEED FOR SECURITY CONTROLS TO PROTECT INFORMATION SYSTEMS

       he selection and employment of appropriate security controls for an information system 3

T      are important tasks that can have major implications on the operations 4 and assets of an
       organization as well as the welfare of individuals. Security controls are the management,
operational, and technical safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for an information system to
protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information. There are
several important questions that should be answered by organizational officials when addressing
the security considerations for their information systems:
•      What security controls are needed to adequately protect the information systems that support
       the operations and assets of the organization in order for that organization to accomplish its
       assigned mission, protect its assets, fulfill its legal responsibilities, maintain its day-to-day
       functions, and protect individuals?
•      Have the selected security controls been implemented or is there a realistic plan for their
       implementation?
•      What is the desired or required level of assurance (i.e., grounds for confidence) that the
       selected security controls, as implemented, are effective 5 in their application?

The answers to these questions are not given in isolation but rather in the context of an effective
information security program for the organization that identifies, controls, and mitigates risks to
its information and information systems. 6 The security controls defined in Special Publication
800-53 and recommended for use by organizations in protecting their information systems should
be employed in conjunction with and as part of a well-defined and documented information
security program. An effective information security program should include:
•      Periodic assessments of risk, including the magnitude of harm that could result from the
       unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information
       and information systems that support the operations and assets of the organization;
•      Policies and procedures that are based on risk assessments, cost-effectively reduce
       information security risks to an acceptable level and address information security throughout
       the life cycle of each organizational information system;

3
 An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized expressly for the collection, processing,
maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. Information systems also include specialized
systems such as industrial/process controls systems, telephone switching/private branch exchange (PBX) systems, and
environmental control systems.
4
    Organizational operations include mission, functions, image, and reputation.
5
  Security control effectiveness addresses the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as
intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the information
system in its operational environment.
6
  The E-Government Act (P.L. 107-347), passed by the one hundred and seventh Congress and signed into law by the
President in December 2002, recognized the importance of information security to the economic and national security
interests of the United States. Title III of the E-Government Act, entitled the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA), emphasizes the need for organizations to develop, document, and implement an
organization-wide program to provide security for the information systems that support its operations and assets.
