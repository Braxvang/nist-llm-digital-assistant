                                   the alternate site should be fully configured
                                   as defined in the plan.)

                                   information and ensure that backup copies
                                   are stored in a separate facility.)



3.6        Plan Maintenance

To be effective, the plan must be maintained in a ready state that accurately reflects system requirements,
procedures, organizational structure, and policies. During the Operation/Maintenance phase of the SDLC,
information systems undergo frequent changes because of shifting business needs, technology upgrades,
or new internal or external policies. Therefore, it is essential that the ISCP be reviewed and updated
regularly as part of the organization’s change management process to ensure that new information is
documented and contingency measures are revised if required. As identified as part of RMF Step 6
(Continuous Monitoring), a continuous monitoring process can provide organizations with an effective
tool for plan maintenance, producing ongoing updates to security plans, security assessment reports, and
plans of action and milestone documents.

As a general rule, the plan should be reviewed for accuracy and completeness at an organization-defined
frequency or whenever significant changes occur to any element of the plan. Certain elements, such as
contact lists, will require more frequent reviews. The plans for moderate- or high-impact systems should
be reviewed more often. At a minimum, plan reviews should focus on the following elements:

         Operational requirements;
         Security requirements;
         Technical procedures;
         Hardware, software, and other equipment (types, specifications, and amount);
         Names and contact information of team members;
