Measure 19: System and Information Integrity (SI) (program-level and system-level)
         Field                                                 Data
Measure ID       System and Information Integrity 1 (or a unique identifier to be filled out by the
                 organization)
Goal             •   Strategic Goal: Accelerate the development and use of an electronic information
                     infrastructure.
                 •   Information Security Goal: Provide protection from malicious code at appropriate
                     locations within organizational information systems, monitor information systems
                     security alerts and advisories, and take appropriate actions in response.
Measure          Percentage (%) of operating system vulnerabilities for which patches have been applied
                 or that have been otherwise mitigated
                 NIST SP 800-53 Controls – SI-2: Flaw Remediation
Measure Type     Implementation and Effectiveness/Efficiency
Formula          (Number of vulnerabilities addressed in distributed alerts and advisories for which
                 patches have been implemented, determined as non-applicable, or granted a waiver/total
                 number of applicable vulnerabilities identified through alerts and advisories and through
                 vulnerability scans) *100
Target           This should be a high percentage defined by the organization.
Implementation   1. Does the organization distribute alerts and advisories (SI-5)?
Evidence
                      Yes                       No

                 2. How many vulnerabilities were identified by analyzing distributed alerts and advisories
                 (SI-5)? _____

                 3. How many vulnerabilities were identified through vulnerability scans (RA-5)? _____

                 4. How many patches or work-arounds were implemented to address identified
                 vulnerabilities (SI-2)? _____

                 5. How many vulnerabilities were determined to be non-applicable (SI-2)? _____

                 6. How many waivers have been granted for weaknesses that could not be remediated by
                 implementing patches or work-arounds? _____
