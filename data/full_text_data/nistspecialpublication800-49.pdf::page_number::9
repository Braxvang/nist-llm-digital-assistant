1 Introduction
S/MIME (Secure / Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a set of specifications for securing
electronic mail. S/MIME is based upon the widely used MIME standard [MIME] and describes a
protocol for adding cryptographic security services through MIME encapsulation of digitally
signed and encrypted objects. The basic security services offered by S/MIME are authentication,
non-repudiation of origin, message integrity, and message privacy. Optional security services
include signed receipts, security labels, secure mailing lists, and an extended method of
identifying the signerâ€™s certificate(s).

S/MIME Version 3 is the latest version of S/MIME. Version 3 is specified in IETF RFCs 2630
through 2634 ([RFC2630], [RFC2631], [RFC2632], [RFC2633], and [RFC2634]).

The S/MIME specifications were designed to promote interoperable secure electronic mail, such
that two compliant implementations would be able to communicate securely with one another.
However, implementations may support different optional services, and the specifications may
unintentionally allow multiple interpretations. As a result, different implementations of S/MIME
may not be fully interoperable or provide the desired level of security.

The S/MIME specifications rely on cryptographic mechanisms and public key infrastructures
(PKI) to provide security services. If the cryptographic and PKI components that are used to
support the S/MIME implementation are sufficiently robust, users can obtain additional
assurance that sufficiently strong cryptographic algorithms are used, and that procedures are in
place to protect sensitive information.

Conformance to this profile helps to assure that S/MIME implementations will be able to
interoperate and provide reasonable assurance to users.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Information Technology
Laboratory, Computer Security Division, has developed this S/MIME client profile as guidance
in the development and procurement of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) S/MIME-compliant
products. This profile document identifies requirements for a secure and interoperable S/MIME
V3 client implementation. NIST is developing tests and testing tools to determine the level of
conformance of an S/MIME V3 client implementation with this profile.

This profile does not address requirements for network infrastructure components that implement
S/MIME V3, such as mail list agents (MLAs) and secure mail gateways (e.g., security guards).
Such systems will have significant overlap but will have additional requirements specific to their
function.

The remainder of this document is organized into four principal sections: (a) S/MIME Profile
requirements; (b) Support for Enhanced Security Services (ESS); (c) Optional Features and
Notes on Testing; and (d) References. In addition, there is a non-Normative Appendix on
Cryptographic Algorithms. The profile requirements describe the minimum functionality
required to support secure and interoperable S/MIME client implementations. The support for
