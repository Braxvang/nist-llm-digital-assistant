                                                             Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

4.6   Generic On-Site Decision Tree

      Figure 7 illustrates an example of an on-site decision tree that may be used as a general
      guideline for organizations and agencies. This provides a starting point intended for
      customization allowing alignment with existing policies and procedures. The following list
      describes some of the actions and decision points contained within the tree.

             Unlocked/Undamaged – Is the device in an unlocked state and functional permitting a
              manual or logical data extraction?

             Urgent – Do circumstances exist such that data extraction is required on site?

             Lab less than 2 hours away – Can the mobile device be transported to a forensics
              laboratory in less than 2 hours?

             Tool/Training – Is the device supported by the tool and has the examiner received
              proper training?

             Contact Expert – The on-site examiner should contact an expert for additional
              assistance and guidance.

             Battery More than 50% – Does the device show that it has more than 50% remaining
              battery power?

             Need More Data - After the extraction is successful and the examiner has reviewed
              the results, is additional information or analysis required?
