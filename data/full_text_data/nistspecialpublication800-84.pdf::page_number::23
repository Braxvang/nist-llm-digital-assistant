                                         GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



and coordination requirements. Once the appropriate participants have been identified, they should
receive a written invitation or announcement of the exercise as soon as possible. This is typically
accomplished in the form of an e-mail or memorandum by a member of the tabletop exercise design team,
but, if more appropriate, may instead be distributed by a member of management.

4.2.5     Identify the Tabletop Exercise Staff

The design team usually designates an exercise facilitator, who leads the discussion among the exercise
participants, and a data collector, who records information about the actions that occur during the
exercise. The facilitator and the data collector should be thoroughly familiar with the content of the IT
plan being exercised and with the exercise objectives. The facilitator and data collector should meet
before the event to discuss the details surrounding the exercise, including its scope and objectives. At this
time, the facilitator and the data collector review the results from previous tabletop exercises, if
applicable, to heighten their awareness of potential issues before the event.

4.2.6     Coordinate the Logistics

One person on the design team should typically be responsible for coordinating the exercise eventâ€™s
logistics. The logistics coordinator usually begins to do this at least one month before the conduct of the
tabletop exercise. The checklist in Table 4-1 can be used as a starting point by the logistics coordinator to
ensure the necessary tasks are completed.

Select a date for exercise conduct
Reserve a conference room that will accommodate all participants
Determine the need for audio/visual equipment
Reserve audio/visual equipment, if applicable
Identify the facilitator and data collector
Identify participants
Invite participants
Coordinate the development of the facilitator guide and participant guides
Arrange for the printing of name tents
Ensure conference room is available in sufficient time before the exercise to
perform setup
Arrange for refreshments, if appropriate
Copy all files as a backup onto a CD-ROM, USB flash drive, or other
removable media



4.3     Develop the Tabletop Exercise Material

Once the event is designed, the design team should assign roles and responsibilities to its members to
develop the tabletop exercise material. Tabletop exercises typically include the following documentation:

       Briefing. A briefing is created for the participants; it includes an agenda and logistics
        information.
