A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



4.2 The Interpretation of Empirical Results
Three scenarios typify events that may occur due to empirical testing. Case 1: The analysis of the P-
values does not indicate a deviation from randomness. Case 2: The analysis clearly indicates a deviation
from randomness. Case 3: The analysis is inconclusive.

The interpretation of empirical results can be conducted in any number of ways. Two approaches NIST
has adopted include (1) the examination of the proportion of sequences that pass a statistical test and (2)
the distribution of P-values to check for uniformity. The file finalAnalysisReport.txt contains the results
of these two forms of analysis.

In the event that either of these approaches fails (i.e., the corresponding null hypothesis must be rejected),
additional numerical experiments should be conducted on different samples of the generator to determine
whether the phenomenon was a statistical anomaly or a clear evidence of non-randomness.

4.2.1   Proportion of Sequences Passing a Test
                                      Given the empirical results for a particular statistical test,
                                      compute the proportion of sequences that pass. For
                                      example, if 1000 binary sequences were tested (i.e., m =
                                      1000), α = 0.01 (the significance level), and 996 binary
                                      sequences had P-values ≥ .01, then the proportion is
                                      996/1000 = 0.9960.

                                                  The range of acceptable proportions is determined using
                                                                                                 p̂( 1 − p̂ )
                                                  the confidence interval defined as, p̂ ± 3                  ,
                                                                                                      m
                                                  where p = 1-α, and m is the sample size. If the proportion
                                                  falls outside of this interval, then there is evidence that the
           Figure 4-1: P-value Plot
                                                  data is non-random. Note that other standard deviation
                                                  values could be used. For the example above, the
confidence interval is .99 ± 3 .99(.01 ) = .99 ± 0.0094392 (i.e., the proportion should lie above 0.9805607. This
                                1000
can be illustrated using a graph as shown in Figure 4-1. The confidence interval was calculated using a
normal distribution as an approximation to the binomial distribution, which is reasonably accurate for
large sample sizes (e.g., n ≥ 1000).
