         to ensure that the information has been properly expunged [Len03].27 These activities
         should be carried out in compliance with an agency’s records management policy.

Having an exit strategy established early in the planning stage, and periodically reviewing and
updating its contents, can minimize the problems encountered with the termination of a service
agreement, and the effort required to transition applications to another service provider or return
them to the organization’s data center.

5.5     Summary of Recommendations
Table 3 below summarizes the issues and recommendations that apply at the various stages of
outsourcing. They are complementary to those given earlier in Table 1, which stem from
specific security and privacy issues.

                            Table 3: Outsourcing Activities and Recommendations


Areas                      Recommendations

                           Identify security, privacy, and other organizational requirements for cloud services to
                           meet, as a criterion for selecting a cloud provider.
                           Analyze the security and privacy controls of a cloud provider’s environment and assess
Preliminary Activities
                           the level of risk involved with respect to the control objectives of the organization.
                           Evaluate the cloud provider’s ability and commitment to deliver cloud services over the
                           target timeframe and meet the security and privacy levels stipulated.

                           Ensure that all contractual requirements are explicitly recorded in the service agreement,
                           including privacy and security provisions, and that they are endorsed by the cloud
                           provider.
Initiating and             Involve a legal advisor in the review of the service agreement and in any negotiations
Coincident Activities      about the terms of service.
                           Continually assess the performance of the cloud provider and the quality of the services
                           provisioned to ensure all contract obligations are being met and to manage and mitigate
                           risk.

                           Alert the cloud provider about any contractual requirements that must be observed upon
                           termination.
                           Revoke all physical and electronic access rights assigned to the cloud provider and
Concluding Activities      recover physical tokens and badges in a timely manner.
                           Ensure that organizational resources made available to or held by the cloud provider
                           under the terms of service agreement are returned or recovered in a usable form, and
                           that information has been properly expunged.
