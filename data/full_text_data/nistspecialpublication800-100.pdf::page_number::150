Q. Why is a thorough awareness and training program vital to a security
   program?
A. The workforce is the largest component of the information security solution. It
   comprises the resources that:
   • Develop policy and procedures;
   • Design and develop applications and systems;
   • Implement and monitor security controls;
   • Ensure regulatory compliance;
   • Manage mission and business objectives; and
   • Use the information.
   In terms of the total security solution, the importance of the workforce in
   achieving information security goals and the importance of training as a
   countermeasure cannot be overstated. Establishing and maintaining a robust and
   relevant information security awareness and training program, as part of the
   overall information security program, is the primary conduit for providing the
   workforce with the information and tools needed to protect an agency’s vital
   information resources. Agencies that continually train their workforce in
   organizational security policy and role-based security responsibilities will have a
   higher rate of success in protecting information.
Q. What is security awareness?
A. “Awareness” constitutes the point-of-entry for all employees in pursuing IT
   security knowledge. Awareness seeks to focus an individual’s attention on an
   issue or a set of issues. Awareness is not training.
   Security awareness programs provide a blended solution of activities that
   promote security, establish accountability, and inform the workforce of security
