empowered to prevent risk from being documented and discussed. Centralized processes
also allow for the standardization of the risk assessment and the amount of “acceptable
risk” across different programs’ releases.
As part of their risk analysis, agencies should specifcally evaluate the anticipated negative
actions that might result from re-identifcation, as well as strategies for remediation. It
is diffcult to measure re-identifcation risk in ways that are both general and meaningful.
Such calculations may result in different levels of risk for different groups. There may
be some individuals in a dataset who would be signifcantly adversely impacted by re-
identifcation and for whom the likelihood of re-identifcation might be quite high, but
these individuals may represent a tiny fraction of the entire dataset. This represents an
important area for research in the feld of risk communication.
NIST provides guidance for conducting privacy risk assessments in NIST Internal Report
(NISTIR) 8062, “An Introduction to Privacy Engineering and Risk Management in Federal
Systems” [22], the NIST Privacy Framework: A Tool for Improving Privacy through Enter-
prise Risk Management, and the NIST Privacy Risk Assessment Methodology (PRAM) [20],
all of which can be downloaded from the NIST privacy engineering resources page located
at https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/privacy-engineering/resources.
Less has been published regarding quantitative approaches for assessing the beneft of data
releases. An Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) report on
the organization’s Open, Useful, and Re-usable data (OURdata) Index states:
           Open government data promotes transparency, accountability and value
      creation by making government data available to all with no restriction for
      its re-use. Public bodies produce and commission huge quantities of data and
      information. By making their datasets available, public institutions become
      more transparent and accountable to citizens. By encouraging the use, reuse
      and free distribution of datasets, governments promote business creation and
      innovative, citizen-centric services. [116]
The OURdata index rates more than 30 countries according to their data availability and
accessibility and government support for data reuse, but these metrics are relative because
the report does not attempt to quantify the benefts of data release. At a 2018 conference,
Ben Snaith, Peter Wells, and Anna Scott of the Open Data Institute wrote, “Is it possible
to measure the value of data? Many now recognise how important data is [sic], but how it
should be governed and regulated is often confused by a lack of consensus on how it can
be valued” [142].
When conducting a risk analysis, agencies should consider whether the de-identifed data
will be made publicly available or only be distributed in a controlled manner with some
sort of data-sharing agreement. Controlled distributions combined with data-sharing agree-
ments that prohibit re-identifcation can signifcantly lower the risk of re-identifcation
