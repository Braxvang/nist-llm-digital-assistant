Export promotion and merchandise inspection missions are generally tolerant of significant
delays. If the export promotion and merchandise inspection information are time-critical, the
availability impact may be high. This would be the case where such an occurrence could
result in significant financial consequences as a result of uncertainty regarding the status of
an imported or exported shipment.

Tariffs/quotas monitoring missions are also tolerant of significant delays. Typically, this
information is used in high level policy and strategic analysis, and denial of access might
cause an inconvenience but no significant mission impact. However, the availability impact
associated with tariffs/quotas monitoring information may be high, if denial of access could
result in serious damage to the image or reputation of an agency resulting from uncertainty
regarding the compliance statistics of a major sovereign trade partner.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
global trade information is high.

D.6 Natural Resources
The Natural Resources mission area includes all activities involved in conservation planning,
land management, and national park/monument tourism that affect the nation's natural and
recreational resources, both private and federal. Note: Energy-related natural resources are
covered in the Energy Management mission area.

D.6.1 Water Resource Management Information Type

Water Resource Management includes all activities that promote the effective use and
management of the nation’s water resources. Notes: Environmental protection of water resources
is included in the Environmental Management Line of Business. Hydroelectric energy
production is included under the Energy Production mission. The recommended provisional
categorization of the water resource management information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of water resource
management information on the ability of responsible agencies to promote the effective use and
management of the nation’s water resources. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of
most water resource management information would have, at most, a limited adverse effect on
agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: There may be some cases for which
moderate confidentiality impact is associated with unauthorized disclosure of business/industry
development. For example, unauthorized disclosure of details of current agency water resource
management activities and plans may focus opposition and/or give an unfair advantage to
competing interests. Consistent premature disclosure of agency plans may cause significant
degradation in mission capability.
