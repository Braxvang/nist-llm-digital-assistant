NIST SP 800-166                                                    DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                   DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

                         an id-ad-caIssuers (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2) accessMethod, which points
                         to the location where the certificates issued to the issuer of this
                         certificate can be found.
 DTR(s)                  • DTR-07.03.02.07
 Issuer Documentation    None.

 Precondition(s)         •    A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                              appropriate token reader.
                         •    Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                              an instance of the reader.
                         •    A digital signature certificate is present within the Derived PIV
                              Application.
 Test Scenario           1. Send the SELECT command with
                               • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                         2. Send the GET DATA command with
                               • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                  ('5FC10A') of the X.509 Certificate for
                                  Digital Signature data object.
                         3. Extract the value of the authorityInfoAccess
                            extension from the certificate.
 Expected Result(s)      1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                            template with the status word '90 00'.
                         2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                            along with the status word '90 00'.
                         3. From Step 3, the authorityInfoAccess extension contains an id-
                            ad-caIssuers (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2) accessMethod with an
                            accessLocation of type uniformResourceIdentifier where the
                            scheme is “http” or “ldap.”

9.3.2.7 Asymmetric Key Pair

 Test Assertion          TA-09.03.02.07
 Purpose                 Verifies that the public key that exists in the digital signature
                         certificate corresponds to the private key within the Derived PIV
                         Application.

 Precondition(s)         • A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                             appropriate token reader.
                         • Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and

                         • A digital signature certificate is present within the Derived PIV
                             Application.
                         • The Derived PIV Application Password is recorded.
                         • The Derived PIV Application Password’s retry counter is not 0.
