would be provided for ports 1-4, while another would be provided for ports 5-8. While all eight
ports are physically connected to a single device, each port is only logically connected to the
other ports within its VLAN.

E.1.4. Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
Traditional networking switches are responsible for both forwarding packets (data plane) and
running the distributed algorithms that determine routing (control plane). SDN is a technology
that evolves this concept by keeping the data plane at the switch and moving the control plane to
a centralized controller. The centralized controller acts as an abstraction layer for network
programmability, eliminating the need to individually manage each switch within the network.
SDN allows for easy dynamic reconfiguration of the data plane, which can in turn allow for the
quick isolation of devices or redirection and duplication of traffic for monitoring and data
capture. Utilizing SDN technology within an OT environment gives asset owners greater
flexibility when initially designing their network architectures and when updating them in the
future.

E.2.   Network Monitoring â€“ Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
Network monitoring technologies allow OT network owners to maintain situational awareness of
their controlled processes and support cybersecurity objectives, such as event or anomaly
detection. OT vendors often market their network monitoring technology as being capable of
integrating with SIEM technologies. These systems collect data through log aggregation and
network scanning tools, detect threats through analytics, and can provide automated incident
response. Capabilities continue to be added, including the use of ML and AI to improve
detection and reduce unnecessary alerts. OT owners must exercise caution when implementing
these technologies as they can directly impact the availability of the controlled process.

E.2.1. Centralized Logging
System and network logs from all sources in an environment are the foundation of SIEM. Logs
act as the primary historical artifact for incident response. When aggregated at a central location,
logs can be analyzed together to provide a holistic view of the network state. A SIEM will utilize
a variety of sensors strategically placed within a target network to collect logs from endpoints
and network traffic information, which are then stored in a database for real-time analysis.
Specific to OT networks, data historians can serve as a supplemental source of event data to
provide greater context surrounding a cyber incident.

E.2.2. Passive Scanning
Passive network scans are a form of network discovery that inspects existing network traffic by
watching traffic passing through network switches or other dedicated network capture devices.
Systems that implement passive network scans do not introduce any additional traffic to the
network, which is ideal for sensitive devices found on OT networks that may exhibit unexpected
behavior when directly probed. Passive scanning can identify all of the devices that are actively
communicating on monitored network segments. Through the inspection of network data,
