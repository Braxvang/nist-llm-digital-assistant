                                                               GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


available via a diverse set of customer platforms. Mobile phones, handheld personal computers, notebook
computers, desktop PCs, and home multimedia and gaming centers are all IPv4-capable today.
Delivering multimedia content to those platforms is increasingly viable given the broadband network
bandwidths available. Nevertheless, IPv4 clearly cannot address all of these devices without using an
address conservation technology like NAT, and NAT by its nature denies true end-to-end IP connectivity.
Multimedia service offerings and ultimately the market for those offerings are likely always to be
constrained by IPv4, while IPv6 may prove to be an enabling technology.

If an organization is not constrained by IPv4 address availability or the disruption that NAT causes to true
end-to-end connectivity between nodes, it should still plan for a world in which IPv6 will eventually be
ubiquitous. All major vendors of IT products are shipping IPv6-capable products. Wholesale
replacement of computing platforms and network infrastructure as a deployment requirement is less likely
now than only five years ago, since many operating systems and networking products contain a native
IPv6 protocol stack. Also, tunneling IPv6 over the existing IPv4 Internet is possible today by using free,
readily available tunnel clients. An end user may download client software, obtain a routable IPv6
address, and begin tunneling IPv6 over IPv4 networks with few technical or administrative barriers.
Many open source IP networking tools are IPv6-capable, as are many consumer-oriented wireless access
points. Many consumers of personal computing and home networking equipment are IPv6-capable, even
if they do not use the features.

Because of the increasing availability and use of IPv6, as well as many years of coexistence between IPv6
and IPv4, management and technical experts within any organization should understand IPv6
technologyâ€”its background, basis, and capabilities, and how they can mitigate risks associated with
running dual stack IPv4 and IPv6 networks. In the context of this document, dual stack means that nodes
are running both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols concurrently. The remainder of this document examines certain
aspects of the IPv6 specification in detail, and discusses threats, vulnerabilities, and the mitigation of
risks, in detail.
