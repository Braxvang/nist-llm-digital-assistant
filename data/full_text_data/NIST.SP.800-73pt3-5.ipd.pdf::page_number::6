      NIST SP 800-73pt3-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)           Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 3
      September 2023                                                                               PIV Client API

 83   Call for Patent Claims
 84   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use
 85   would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information
 86   Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or requirements may be
 87   directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another publication. This call also
 88   includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending U.S. or foreign patent applications
 89   relating to this ITL draft publication and of any relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.
 90   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its behalf,
 91   in written or electronic form, either:
 92       a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not hold
 93          and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
 94       b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available to
 95          applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the guidance
 96          or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:
 97              i.    under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
 98                    discrimination; or
 99             ii.    without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
100                    demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.
101   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make assurances
102   on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents subject to the
103   assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the assurance are binding on
104   the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of
105   future transfers with the goal of binding each successor-in-interest.
106   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
107   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.
108   Such statements should be addressed to: piv_comments@nist.gov
