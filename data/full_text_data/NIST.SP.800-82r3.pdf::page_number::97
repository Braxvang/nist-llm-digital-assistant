NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

5.3.2.1.       Data, Applications, and Infrastructure
Architecture requirements and design should support the redundancy needs of OT systems.
Availability can be enhanced using redundancy at the communication, system, or component
level such that a single failure is less likely to result in a capability or information outage.
Cybersecurity architecture should consider any redundant communication and protect it to the
same security level as the primary.
Additionally, a data backup and restoration process will facilitate the speedy recovery of systems
if data is lost due to cyber attacks or other reasons. Examples of important data and files are
operational data, program files, configuration files, system images, firewall rules, and access
control lists (ACLs). A “backup-in-depth” approach with multiple layers of backups (e.g., local,
facility, disaster) that are time-sequenced such that rapid recent local backups are available for
immediate use and secure backups are available to recover from a massive security incident (e.g.,
ransomware attack) can help improve OT system availability. Periodically testing data backup
and restore capabilities will ensure their availability when the need arises.

5.3.2.2.       Primary and Alternate Power Sources
Architectural considerations should include the impact of power outages on OT systems. For
example, if the OT systems need a graceful degradation or orderly shutdown, then an alternate
backup power may be considered. In addition, if the organization’s business continuity plan
requires that the OT systems continue operating in the event of an extended loss of the primary
power source, a long-term alternate power supply for the OT systems that is self-contained and
not reliant on external power generation can be implemented. The monitoring and controls
systems for the power system are vulnerable to cyber attacks, so appropriate cybersecurity
practices should be implemented.

5.3.2.3.       Other Utilities
Industrial facilities typically have monitoring and controls systems that manage uninterruptable
power supplies (UPSs), generators, HVAC, fire alarm systems, boilers, cooling water plant,
steam, compressed air, and other critical functions. These monitoring and controls systems are
also vulnerable to cyber attacks and can affect the OT systems, so appropriate cybersecurity
practices should be implemented to protect them.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Disaster recovery planning is another important activity for OT systems,
            especially when there are safety concerns. Organizations should establish
            and maintain a disaster recovery plan (DRP) that details the actions to
            take before, during, and after a natural, environmental, or human-caused
            (intentionally or unintentionally) disaster. The DRP should also include
            instructions for restoring and restarting failed components and
            integrating them back into operation. Organizations should consider
            testing the DRP to ensure that the necessary architecture capabilities can
            be operationalized in an actual disaster recovery scenario. Tabletop
            exercises can also be used to simulate a disaster recovery event to
            support testing.
