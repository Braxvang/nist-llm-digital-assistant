of limited unauthorized disclosure of retirement and disability information would have a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

The disclosure of privacy information (e.g., information required by the Privacy Act of 1974 or
other statutes and executive orders to receive special handling to protect the privacy of
individuals) may have serious consequences. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact
levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type.
Unauthorized disclosure of large amounts of general retirement and disability information may
result in significant damage to an agency’s image or operation.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The confidentiality impact recommended for general
retirement and disability information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Unauthorized
modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages,
electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the
damage to the mission would usually be limited.
Generally, the consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of general retirement
and disability information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals. However, where provision of retirement and/or disability benefits is a
primary agency service delivery mission, the consequences can be more severe.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Integrity compromises may result in
reduction of benefits– and in extreme cases can be life threatening. This can result in assignment
of a high impact level to such information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
general retirement and disability information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to general retirement and disability
information. The effects of disruption of access to general retirement and disability information
or information systems would have, in many cases, a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Where provision of retirement and/or
disability benefits is a primary agency service delivery mission, the consequences can be more
severe. Availability compromises may result in reduction of benefits – and in extreme cases can
be life threatening. This can result in assignment of a high impact level to such information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
general retirement and disability information is moderate.
