GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



4.2.1    Copying Files from Media

Files can be copied from media using two different techniques:

     ! Logical Backup. A logical backup copies the directories and files of a logical volume. It does
       not capture other data that may be present on the media, such as deleted files or residual data
       stored in slack space.
     ! Bit Stream Imaging. Also known as disk imaging, bit stream imaging generates a bit-for-bit
       copy of the original media, including free space and slack space. Bit stream images require more
       storage space and take longer to perform than logical backups.
If evidence may be needed for prosecution or disciplinary actions, the analyst should get a bit stream
image of the original media, label the original media, and store it securely as evidence. All subsequent
analysis should be performed using the copied media to ensure that the original media is not modified and
that a copy of the original media can always be recreated if necessary. All steps that were taken to create
the image copy should be documented. Doing so should allow any analyst to produce an exact duplicate
of the original media using the same procedures. In addition, proper documentation can be used to
demonstrate that evidence was not mishandled during the collection process. Besides the steps that were
taken to record the image, the analyst should document supplementary information such as the hard drive
model and serial number, media storage capacity, and information about the imaging software or
hardware that was used (e.g., name, version number, licensing information). All of these actions support
the maintenance of the chain of custody.

When a bit stream image is executed, either a disk-to-disk or a disk-to-file copy can be performed. A
disk-to-disk copy, as its name suggests, copies the contents of the media directly to another media. A
disk-to-file copy copies the contents of the media to a single logical data file. A disk-to-disk copy is
useful since the copied media can be connected directly to a computer and its contents readily viewed.
However, a disk-to-disk copy requires a second media similar to the original media.28 A disk-to-file copy
allows the data file image to be moved and backed up easily. However, to view the logical contents of an
image file, the analyst has to restore the image to media or open or read it from an application capable of
displaying the logical contents of bit stream images. The details of this are OS and forensics tool-
dependent. Section 4.3 discusses this process in more detail.

Numerous hardware and software tools can perform bit stream imaging and logical backups. Hardware
tools are generally portable, provide bit-by-bit images, connect directly to the drive or computer to be
imaged, and have built-in hash functions.29 Hardware tools can acquire data from drives that use common
types of controllers, such as Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) and Small Computer System Interface
(SCSI). Software solutions generally consist of a startup diskette, CD, or installed programs that run on a
workstation to which the media to be imaged is attached.30 Some software solutions create logical copies

     The destination medium should be forensically clean before the copy occurs, so that any existing data on the medium is
     eliminated. The destination medium should have a larger storage capacity than the data to be copied.
