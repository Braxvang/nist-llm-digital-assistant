CHAPTER TWO

THE FUNDAMENTALS
SECURITY CONTROL STRUCTURE, ORGANIZATION, BASELINES, AND ASSURANCE




T     his chapter presents the fundamental concepts associated with security control selection
      and specification including: (i) the structure of security controls and the organization of the
      controls in the control catalog; (ii) security control baselines; (iii) the identification and use
of common security controls; (iv) security controls in external environments; (v) security control
assurance; and (vi) future revisions to the security controls, the control catalog, and baseline
controls.

2.1 SECURITY CONTROL ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE
Security controls in the security control catalog (Appendix F) have a well-defined organization
and structure. The security controls are organized into classes and families for ease of use in the
control selection and specification process. There are three general classes of security controls
(i.e., management, operational, and technical) and seventeen security control families. 17 Each
family contains security controls related to the security functionality of the family. A two-
character identifier is assigned to uniquely identify each control family. Table 1 summarizes the
classes and families in the security control catalog and the associated family identifiers.

   The seventeen security control families in NIST Special Publication 800-53 are closely aligned with the seventeen
security-related areas in FIPS 200 specifying the minimum security requirements for protecting federal information and
information systems. Families are assigned to their respective classes based on the dominant characteristics of the
controls in that family. Many security controls, however, can be logically associated with more than one class. For
example, CP-1, the policy and procedures control from the Contingency Planning family, is listed as an operational
control but also has characteristics that are consistent with security management as well.
