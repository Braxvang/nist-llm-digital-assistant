Practical Combinatorial Testing
________________________________________________________________
5.4    Chapter Summary

1. Sequence covering arrays are a new application of combinatorial methods, developed
   by NIST to solve problems with interoperability testing. A sequence-covering array is
   a set of tests that ensure all t-way sequences of events have been tested. The t events in
   the sequence may be interleaved with others, but all permutations will be tested.

2. All 2-way sequences can be tested simply by listing the events to be tested in any order,
   then reversing the order to create a second test. Algorithms have been developed to
   create sequence covering arrays for higher strength interaction levels.

3. As with other types of combinatorial testing, constraints may be important, since it is
   very common that certain events depend on others occurring first. The tools NIST has
   developed for this problem allow the user to specify constraints in the form of excluded
   sequences which will not appear in the generated test array.
