               The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



5.    Data Stream Content Types

This section discusses additional requirements for four common types of SCAP content: compliance
checking, vulnerability scanning, inventory scanning, and OVAL-only scanning.

5.1   Compliance Checking

SCAP content can be used to compare system characteristics and settings against an SCAP-expressed
checklist in an automated fashion. This can verify that operating systems and applications comply with
security checklists and identify any deviations from those checklists.

The SCAP source data stream component that MUST be included for compliance checking is the XCCDF
Benchmark, which expresses the checklist. Each rule in the XCCDF Benchmark SHALL reference one of
the following:

 An OVAL compliance definition. This definition SHALL be contained in an OVAL Compliance
  component, which holds the definitions of the compliance checks used by the checklist. The OVAL
  Compliance component SHALL have at least one OVAL definition of class compliance, MAY have
  one or more additional OVAL definitions of classes compliance and/or inventory, and SHALL NOT
  have any other classes of OVAL definitions. An XCCDF Benchmark‘s rules MAY reference one or
  more OVAL compliance definitions in an OVAL Compliance component.
 An OCIL questionnaire. This questionnaire SHALL be contained in an OCIL Questionnaire
  component, which holds the questionnaires that collect information that OVAL is not being used to
  collect, such as posing questions to users or harvesting configuration information from an existing
  database. An XCCDF Benchmark‘s rules MAY reference one or more OCIL questionnaires in an
  OCIL Questionnaire component.
 An OVAL Patch component. The OVAL Patch component holds definitions for patch compliance
  checks. These checks may be needed if an organization includes patch verification in its compliance
  activities. The OVAL Patch component SHALL have at least one OVAL definition of class patch,
  MAY have one or more additional OVAL definitions of classes compliance and/or inventory, and
  SHALL NOT have any other classes of OVAL definitions. An XCCDF Benchmark MAY reference
  an OVAL Patch component through a patches up-to-date rule in a manner consistent with Section
  3.2.6.4.
Each XCCDF Benchmark SHALL have at least one rule that references either an OVAL compliance
definition in the OVAL Compliance component or an OCIL questionnaire in the OCIL Questionnaire
component.

All OVAL Compliance, OCIL Questionnaire, and OVAL Patch components referenced by the XCCDF
Benchmark SHALL be included in the SCAP source data stream.

If the XCCDF Benchmark component references any CPE names, then the SCAP source data stream
MUST include the following components, in addition to those already mentioned:

 CPE Dictionary: specifies the products or platforms of interest.
 CPE Inventory: contains the technical procedures for determining whether or not a specific target
  asset has a product or platform of interest. The CPE Inventory component SHALL have one or more
  OVAL definitions of class inventory and SHALL NOT have any other classes of OVAL definitions.
