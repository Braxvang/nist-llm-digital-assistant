                                  GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



3.2.4     Context of Use

The context of use factor is related to the Fair Information Practices of Purpose Specification and Use
Limitation. Context of use is defined as the purpose for which PII is collected, stored, used, processed,
disclosed, or disseminated. Examples of context include, but are not limited to, statistical analysis,
eligibility for benefits, administration of benefits, research, tax administration, or law enforcement.
Organizations should assess the context of use because it is important in understanding how the disclosure
of data elements can potentially harm individuals and the organization. Organizations should also
consider whether disclosure of the mere fact that PII is being collected or used could cause harm to the
organization or individual. For example, law enforcement investigations could be compromised if the
mere fact that information is being collected about a particular individual is disclosed.

The context of use factor may cause the same types of PII to be assigned different PII confidentiality
impact levels in different instances. For example, suppose that an organization has three lists that contain
the same PII data fields (e.g., name, address, phone number). The first list is people who subscribe to a
general-interest newsletter produced by the organization. The second list is people who have filed for
retirement benefits, and the third list is individuals who work undercover in law enforcement. The
potential impacts to the affected individuals and to the organization are significantly different for each of
the three lists. Based on context of use only, the three lists are likely to merit impact levels of low,
moderate, and high, respectively.

3.2.5     Obligation to Protect Confidentiality

An organization that is subject to any obligations to protect PII should consider such obligations when
determining the PII confidentiality impact level. Many organizations are subject to laws, regulations, or
other mandates 36 governing the obligation to protect personal information,37 such as the Privacy Act of
1974, OMB memoranda, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).
Additionally, some Federal agencies, such as the Census Bureau and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS),
are subject to additional specific legal obligations to protect certain types of PII. 38 Some organizations are
also subject to specific legal requirements based on their role. For example, organizations acting as
financial institutions by engaging in financial activities are subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
(GLBA). 39 Also, some agencies that collect PII for statistical purposes are subject to the strict
confidentiality requirements of the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act
(CIPSEA).40 Violations of these laws can result in civil or criminal penalties. Organizations may also be
obliged to protect PII by their own policies, standards, or management directives.

Decisions regarding the applicability of a particular law, regulation, or other mandate should be made in
consultation with an organization‘s legal counsel and privacy officer because relevant laws, regulations,
and other mandates are often complex and change over time.

     Personal information is defined in different ways by different laws, regulations, and other mandates. Many of these
     definitions are not interchangeable. Therefore, it is important to use each specific definition to determine if an obligation to
     protect exists for each type of personal information. See Appendix C for a listing of common definitions of personal
     information.
38
     The Census Bureau has a special obligation to protect based on provisions of Title 13 of the U.S. Code, and the IRS has a
     special obligation to protect based on Title 26 of the U.S. Code. There are more agency-specific obligations to protect PII,
     and an organization‘s legal counsel and privacy officer should be consulted.

     CIPSEA is Title 5 of the E-Government Act of 2002, Pub.L. 107-347, 116 Stat. 2899, 44 U.S.C. § 101 et seq. CIPSEA
     covers all types of data collected for statistical purposes, not just PII. For additional information, see the OMB
     Implementation Guidance for CIPSEA, http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg/2007/061507_cipsea_guidance.pdf.
