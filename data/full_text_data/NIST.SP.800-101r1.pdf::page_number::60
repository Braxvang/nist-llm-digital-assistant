                                                                            Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

      motivation, and intention may be established. Most of the evidence sources from mobile
      devices are: contact data, call data, messaging, pictures, video, social media, or Internet-related
      information. User applications potentially provide other evidence sources. User files placed on
      the device for rendering, viewing, or editing are other important evidence sources. Besides
      graphic files, other relevant file content includes audio and video recordings, spreadsheets,
      presentation slides, and other similar electronic documents.

      Installed executable programs may also have relevance in certain situations. Often times the
      most important data recovered is that which links to information held by the service provider.
      Service providers maintain databases for billing or debiting accounts based on call logs, which
      can be queried using the subscriber or equipment identifiers. Similarly, undelivered SMS text
      messages, multi-media, or voice messages may also be recoverable. This may allow an
      examiner to validate their findings as the data obtained from the device may be verified with
      the data obtained from the service provider.


           Enhanced 911: Enhanced 911 (E911) is a technology advanced by the U.S. Federal
           Communications Commission (FCC) enabling mobile devices to process 911 calls and to provide
           the geographic location of the handset. Therefore, all U.S. based mobile devices possess the
           ability to establish cellular voice communication when dialing 911 regardless of their service status
           (i.e., active, inactive). Additionally, GSM and other UICC dependent devices may also establish
           cellular voice communication by dialing 911 without the presence of a UICC.

           All U.S. based cellular carriers are required to handle calls regardless of the mobile device
           customer's specific carrier. Under the rules, all mobile devices manufactured for sale in the United
           States after February 13, 2000, that are capable of operating in an analog mode, including dual-
                                                                                                       22
           mode and multi-mode handsets, must include this special method for processing 911 calls .

           In situations where 911 was dialed on a mobile device, the location information (i.e., the latitude
           and longitude of the device or cell tower) for the call may be of interest to a forensic investigator.
           Outgoing 911 calls may or may not be logged in the memory of the mobile device or UICC.




6.2   Applying Mobile Device Forensic Tools

      Once a copy of the acquisition results are available, the next steps involve searching the data,
      identifying evidence, creating bookmarks, and developing the contents of a final report.
      Knowledge and experience with the tools used for examination are extremely valuable, since
      proficient use of the available features and capabilities of a forensic tool can greatly speed the
      examination process.

      It is important to note that forensic tools have the potential to contain some degree of error in
      their operation. For example, the implementation of the tool may have a programming error;
      the specification of a file structure used by the tool to translate bits into data comprehensible by
      the examiner may be inaccurate or out of date; or the file structure generated by another
      program as input may be incorrect, causing the tool to function improperly. Experiments
      conducted with mobile device forensic tools indicate a prevalence of errors in the formatting
