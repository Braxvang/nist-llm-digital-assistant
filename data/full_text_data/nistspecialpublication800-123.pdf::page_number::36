                                                                            GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



 Placing a limit on the amount of hard drive space that is dedicated for uploads, if uploads to the server
  are allowed. Ideally, uploads should be placed on a separate partition to provide stronger assurance
  that the hard drive limit cannot be exceeded.

 If uploads are allowed to the server, ensuring that these files are not readable by the server until after
  some automated or manual review process is used to screen them. This measure prevents the server
  from being used to propagate malware or traffic pirated software, attack tools, pornography, etc. It is
  also possible to limit the size of each uploaded file, which could limit the potential effects of a DoS
  attack involving uploading many large files.

 Ensuring that log files are stored in a location that is sized appropriately. Ideally, log files should be
  stored on a separate partition. If an attack causes the size of the log files to increase beyond
  acceptable limits, a physical partition helps ensure the server has enough resources to handle the
  situation appropriately.

 Configuring the maximum number of server processes and/or network connections that the server
  should allow.

To some degree, these actions protect against attacks that attempt to fill the file system on the server OS
with extraneous and incorrect information that may cause the server to crash. Logging information
generated by the server OS may help in recognizing such attacks. As discussed in Section 6.1,
administrators should store server logs on centralized logging servers whenever possible and also store
logs locally if feasible. If an attack causes the server to be compromised, the attacker could modify or
erase locally stored logs to conceal information on the attack. Maintaining a copy of the logs on a
centralized logging server gives administrators more information to use when investigating such a
compromise.

In addition to the controls mentioned above, it is often necessary to configure timeouts and other controls
to further reduce the impact of certain DoS attacks. One type of DoS attack takes advantage of the
practical limits on simultaneous network connections by quickly establishing connections up to the
maximum permitted, such that no new legitimate users can gain access. By setting network connection
timeouts (the time after which an inactive connection is dropped) to a minimum acceptable time limit,
established connections will time out as quickly as possible, opening up new connections to legitimate
users. This measure only mitigates the effects; it does not defeat the attack.

If the maximum number of open connections (or connections that are half-open—that is, the first part of
the TCP handshake was successful) is set to a low number, an attacker can easily consume the available
connections with illegitimate requests (often called a SYN flood). Setting the maximum to a much higher
number may mitigate the effect of such an attack, but at the expense of consuming additional resources.
Note that this is only an issue for servers that are not protected by a firewall that stops SYN flood attacks.
Most enterprise-level firewalls protect servers from SYN floods by intercepting them before they reach
the servers.

5.4   Selecting and Implementing Authentication and Encryption Technologies

Many servers support a range of technologies for identifying and authenticating users with differing
privileges for accessing information. Without user authentication, a server cannot restrict access to
authorized users—all services and information will be accessible by anyone with access to the server. In
many cases, this is not acceptable. Encryption can be used to protect information traversing the
connection between a server and a client. Without encryption, anyone with access to the network traffic
can determine, and possibly alter, the content of sensitive information, even if the user accessing the
