                                       GUIDE TO MALWARE INCIDENT PREVENTION AND HANDLING FOR DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS


an organization receives updated signatures, it is prudent to test them at least minimally before
deployment, to ensure that the update itself should not cause a negative impact on the organization.
Another benefit of having multiple types of automated detection ready is that different detectors may be
more effective in different situations. For example, detection tools that were not capable of recognizing or
stopping malware when it was a new threat can sometimes be updated or reconfigured to recognize the
same malware’s characteristics later and stop it from spreading. Examples of automated detection
methods other than antivirus software are as follows:

      Content Filtering. For example, email servers and clients, as well as anti-spam software, can be
       configured to block emails or email attachments that have certain characteristics, such as a known
       bad subject, sender, message text, or attachment name or type.19 This is only helpful when the
       malware has static characteristics; highly customized malware usually cannot be blocked
       effectively using content filtering. Web content filtering and other content filtering technologies
       may also be of use for static malware.
      Network-Based IPS Software. Most IPS products allow their prevention capabilities to be
       enabled for specific signatures. If a network-based IPS device is inline, meaning that it is an
       active part of the network, and it has a signature for the malware, it should be able to identify the
       malware and stop it from reaching its targets. If the IPS device does not have its prevention
       capabilities enabled, it may be prudent during a severe incident to reconfigure or redeploy one or
       more IPS sensors and enable IPS so they can stop the activity. IPS technologies should be able to
       stop both incoming and outgoing infection attempts. Of course, the value of IPSs in malware
       containment depends on the availability and accuracy of a signature to identify the malware.
       Several IPS products allow administrators to write custom signatures based on some of the known
       characteristics of the malware, or to customize existing signatures. For example, an IPS may
       allow administrators to specify known bad email attachment names or subjects, or to specify
       known bad destination port numbers. In many cases, IPS administrators can have their own
       accurate signature in place hours before antivirus vendors have signatures available. In addition,
       because the IPS signature affects only network-based IPS sensors, whereas antivirus signatures
       generally affect all workstations and servers, it is generally less risky to rapidly deploy a new IPS
       signature than new antivirus signatures.
      Executable Blacklisting. Some operating systems, host-based IPS products, and other
       technologies can restrict certain executables from being run. For example, administrators can
       enter the names of files that should not be executed. If antivirus signatures are not yet available
       for a new threat, it might be possible to configure a blacklisting technology to block the execution
       of the files that are part of the new threat.
4.3.3    Containment Through Disabling Services

Some malware incidents necessitate more drastic and potentially disruptive measures for containment.
These incidents make extensive use of a particular service. Containing such an incident quickly and
effectively might be accomplished through a loss of services, such as shutting down a service used by
malware, blocking a certain service at the network perimeter, or disabling portions of a service (e.g., large
mailing lists). Also, a service might provide a channel for infection or for transferring data from infected
hosts—for example, a botnet command and control channel using Internet Relay Chat (IRC). In either


     malware to the organization’s antivirus vendors and other security software vendors for analysis. This practice can help
     vendors respond more quickly to new threats. Organizations should also contact trusted parties, such as incident response
     organizations, when needed for guidance on handling new threats.

     Generally, it is feasible only in highly managed environments to configure email clients throughout the organization to block
     certain emails or email attachments.
