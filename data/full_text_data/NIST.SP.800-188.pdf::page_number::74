datasets are released with a privacy loss of ε = 1 and ε = 1.5, then the releasing agency can
compute that the total privacy loss that might be suffered by individuals in the dataset is no
greater than ε = 2.5. This is not true of most other de-identifcation techniques, for which
there is no straightforward approach to computing the maximum possible privacy loss that
might result from a combination of two separate data releases.
Composition concerns can arise when:
    • The same dataset is provided to multiple downstream users.
    • Snapshots of a dataset are published on a periodic basis.
    • Changes in computer technology result in new aspects of a dataset being made avail-
      able.
    • Legal proceedings require that aspects of the dataset (attributes or a subset of records)
      be made available without de-identifcation.
Privacy risk can result from unanticipated composition, which is one of the reasons that
released datasets should be subjected to periodic review and reconsideration.

4.3.12.   Potential Failures of De-Identifcation
The de-identifcation process outlined in this section can fail to prevent a disclosure for a
number of different reasons. In addition, failures of data utility can also occur, in which
the de-identifcation process removes too much information, and the de-identifed dataset
is not useful for its intended purpose.
    • If an inappropriate risk threshold is selected, then the risk of re-identifcation may
      be higher than intended. Agencies should consider risk thresholds carefully and se-
      lect the most conservative threshold possible that achieves the utility goals of the
      release.
    • If direct or quasi-identifers are missed, then identifying information may remain in
      the de-identifed dataset, leading to increased re-identifcation risk. Agencies should
      be mindful of the ways in which personal information can be used to identify individ-
      uals and – in ambiguous situations – assume that such information can be identifying
      when combined with other datasets.
    • If threats are missed during threat modeling, then the re-identifcation risk could
      be higher than intended. In particular, if other datasets that could be linked with
      the de-identifed dataset are not considered, then the risk could be much higher than
      anticipated. Agencies should carefully consider existing and future data releases
      during threat modeling.
