 Schedules of organizational principals or their exact location (whether on or off the premises)

 Information on the composition or preparation of hazardous materials or toxins 32

 Sensitive information relating to homeland security

 Investigative records

 Financial records (beyond those already publicly available)

 Medical records

 The organization’s physical and information security procedures

 Information about organization’s network and information system infrastructure (e.g., address ranges,
  naming conventions, access numbers)

 Information that specifies or implies physical security vulnerabilities

 Plans, maps, diagrams, aerial photographs, and architectural plans of organizational building,
  properties, or installations

 Information on disaster recovery or continuity of operations plans except as absolutely required

 Details on emergency response procedures, evacuation routes, or organizational personnel responsible
  for these issues

 Copyrighted material without the written permission of the owner

 Privacy or security policies that indicate the types of security measures in place to the degree that they
  may be useful to an attacker.

Organizations should not use public Web servers to host sensitive information intended to be accessed
only by internal users. The compromise of a public Web server often leads to the compromise of such
data.

To ensure a consistent approach, an organization should create a formal policy and process for
determining and approving the information to be published on a Web server. In many organizations, this
is the responsibility of the CIO and/or public affairs officer. Such a process should include the following
steps:

 Identify information that should be published on the Web

 Identify the target audience (Why publish if no audience exists?)

 Identify possible negative ramifications of publishing the information


     email addresses are much more likely to receive spam. Two, personally identifying email addresses can provide useful
     information to an attacker (e.g., possible usernames, information for social engineering attempts).
