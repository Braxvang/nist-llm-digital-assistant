a series of operations as a test or real user to ensure that all parts of the system are operating correctly.
Detailed functionality test procedures may be provided in Appendix E, System Validation Test Plan.

5.3     Recovery Declaration

Upon successfully completing testing and validation, the {designated authority} will formally declare
recovery efforts complete, and that {system name} is in normal operations. {System name} business and
technical POCs will be notified of the declaration by the ISCP Coordinator.

5.4     Notifications (users)

Upon return to normal system operations, {system name} users will be notified by {role} using
predetermined notification procedures (e.g., email, broadcast message, phone calls, etc.).

5.5     Cleanup

Cleanup is the process of cleaning up or dismantling any temporary recovery locations, restocking
supplies used, returning manuals or other documentation to their original locations, and readying the
system for a possible future contingency event.

Provide any specific cleanup procedures for the system, including preferred locations for manuals and
documents and returning backup or installation media to its original location.

5.6     Offsite Data Storage

It is important that all backup and installation media used during recovery be returned to the offsite data
storage location. The following procedures should be followed to return backup and installation media to
its offsite data storage location.

Provide procedures for returning retrieved backup or installation media to its offsite data storage
location. This may include proper logging and packaging of backup and installation media, preparing
for transportation, and validating that media is securely stored at the offsite location.

5.7     Data Backup

As soon as reasonable following recovery, the system should be fully backed up and a new copy of the
current operational system stored for future recovery efforts. This full backup is then kept with other
system backups. The procedures for conducting a full system backup are:

Provide appropriate procedures for ensuring that a full system backup is conducted within a reasonable
time frame, ideally at the next scheduled backup period. This backup should go offsite with the other
media in Section 5.6.

5.8     Event Documentation

It is important that all recovery events be well-documented, including actions taken and problems
encountered during the recovery and reconstitution effort, and lessons learned for inclusion and update to
this ISCP. It is the responsibility of each ISCP team or person to document their actions during the
recovery and reconstitution effort and to provide that documentation to the ISCP Coordinator.
