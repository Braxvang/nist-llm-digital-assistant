       The Problem Context
The problem context defines the basis for an adequately secure system. It focuses on
stakeholders’ concerns about unacceptable losses given their mission, operational capability, and
performance needs and concerns, as well as all associated cost, schedule, performance, and risk-
driven constraints. The problem context enables the engineering team to focus on acquiring as
complete an understanding of the stakeholder problem as practical, to explore all feasible
solution class options, and to select the solution class option or options to be pursued. The
problem context includes:
•   Defining security objectives
