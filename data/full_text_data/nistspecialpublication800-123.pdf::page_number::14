                                                                                          GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



Each system, including all servers that are part of the system, should be protected based on the potential
impact to the system of a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Protection measures (otherwise
known as security controls) tend to fall into two categories. First, security weaknesses in the system need
to be resolved. For example, if a system has a known vulnerability that attackers could exploit, the
system should be patched so that the vulnerability is removed or mitigated. Second, the system should
offer only the required functionality to each authorized user, so that no one can use functions that are not
necessary. This principle is known as least privilege. Limiting functionality and resolving security
weaknesses have a common goal: give attackers as few opportunities as possible to breach a system.

A common problem with security controls is that they often make systems less convenient or more
difficult to use. When usability is an issue, many users will attempt to circumvent security controls; for
example, if passwords must be long and complex, users may write them down. Balancing security,
functionality, and usability is often a challenge. This guide attempts to strike a proper balance and make
recommendations that provide a reasonably secure solution while offering the functionality and usability
that users require.

Another fundamental principle endorsed by this guide is using multiple layers of security—defense in
depth. For example, a system may be protected from external attack by several controls, including a
network-based firewall, a host-based firewall, and OS patching. The motivation for having multiple
layers is that if one layer fails or otherwise cannot counteract a certain threat, other layers might prevent
the threat from successfully breaching the system. A combination of network-based and host-based
controls is generally most effective at providing consistent protection for systems.

NIST SP 800-53 Revision 2, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, proposes
minimum baseline management, operational, and technical security controls for information systems. 4
These controls are to be implemented based on the security categorizations proposed by FIPS 199, as
described earlier in this section. This guidance should assist agencies in meeting baseline requirements
for servers deployed in their environments.

2.3     Basic Server Security Steps

A number of steps are required to ensure the security of any server. As a prerequisite for taking any step,
however, it is essential that the organization have a security policy in place. Taking the following steps
for server security within the context of the organization’s security policy should prove effective:

1. Plan the installation and deployment of the operating system (OS) and other components for the
   server. Section 3 addresses this step.

2. Install, configure, and secure the underlying OS. This is discussed in Section 4.

3. Install, configure, and secure the server software. Section 5 describes this step.

4. For servers that host content, such as Web servers (Web pages), database servers (databases), and
   directory servers (directories), ensure that the content is properly secured. This is highly dependent
   on the type of server and the type of content, so it is outside the scope of this publication to provide
   recommendations for content security. Readers should consult relevant NIST publications (see
   Appendix C) and other sources of security recommendations for information on securing server
   content.
