SP 800-152                                                A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


FR:11.4 The CKMS design shall specify all validation certificate numbers for its
validated devices.

                            During a full security assessment, the assessment team for a
PR:11.3
                            Federal CKMS shall verify that NIST-approved
                            cryptographic algorithms are supported in the FCKMS and
                            have been validated under the NIST Cryptographic Algorithm
                            Validation Program (CAVP).
                            During a full security assessment, the assessment team for a
PR:11.4
                            Federal CKMS shall verify that all cryptographic modules
                            used by the FCKMS have been validated for conformance to
                            FIPS 140 under the NIST Cryptographic Module Validation
                            Program (CMVP).

                            During a full security assessment, the assessment team for a
PA:11.3
                            Federal CKMS should verify that non-cryptographic software
                            and hardware (e.g. operating systems, DBMS, or firewalls)
                            used in or by the FCKMS have been validated using the
                            Common Criteria Standard (see [ISO 15408 Parts 1- 3]) under
                            the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP)

11.1.2 Architectural Review of System Design
An architectural review is an examination of a systemâ€™s security architecture by a
qualified team of experts to determine that the basic design is consistent with its security
goals. This review is required in Section 11.1 for all FCKMS(s).

FR:11.5 The CKMS design shall specify whether an architectural review is required as
part of the full security assessment.

FR:11.6 If an architectural review is required, then the CKMS design shall specify the
skill set required by the architectural review team.

                            During an architectural review, the assessment team for a
PR:11.5
                            Federal CKMS shall have access to all CKMS design
                            information, third-party-validation information, and the
                            available results of FCKMS/CKMS testing.

                            When penetration testing is to be performed on a Federal
PA:11.4
                            CKMS, the penetration-testing scenarios should be
                            determined by the architectural review team.
             SA-4           A Federal CKMS using-organization should analyze the
PA:11.5
                            results of the architectural review before procuring an
                            FCKMS.
