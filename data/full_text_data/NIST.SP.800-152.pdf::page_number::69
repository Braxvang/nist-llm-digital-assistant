SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


6.4.24 Validate a Symmetric Key
This function performs a validity check on a symmetric key, e.g., to verify that the length and
format are correct. The function could also verify any error detection/correction codes or
integrity checks placed upon the key and/or its metadata.

FR:6.66 The CKMS design shall specify how, where, and the circumstances under which
symmetric keys and/or metadata are validated.

                           A Federal CKMS shall validate a symmetric key before its
PR:6.59
                           initial use.

6.4.25 Validate Possession of a Symmetric Key
This function is used by an entity who receives an encrypted symmetric key and who needs
assurance that the claimed sender of the key has possession of the plaintext key. This
assurance may be obtained by encapsulating the plaintext key in a key package that has
sufficient redundancy known by the receiver. The receiver verifies the redundancy after
decryption. Alternatively, the sender and receiver may undergo a handshake that provides
assurance that the sender possesses the correct key.

                           A Federal CKMS shall obtain assurance of symmetric key
PR:6.60
                           possession by the sender of a symmetric key.

6.4.26 Validate a Private Key (or Key Pair)
This function performs tests on private keys or key pairs to verify that they meet their
specifications. Only the private-key owner or a trusted third party acting on behalf of the
private-key owner can perform this test.

FR:6.67 The CKMS design shall specify how, where and the circumstances under which,
private keys or key pairs and/or metadata can be validated.

                           A Federal CKMS shall validate private keys or key pairs as
PR:6.61
                           specified in [SP 800-56A] or [SP 800-56B] before their first
                           use.

6.4.27 Validate the Possession of a Private Key
This function is used by an entity that receives a public key and needs assurance that the
claimed owner of the public key has possession of the corresponding private key.

FR:6.68 The CKMS design shall specify how, where, and the circumstances under which,
possession of private keys and their metadata are validated.

                          Assurance of private-key possession by the keyâ€™s owner shall
PR:6.62
                          be obtained before its first use as specified in [SP 800-56A],
                          [SP 800-56B] or [SP 800-89].
