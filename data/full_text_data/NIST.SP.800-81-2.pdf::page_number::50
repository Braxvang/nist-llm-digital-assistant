SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



In this statement, the file “sales_internal.db” contains the authoritative information for zone
“sales.mycom.com” and restricts that information to queries coming from the address list named
“internal_hosts”. Section 8.1.1 provides details on how to set up this list. To set up a view of the same
zone, but with only external hosts for queries coming from outside the network, the following view
statement is used in the same configuration file:

         view “outsider” {
              match-clients { any; };
              match-destinations { public_hosts; };
              recursion no;
              zone sales.mycom.com {
                    type master;
                    file “sales_external.db”;
              };
         };

This statement is very similar to the previous statement, except that the file with the zone view is
“sales.external.db” and the client list is given as “any”, meaning that queries coming from both outside
and inside the network can see the same external view of “sales.mycom.com.” Together, these statements
allow internal clients to view both the internal and external hosts in “sales.mycom.com,” whereas external
hosts (not on the same network) can see only DNS information contained in the external view of the zone
where the destination matches the address list “public_hosts.”

7.2.9    Limiting Information Exposure Through Separate Name Servers for Different
         Clients

Instead of having the same set of authoritative name servers serve different types of clients, an enterprise
could have two different sets of authoritative name servers. One set, called external name servers, can be
located within a DMZ; these would be the only name servers that are accessible to external clients and
would serve RRs pertaining to hosts with public services (Web servers that serve external Web pages or
provide B2C services, mail servers, etc.) The other set, called internal name servers, is to be located
within the firewall and should be configured so they are not reachable from outside and hence provide
naming services exclusively to internal clients. The purpose of both architecture options (i.e., two
different sets of name servers and split DNS) is to prevent the outside world from knowing the IP
addresses of internal hosts. This configuration may be the only available option for enterprises that use
DNS server software that does not have the view feature found in BIND or organizations that use NSD as
their authoritative DNS server.

7.3     Content Control of Zone File

As stated in Section 5.7, the only protection approach for content control of DNS zone file is the use of a
zone file integrity checker. The effectiveness of integrity checking using a zone file integrity checker
depends upon the database of constraints built into the checker. Hence, the deployment process consists
of developing these constraints with the right logic and the only determinant of the truth value of these
logical predicates are the parameter values for certain key fields in the format of various RRTypes. The
choice of these parameter values forms the deployment guidelines and is discussed in Section 10.
