7.3.3    Operation of the Computer Managers

At the lowest layer in the hierarchy, a Computer Manager cooperates with the hypervisor that runs on
each computer system in a cluster. In response to queries from its Cluster Manger, a Computer Manager
returns status information including how many virtual machines are running and how many can still be
started. In response to commands issued from its Cluster Manager, a Computer Manager uses the
command interface of its hypervisor to start, stop, suspend, and reconfigure virtual machines, and to set
the local virtual network configuration. With some hypervisor technologies, network packets exchanged
between different virtual machines running on the same hypervisor can be implemented using very high
performance in-memory messages, thus boosting performance. The Computer Manager is responsible for
configuring such optimizations. As noted above, virtual machines running on behalf of different
consumers must appear to be isolated from one another; the Computer Manager on each computer system
is responsible for using the facilities of its hypervisor to generate this useful illusion to the greatest extent
possible.

As illustrated in Figure 17, the operation of an IaaS cloud is a cyclical process of consumer requests
flowing in and down through the hierarchy, and responses flowing back up to consumers. In addition to
virtual machine operations, consumers may directly access data storage servers in the cloud. Even though
the aggregate consumer demand peaks and troughs should be more gradual than individual consumer
demand peaks and troughs, the cloud will sometimes be underutilized and migration of consumer
workloads from computer system to computer system, or even from cluster to cluster, is a strategy that
can concentrate consumer workloads on a set of highly utilized machines and allow others to be turned
off to save some of the costs of their operation or to allow maintenance activities to be performed.
Although Figure 17 shows a static structure of computer systems and networks, in reality physical
hardware wears out or fails, and the cloud’s structure and algorithms must allow for its replacement
without wide-scale service interruptions. Note that the underlying mobility of virtual machines is an
important tool for accommodating the inevitable need for hardware replacement. In addition, providers
can use virtualization to transparently add new capacity in the form of additional computers within
clusters or additional clusters to accommodate growth in demand for cloud services.

7.4     Benefits

As with SaaS and PaaS clouds, in the public and outsourced IaaS scenarios, a cloud provider is free to
locate cloud infrastructure in low-cost areas and have consumers access cloud services over the open
Internet; cost savings from lower cost infrastructure may be shared with consumers in the form of lower
service charges. Furthermore, public and outsourced IaaS clouds allow for savings in up-front costs as do
public or outsourced PaaS and SaaS clouds:

 Savings in Up-front Costs (5.3.5).
In general, IaaS places more system management responsibility on consumers than either SaaS or PaaS;
consumers need to manage the VMs and virtualized infrastructure and need to perform system
administrator work. Although the provider may offer carefully constructed operating system images and
services, replicated storage, cryptography, firewalls, monitoring, demand-based automated VM
startup/shutdown, etc., responsibility for the operation of all software layers above the hypervisor rests
primarily with the consumer. This can be considered as either a benefit or a concern, depending on the
consumer's skill set and special needs.
