      NIST SP 800-73pt2-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)            Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 2
      September 2023                                               PIV Card Application Card Command Interface


274       Overview: Concepts and Constructs
275   SP 800-73-5 Parts 2 and 3 define two interfaces to an ICC that contain the PIV Card Application:
276   a low-level card command interface (Part 2) and a high-level client API (Part 3). SP 800-73-5
277   Part 3 is optional, and NIST Personal Identity Verification Program (NPIVP) conformance
278   testing for PIV Middleware in accordance with SP 800-73 Part 3 is discontinued since endpoints
279   support high level-client API natively at the time of this publication.
280   The information processing concepts and data constructs on both interfaces are identical and
281   MAY be referred to generically as the information processing concepts and data constructs on
282   the PIV interfaces without specific reference to the client API or the card command interface.
283   The client API provides task-specific programmatic access to these concepts and constructs, and
284   the card command interface provides communication access. The client API is used by client
285   applications using the PIV Card Application. The card command interface is used by software
286   that implement the client API (middleware).
287   The client API is thought of as being at a higher level than the card command interface because
288   access to a single entry point on the client API may cause multiple card commands to traverse
289   the card command interface. In other words, it may require more than one card command on the
290   card command interface to accomplish the task represented by a single call on an entry point of
291   the client API.
292   The client API is a program execution, call/return style interface, whereas the card command
293   interface is a communication protocol, command/response style interface. Because of this
294   difference, the representation of the PIV concepts and constructs as bits and bytes on the client
295   API may be different from the representation of these same concepts and constructs on the card
296   command interface.

297           Platform Requirements
298   The PIV Card Application places the following requirements on the ICC platform on which it is
299   implemented or installed:
300       •   Global security status that includes the security status of a global cardholder PIN
301       •   Application selection using a truncated Application Identifier (AID)
302       •   Ability to reset the security status of an individual application
303       •   Indication to applications as to which physical communication interface — contact versus
304           contactless — is in use
305       •   Support for the default selection of an application upon warm or cold reset

306           Namespaces of the PIV Card Application
307   Part 1 specifies the AID, names, Tag-Length-Value (BER-TLV) tags [ISO8825], ASN.1 Object
308   Identifiers (OIDs) [ISO8824], and Proprietary Identifier eXtensions (PIXes) of the NIST
309   Registered Application Provider IDentifier (RID) used on the PIV interfaces. Part 1 also states
