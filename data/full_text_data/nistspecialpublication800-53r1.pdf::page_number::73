          roles and responsibilities during the system development life cycle, documents those roles and
          responsibilities, and provides appropriate information system security training: (i) before
          authorizing access to the system or performing assigned duties; (ii) when required by system
          changes; and (iii) [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] thereafter.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization determines the appropriate content of security training
          based on the specific requirements of the organization and the information systems to which
          personnel have authorized access. In addition, the organization provides system managers, system
          and network administrators, and other personnel having access to system-level software, adequate
          technical training to perform their assigned duties. The organization’s security training program is

          professionals in similar organizations to stay up to date with the latest recommended security
          practices, techniques, and technologies and to share the latest security-related information
          including threats, vulnerabilities, and incidents.

          personnel in an environment of rapid technology changes and dynamic threats, the organization

          requirements. Information sharing activities regarding threats, vulnerabilities, and incidents
