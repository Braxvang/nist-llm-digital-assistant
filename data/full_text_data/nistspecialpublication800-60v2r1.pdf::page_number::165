Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to environmental monitoring and
forecasting information. Except for cases of emergency bulletins necessary to correct existing
threats to public safety, the nature of environmental monitoring and forecasting processes is
usually tolerant of reasonable delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
environmental monitoring and forecasting information is low.

D.8.2 Environmental Remediation Information Type

Environmental remediation supports the immediate and long-term activities associated with the
correcting and offsetting of environmental deficiencies or imbalances, including restoration
activities. The following security categorization is recommended for the environmental
remediation information type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of environmental
remediation information on the immediate and long-term activities of responsible agencies with
respect to correcting and offsetting environmental deficiencies or imbalances. Serious adverse
effects are likely to result from 1) exposure of information that is premature and not fully
checked for accuracy and that can damage public confidence in an organization targeted for
remedial action, 2) unauthorized disclosure of information that is proprietary to an organization,
3) unauthorized disclosure of information concerning proposed remediation that may be used by
organizations opposing particular remedial actions, and 4) disclosure of an agencyâ€™s tactics for
enforcing remediation that will have an adverse effect on the enforcement action. The
consequences of such unauthorized disclosures may have a serious adverse effect on public
confidence in the agency, have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, and place the
agency at a significant disadvantage.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for environmental remediation information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of environmental remediation
information may depend on the urgency with which the information is typically needed.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications
(e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations, public confidence in the
agency, and the agency mission.
