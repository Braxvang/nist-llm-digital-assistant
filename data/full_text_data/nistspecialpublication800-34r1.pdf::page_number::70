                                                  CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



SLAs can facilitate prompt recovery following software or hardware problems associated with the
telecommunications. An SLA also may be developed with the NSP or ISP to guarantee the desired
network availability and establish tariffs if the vendor’s network is unavailable. If the NSP or ISP is
contracted to provide network-connecting devices, such as routers, the availability of these devices should
be included in the SLA.

5.4       Mainframe Systems

Unlike the client/server architecture, the mainframe architecture is centralized. The clients that access the
mainframe are terminals with no processing or data storage capabilities. All the processing power for the
system is within the mainframe itself. The terminals accept output only from the mainframe. Early on,
these terminals were primarily monitors and keyboards without processors. Now, however, mainframes
normally do not have traditional terminals. Instead, desktops and portable computers access mainframes
through the use of terminal emulation software.

A mainframe is a multiuser computer designed to meet the computing needs of a large organization. The
term (mainframe) was created to describe the large central computers developed in the late 1950s and
1960s to perform bulk accounting and information management functions. Mainframe systems store all
data in a central location rather than dispersing data among multiple machines.

5.4.1     Mainframe Contingency Considerations

Although processing on a mainframe computer is more powerful and centralized than on other types of
platforms, it shares many of the same contingency requirements. Because a mainframe uses a centralized
architecture, the mainframe does not have the inherent redundancy that a distributed system or network
provides. As a result, mainframe availability and data backups are critical. The following measures
should be considered when determining mainframe contingency requirements:

         Store backup media offsite. Backup media should be labeled, logged, and stored offsite in a
          secure, environmentally controlled facility. The storage facility should be located far enough
          away from the original site to reduce the likelihood that both sites would be affected by the same
          event. Additionally, depending on the FIPS 199 impact level, data encryption may be required
          for protecting system backup information while in transit and at rest to minimize the risk if
          backup media is lost or stolen.
         Document system configurations and vendors. Maintaining detailed records of system
          configurations enhances system recovery capabilities. In addition, vendors that supply essential
          hardware, software, and other components should be identified in the contingency plan.
         Coordinate with network security policy and system security controls. Mainframe
          contingency solutions should include duplicating interfaces and telecommunications
          infrastructure as well as coordinating with network security policies, such as stringent access
          controls.
         Utilize results from the BIA. Impacts and priorities identified through the BIA of associated
          systems supporting organizational critical mission/business processes should be reviewed to
          determine recovery requirements and priorities.

5.4.2     Mainframe Contingency Solutions

Mainframes require different contingency strategies from distributed systems because data is stored in a
single location. Contingency strategies should emphasize the mainframe’s data storage capabilities and
underlying architecture. Redundant system components are critical to ensure that a failure of a system
