SP 800-152                                                    A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


                           When keys and sensitive metadata reside in remote locations, a
PR:6.34
                           means for requesting their destruction shall be available that
                           provides integrity protection and source authentication.
               SC-12       When keys are destroyed, the Federal CKMS shall employ an
PR:6.35
                           approved key destruction method.
                           When sensitive metadata is destroyed, the Federal CKMS
PR:6.36
                           shall employ an approved metadata destruction method.

6.4.10 Associate a Key with its Metadata
A cryptographic key could have several metadata elements associated with it. The CKMS
designer determines which metadata are to be associated with a key and selects the protection
mechanism(s) that provide(s) the association. Depending on the sensitivity of a metadata
element, the metadata element could require confidentiality protection, integrity protection,
and source authentication. The association function uses cryptography or a trusted process to
provide these protections.

FR:6.40 For each key type used, the CKMS design shall specify what metadata is associated
with the key, how the metadata is associated with the key, and the circumstances under
which metadata is associated with the key.

FR:6.41 For each key type used, the CKMS design shall describe how the following security
services (protections) are applied to the associated metadata: source authentication, integrity,
and confidentiality.

                           A Federal CKMS shall:
PR:6.37
                               a) Create a trusted association between a key and its
                                  metadata upon their entry into the FCKMS,
                               b) Maintain the trusted association throughout the keyâ€™s
                                  lifetime, and
                               c) Establish a new trusted association following
                                  modification or replacement of any metadata.

                           A Federal CKMS that protects Moderate or High impact-level
PR:6.38
                           information shall cryptographically bind a key and its
                           metadata elements.

                           A Federal CKMS that protects Low impact-level information
PA:6.10
                           should cryptographically bind a key and its metadata
                           elements.

6.4.11 Modify Metadata
The modify metadata function can be used to modify existing metadata that is associated
with a key. Some metadata elements for a key type may be fixed after creation and not
