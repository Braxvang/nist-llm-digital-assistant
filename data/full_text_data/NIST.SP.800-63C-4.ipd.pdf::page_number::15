335   2.   Introduction
336   This section is informative.
337   Federation is a process that allows for the conveyance of authentication attributes
338   and subscriber attributes across networked systems. In a federation scenario, the CSP
339   provides a service known as an identity provider, or IdP. The IdP acts as a verifier for
340   authenticators issued by the CSP. The IdP sends a message, called an assertion, about
341   this authentication event to the RP. The RP receives the assertion provided by the IdP
342   and uses it for authentication and authorization decisions, but the RP does not verify the
343   authenticator directly.
344   Assertions are verifiable statements from an IdP to an RP that represent an authentication
345   event for a subscriber. Federation is generally used when the RP and the IdP are not a
346   single entity or are not under common administration, though federation can be applied
347   within a single security domain for a variety of reasons. The RP uses the information
348   in the assertion to identify the subscriber and make authorization decisions about their
349   access to resources controlled by the RP.
350   In a federated identity scenario, the subscriber does not authenticate directly to the RP.
351   Instead, the federation protocol defines a mechanism for an IdP to generate an assertion
352   associated with a subscriber, generally in response to an explicit request from the RP.
353   The IdP is responsible for authenticating the subscriber (though it may use session
354   management as described in [SP800-63B], Sec. 7). The federation process allows the
355   subscriber to obtain services from multiple RPs without the need to hold or maintain
356   separate authenticators at each RP, a process sometimes known as single sign-on.
357   The subscriber is uniquely identified to the RP by a federated identifier, which is a logical
358   combination of the subject identifier as asserted by the IdP as well as a unique identifier
359   for the IdP itself. This multi-part identifier pattern is required because different IdPs
360   manage their subject identifiers independently, and could therefore potentially collide in
361   their choices of subject identifiers for different subjects. Therefore, it is imperative that an
362   RP never process the subject identifier without taking into account which IdP issued that
363   subject identifier.
364   An assertion includes a federated identifier for the subscriber, allowing association of
365   the subscriber with their interactions with the RP over multiple authenticated sessions.
366   Assertions may also include attribute values or derived attribute values that further
367   characterize the subscriber and support authorization decisions at the RP. Additional
368   attributes may also be available outside of the assertion as part of the larger federation
369   protocol. These attribute values and derived attribute values are often used in determining
370   access privileges for attribute-based access control (ABAC) or facilitating a transaction
371   (e.g., providing a shipping address).
372   Federation requires relatively complex multiparty protocols that have subtle security
373   and privacy requirements. When evaluating a particular federation structure, it may be
