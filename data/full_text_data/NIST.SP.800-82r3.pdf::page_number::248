AC-7     UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS

OT Discussion: Many OT systems remain in continuous operation, and operators remain logged
onto the system at all times. A “log-over” capability may be employed. Example compensating
controls include logging or recording all unsuccessful logon attempts and alerting OT security
personnel through alarms or other means when the number of organization-defined consecutive
invalid access attempts is exceeded. Unsuccessful logon attempt limits are enforced for accounts
(e.g., administrator) or systems (e.g., engineering workstations) that are not required for
continuous operation.
AC-8     SYSTEM USE NOTIFICATION

                                                                        CONTROL BASELINES

 AC-8       System Use Notification                                  Select     Select      Select

OT Discussion: Many OT systems must remain in continuous operation, and system use
notification may not be supported or effective. Example compensating controls include posting
physical notices in OT facilities or providing recurring training on system use prior to permitting
access.
AC-10 CONCURRENT SESSION CONTROL

                                                                        CONTROL BASELINES
  CNTL                         CONTROL NAME
   NO.                      Control Enhancement Name

 AC-10      Concurrent Session Control                                                      Select

OT Discussion: The number, account type, and privileges of concurrent sessions consider the
roles and responsibilities of the affected individuals. Example compensating controls include
providing increased auditing measures.

OT Discussion: This control assumes a staffed environment where users interact with system
displays. This control may be tailored appropriately where systems do not have displays
configured, systems are placed in an access-controlled facility or locked enclosure, or immediate
