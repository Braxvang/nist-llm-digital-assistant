                                                                         Guidelines on PDA Forensics



       Forensic examiners are advised to experiment with various toolkits on test devices to find out
       which acquisition tools work efficiently with particular device types, and to determine the
       degree of interoperability among different acquisition and examination tools for a device
       family. Besides gaining familiarity with the capabilities of the tool, experimentation allows
       special purpose search filters and custom configurations to be set up before use in an actual
       case. In addition, software updates from the manufacturer can be installed.

       No matter whether the device is Pocket PC, Palm OS, or Linux-based, to acquire data from it,
       a connection must be established from the specialist’s forensic workstation to the device.
       Before performing an acquisition, the version of the tool being used should be documented,
       along with any applicable patches or errata from the manufacturer applied to the tool. Once
       the connection has been established, the forensic software suite can proceed to acquire data
       from the device properly.

       Unlike desktop machines or network servers, present day PDAs have no hard disk and rely
       instead completely on semiconductor memory. Specialized software exists for producing an
       image of the device, as well as performing a logical acquisition of PIM data. However, the
       contents of a PDA are dynamic and continually changing, even when switched off (i.e., in the
       quiescent state). Two back-to-back acquisitions of a device using the same tool produce
       different results overall, though the majority of information, such as PIM data, remains
       unchanged. To image a PDA device’s memory, the device has to be switched on, which is a
       major difference from personal computers. This effectively means that the first evidentiary
       principle mentioned in section 4 – actions taken should not modify data contained on the
       device – cannot be complied with, strictly speaking. Therefore, the goal with PDA acquisition
       is to affect memory contents as little as possible and then only in the knowledge of what is
       happening internally, placing more importance on ensuring adherence to the second and third
       evidentiary principles, which stress the competence of the specialist and the generation of a
       detailed audit trail [ACPO].

       After an acquisition is finished, the forensic specialist should always confirm that the entire
       contents of a device were captured correctly (i.e., verify RAM/ROM size ensuring consistency
       with the device). On occasion, a tool may fail its task without any error notification and
       require the specialist to reattempt it with either the same tool or another tool. Similarly, some
       tools do not work well with certain devices as others do, and may fail with an error
       notification. Thus, when possible, it is advisable to have multiple tools available.

6.1   Unobstructed Devices

       An unobstructed device is a device that does not require a password or other authentication
       technique to be satisfied to be granted access to the device. From anecdotal information, most
       devices seized in investigations appear to fall into this category. As mentioned earlier, when
       seizing an “Unobstructed Device” caution should be utilized to avoid, for example, altering the
       state of the device by pressing key chord sequences that have the potential to corrupt or erase
       valuable evidence.

       In general, a PDA has four main categories of storage to consider: the operating system code,
       including the kernel, device drivers, and system libraries; dynamically allocated memory for
       executing operating system applications and storing and executing additional user applications
       loaded onto the device, user storage for various types of data files, including text, images, and
