                   The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



               The source attribute SHALL be defined using either ―CVE‖ or ―http://cve.mitre.org”
               (preferred method).
          b. Definitions that are directly or indirectly extended SHALL be limited to inventory and
             vulnerability classes.

3.4     Open Checklist Interactive Language (OCIL)

OCIL content SHOULD be used for checking rules that cannot be fully automated with OVAL.18 For
example, a particular software product may not have an application programming interface (API) that
supports OVAL use. Another example is performing a check that requires user interaction, such as asking
the user to look up information within a management console or to report a serial number affixed to a
computing device. OCIL can also be used to collect a user‘s own information, such as whether the user
participated in a recent security training session.

3.5     Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)

The Official CPE Dictionary data feed19 MAY be used by SCAP components to reference CPE Names.
Local enumerations are permitted, but if a CPE Name for a product or platform exists in the Official CPE
Dictionary, the content SHALL match the product or platform referenced by that official identifier.

Section 8 of [CPE] provides the defining structure of the Official CPE Dictionary. For certain names, a
<cpe_dict:cpe-item> MAY contain one or more <check> elements that reference OVAL
system inventory definitions using the following format:
<cpe_dict:check system="http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5"
      [href="oval_URL"]>oval_inventory_definition_id</cpe_dict:check>

For example:

<cpe-list xmlns="http://cpe.mitre.org/dictionary/2.0"
          xmlns:cpe_dict="http://cpe.mitre.org/dictionary/2.0">
   <cpe-item name="cpe:/o:microsoft:windows_2003">
      <title>Microsoft Windows Server 2003</title>
      <check system=http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5
             href="example-winsvr2003-oval.xml">
             oval:org.mitre.oval:def:128
      </check>
   </cpe-item>
</cpe-list>

The referenced OVAL inventory definition SHALL specify the technical procedure for determining
whether or not a specific target asset is an instance of the CPE Name specified by the
<cpe_dict:cpe-item> element. This usage is encouraged for a CPE dictionary source data stream
component.

If a <cpe_dict:cpe-item> contained in a CPE dictionary data stream component references an
OVAL ―inventory‖ definition, then that definition SHALL be resolved by an @href attribute referencing
a CPE Inventory source data stream component in the same data stream. Furthermore, the title of the
