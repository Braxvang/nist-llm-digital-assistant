1106   2.10.2.        CPLP Staff and Locations
1107   Those who have managed federal CPLPs report that training the workforce requires a
1108   combination of technical knowledge and professional attributes, such as communication,
1109   creativity, and interpersonal skills [11]. If the organization does not have the budget for CPLP
1110   course developers, determine what other agencies or organizations of similar size have done for
1111   their own needs. Some organizations may have in-house instructional designers, curriculum
1112   developers, instructors, web developers, communication experts, and graphic designers. Other
1113   organizations may need to include these professional costs in the budget for a new project.
1114   Identify qualified contractors to use or external courses that the organization can purchase.
1115   Different information requires different methods of delivery. Some program elements will be
1116   appropriate to deliver via online learning, while others will necessitate both instructors and
1117   physical classroom locations. Determining these requirements up front will allow for appropriate
1118   resource allocation (e.g., rooms to be reserved, computers and projectors secured, etc.). Even
1119   posters and flyers require space considerations, as they will need to be displayed in a sufficiently
1120   prominent area to have a learning impact on the personnel.

1121          Communicating the Strategic Plan and Program Performance
1122   One of the most important aspects of executing the CPLP Strategic Plan is collaborating with the
1123   learning team, key stakeholders, senior leadership, and personnel. Involving stakeholders and
1124   employees during the planning process can lead to greater success as the program begins and as
1125   each program element is implemented. Determining what to communicate should focus on:
1126      •   How the CPLP helps meet organizational and learning goals
1127      •   How the CPLP elements will impact personnel
1128      •   Engaging with stakeholders to determine concerns or conflicts in advance
1129      •   Soliciting feedback to identify gaps or missing elements in the plan
1130   Getting early and continual buy-in for the strategic plan is important to keep the momentum for
1131   the CPLP strong and to inspire engagement and satisfaction with the plan. A solid
1132   communication strategy will address those needs. Consider whether the organization has a
1133   centralized communications department or whether communications decisions will be made at
1134   the business unit level. Then develop a communications plan (or incorporate these elements into
1135   an existing communications plan) to share information about the new or updated CPLP. Keep it
1136   simple and tailored to internal stakeholders. The Learning Program Manager may choose to
1137   create a custom version of the strategic plan that includes different information for different
1138   audiences.
1139   Some important elements to share include information about what the CPLP is and who manages
1140   it. Funding issues and gaps may also need to be identified and addressed. For example, agency
1141   leaders and managers need to know whether the cost to implement the CPLP activities will be
1142   funded by the CIO, CISO, CLO, or another program budget or whether their budgets will be
1143   impacted to cover a portion of the expense. In addition, schedules and completion requirements
1144   must be communicated.
