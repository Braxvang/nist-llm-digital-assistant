Cloud computing can and does mean different things to different people. The common
characteristics most interpretations share are on-demand scalability of highly available and
reliable pooled computing resources, secure access to metered services from nearly anywhere,
and displacement of data and services from inside to outside the organization. While aspects of
these characteristics have been realized to a certain extent, cloud computing remains a work in
progress. This publication provides an overview of the security and privacy challenges pertinent
to public cloud computing and points out considerations organizations should take when
outsourcing data, applications, and infrastructure to a public cloud environment.
