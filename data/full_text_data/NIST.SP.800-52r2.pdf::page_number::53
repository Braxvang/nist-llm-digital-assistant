intended to visit the indicated website. Users should be aware that URLs can appear to be
legitimate but still not be valid. For example, the numeric “1” and the letter “l” appear quite
similar or the same to the human eye.

Client authentication keys may be located outside of the client (e.g., in PIV Cards). Users shall
follow the relevant policies and procedures for protecting client authentication keys outside of
the client.

4.6   Session Resumption and Early Data

Session resumption considerations and server recommendations were given in Section 3.6. There
are no specific recommendations for clients regarding session resumption when using TLS 1.2,
1.1, or 1.0. Clients typically will not know if any anti-replay mechanisms are in place to prevent
replay attacks on 0-RTT data in TLS 1.3. Therefore, clients using TLS 1.3 should not send 0-
RTT data.

RFC 7918 [39] describes a technique called False Start that allows a TLS 1.2 client to send early
data. While this concept is similar to the 0-RTT data of TLS 1.3, there are differences that affect
security. For example, an attacker may perform downgrade attacks, both of protocol versions and
cipher suites, and obtain client data before the handshake is determined to be invalid. While RFC
7918 provides recommendations for improving security, it is safest to disable False Start unless
there is a real need for it. TLS 1.2 clients shall not use False Start.

4.7   Compression Methods

The client shall follow the same compression recommendations as the server, which are
described in Section 3.7.

4.8   Operational Considerations

The client and associated platform shall be kept up-to-date in terms of security patches. This is
critical to various aspects of security.

Once the TLS-protected data is received at the client and decrypted and authenticated by the TLS
layer of the client system, the unencrypted data is available to the applications on the client
platform.

These guidelines do not mitigate the threats against the misuse or exposure of the client
credentials that reside on the client machine. These credentials could contain the private key used
for client authentication or other credentials (e.g., a one-time password (OTP) or user ID and
password) for authenticating to a server-side application.

For these reasons, the use of TLS does not obviate the need for the client to use appropriate
security measures, as described in applicable Federal Information Processing Standards and
NIST Special Publications, to protect computer systems and applications. Users shall operate
client systems in accordance with agency and administrator instructions.
