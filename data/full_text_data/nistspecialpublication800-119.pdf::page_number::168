                                                                GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


should ensure auditors performing the certification function are knowledgeable about IPv6 security and
have the tools to look for IPv6 traffic and vulnerabilities. If two separate environments are supported
(IPv4 and IPv6), then a system accreditor may require two separate certifications and accreditations; with
a dual stack environment only a single certification and accreditation may be required. The goal should
be to achieve security as good as or better than the IPv4 network.

  6.9.4   Operations / Maintenance Phase

The operations phase often begins concurrently with the implementation phase. During operations, the
focus is the secure operation of a dual stack or mixed IPv6/IPv4 environment. One of the most difficult
challenges facing the operations staff in a mixed IPv6/IPv4 environment is keeping the two environments
synchronized.

When operations makes changes to security controls such as firewall rule sets, access control lists, and
IDS signatures, they must ensure the change occurs on both the IPv4 and IPv6 networks. Rules and
signatures must be translated between IPv4 and IPv6 syntax and deployed as a single coordinated process.
If strict change control is not followed, the two environments will have non-overlapping protections.

In a dual stack environment, the physical topologies of the equipment are the same, but the logical
topologies can be very different. Configuration changes can have unpredictable or unforeseen
consequences. Configuration management controls should be structured to prevent configuration changes
on IPv4 or IPv6 networks that affect the other network. Organizations should manage and monitor their
IPv4, IPv6, and dual stack environment as a single environment.

  6.9.5   Disposition Phase

A migration from IPv4 to IPv6 results in displacement or retirement of equipment. Some equipment does
not support IPv6 and is retired, while other equipment is transferred to IPv4 islands or to other
organizations. Organizations must plan for the secure disposition of this obsolete equipment, ensuring
that no confidential data is released. Organizations place themselves at great risk for exposing
confidential information when disposing of obsolete equipment.

A key decision concerning sanitization is whether the equipment is planned for reuse or retirement.
Often, equipment is reused to conserve an organizationâ€™s resources. Equipment should be sanitized
before it is reused or retired. Most organizations have policies, regulations or standards that require the
proper disposition of obsolete equipment. It is important that these processes be followed.

Failure to follow proper disposition procedures could result in the disclosure of confidential information.
Organizations store and process information such as personal records of employees, personal records of
clients, credit card numbers, social security numbers, medical information, trade secrets, classified data,
system passwords, system configuration, network documentation, and many other examples of data that
must be kept confidential. Network equipment can expose administrative accounts, passwords,
authentication credentials, certificates, pre-shared keys, and community strings.

Failure to maintain confidentiality could result in embarrassment to the organization, system intrusions,
software and hardware license violations, legal fees and fines, and other avoidable consequences. Some
data requires protection under State law or Federal law or both (e.g., the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act [HIPAA], the Family Education Rights Privacy Act [FERPA]) or industry governance
boards like the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council).

There are several methods available for sanitizing storage media. Equipment should be carefully
