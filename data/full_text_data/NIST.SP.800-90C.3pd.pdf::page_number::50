       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                            Recommendation for RBG Constructions

1356       RBG2 Constructions Based on Physical and/or Non-Physical Entropy Sources
1357   An RBG2 construction is a cryptographically secure RBG with continuous access to one or more
1358   validated entropy sources within its RBG security boundary. The RBG is instantiated before use,
1359   generates outputs on demand, and can be used in an RBG3 construction (see Section 6). An RBG2
1360   construction may support reseeding and may provide prediction resistance during generation
1361   requests (i.e., by performing a reseed of the DRBG prior to generating output). Both reseeding and
1362   providing prediction resistance are optional for this construction.
1363   If full-entropy output is required by a consuming application, an RBG3 construction from Section
1364   6 needs to be used rather than an RBG2 construction.
1365   An RBG2 construction may be useful for all devices in which an entropy source can be
1366   implemented.

1367           RBG2 Description
1368   The DRBG for an RBG2 construction is contained within the same RBG security boundary and
1369   cryptographic module as its validated entropy source(s) (see Figure 16). The entropy source is
1370   used to provide the entropy bits for both DRBG instantiation and the reseeding of the DRBG used
1371   by the construction (e.g., to provide prediction resistance). An optional recommended
1372   personalization string and optional additional input may be provided from within the cryptographic
1373   module or from outside of that module.

1376   The output from the RBG may be used within the cryptographic module or by an application
1377   outside of the module.
