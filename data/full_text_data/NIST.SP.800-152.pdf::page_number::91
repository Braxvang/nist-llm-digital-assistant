SP 800-152                                                    A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


8 Security Controls
An FCKMS consists of one or more computer systems, communication services, devices,
FCKMS modules, cryptographic modules, firewalls, communications and human interfaces,
backup storage media, archive facilities, network security protocols, and entity identification
systems. An FCKMS requires security mechanisms and management to protect FCKMS
devices and components, along with the keys and metadata that they contain. These controls
include physical security controls, operating system and device security controls, auditing
and remote monitoring, network security controls and cryptographic module controls.

8.1    Physical Security Controls

Physical security is needed to protect the availability, reliability, and integrity of an FCKMS
and to ensure the security and availability of its data-processing resources, including all key-
management information and support software. Without good physical security, the FCKMS
hardware and software could be modified to negate or bypass security mechanisms.

An FCKMS may include facilities that provide third-party key-management services (such as
a Certification Authority, Key Distribution Center, Registration Authority, or Certificate
Directory) and end-to-end communication devices (such as personal computers, personal
digital assistants, smart phones, and intelligent sensing devices).

A facility is traditionally considered to be a building or room that houses equipment and
support personnel in a fixed or “static” facility/environment. However, in today’s world of
mobile “smart” devices, the definition of a facility needs to be expanded to include the
enclosure in which a mobile FCKMS module is contained (e.g., a computer laptop case, or
cell phone protective cover), with some protection provided by its owner/user. A mobile
device enclosure and the person carrying the enclosed device should provide protection that
is similar to that available in a static facility and environment. In some instances, an FCKMS
could encompass a variety of static and mobile facilities.

In a static environment, an FCKMS module could be protected by gated fences, locked
doors, smart-card access-control systems, password verifiers, surveillance cameras, and
guards. In a mobile environment, security will depend on the room or enclosure in which the
mobile device and FCKMS module are currently operating, the person operating the mobile
device, and perhaps a personal identity-verification (PIV) mechanism that is built into the
device that requires an authorized owner/user to enter a special access token, secret
password, and/or personal biometric characteristic (e.g., fingerprint).

FR:8.1 The CKMS design shall specify each of its CKMS devices and their intended
purposes.

FR:8.2 The CKMS design shall specify the physical security controls for protecting each
device containing CKMS components.
