                                       CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



Impact:                          The magnitude of harm that can be expected to result from the
(NIST SP 800-60)                 consequences of unauthorized disclosure of information,
                                 unauthorized modification of information, unauthorized
                                 destruction of information, or loss of information or information
                                 system availability.

Impact Level:                    High, Moderate, or Low security categories of an information
                                 system established in FIPS 199 which classify the intensity of a
                                 potential impact that may occur if the information system is
                                 jeopardized.

Incident Response Plan:          The documentation of a predetermined set of instructions or
                                 procedures to detect, respond to, and limit consequences of a
                                 malicious cyber attacks against an organization’s information
                                 system(s).

Information System:              A discrete set of resources organized for the collection,
(44 U.S.C., Sec 3502)            processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or
                                 disposition of information.

Information System Contingency   Management policy and procedures designed to maintain or
Plan (ISCP):                     restore business operations, including computer operations,
                                 possibly at an alternate location, in the event of emergencies,
                                 system failures, or disasters.

Maximum Tolerable Downtime:      The amount of time mission/business process can be disrupted
                                 without causing significant harm to the organization’s mission.

Reciprocal Agreement:            An agreement that allows two organizations to back up each
                                 other.

Recovery Point Objective:        The point in time to which data must be recovered after an
                                 outage.

Recovery Time Objective:         The overall length of time an information system’s components
                                 can be in the recovery phase before negatively impacting the
                                 organization’s mission or mission/business processes.

Resilience:                      The ability to quickly adapt and recover from any known or
                                 unknown changes to the environment through holistic
                                 implementation of risk management, contingency, and continuity
                                 planning.

Risk Management:                 The process of managing risks to agency operations (including
(NIST SP 800-53)                 mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, or
                                 individuals resulting from the operation of an information
                                 system. It includes risk assessment; cost-benefit analysis; the
                                 selection, implementation, and assessment of security controls;
                                 and the formal authorization to operate the system. The process
                                 considers effectiveness, efficiency, and constraints due to laws,
                                 directives, policies, or regulations.
