     HTTPS 8

     Internet Caching Protocol (ICP)

     Hyper Text Caching Protocol (HTCP)

     Web Cache Coordination Protocol (WCCP)

     SOCKS 9

     Database services (e.g., Open Database Connectivity [ODBC]).

 Identify any network service software, both client and server, to be installed on the Web server and
  any other support servers.

 Identify the users or categories of users of the Web server and any support hosts.

 Determine the privileges that each category of user will have on the Web server and support hosts.

 Determine how the Web server will be managed (e.g., locally, remotely from the internal network,
  remotely from external networks).

 Decide if and how users will be authenticated and how authentication data will be protected.

 Determine how appropriate access to information resources will be enforced.

 Determine which Web server applications meet the organization’s requirements. Consider servers
  that may offer greater security, albeit with less functionality in some instances. Some issues to
  consider include—

     Cost

     Compatibility with existing infrastructure

     Knowledge of existing employees

     Existing manufacturer relationship

     Past vulnerability history

     Functionality.

 Work closely with manufacturer(s) in the planning stage.

The choice of Web server application may determine the choice of OS. However, to the degree possible,
Web server administrators should choose an OS that provides the following [Alle00]:

 Ability to restrict administrative or root level activities to authorized users only
