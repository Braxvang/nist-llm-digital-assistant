NIST SP 800-186                                               Discrete Logarithm-based Cryptography:
February 2023                                                       Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters



Abstract
This Recommendation specifies the set of elliptic curves recommended for U.S. Government
use. In addition to the previously recommended Weierstrass curves defined over prime fields and
binary fields, this Recommendation includes two newly specified Edwards curves, which
provide increased performance, side-channel resistance, and simpler implementation when
compared to traditional curves. This Recommendation also specifies alternative representations
for these new curves to allow more implementation flexibility. The new curves are interoperable
with those specified by the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) of the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF).

Keywords
computer security; discrete logarithm-based groups; domain parameters; elliptic curve
cryptography.

Reports on Computer Systems Technology
The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
with industry, government, and academic organizations.
