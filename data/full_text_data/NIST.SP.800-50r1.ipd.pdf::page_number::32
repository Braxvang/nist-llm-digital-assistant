      NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                                   Building a Cybersecurity and

813   2.5.1. All Users
814   In a typical scenario, all of the organization’s personnel (i.e., the general workforce, including
815   contractors) will participate in the CPLP, agree to abide by the Acceptable Use Policy or
816   Standards of Behavior, complete the annual Learning Program training, and attend, complete,
817   view, and receive the other various ongoing program elements.
818   In NIST SP 800-53 [8], All User training is referred to in the Awareness and Training control
819   (AT-2) as cybersecurity and privacy “literacy” training. As part of or after completing the annual
820   training, users will sign a Rules of Behavior that defines the behaviors required to gain and keep
821   system access. NIST SP 800-53 additionally indicates that the training will also need to be
822   updated for any system changes or following any organization-defined events:
823   “Subsequent literacy training may be satisfied by one or more short ad hoc sessions and include topical information
824   on recent attack schemes, changes to organizational security and privacy policies, revised security and privacy
825   expectations, or a subset of topics from the initial training. Updating literacy training and awareness content on a
826   regular basis helps to ensure that the content remains relevant. Events that may precipitate an update to literacy
827   training and awareness content include, but are not limited to, assessment or audit findings, security incidents or
828   breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and
829   guidelines.”
830   All users in the workforce (previously referred to as “system users” and “general users”) are
831   critical to reducing unintentional errors and vulnerabilities. The organization’s personnel may
832   include employees, contractors, foreign or domestic guest researchers, visitors, guests, other
833   agency personnel, and other collaborators or associates who require access. All users must:
834       •    Understand and comply with the organization’s cybersecurity, physical security, and
835            privacy policies and procedures
836       •    Understand and accept the rules of behavior for the systems and applications to which
837            they have access
838       •    Work with management to meet training needs
839       •    Be aware of actions they can take to better protect their organization’s information and
840            environment
841   Examples of topics that the CPLP may address include understanding how cybersecurity and
842   privacy activities support the organization’s mission and business objectives; using proper
843   passwords; backing up data; using proper antivirus protection; reporting any suspected incidents
844   or violations of cybersecurity and privacy policies; following the rules established to avoid social
845   engineering attacks (e.g., ransomware and phishing) and to deter the spread of spam, viruses, and
846   worms; identifying and addressing privacy risks during information processing; and knowing
847   where to find the organization’s cybersecurity and privacy resources and points of contact.

848   2.5.2. Privileged Users
849   Privileged users are trusted with additional access or responsibilities to perform cybersecurity-
850   and privacy-related functions that ordinary users are not authorized to perform. Due to the
851   specialized functions that privileged users typically perform and their ability to access critical
852   resources of the organization, privileged users require additional training to ensure that they
853   understand their account privileges and do not accidently cause or exploit vulnerabilities.
