Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where large monetary amounts
and/or violent crimes are involved, the confidentiality impact of unauthorized disclosure of
resolution facilitation information is at least moderate.

In exceptional cases human lives may be jeopardized by failure of the resolution facilitation
process. Additionally, when resolution facilitation concerns matters of trans-national interest,
such as trade enforcement, tariff agreements, etc., or where foreign nationals might be involved,
the confidentiality impact will be high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Given the legal consequences of unauthorized
disclosure, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for resolution facilitation
information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Resolution
facilitation activities are not typically time-critical. The modification or destruction of court
records may result in disruption or jeopardy of legal proceedings. In most cases, the adverse
effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of resolution facilitation information on
agency mission functions and/or public confidence in the agency can be expected to be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
resolution facilitation information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to resolution facilitation information.
Most resolution facilitation processes are tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of access to
resolution facilitation information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on
government operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
resolution facilitation information is low.
