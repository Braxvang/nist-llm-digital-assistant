4 Security Policies
An organization often creates and supports layered security policies, with high-level policies
addressing the management of its information and lower-level policies specifying the rules
for protecting the information.

An organization could have different policies covering different applications or categories of
information. For example, a Federal organization could have one set of policies covering its
financial information and a different set of policies covering its personnel information.

This section describes a layered set of policies, including an Information Management
Policy, an Information Security Policy, and an FCKMS Security Policy.

4.1   Information Management Policy

An organization’s Information Management Policy governs the collection, processing, and
use of an organization’s information, and should specify, at a high level, what information is
to be collected or created, and how it is to be managed. An organization’s management
establishes this policy using industry standards of good practices, legal requirements
regarding the organization’s information, and organizational goals that must be achieved
using the information that the organization will be collecting and creating.

These specifications are the foundation of an Information Security Policy (see Section 4.2)
and dictate the levels of confidentiality, integrity, availability, and source-authentication
protections that must be provided for each category of sensitive and valuable information
covered by the Information Management Policy.

                           A Federal CKMS service-using organization shall create an
PR:4.1
                           Information Management Policy that:
                              a) Specifies the information to be collected or created and
                                 how it is to be managed;
                              b) Specifies the high-level goals for obtaining and using
                                 the information;
                              c) Specifies the organizational management roles and
                                 responsibilities for the policy and establishes the
                                 authorization required for people performing these
                                 information-management duties;
                              d) Specifies what categories of information need to be
                                 protected against unauthorized disclosure, modification
                                 or destruction; and
                              e) Establishes the rules for authorizing one or more people
                                 to create policy and manage its implementation and
                                 use.
