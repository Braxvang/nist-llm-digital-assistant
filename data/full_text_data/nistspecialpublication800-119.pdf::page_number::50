                                                                 GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


the destination node analyses the packet. Seeing the FF02::1 multicast with the ICMPv6 MAC request,
the destination checks that it is the intended recipient, updates its neighbor cache, and replies with a NA
sending its true MAC address.

ND is essential to the correct operation of an IPv6 network, as well as associated procedures like NUD
and DAD. Routers must provide multicast services correctly and obey scope rules, and interfaces must be
able to receive solicited node multicast messages. ND security ramifications are discussed in Section
3.5.6; Secure Neighbor Discovery is discussed in Section 5.4.

  3.5.4   Autoconfiguration

Autoconfiguration, described in RFC 4862, is essentially plug-and-play networking.

One of the most interesting and potentially valuable addressing features implemented in IPv6, this new
feature allows devices on an IPv6 network to configure addresses independently using stateless address
autoconfiguration (SLAAC). Whereas in IPv4, hosts were originally configured manually or with host
configuration protocols like DHCP, IPv6 autoconfiguration goes a step further by defining a method for
devices to configure their IP address and other parameters automatically without the need for a server.
Moreover, it also defines a method, renumbering, whereby large numbers of IP addresses on a network
can be renumbered. This subsection describes autoconfiguration in brief as well as several improvements
over the IPv4 set of protocols.

IPv6 defines both Stateful and Stateless address autoconfiguration. SLAAC, illustrated in Figure 3-12,
requires no manual configuration of hosts, minimal (if any) configuration of routers, and no additional
servers. This allows a host to generate its own addresses using a combination of locally available
information and information advertised by routers. Locally available information is delivered to a host
when routers advertise prefixes that identify the subnets associated with a link. In turn, a host generates
an interface identifier that uniquely identifies an interface on a subnet. As previously discussed, an
address is formed by combining the two. If a router is not available to advertise subnet prefixes, a host
can only generate link-local addresses, which are sufficient for allowing communication among nodes
attached to the same link; in the presence of a router, a host will generate its link-local address in addition
to other addresses.

Stateful autoconfiguration for IPv4 is known as DHCP. In this case, hosts obtain interface addresses or
configuration information and parameters from a server. DHCP servers maintain a database to keep track
of which addresses have been assigned to each host. The IPv6 version, DHCPv6, is described in Section
4.7.

As defined in RFC 4862, an IPv6 address can have different states:

        Tentative Address. An address whose uniqueness on a link is being verified, prior to its
         assignment to an interface. A tentative address is not considered assigned to an interface in
         the usual sense. An interface discards packets addressed to a tentative address except for ND
         packets related to DAD.

        Preferred Address. An address assigned to an interface whose use by upper layer protocols
         is unrestricted. Preferred addresses may be used as the source (or destination) address of
         packets sent from (or to) the interface.
