                                  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document is a guide to assist in the development, selection, and implementation of measures
to be used at the information system and program levels. These measures indicate the
effectiveness of security controls applied to information systems and supporting information
security programs. Such measures are used to facilitate decision making, improve performance,
and increase accountability through the collection, analysis, and reporting of relevant
performance-related data—providing a way to tie the implementation, efficiency, and
effectiveness of information system and program security controls to an agency’s success in
achieving its mission. The performance measures development process described in this guide
will assist agency information security practitioners in establishing a relationship between
information system and program security activities under their purview and the agency mission,
helping to demonstrate the value of information security to their organization.

A number of existing laws, rules, and regulations—including the Clinger-Cohen Act, the
Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), the Government Paperwork Elimination Act
(GPEA), and the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)—cite information
performance measurement in general, and information security performance measurement in
particular, as a requirement. In addition to legislative compliance, agencies can use performance
measures as management tools in their internal improvement efforts and link implementation of
their information security programs to agency-level strategic planning efforts.

The following factors must be considered during development and implementation of an
information security measurement program:

   •   Measures must yield quantifiable information (percentages, averages, and numbers);

   •   Data that supports the measures needs to be readily obtainable;

   •   Only repeatable information security processes should be considered for measurement;
       and

   •   Measures must be useful for tracking performance and directing resources.

The measures development process described in this document ensures that measures are
developed with the purpose of identifying causes of poor performance and pointing to
appropriate corrective actions.

This document focuses on the development and collection of three types of measures:

   •   Implementation measures to measure execution of security policy;

   •   Effectiveness/efficiency measures to measure results of security services delivery; and

   •   Impact measures to measure business or mission consequences of security events.
