       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                            Digital Identity Guidelines

1537   be encrypted using a key established through a pairing process between the devices or
1538   through a temporary wired connection. An authenticated connection using a pairing code
1539   meeting the above requirements SHOULD be used. If the authenticator is configured to
1540   require authenticated pairing, pairing code SHALL be used.
1541         Note: Encryption of only the activation secret, and not the entire
1542         authentication transaction, may expose sensitive information such as
1543         the identity of the relying party, although this would require the attacker
1544         to be very close to the subscriber. Special care should be taken with
1545         authenticators containing personally identifiable information that do not
1546         require authenticated pairing to protect that information against “skimming”
1547         and eavesdropping attacks.
1548   The key established as a result of the pairing process MAY be either temporary (valid
1549   for a limited number of transactions or time) or persistent. A mechanism for endpoints to
1550   remove persistent keys SHALL be provided.
1551   Where cryptographic operations are required, approved cryptography SHALL be used.
1552   All communication of authentication data between authenticators and endpoints SHALL
1553   occur directly between those devices or through an authenticated protected channel
1554   between the authenticator and endpoint.
