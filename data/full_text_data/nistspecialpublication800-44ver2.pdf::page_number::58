      Request a copy of your credit report yearly from each of the three credit reporting agencies:
         Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian. If an identity thief opens accounts in your name, they will
         likely show up on your credit report. 38

 Validating official communication by personalizing emails and providing unique identifying
  information that only the organization and user should know. However, confidential information
  should not be disclosed.

 Using digital signatures on e-mail. However, digital signatures may not be validated automatically by
  the user’s email application.

 Performing content validation within the Web application. Vulnerabilities in the organization’s Web
  applications may be used in a phishing attack.

 Personalizing Web content, which can aid users in identifying a fraudulent Web site.

 Using token-based or mutual authentication at the Web site to prevent phishers from reusing previous
  authentication information to impersonate the user.

Most Web browsers provide some level of phishing protection. All Web browsers inform users when
they visit a secured site via a padlock or some other GUI mechanism, and they also inform users if the
Domain Name System (DNS) address visited does not match that of the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
certificate. However, phishing sites often use DNS addresses that are similar to those of the original sites
and that have a valid PKI certificate, making them harder to detect. In such cases, a Web browser would
notify the user of the danger only if the site was a known phishing site. Browsers may either download a
phishing blacklist from the browser manufacturer’s Web site periodically or check all Web requests
against an anti-phishing database. Organizations should use Web browser-provided anti-phishing features
where applicable. In addition, a number of vendors offer more advanced anti-phishing solutions and
services [APWG07]:

 Cousin Domain Monitoring and Prevention—Vendors (primarily domain name registrars) monitor
  and in some instances prevent the creation of domain names similar to those of organizations that
  may be subject to phishing attacks.

 Attack Detection and Analysis—Vendors monitor e-mail and Web communication to discover
  ongoing phishing campaigns so that organizations can take appropriate responses.

 Takedown—Vendors aid in limiting access to the phishing Web site.

 Fraud Analysis—Vendors monitor access to the organization’s Web site for potential fraud attempts
  (such as phishers attempting to use captured credentials) or monitor the Web for fraudulent use of an
  organization’s identity.

 Forensic Services—After discovery of a successful phishing attack, vendors aid in addressing issues
  that arise as a result of the attack.
