1462   9.   Usability Considerations
1463   This section is informative.
1464         Note: In this section, the term “users” means “applicants” or “subscribers.”
1465   This section is intended to raise implementers’ awareness of the usability considerations
1466   associated with enrollment and identity proofing (for usability considerations for typical
1467   authenticator usage and intermittent events, see [SP800-63B] Sec. 10.
1468   [ISO/IEC9241-11] defines usability as the “extent to which a system, product, or service
1469   can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency
1470   and satisfaction in a specified context of use.” This definition focuses on users, goals,
1471   and context of use as the necessary elements for achieving effectiveness, efficiency, and
1472   satisfaction. A holistic approach considering these key elements is necessary to achieve
1473   usability.
1474   The overarching goal of usability for enrollment and identity proofing is to promote a
1475   smooth, positive enrollment process for users by minimizing user burden (e.g., time and
1476   frustration) and enrollment friction (e.g., the number of steps to complete and amount
1477   of information to track). To achieve this goal, organizations have to first familiarize
1478   themselves with their users.
1479   The enrollment and identity proofing process sets the stage for a user’s interactions with a
1480   given CSP and the online services that the user will access; as negative first impressions
1481   can influence user perception of subsequent interactions, organizations need to promote a
1482   positive user experience throughout the process.
1483   Usability cannot be achieved in a piecemeal manner. Performing a usability evaluation on
1484   the enrollment and identity proofing process is critical. It is important to conduct usability
1485   evaluation with representative users, realistic goals and tasks, and appropriate contexts of
1486   use. The enrollment and identity proofing process should be designed and implemented
1487   so it is easy for users to do the right thing, hard to do the wrong thing, and easy to recover
1488   when the wrong thing happens.
1489   From the user’s perspective, the three main steps of enrollment and identity proofing are
1490   pre-enrollment preparation, the enrollment and proofing session, and post-enrollment
1491   actions. These steps may occur in a single session or there could be significant time
1492   elapsed between each one (e.g., days or weeks).
1493   General and step-specific usability considerations are described in sub-sections below.
1494   Guidelines and considerations are described from the users’ perspective.
1495   Accessibility differs from usability and is out of scope for this document. [Section508]
1496   was enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology and require federal agencies
1497   to make their electronic and information technology public content accessible to people
1498   with disabilities. Refer to Section 508 law and standards for accessibility guidance.
