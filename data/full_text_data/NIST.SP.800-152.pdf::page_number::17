2.2    Rationale for Cryptographic Key Management

Todayâ€™s information systems require protection against the denial of authorized use of their
services; unauthorized access to, or modification of, their information processing capabilities;
and unauthorized destruction of their equipment and facilities. The information systems
themselves must also protect the information that they contain from unauthorized disclosure,
modification, and destruction. These protections may be provided by physical means, such as
enclosures, locks, and guards, or they can be provided by logical means, such as
cryptography or software-based access control.

Cryptography is the only means for protecting data during transmission when physical
protection is cost-prohibitive or impossible to provide. Thus, cryptography is widely used
when business is conducted or sensitive information is transmitted over a network.
Cryptography also provides excellent protection for stored data against entities that are not
authorized to obtain or modify the data.

Cryptographic protection for data requires algorithms designed specifically for that purpose.
These algorithms often require the use of cryptographic keys, which are managed by an
FCKMS. The combination of the cryptographic algorithms and keys of an appropriate length
can be used to provide a level of protection for data; this level is commonly referred to as the
security strength (see [SP 800-57 Part1] for additional information).

Cryptographic-based security requires the secure management of keys throughout their
lifetime. Cryptography can reduce the scope of information management from protecting
large amounts of information to protecting a key and its associated metadata (i.e.,
information about the key). This Profile specifies requirements for the management of the
keys used to protect sensitive Federal information and the metadata associated with those
keys.

FR:2.1 The CKMS design shall specify all cryptographic algorithms and supported key sizes
for each algorithm used by the system.

FR:2.2 The CKMS design shall specify the estimated security strength of each cryptographic
technique that is employed to protect keys and their bound metadata.

Among the initial requirements for this Profile are requirements for the use of NIST-
approved cryptography and the minimum security strengths required for each [FIPS 199]
impact level.
