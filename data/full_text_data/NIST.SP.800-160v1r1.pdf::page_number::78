traceability matrix
A matrix that records the relationship between two or more products of the development process (e.g., a matrix that
records the relationship between the requirements and the design of a given software component). [24]

trade-off
Decision-making actions that select from various requirements and alternative solutions on the basis of net benefit to
the stakeholders. [4]

trade-off analysis
Determining the effect of decreasing one or more key factors and simultaneously increasing one or more other key
factors in a decision, design, or project.

transdisciplinary
Creating a unity of intellectual frameworks beyond the disciplinary perspectives. [135]

trust
A belief that an entity meets certain expectations and therefore, can be relied upon. [39]
         Note: The term belief implies that trust may be granted to an entity whether the entity is trustworthy or not.

trust relationship
An agreed upon relationship between two or more system elements that is governed by criteria for secure
interaction, behavior, and outcomes relative to the protection of assets.
         Note: This refers to trust relationships between system elements implemented by hardware, firmware, and
         software.

trustworthiness
Worthy of being trusted to fulfill whatever critical requirements may be needed for a particular component,
subsystem, system, network, application, mission, enterprise, or other entity. [2]
         Note: From a security perspective, a trustworthy system meets specific security requirements in addition to
         meeting other critical requirements.

trustworthy
The degree to which the behavior of a component is demonstrably compliant with its stated requirements.

user
Individual or group that interacts with a system or benefits from a system during its utilization. [91]
         Note: The role of user and the role of operator are sometimes vested, simultaneously or sequentially, in the
         same individual or organization.

validation
Confirmation, through the provision of objective evidence, that the requirements for a specific intended use or
application have been fulfilled. [78]
         Note: A system is able to accomplish its intended use, goals, and objectives (i.e., meet stakeholder
         requirements) in the intended operational environment. The right system was built.

verification
Confirmation, through the provision of objective evidence, that specified requirements have been fulfilled. [78]
         Note: Verification is a set of activities that compares a system or system element with the required
         characteristics. This includes but is not limited to specified requirements, design description, and the
         system itself. The system was built correctly.

view
Representation of a whole system from the perspective of a related set of concerns. [92]
         Note: A view can cover the entire system being examined or only a part of that system.
