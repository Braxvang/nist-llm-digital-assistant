          PR(DC)-3     The organization’s employee and contractor identification              DPCI         Privacy Act [PRIVACY]
                       SORNs are updated to reflect any changes in the disclosure
                       of information to other organizations in order to be consistent                     OMB Memorandum [M-05-24]

                       [A-130], Appendix 1.

                       Assessment

         (UPDATED)     comprehensive list of the types of information that will be                         Privacy Requirements
                       collected (e.g., transactional information, PII), the purpose of
                       collection, what information may be disclosed to whom during
                       the life of the derived PIV credential, how the information will
                       be protected, and the complete set of uses of the derived PIV

                       Assessment
                       Determine that:
                          (i) Before receiving the derived PIV credential, the issuer
                              requires the applicant to be notified of the PII that is
                              collected, how it will be used, what information will be
                              disclosed and to whom, and what protections are
                              provided to ensure the security of the information

                              the security of this information (interview).
          PR(DC)-5     The issuer employs technologies that allow for the                     DPCI         [FIPS201], Sec. 2.11 – PIV
                       continuous auditing of compliance with privacy policies and                         Privacy Requirements

                             policies and practices. This could include the use of
                             technology to monitor data access, data flows
                             between information systems, and the use of PII
