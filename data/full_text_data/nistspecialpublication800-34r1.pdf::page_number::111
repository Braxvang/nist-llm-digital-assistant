                                                 CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



An example of a validation data test for a high-impact system would be to log into the system database
and check the audit logs to determine that all transactions and updates are current. Detailed data test
procedures may be provided in Appendix E, System Validation Test Plan.

5.3     Validation Functionality Testing

Validation functionality testing is the process of verifying that {system name} functionality has been
tested, and the system is ready to return to normal operations.

Provide system functionality testing and validation procedures to ensure that the system is operating
correctly. This section may be combined with the Data Testing section if procedures test both the
functionality and data validity. Teams or persons responsible for each procedure should be identified.
An example of a functional test for a high-impact system may be logging into the system and running a
series of operations as a test or real user to ensure that all parts of the system are operating correctly.
Detailed functionality test procedures may be provided in Appendix E, System Validation Test Plan.

5.4     Recovery Declaration

Upon successfully completing testing and validation, the {designated authority} will formally declare
recovery efforts complete, and that {system name} is in normal operations. {System name} business and
technical POCs will be notified of the declaration by the ISCP Coordinator.

5.5     Notifications (users)

Upon return to normal system operations, {system name} users will be notified by {role} using
predetermined notification procedures (e.g., email, broadcast message, phone calls, etc.).

5.6     Cleanup

Cleanup is the process of cleaning up or dismantling any temporary recovery locations, restocking
supplies used, returning manuals or other documentation to their original locations, and readying the
system for a possible future contingency event.

Provide any specific cleanup procedures for the system, including preferred locations for manuals and
documents and returning backup or installation media to its original location.

5.7     Offsite Data Storage

It is important that all backup and installation media used during recovery be returned to the offsite data
storage location. The following procedures should be followed to return backup and installation media to
its offsite data storage location.

Provide procedures for returning retrieved backup or installation media to its offsite data storage
location. This may include proper logging and packaging of backup and installation media, preparing
for transportation, and validating that media is securely stored at the offsite location.
