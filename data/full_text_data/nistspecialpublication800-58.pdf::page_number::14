NIST SP 800-58                                             Voice Over IP Security
    _________________________________________________________________________

      VOIP. NIST strongly recommends that the WPA (or WEP if WPA is
      unavailable) security features be used as part of an overall defense-in-depth
      strategy. Despite their weaknesses, the 802.11 security mechanisms can provide
      a degree of protection against unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized network
      access, or other active probing attacks. However, the Federal Information
      Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic
      Modules, is mandatory and binding for Federal agencies that have determined that
      certain information must be protected via cryptographic means. As currently
      defined, neither WEP nor WPA meets the FIPS 140-2 standard. In these cases, it
      will be necessary to employ higher level cryptographic protocols and applications
      such as secure shell (SSH), Transport Level Security (TLS) or Internet Protocol
      Security (IPsec) with FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules and associated
      algorithms to protect information, regardless of whether the nonvalidated data
      link security protocols are used.

9. Carefully review statutory requirements regarding privacy and record
retention with competent legal advisors.

     Although legal issues regarding VOIP are beyond the scope of this document,
     readers should be aware that laws and rulings governing interception or monitoring
     of VOIP lines, and retention of call records, may be different from those for
     conventional telephone systems. Agencies should review these issues with their
     legal advisors. See Section 2.5 for more on these issues.
