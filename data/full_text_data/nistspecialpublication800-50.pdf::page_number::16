Users are the largest audience in any organization and are the single most important group of people who
can help to reduce unintentional errors and IT vulnerabilities. Users may include employees, contractors,
foreign or domestic guest researchers, other agency personnel, visitors, guests, and other collaborators or
associates requiring access. Users must:

   Understand and comply with agency security policies and procedures;
   Be appropriately trained in the rules of behavior for the systems and applications to which they have
    access;
   Work with management to meet training needs;
   Keep software/ applications updated with security patches; and
   Be aware of actions they can take to better protect their agency’s information. These actions include,
    but are not limited to: proper password usage, data backup, proper antivirus protection, reporting any
    suspected incidents or violations of security policy, and following rules established to avoid social
    engineering attacks and rules to deter the spread of spam or viruses and worms.
