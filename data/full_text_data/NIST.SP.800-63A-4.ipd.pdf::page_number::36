      NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                            Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                              Enrollment and Identity Proofing


925     3. CSPs SHALL store the biometric consent with the subscriber’s account.
926     4. CSPs SHALL have a documented, and publicly available, deletion process and
927        default retention period for all biometric information.
928     5. CSPs SHALL allow individuals to request deletion of their biometric information
929        at any time, except where otherwise restricted by regulation, law, or statute.
930     6. CSPs SHALL have all biometric algorithms tested by an independent entity
931        (e.g., accredited laboratory or research institution) for performance, including
932        performance across demographic groups.
933     7. Testing of all algorithms SHALL be consistent with published ISO/IEC standards
934        for the given modality.
935     8. CSPs SHALL meet the minimum performance thresholds for biometric usage:
936            • False match rate: 1:10,000 or better; and
937            • False non-match rate: 1:100 or better
938     9. CSPs SHALL employ biometric technologies that provide similar performance
939        characteristics for applicants of different demographic groups (racial background,
940        gender, ethnicity, etc.). If performance differences across demographic groups are
941        discovered, CSPs SHALL act expeditiously to provide redress options to affected
942        individuals and to close performance gaps.
943    10. CSPs SHALL make all performance and operational test results publicly available.
944    11. CSPs SHALL assess the performance and demographic impacts of employed
945        biometric technologies in conditions substantially similar to the operational
946        environment and user base of the system. When such assessments include real-
947        world users, participation by users SHALL be voluntary.
948    12. CSPs SHALL make all performance and operational test results publicly available.
949   The following requirements apply to CSPs who collect biometric characteristics from
950   applicants:
951     1. CSP SHALL collect biometrics in such a way that ensures that the biometric is
952        collected from the applicant, and not another subject.
953     2. When collecting and comparing biometrics remotely, the CSP SHALL implement
954        liveness detection capabilities to confirm the genuine presence of a live human
955        being and to mitigate spoofing and impersonation attempts.
956     3. When collecting biometrics in person, the CSP SHALL have the operator view
957        the biometric source (e.g., fingers, face) for presence of non-natural materials and
958        perform such inspections as part of the proofing process.
