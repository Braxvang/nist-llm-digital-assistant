                                               TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



In this type of case, one or more subject matter experts (SME) may be needed to augment the regular
assessors. The SME may be an experienced security tester and system expert, or may be skilled only in
the system being tested. Regardless, SMEs should be educated on the goals, objectives, approach, and
process of the assessment—and should also be included in the planning process whenever possible
because they may have critical knowledge to contribute.

Assessors need to remain abreast of new technology and the latest means by which an adversary may
attack that technology. They should periodically refresh their knowledge base, reassess their
methodology-updating techniques as appropriate, and update their tool kits. For example, attending
technical training courses, performing hands-on testing in a test environment, or researching the latest
vulnerabilities and exploits are just a few activities in which assessors should regularly engage. Assessors
should also perform technical hands-on tests in operational environments on a regular basis to maintain
and improve their skills.

Responsibilities of assessors include:

     Informing the appropriate parties—such as security officers, management, system administrators,
      and users—of security assessment activities
     Developing assessment plans with system managers, the Information Systems Security Officer
      (ISSO), and the CISO
     Executing examinations and tests, and collecting all relevant data
     Analyzing collected data and developing mitigation recommendations
     Conducting additional examinations and tests when needed to validate mitigation actions.
In some cases, engaging third parties (e.g., auditors, contractor support staff) to conduct the assessment
offers an independent view and approach that internal assessors may not be able to provide.
Organizations may also use third parties to provide specific subject matter expertise that is not available
internally. While it can be beneficial to gain an external perspective on the security posture, giving
outsiders access to an organization’s systems can introduce additional risk. External entities should be
properly vetted to ensure that they possess the necessary skills, experience, and integrity, and should be
asked to assume some of the risk associated with the security assessment in that they may be responsible
for damages incurred by the organization being assessed. External entities should also understand and
comply with the organization’s applicable policies and operational and security requirements.

In addition to those listed above, the responsibilities for external assessors include:

     Coordinating and communicating with the organization being assessed
     Ensuring that proper authority is granted, and maintaining a signed copy of the assessment plan to
      ensure all updates are documented
     Signing and abiding by any required nondisclosure agreements
     Properly protecting data in accordance with the organization’s regulations, including handling,
      transmission, storage, and deletion of all collected data and resulting reports.
6.4.2   Location Selection

The environment in which assessors operate differs according to the techniques being used. For many
types of tests, assessors can operate either onsite or offsite, with onsite testing defined as testing executed
