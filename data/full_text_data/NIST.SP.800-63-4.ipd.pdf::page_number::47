       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


1324   The preliminary selection assumes that higher potential impacts of failures in the
1325   authentication process should be mitigated by higher assurance processes. While this
1326   is often the case, organizations should consider the specific failures, impact categories,
1327   and impacted entities identified as part of the impact analysis to determine if additional
1328   tailoring is warranted. Further, organizations should consider legal, regulatory, or
1329   policy requirements that govern digital services. For example, the terms of [EO13681]
1330   requiring “that all organizations making personal data accessible to citizens through
1331   digital applications require the use of multiple factors of authentication,” which would
1332   drive the selection of AAL2 or AAL3.
1333   The result of this process, including any additional tailoring, is the initial assessment of
1334   the AAL, which will be as assessed against additional potential impacts as described in
1335   Sec. 5.3.

1336   5.2.3.3. Selecting Initial FAL
1337   The FAL reflects the level of assurance in identity assertions that convey the results of
1338   authentication processes and relevant identity information to RP systems. Organizations
1339    SHALL use a risk-based approach to select the most appropriate federation requirements
1340   for their RP application. The impact analysis described in Sec. 5.3.1 informs the selection
1341   of the initial FAL selection. This initial selection SHALL be tailored, as described in
1342   Sec. 5.3, based on mission needs, risk tolerance, and potential impacts to privacy, equity,
1343   and usability, before making a final FAL determination.
1344   The initial FAL SHALL be assessed based on the potential impacts of failures in the
1345   presentation or acceptance of assertions in federated identity architectures. Examples
1346   of compromise include use of assertion replay to impersonate a valid user or leakage of
1347   assertion information through the browser. As described in Sec. 5.1, potential impacts
1348    SHALL be considered from the perspective of the organization, individuals, other
1349   organizations, and the nation, for harms incurred through the use or operation of the
1350   RP application, as the level of harm from a failure could vary significantly across these
1351   entities. Organizations SHOULD consider the worst-case when identifying the overall
1352   impact level of the RP application, but may use risk management processes to tailor their
1353   initial selection when there are differing impacts.
1354   When assessing the overall impact level of the RP application, the organization SHOULD
1355   consider impacts to mission delivery separately from other impact categories. Potential
1356   failures in federated architectures that could lead to harms in mission delivery MAY be
1357   assessed by the organization to determine if the associated impacts would be mitigated or
1358   exacerbated by the implementation of more rigorous controls by identity providers. As
1359   such, the organization may exclude the mission delivery impact category when initially
1360   identifying the overall impact level of the RP application, as these impacts will need to be
1361   considered in the tailoring process.
