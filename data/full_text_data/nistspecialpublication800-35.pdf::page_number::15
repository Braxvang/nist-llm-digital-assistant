1.    Introduction

1.1   Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency
Information Systems, as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright though attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority. Nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.

1.2   Purpose

Organizations frequently must evaluate, select, and employ a variety of IT security services in order to
maintain and improve their overall IT security programs. IT security services (e.g., security policy
development, intrusion detection support, etc.) may be offered by an IT group internal to an organization,
or by a growing group of vendors. Individuals who are responsible for selecting, implementing, and
managing IT security services for an organization must carefully review the necessary processes and
procedures, weigh a host of available options, and select resources that can be entrusted to optimally meet
IT security program requirements.

Factors to be considered when selecting, implementing, and managing IT security services include: the
type of service arrangement; service provider qualifications, requirements, experience, and viability;
trustworthiness of service provider employees; and protection for organization systems, applications, and
data. These considerations may apply (in varying degrees) depending on the size, type, complexity, cost,
and criticality of the services being considered.

The purpose of this guide is to provide assistance with selecting, implementing, and managing IT security
services by guiding the organization through the various phases of the IT security services life cycle. The
IT security services life cycle provides a framework that enables the IT security decision makers to
organize their IT security effortsâ€”from initiation to closeout. The systematic management of the IT
security services process is critically important. Failure to consider and manage the many complex issues
involved can seriously impact the organization. IT security decision makers must think about the costs
and security requirements, as well as organizational mission and strategic functions, personnel and service
provider arrangements.

This guide discusses each phase of the IT security services life cycle to provide a starting point for
evaluating and selecting sound security practices. The discussion is directed toward a wide variety of
organizations with diverse IT security requirements. The guide discusses general topics such as the
