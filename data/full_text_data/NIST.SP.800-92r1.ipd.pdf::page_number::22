      NIST SP 800-92r1 ipd                                                     Cybersecurity Log Management

582      4. TS-3.4: Determine how log data should or must be transferred to the log infrastructure,
583         including out-of-band methods where appropriate, and how frequently log data should or
584         must be transferred.
585      5. TS-3.5: Determine how the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of each log event
586         should or must be protected while in storage at the log source, while in the log
587         infrastructure, while being transferred from the log source to the log infrastructure, and
588         while being transferred from one log infrastructure component to another.
589      6. TS-3.6: Determine how much log storage space should or must be available at the log
590         sources and the log infrastructure.
591      7. TS-3.7: Determine how to handle log storage and log transfer errors at the log sources
592         and the log infrastructure.
593      8. TS-3.8: Determine if and when each type of log event should or must be transferred from
594         active storage to cold data storage for data retention purposes.
595      9. TS-3.9: Determine which log format/type to use (if this is an option).
596      10. TS-3.10: Determine how the protection of log storage and transfers should or must be
597          monitored and validated to ensure their confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
598   Supporting information for tasks: Completing these tasks effectively designs the high-level
599   architecture of the log infrastructure, such as the logical and physical locations of centralized log
600   data storage and various log analysis services. When most organizations only had one or a few
601   closely related logging use cases, a centralized logging server or group of servers could often
602   handle all of an organizationâ€™s logging infrastructure needs. Now, organizations often have
603   several diverse logging use cases and magnitudes more data to process and store, so more
604   complex logging architectures have become commonplace. For example, some organizations use
605   a massive data lake to hold all of their security log data instead of a centralized log management
606   and analysis service. Each logging use case probably has one or more different tools that
607   consume log data, and these tools can retrieve data from the data lake instead of having to
608   interact with all of the log sources. This can be much more efficient in terms of time, network
609   bandwidth, and especially storage.
610   Another consideration when performing these tasks is the possibility of another entity, such as a
611   parent organization or an outsourcer, taking care of some or all of your centralized log storage
612   needs in the future. Log storage needs are highly variable over time, although they generally
613   continue to increase. Cloud-based log storage can provide rapid scalability that on-premises log
614   storage often cannot.
615   Organizations will also need to determine whether their original logs need to be preserved for a
616   certain period of time or if preserving log data copied to a centralized log server or storage is
617   acceptable. In many environments, original logs only need to be preserved if they may be needed
618   as evidence.
