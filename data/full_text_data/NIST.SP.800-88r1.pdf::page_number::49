Appendix B—Glossary

ATA                     Magnetic media interface specification. Also known as “IDE” –
                        Integrated Drive Electronics.

BD                      A Blu-ray Disc (BD) has the same shape and size as a CD or DVD,
                        but has a higher density and gives the option for data to be multi-
                        layered.

Bend                    The use of a mechanical process to physically transform the storage
                        media to alter its shape and make reading the media difficult or
                        infeasible using state of the art laboratory techniques.

Clear                   A method of Sanitization by applying logical techniques to sanitize
                        data in all user-addressable storage locations for protection against
                        simple non-invasive data recovery techniques using the same
                        interface available to the user; typically applied through the standard
                        read and write commands to the storage device, such as by rewriting
                        with a new value or using a menu option to reset the device to the
                        factory state (where rewriting is not supported).

CD                      A Compact Disc (CD) is a class of media from which data are read
                        by optical means.

CD-RW                   A Compact Disc Read/Write (CD-RW) is a CD that can be Purged
                        and rewritten multiple times.

CD-R                    A Compact Disc Recordable (CD-R) is a CD that can be written on
                        only once but read many times. Also known as WORM.

CE                      See Cryptographic Erase.

CMRR                    The Center for Magnetic Recording Research, located at the
                        University of California, San Diego, advances the state-of-the-art in
                        magnetic storage and trains graduate students and postdoctoral
                        professionals (CMRR homepage: http://cmrr.ucsd.edu/).

Cut                     The use of a tool or physical technique to cause a break in the
                        surface of the electronic storage media, potentially breaking the
                        media into two or more pieces and making it difficult or infeasible to
                        recover the data using state of the art laboratory techniques.

Cryptographic Erase     A method of Sanitization in which the Media Encryption Key
                        (MEK) for the encrypted Target Data (or the Key Encryption Key –
                        KEK) is sanitized, making recovery of the decrypted Target Data
                        infeasible.
