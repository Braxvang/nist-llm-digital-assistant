      NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                                Enrollment and Identity Proofing


789      4. The CSP SHALL provide mechanisms for redress of applicant complaints and for
790         problems arising from the identity proofing. These mechanisms SHALL be easy
791         for applicants to find and use. The CSP SHALL assess the mechanisms for their
792         efficacy in achieving resolution of complaints or problems.

793   5.1.3. General Equity Requirements
794   In support of the goal of improved equity, and as part of its overall risk assessment
795   process, the CSP SHALL assess the elements of its identity service to identify processes
796   or technologies that can possibly result in inequitable access, treatment, or outcomes for
797   members of one group as compared to others. See Sec. 10 for a non-exhaustive list of
798   identity proofing processes and technologies that may be subject to inequitable access or
799   outcomes.
800   Note that executive order 13985 [EO13985], Advancing Racial Equity and Support for
801   Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, requires each federal
802   agency to assess whether, and to what extent, its programs and policies perpetuate
803   systemic barriers to opportunities and benefits for people of color and other underserved
804   groups.
805   When assessing the risk of inequitable access, treatment, or outcomes, the following
806   requirements apply:
807      1. Based on the results of its risk assessment, the CSP SHALL document the
808         measures it takes to mitigate the possibility of inequitable access, treatment, or
809         outcomes.
810      2. The CSP SHALL re-assess the risks to equitable access, treatment, or outcomes
811         any time it makes changes to its identity service that affect the processes or
812         technologies.
813      3. The CSP SHALL re-assess the risks to equitable access, treatment, or outcomes
814         periodically to ensure it accurately reflects the current risks associated with its
815         service.
816      4. The CSP SHALL NOT make applicant participation in these risk assessments
817         mandatory.
818      5. The CSP SHALL make the results of its assessment of risks associated with
819         inequitable access, treatment, or outcomes, and any associated mitigations,
820         available to any organizations or individuals that use its service.
821      6. The CSP SHALL also make the results of its assessment publicly available.
