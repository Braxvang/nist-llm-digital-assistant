OT Discussion: Organizations identify OT systems and system components with specific
calibration, maintenance, or other requirements and limit maintenance to specific facilities. Some
examples may include safety-critical systems or systems involved in custody transfer where
accuracy tolerances are limited and additional quality control checks are required.
Rationale for adding MA-7 to LOW, MOD, and HIGH baselines: Some OT equipment have
specific requirements for calibration, maintenance, and modification to meet regulatory or safety
standards. Different deployed locations may impact the quality and precision of field
maintenance.
