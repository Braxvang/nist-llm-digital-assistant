NIST SP 800-166                                                      DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                     DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

 Expected Result(s)          1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                                template with the status word '90 00'.
                             2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                                along with the status word '90 00'.
                             3. From Step 5, if the public key algorithm is RSA, then the
                                keyUsage extension only asserts the keyEncipherment bit. If
                                the public key algorithm is elliptic curve, then the keyUsage
                                extension only asserts the keyAgreement bit.

9.3.3.5 Certificate Policy

 Test Assertion              TA-09.03.03.05
 Purpose                     Verifies the key management certificate asserts the appropriate
                             certificate policy OID.
 DTR(s)                      • DTR-07.03.03.06
 Issuer Documentation        None.
 Precondition(s)             • A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                                appropriate token reader.
                             • Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                                an instance of the reader.
                             • A key management certificate is present within the Derived
                                PIV Application.
 Test Scenario               1. Send the SELECT command with
                                   • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                             2. Send the GET DATA command with
                                   • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                      ('5FC10B') of the X.509 Certificate for Key
                                      Management data object
                             3. Extract the value of the certificatePolicies
                                extension from the certificate.
 Expected Result(s)          1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                                template with the status word '90 00'.
                             2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                                along with the status word '90 00'.
                             3. From Step 3, the certificatePolicies extension asserts one of the
                                following: id-fpki-common-policy, id-fpki-common-hardware
                                or id-fpki-common-High.

9.3.3.6 Authority Information Access Extension

 Test Assertion              TA-09.03.03.06
 Purpose                     Verifies that the authority information access extension in the key
                             management certificate is populated appropriately and contains an
                             id-ad-caIssuers (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2) accessMethod, which points to
                             the location where the certificates issued to the issuer of this
                             certificate can be found.
