     greater disruption and financial loss than the incident itself. Creating and
     maintaining a list of internal and external points of contact (POC), along with
     backups for each contact, should assist in making communications among
     parties easier and faster.
   • Define Incident Response Team Services. Although the main focus of an
     incident response team is performing incident response, most teams offer
     additional services. Examples of the types of services an incident response
     team can provide to the organization include security advisory distribution,
     vulnerability assessment, intrusion detection, and education and awareness.
   • Select a Team Structure and Staffing Model. The organization should
     select the team structure and staffing model best suited to its needs. When
     contemplating the best team structure and staffing model, an organization
     should considers several factors, such as size of the organization, the
     geographic diversity of major computing resources, the need for 24/7
     availability, cost, and staff expertise.
   • Staff and Train the Incident Response Team. Members of the incident
     response team should have excellent technical and problem-solving skills
     because they are critical to the team’s success. Excellent teamwork,
     organizational, communication, and speaking skills are important as well. Most
     incident response teams have a team manager and a deputy team manager
     who assumes authority in the absence of the team manager. In addition, some
     teams also have a technical lead who assumes oversight of and final
     responsibility for the quality of the technical work performed by the entire
     incident response team. Also, larger teams often assign an incident lead as the
     primary POC for handling a specific incident.
    Organizations typically find it challenging to maintain situational awareness for
handling large-scale incidents because of their complexity. Many people within the
organization may play a role in the incident response, and the organization may need
to communicate rapidly and efficiently with various external groups. Collecting,
organizing, and analyzing all the pieces of information so that the right decisions can
be made and executed are not easy tasks. The key to maintaining situational
awareness is to prepare thoroughly to handle large-scale incidents. Two specific
actions that support this matter are as follows:
   • Establish and Maintain Accurate Notification Mechanisms. Organizations
     should establish, document, maintain, and exercise on-hour and off-hour
     contact and notification mechanisms for various individuals and groups within
     the organization (e.g., chief information officer [CIO], head of information
     security, IT support, business continuity planning) and outside the organization
     (e.g., incident response organizations, counterparts at other organizations).
   • Develop Written Guidelines for Prioritizing Incidents. Incident response
     teams should handle each incident with the appropriate priority, based on the
     criticality of the affected resources and the current and potential technical
     effect of the incident. For example, data destruction on a user workstation
     might result in a minor loss of productivity, whereas root compromise of a
     public Web server might result in a major loss of revenue, productivity, access
     to services, and reputation, as well as the release of confidential data (e.g.,
     credit card numbers, social security numbers). Because incident responders
     normally work under stressful conditions ripe for human error, it is important to
     clearly define and articulate the incident handling priority process. The incident
