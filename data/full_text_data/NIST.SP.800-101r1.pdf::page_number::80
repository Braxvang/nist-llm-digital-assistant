                                                        Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

Near Field Communication (NFC) – A form of contactless, close proximity, radio
communications based on radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology.

Password Protected – The ability to protect the contents of a file or device from being
accessed until the correct password is entered.

Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) – A handheld computer that serves as a tool for reading and
conveying documents, electronic mail, and other electronic media over a communications link,
as well as for organizing personal information, such as a name-and-address database, a to-do
list, and an appointment calendar.

Personal Information Management (PIM) Applications – A core set of applications that
provide the electronic equivalents of such items as an agenda, address book, notepad, and
reminder list.

Personal Information Management (PIM) Data – The set of data types such as contacts,
calendar entries, phonebook entries, notes, memos, and reminders maintained on a device,
which may be synchronized with a personal computer.

Post Office Protocol (POP) – A standard protocol used to receive electronic mail from a
server.

Probative Data – Information that reveals the truth of an allegation.

Push-To-Talk (PTT) – A method of communicating on half-duplex communication lines,
including two-way radio, using a “walkie-talkie” button to switch from voice reception to
transmit mode.

Removable User Identity Module (R-UIM) – A card developed for cdmaOne/CDMA2000
handsets that extends the GSM SIM card to CDMA phones and networks.

Secure Digital eXtended Capacity (SDXC) – Supports cards up to 2 TB, compared to a limit
of 32 GB for SDHC cards in the SD 2.0 specification.

Short Message Service (SMS) – A cellular network facility that allows users to send and
receive text messages of up to 160 alphanumeric characters on their handset.

SMS Chat – A facility for exchanging messages in real-time using SMS text messaging that
allows previously exchanged messages to be viewed.

Steganography – The art and science of communicating in a way that hides the existence of
the communication. For example, a child pornography image can be hidden inside another
graphic image file, audio file, or other file format.

Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) – A smart card chip specialized for use in GSM
equipment.

Synchronization Protocols – Protocols that allow users to view, modify, and transfer/update
data between a cell phone and personal computer.
