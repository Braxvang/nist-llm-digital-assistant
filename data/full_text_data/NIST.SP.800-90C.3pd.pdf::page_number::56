       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                        Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

1543       RBG3 Constructions Based on Physical Entropy Sources
1544   An RBG3 construction is designed to provide full entropy (i.e., an RBG3 construction can support
1545   all security strengths). The RBG3 constructions specified in this Recommendation include one or
1546   more entropy sources and an approved DRBG from SP 800-90A that can and will be instantiated
1547   at a security strength of 256 bits. If an entropy source fails in an undetected manner, the RBG
1548   continues to operate as an RBG2(P) construction, providing outputs at the security strength of its
1549   DRBG (256 bits) (see Section 5 and Appendix A). If a failure is detected, the RBG operation shall
1550   be terminated.
1551   Two RBG3 constructions are specified:
1552       1. RBG3(XOR) − This construction is based on combining the output of one or more
1553          validated entropy sources with the output of an instantiated, approved DRBG using an
1554          exclusive-or operation (see Section 6.2).
1555       2. RBG3(RS) − This construction is based on using one or more validated entropy sources to
1556          continuously reseed the DRBG (see Section 6.3).
1557   An RBG3 construction continually accesses its entropy sources, and its DRBG may be reseeded
1558   whenever requested (e.g., to provide prediction resistance for the DRBG’s output). Upon receipt
1559   of a request for random bits from a consuming application, the entropy source is accessed to obtain
1560   sufficient bits for the request. See Sections 3.1 and 3.2 for further discussion about accessing the
1561   entropy source(s).
1562   An implementation may be designed so that the DRBG implementation used within an RBG3
1563   construction can be directly accessed by a consuming application (i.e., the directly accessible
1564   DRBG uses the same internal state as the RBG3 construction).
1565   An RBG3 construction is useful when bits with full entropy are required or a higher security
1566   strength than RBG1 and RBG2 constructions can support is needed.

1567           General Requirements
1568   RBG3 constructions have the following general security requirements. See Sections 6.2.2 and 6.3.2
1569   for additional requirements for the RBG3(XOR) and RBG3(RS) constructions, respectively.
1570       1. An RBG3 construction shall be designed to provide outputs with full entropy using one or
1571          more validated independent physical entropy sources as specified for Method 1 in Section
1572          3.3 (i.e., only the entropy provided by validated physical entropy sources shall be counted
1573          toward fulfilling entropy requests, although entropy provided by any validated non-
1574          physical entropy source may be used but not counted).
1575       2. An RBG3 construction and its components shall be successfully validated for compliance
1576          with the corresponding requirements in [SP800-90A], [SP800-90B], SP 800-90C, [FIPS
1577          140] and the specification of any other approved algorithm used within the RBG, as
1578          appropriate.
1579       3. The DRBG within the RBG3 construction shall be capable of supporting a security strength
1580          of 256 bits (i.e., a CTR_DRBG based on AES-256 or either Hash_DRBG or
1581          HMAC_DRBG using a hash function with an output length of at least 256 bits).
