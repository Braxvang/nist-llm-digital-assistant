deployment decisions, systems and network administrators may first perform deployment testing
before pushing new software into the production environment.
Administrators consider a broad spectrum of test scenarios to evaluate a software update and
decide what tests will be sufficient to indicate that the update is ready for the production
environment. A phased approach to component level, feature, network, and enterprise-wide
testing is typically recommended for deployment testing.
For example, when introducing a new enterprise capability, such as managed mobile devices or
mobile application vetting, the administrator should consider rolling out a limited trial with only
a small set of carefully chosen users. After the trial deployment has been operating satisfactorily
for a predetermined period of time, and if the user experience and satisfaction have met their
target level, the organization may then be ready for an enterprise-wide deployment. Following
this approach not only ensures minimal disruption to the enterprise operation and a satisfactory
user experience but also facilitates the discovery of security issues as early as possible in the
deployment process.

       Operate and Maintain
It is necessary to design and implement security controls to protect enterprise systems, as well as
enterprise and user data. However, the initial deployment of controls is not sufficient to protect
an operational enterprise. In addition, IT audits should be used to periodically evaluate the
effectiveness of security controls for protecting the evolving enterprise, identify security issues,
and modify or add controls to better protect the system in the future. Auditors need data to
perform those evaluations, and mobile device usage logs provide important data for assessing the
effectiveness of controls on the mobile computing environment.

5.4.1. Auditing
In order to keep up with a rapidly changing attack surface and cybersecurity landscape, the
enterprise security team may practice and conduct security assessments. An essential component
of such assessments is the periodic audit of the enterprise IT and mobile networking
infrastructure. A comprehensive audit should cover the following:
   •   Enumerate the enterprise audit objectives;
   •   Establish a security baseline through periodic (e.g., annual) audits;
   •   Rely on auditors with well-established (and verified) security assessment experience;
   •   Develop an automated audit process to cover all of the enterprise IT infrastructure,
       including mobile devices;
   •   Analyze the data generated by the audit process rather than relying on compliance
       checklists;
   •   Use a third-party auditor to report risks facing the enterprise.
Periodic audits should include the enterprise mobile infrastructure and device management
systems, as well as components such as EMM/MDM, services for mobile app vetting, integration
with backend services, and the employees’ mobile devices and their applications. The audit
