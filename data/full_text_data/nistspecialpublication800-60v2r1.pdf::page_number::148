The unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting conflict resolution
information may adversely affect mission operations in a manner that results in unacceptable
consequences such as loss of human life and/or major property assets.

The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of information can be very serious
if the modification is to time-critical operational information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
foreign affairs information is high.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to foreign affairs information.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Diplomatic missions are often
tolerant of delays. Therefore, the availability impact level assigned to information associated
with treaties and agreements that are associated with diplomatic missions is low. Where this
is not the case, the availability impact for foreign affairs information associated with treaties
and agreements may be high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
foreign affairs information is moderate.

D.5.2 International Development and Humanitarian Aid Information Type

International Development and Humanitarian Aid refers to those activities related to the
implementation of development and humanitarian assistance programs to developing and
transitioning countries throughout the world. Development and aid may include technical
assistance (the transfer of knowledge and expertise), and the delivery of equipment, commodities
and humanitarian assistance including food aid. In some cases, international development and
humanitarian aid information is subject to security classification. This classified information is
treated under separate rules established for national security information. The recommended
categorization for unclassified international development and humanitarian aid information
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of international
development and humanitarian aid information on the ability of responsible agencies to execute
programs relating to debt relief, foreign investments, poverty alleviation and food relief, foreign
market expansion, and donations, as well as the establishment of policies and procedures to
facilitate economic development.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The unauthorized disclosure of
international development and humanitarian aid information may not directly jeopardize foreign
