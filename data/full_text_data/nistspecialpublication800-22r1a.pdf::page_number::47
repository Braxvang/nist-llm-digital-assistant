        For this block, the trial feedback algorithm works. If this were not the case, other feedback
        algorithms would be attempted for the block (e.g., adding bits 1 and 3 to produce bit 5, or adding
        bits 1, 2 and 3 to produce bit 6, etc.).

(1)     Under an assumption of randomness, calculate the theoretical mean µ:

                                         µ=       +
                                                     (
                                                M 9 + (− 1)M +1
                                                                −
                                                                  ) (M 3 + 2 9 ).
                                                2      36                   M
                                                                        2


        For the example in this section, µ =            +
                                                         (
                                                     13 9 + (− 1)13+1
                                                                      −
                                                                       ) (13 3 + 2 9 ) = 6.777222.
                                                      2      36                  13
                                                                                2
(4)     For each substring, calculate a value of Ti, where Ti = (− 1)M • (Li − µ )+ 2 9 .


        For the example, Ti = (− 1)
                                         13
                                              (4 − 6.777222 )+ 2 9 = 2.999444.

(5)     Record the Ti values in v0,…, v6 as follows:

                If:      Ti ≤ -2.5                       Increment vo by one
                         -2.5 < Ti ≤ -1.5                Increment v1 by one
                         -1.5 < Ti ≤ -0.5                Increment v2 by one
                         -0.5 < Ti ≤ 0.5                 Increment v3 by one
                         0.5 < Ti ≤ 1.5                  Increment v4 by one
                         1.5 < Ti ≤ 2.5                  Increment v5 by one
                         Ti > 2.5                        Increment v6 by one

                               K     (vi − Nπ i )2
(6)     Compute χ 2 ( obs ) = ∑                      , where π0 = 0.010417, π1 = 0.03125, π2 = 0.125, π3 = 0.5,
                               i=0       Nπ i
        π4 = 0.25, π5 = 0.0625, π6 = 0.020833 are the probabilities computed by the equations in Section
        3.10.

                                          K χ 2 ( obs ) 
(7)     Compute P-value = igamc            ,            .
                                         2       2      
                                                        
