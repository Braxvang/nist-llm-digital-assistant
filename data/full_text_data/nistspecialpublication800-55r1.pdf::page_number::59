Measure ID       Contingency Plan Testing Measure 1 (or a unique identifier to be filled out by the
                 organization)
Goal             •   Strategic Goal: Ensure an environment of comprehensive security and accountability
                     for personnel, facilities, and products.
                 •   Information Security Goal: Establish, maintain, and effectively implement plans for
                     emergency response, backup operations, and post-disaster recovery for
                     organizational information systems to ensure the availability of critical information
                     resources and continuity of operations in emergency situations.
Measure          Percentage (%) of information systems that have conducted annual contingency plan
                 testing
                 NIST SP 800-53 Controls: CP-4: Contingency Plan Testing and Exercises
Measure Type     Effectiveness/Efficiency
Formula          (Number of information systems that have conducted annual contingency plans
                 testing/number of information systems in the system inventory) *100
Target           This should be a high percentage defined by the organization.
Implementation   1. How many information systems are in the system inventory? _____
Evidence         2. How many information systems have an approved contingency plan (CP-2)? _____
                 3. How many contingency plans were successfully tested within the past year (CP-4)?
                 _____
