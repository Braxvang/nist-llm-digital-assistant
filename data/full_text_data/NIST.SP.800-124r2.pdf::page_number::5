Abstract
Mobile devices were initially personal consumer communication devices, but they are now
permanent fixtures in enterprises and are used to access modern networks and systems to process
sensitive data. This publication assists organizations in managing and securing these devices by
describing available technologies and strategies. Security concerns inherent to the usage of
mobile devices are explored alongside mitigations and countermeasures. Recommendations are
provided for the deployment, use, and disposal of devices throughout the mobile-device life
cycle. The scope of this publication includes mobile devices, centralized device management,
and endpoint protection technologies, as well as both organization-provided and personally
owned deployment scenarios.

Keywords
enterprise mobility management (EMM); mobile; mobile application vetting (MAV); mobile
device management (MDM); mobile security; mobile threat defense (MTD); tablets.

Reports on Computer Systems Technology
The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
with industry, government, and academic organizations.
