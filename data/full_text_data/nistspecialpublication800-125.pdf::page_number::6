Executive Summary

Virtualization is the simulation of the software and/or hardware upon which other software runs. This
simulated environment is called a virtual machine (VM). There are many forms of virtualization,
distinguished primarily by computing architecture layer. This publication focuses on the form of
virtualization known as full virtualization. In full virtualization, one or more OSs and the applications
they contain are run on top of virtual hardware. Each instance of an OS and its applications runs in a
separate VM called a guest operating system. The guest OSs on a host are managed by the hypervisor.
which controls the flow of instructions between the guest OSs and the physical hardware, such as CPU,
disk storage, memory, and network interface cards. The hypervisor can partition the system’s resources
and isolate the guest OSs so that each has access to only its own resources, as well as possible access to
shared resources such as files on the host OS. Also, each guest OS can be completely encapsulated,
making it portable. Some hypervisors run on top of another OS, which is known as the host operating
system.

The recent increase in the use of full virtualization products and services has been driven by many
benefits. One of the most common reasons for adopting full virtualization is operational efficiency:
organizations can use their existing hardware (and new hardware purchases) more efficiently by putting
more load on each computer. In general, servers using full virtualization can use more of the computer’s
processing and memory resources than servers running a single OS instance and a single set of services. A
second common use of full virtualization is for desktop virtualization, where a single PC is running more
than one OS instance. Desktop virtualization can provide support for applications that only run on a
particular OS. It allows changes to be made to an OS and subsequently revert to the original if needed,
such as to eliminate changes that negatively affect security. Desktop virtualization also supports better
control of OSs to ensure that they meet the organization’s security requirements.

Full virtualization has some negative security implications. Virtualization adds layers of technology,
which can increase the security management burden by necessitating additional security controls. Also,
combining many systems onto a single physical computer can cause a larger impact if a security
compromise occurs. Further, some virtualization systems make it easy to share information between the
systems; this convenience can turn out to be an attack vector if it is not carefully controlled. In some
cases, virtualized environments are quite dynamic, which makes creating and maintaining the necessary
security boundaries more complex.

This publication discusses the security concerns associated with full virtualization technologies for server
and desktop virtualization, and provides recommendations for addressing these concerns. Most existing
recommended security practices remain applicable in virtual environments. The practices described in this
document build on and assume the implementation of practices described in other NIST publications.

To improve the security of server and desktop full virtualization technologies, organizations should
implement the following recommendations:

Secure all elements of a full virtualization solution and maintain their security.

The security of a full virtualization solution is heavily dependent on the individual security of each of its
components, from the hypervisor and host OS (if applicable) to guest OSs, applications, and storage.
Organizations should secure all of these elements and maintain their security based on sound security
practices, such as keeping software up-to-date with security patches, using secure configuration baselines,
and using host-based firewalls, antivirus software, or other appropriate mechanisms to detect and stop
attacks. In general, organizations should have the same security controls in place for virtualized operating
systems as they have for the same operating systems running directly on hardware. The same is true for
