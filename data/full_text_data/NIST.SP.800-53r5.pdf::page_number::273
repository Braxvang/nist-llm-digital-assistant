                                                                                                       Discussion: Organizations have many options for responding to risk including mitigating risk by
                                                                                                       implementing new controls or strengthening existing controls, accepting risk with appropriate
                                                                                                       justification or rationale, sharing or transferring risk, or avoiding risk. The risk tolerance of the
                                                                                                       organization influences risk response decisions and actions. Risk response addresses the need to
                                                                                                       determine an appropriate response to risk before generating a plan of action and milestones
                                                                                                       entry. For example, the response may be to accept risk or reject risk, or it may be possible to
                                                                                                       mitigate the risk immediately so that a plan of action and milestones entry is not needed.
                                                                                                       However, if the risk response is to mitigate the risk, and the mitigation cannot be completed
                                                                                                       immediately, a plan of action and milestones entry is generated.
