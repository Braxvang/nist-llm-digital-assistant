The first step in the initial assessment was recognizing that there were essentially three main areas that
could benefit from WLAN services:

     The commission offices, in which employees conducted their day-to-day business
     The administrative law courts, in which registered attorneys, reporters, and expert witnesses
      needed limited access to court information systems and the ability to access their own office
      servers. Opposing attorneys’ traffic should be isolated from each other, to avoid even the
      appearance of eavesdropping.
