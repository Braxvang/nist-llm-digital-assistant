GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



 If the application environment precludes access to an on-line tag password database (e.g., mobile
  readers in remote locations), then the implementing organization may need to take simplifying
  measures, such as assigning the same password to multiple tags. In cases such as these, the
  compromise of a single password could compromise the integrity of the entire system.
 RFID passwords can be obtained through brute force methods (i.e., cycling through all possible
  passwords) when the tag technology is limited to short passwords. 49
 RFID passwords can be revealed through power analysis attacks on some types of passive tags. 50
5.3.1.2 Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC)

Control: Both the reader and the tag share a common secret key that can be used in combination with a
hash algorithm to provide one-way or mutual authentication between tag and reader. When HMAC is
applied to messages, it also ensures the integrity of data in the messages. HMAC is specified in FIPS
Publication 198. 51 HMAC supports any cryptographic hash algorithm, but Federal agencies must use one
of the secure hash algorithms (SHA) specified in FIPS Publication 180-2. 52 HMAC is not specified in any
RFID standard, but it is available in proprietary designs.

Applicability: Applications in which passwords are considered to offer an inadequate authentication
mechanism, perhaps because the risk of eavesdropping is high. Applications that require evidence of a
tag’s authenticity.

Benefits: The advantages of HMAC relative to password authentication include that HMAC:

     For example, EPC Class-1 Generation-1 UHF tags support a maximum password length of 8-bits, which enables only 256
     possible passwords. An adversary can cycle through 256 passwords in a matter of seconds. EPC Class-1 Generation-2 tags
     support 32-bit passwords and, therefore, 232 possible passwords, which is sufficient if the passwords are randomly
     generated. However, if the binary password is based on American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)
     characters, then the actual number of possible passwords may be much smaller. For example, the ASCII representation of a
     4-digit decimal number (a common length for personal identification numbers) is 32-bits, but results in only 10,000 possible
     combinations, a number certainly vulnerable to brute force attacks. Tags typically do not lock-out readers after a certain
     number of incorrect guesses, which means a determined adversary can continue to guess the password as long as the tag
     remains within the operating range of the adversary’s reader.
50
     The power analysis attack (also called a side channel attack) is based on the fact some passive tags use different levels of
     power depending on how close the password provided is to the actual password. For instance, if the first bit in a password is
     incorrect, the tag uses less energy than it would if the eighth bit is incorrect, given how the algorithm is hard-coded into the
     tag’s circuitry. These power differences are detected in the backscatter to the reader, but it requires that the adversary be
     reasonably close to the tag to get effective measurements. If such measurements are possible, an adversary can determine
     the password much more quickly than by using a brute force method. Lab experiments proved that someone could crack the
     8-bit password protection found on EPC Class-1 Generation-1 tags in one minute. For more information, see Y. Oren and
     A. Shamir, "Power Analysis of RFID Tags," discussed at the Cryptographers Panel of the Fifteenth RSA Conference, San
     Jose, 2006.

     The FIPS HMAC is a generalization of HMAC described in H. Krawczyk, M. Bellare, and R. Canetti, "HMAC: keyed-
     hashing for message authentication," Internet Engineering Task Force, Request for Comments (RFC) 2104, February 1997
     and American Bankers Association, "Keyed Hash Message Authentication Code," American National Standards Institute
     (ANSI) X9.71, Washington, D.C., 2000.
52
     The specified algorithms are SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. While SHA-1 offers the lowest level of assurance
     and is not recommended for use in digital signatures beyond 2010, it is likely most applicable to RFID systems due to its
     greater computational efficiency relative to the other algorithms. See NIST Special Publication 800-57, Recommendation
     on Key Management, Part 1 for additional information.
53
     The evidence of tag or item authenticity is provided by authenticating a tag to a reader, which can be accomplished when the
     tag computes and returns an HMAC using a random challenge provided by the reader. Mutual authentication is also
     possible if both tag and reader provide challenges to each other. Passwords, on the other hand, typically only are used to
     authenticate readers to tags, thereby protecting the tag against rogue commands. If the tag were to authenticate itself to a


                                                               5-12
