                                      Federal S/MIME V3 Client Profile


2.1.1 Cryptographic Algorithm Suite Conformance
To help ensure that cryptographic functions are correctly implemented, software modules
implementing cryptographic functions MUST conform to either FIPS 140-1, or FIPS 140-2,
Security Requirements For Cryptographic Modules [FIPS140-1] [FIPS140-2]3.

2.1.1.1 Mandatory to Implement Algorithm Suites
Conforming Federal S/MIME Profile implementations MUST support the following suites of
cryptographic algorithms:
       ALS1: {RSA for digital signature [RFC2313] with SHA-1 hash algorithm [FIPS180-1],
       RSA for key transport [RFC2313], Triple-DES [FIPS46-3] for content encryption}
       Conforming implementations MUST support a RSA key size of at least 1024 bits. For
       Triple-DES, when generating messages at least two independent keys MUST be
       supported using the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode. This algorithm is also known
       as DES EDE3 CBC.

         ALS2: {DSA for digital signature [FIPS186-2] with SHA-1 hash algorithm [FIPS180-1],
         RSA [RFC2313] for key transport, Triple-DES [FIPS46-3] for content encryption}
         Conforming implementations MUST support a DSA key size of 1024 bits.

This profile requires that implementations MUST be able to verify signatures on certificates and
messages using either of the above algorithm suites. However for message generation only one
of these algorithm suites MUST be supported. This implies that both the RSA digital signature
and DSA algorithms MUST be supported for message verification, but only one of these
algorithms MUST be supported for message generation. However, implementations SHOULD
support both signature algorithms for message generation.

2.1.1.2 Recommended Algorithm Suites
In addition to supporting ALS1 or ALS2, conforming implementations SHOULD support the
following additional algorithm suites:

         ALS3: {RSA [RFC 2313] for digital signature with SHA-1 hash algorithm [FIPS180-1],
         RSA [RFC 2313] for key transport, Advanced Encryption Standard [FIPS197] for content
         encryption}

         ALS4: {DSA for digital signature [FIPS186-2] with SHA-1 hash algorithm [FIPS180-1],
         Diffie-Hellman [RFC2631] for key agreement, Triple-DES for content encryption
         [FIPS46-3].}

         ALS5: {DSA for digital signature [FIPS186-2] with SHA-256 hash algorithm [FIPS180-
         2], Diffie-Hellman [RFC2631] for key agreement, AES [FIPS197] for content
         encryption}

 FIPS-140 defines four levels of security. The appropriate security level is determined by the sensitivity of the
data. Cryptographic module security levels are thus chosen on the basis of data sensitivity, and this selection is
beyond the scope of this profile. See Clause 1 of [FIPS 140-2] for a description of security levels.
