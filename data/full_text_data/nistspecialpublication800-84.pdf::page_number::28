process. The design phase of a functional exercise is usually started at least a few months before the
desired conduct date, depending on the complexity of the exercise. Sections 5.2.1 through 5.2.6 describe
the major steps in the event design process.

5.2.1     Determine the Topic

The design team should determine the overarching objectives for exercising the IT plan (e.g., as part of a
strategic long-term plan, in response to ad hoc requirements). These broad objectives represent the topic
areas that will be addressed in the exercise. The topic areas chosen will depend on whether the exercise
will address the full plan or specific aspects of the plan. Topic areas addressing the full plan could
include (but are not limited to) validating the plan’s procedures, evaluating an organization’s ability to
implement the plan, and assessing interdependencies of organizations and personnel responsible for
carrying out the plan. Examples of topic areas that are more narrowly focused on specific aspects of the
plan are assessing the plan’s alert and notification process, validating personnel responsibilities associated
with the operational phase of the plan, and evaluating the processes involved in resuming normal
operations.

5.2.2     Determine the Scope

The scope of the functional exercise should be determined based on which portions of the IT plan (or all
of it) should be exercised. 17 If only portions of the plan are to be exercised, the design team should
consider examining a specific phase of plan implementation, such as activation, operation, or
reconstitution, or specific functions.

When determining the scope of a functional exercise, the design team should clearly identify the specific
element or elements of the IT plan that will be assessed and consider the types of participants necessary to
carry out the exercise. Ultimately, a robust TT&E program ensures that all elements of a plan are
exercised; however, the emphasis of initial functional exercises is often placed on operational-level team
roles and responsibilities. As an organization’s TT&E program matures, senior-level participants can also
engage in functional exercises to fully validate decision-making aspects of the plan.

5.2.3     Identify the Objectives

The objectives of any functional exercise should be validating the content of the IT plan, validating
participants’ roles and responsibilities as documented in the plan, validating the interdependencies
documented in the plan, and providing an opportunity for participants to get hands-on practice in
executing their functions. An additional objective for some exercises is meeting regulatory and other
such requirements associated with exercising plans, such as the requirement in NIST SP 800-53 for
Federal agencies to conduct exercises or tests for their systems’ contingency plans at least annually.
Specific objectives should be documented and clearly articulated to exercise participants.

5.2.4     Identify the Participants

Based on the topic, scope, and objectives of the exercise, the design team determines who should
participate in the event. 18 The participants should be comprised of the personnel with roles and
responsibilities under the plan that will be needed to help ensure the exercise meets its stated objectives.
For example, senior-level personnel should be invited to participate if the primary exercise objective is to
validate the decision-making and oversight processes within the plan. If the primary objective is to

     Depending on the requirements that the exercise is intended to fulfill, it may be necessary to make participation mandatory
