        Social                 Avoid use of authenticators       6.1.2.1, 6.1.2.3
        Engineering            that present a risk of social
                               engineering of third parties
                               such as customer service
                               agents.
        Online Guessing        Use authenticators that           5.1.2.1, 5.1.7.1, 5.1.9.1
                               generate high entropy output.
                               Use an authenticator that locks   5.2.2
                               up after a number of repeated
                               failed activation attempts.
        Endpoint               Use hardware authenticators       5.2.9
        Compromise             that require physical action by
                               the subscriber.
                               Maintain software-based keys      5.1.3.1, 5.1.6.1, 5.1.8.1
                               in restricted-access storage.
        Unauthorized           Use AitM-resistant                6.1
        Binding                protocols for provisioning of
                               authenticators and associated
                               keys.

1945   Several other strategies may be applied to mitigate the threats described in Table 3:
1946       • Multiple factors make successful attacks more difficult to accomplish. If an attacker
1947         needs to both steal a cryptographic authenticator and guess a memorized secret,
1948         then the work to discover both factors may be too high.
1949       • Physical security mechanisms may be employed to protect a stolen authenticator
1950         from duplication. Physical security mechanisms can provide tamper evidence,
1951         detection, and response.
1952       • Requiring the use of long memorized secrets that don’t appear in common
1953         dictionaries may force attackers to try every possible value.
1954       • System and network security controls may be employed to prevent an attacker from
1955         gaining access to a system or installing malicious software.
1956       • Periodic training may be performed to ensure subscribers understand when
1957         and how to report compromise — or suspicion of compromise — or otherwise
1958         recognize patterns of behavior that may signify an attacker attempting to
1959         compromise the authentication process.
1960       • Out of band techniques may be employed to verify proof of possession of registered
1961         devices (e.g., cell phones).
