                                                     TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



is important for organizations to actively test and secure their enterprise wireless environments. 15
Wireless scans can help organizations determine corrective actions to mitigate risks posed by wireless-
enabled technologies.

The following factors in the organization’s environment should be taken into consideration when
planning technical wireless security assessments:

      The location of the facility being scanned, because the physical proximity of a building to a
       public area (e.g., streets and public common areas) or its location in a busy metropolitan area may
       increase the risk of wireless threats
      The security level of the data to be transmitted using wireless technologies
      How often wireless devices connect to and disconnect from the environment, and the typical
       traffic levels for wireless devices (e.g., occasional activity or fairly constant activity)—this is
       because only active wireless devices are discoverable during a wireless scan
      Existing deployments of wireless intrusion detection and prevention systems (WIDPS 16 ), which
       may already collect most of the information that would be gathered by testing.
Wireless scanning should be conducted using a mobile device with wireless analyzer software installed
and configured—such as a laptop, handheld device, or specialty device. The scanning software or tool
should allow the operator to configure the device for specific scans, and to scan in both passive and active
modes. The scanning software should also be configurable by the operator to identify deviations from the
organization’s wireless security configuration requirements.

The wireless scanning tool should be capable of scanning all Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (IEEE) 802.11a/b/g/n channels, whether domestic or international. In some cases, the device
should also be fitted with an external antenna to provide an additional level of radio frequency (RF)
capturing capability. Support for other wireless technologies, such as Bluetooth, will help evaluate the
presence of additional wireless threats and vulnerabilities. Note that devices using nonstandard
technology or frequencies outside of the scanning tool’s RF range will not be detected or properly
recognized by the scanning tool. A tool such as an RF spectrum analyzer will assist organizations in
identifying transmissions that occur within the frequency range of the spectrum analyzer. Spectrum
analyzers generally analyze a large frequency range (e.g., 3 to 18 GHz) —and although these devices do
not analyze traffic, they enable an assessor to determine wireless activity within a specific frequency
range and tailor additional testing and examination accordingly.

Some devices also support mapping and physical location plotting through use of a mapping tool, and in
some cases support Global Positioning System (GPS)-based mapping. Sophisticated wireless scanning
tools allow the user to import a floor plan or map to assist in plotting the physical location of discovered
devices. (It is important to note that GPS has limited capabilities indoors.)

Individuals with a strong understanding of wireless networking—especially IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n
technologies—should operate wireless scanning tools. These operators should be trained on the
functionality and capability of the scanning tools and software to better understand the captured
information and be more apt to identify potential threats or malicious activity. Individuals with similar
