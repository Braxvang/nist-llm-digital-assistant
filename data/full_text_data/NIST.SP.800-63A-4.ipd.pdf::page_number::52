       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                            Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                              Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1320   7.2. Collaboration with Adjacent Programs
1321   Identity proofing services typically serve as the front door for critical business or
1322   service functions. Accordingly, these services should not operate in a vacuum. Close
1323   coordination of identity proofing and CSP functions with cybersecurity teams, threat
1324   intelligence teams, and program integrity teams can enable a more complete protection
1325   of business capabilities while constantly improving identity proofing capabilities.
1326   For example, payment fraud data collected by program integrity teams could provide
1327   indicators of compromised subscriber accounts and potential weaknesses in identity
1328   proofing implementations. Similarly, threat intelligence teams may receive indications of
1329   new tactics, techniques, and procedures that may impact identity proofing processes.
1330   CSPs and RPs should seek to establish consistent mechanisms for the exchange of
1331   information between critical security and fraud stakeholders. Where the CSP is external,
1332   this may be complicated, but should be considered in contractual and legal mechanisms.
1333   All data collected, transmitted, or shared should be minimized and subject to a detailed
1334   privacy and legal assessment.
