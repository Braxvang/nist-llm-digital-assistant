 Blocking
 List (CBL)
 Description       The CBL takes its source data from very large spam traps, and only lists IPs exhibiting
                   characteristics which are specific to open proxies of various sorts (HTTP, socks, AnalogX,
                   wingate, etc.) which have been abused to send spam, worms and viruses that do their own
                   direct mail transmission, or some types of Trojan horse or “stealth” spamware, without doing
                   open proxy tests of any kind.
