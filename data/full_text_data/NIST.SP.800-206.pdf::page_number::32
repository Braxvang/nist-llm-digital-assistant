                                                           IMPERATIVE 7 – Bolstering Infrastructure Protection



          NIST also began to incorporate cybersecurity risk management into the next
          version of the Smart Grid Interoperability Framework. In FY19, NIST will continue
          to develop the next version of the Smart Grid Interoperability Framework 2.0,
          chair the Smart Electric Power Alliance (SEPA)68 Smart Grid Cybersecurity
          Committee, support the Department of Energy’s Cyber Resilient Energy Delivery
          Consortium (CREDC) program,69 finalize SP 1800-7,70 and undertake capability
          demonstration and documentation activities for an Energy Sector Asset
          Management71 project.


       SECURITY ASPECTS OF ELECTRONIC VOTING
       The Help America Vote Act (HAVA)72 encouraged upgrading voting equipment
       across the United States and established the Election Assistance Commission
       (EAC)73 and the Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC).74 NIST
       chairs the TGDC and provides technical support related to human factors,
       security, and laboratory accreditation. Most significantly, in FY18, the TGDC
       adopted a new version of the Voluntary Voting Systems Guidelines (VVSG)75 and
       principles developed by NIST and the EAC. In FY19, NIST will continue leading the
       public working groups to inform the development of voting system requirements
       and test strategies based on the principles and guidelines. Additionally, NIST will
       support the development of a Cybersecurity Framework Profile to help better
       manage cybersecurity risk in the election infrastructure.
