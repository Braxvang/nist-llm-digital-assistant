      NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                                                    Recommendation for RBG Constructions

454   directly to obtain entropy. Other constructions (e.g., the RBG1 construction) fulfill their entropy
455   requirements by accessing another RBG as a randomness source. In this case, the source RBG may
456   include its own entropy source.
457   SP 800 90B provides guidance for the development and validation of entropy sources −
458   mechanisms that provide entropy for an RBG. Validated entropy sources (i.e., entropy sources that
459   have been successfully validated by the CMVP as complying with SP 800-90B) provide fixed-
460   length outputs and have been validated as reliably providing a specified minimum amount of
461   entropy for each output (e.g., each eight-bit output has been validated as providing at least five bits
462   of entropy). 2
463   An entropy source is a physical entropy source if the primary noise source of the entropy source
464   is physical – that is, it uses dedicated hardware to provide entropy (e.g., from ring oscillators,
465   thermal noise, shot noise, jitter, or metastability). Similarly, a validated entropy source is a non-
466   physical entropy source if the primary noise source of the entropy source is non-physical – that is,
467   entropy is provided by system data (e.g., the entropy present in the RAM data or system time).
468   The entropy-source type is certified during SP 800-90B validation.
469   One or more validated entropy sources are used to provide entropy for instantiating and reseeding
470   the DRBGs in RBG2 or RBG3 constructions or used by an RBG3 construction to generate output
471   upon request by a consuming application.
472   An implementation could be designed to use a combination of physical and non-physical entropy
473   sources. When requests are made to the sources, bitstring outputs are concatenated until the amount
474   of entropy in the concatenated bitstring meets or exceeds the request. Two methods are provided
475   for counting the entropy provided in the concatenated bitstring.
476        Method 1: The RBG implementation includes one or more physical entropy sources, and one
477        or more non-physical entropy sources may also be included in the implementation. However,
478        only the entropy in a bitstring that is provided from physical entropy sources is counted toward
479        fulfilling the amount of entropy requested in an entropy request. Any entropy in a bitstring that
480        is provided by a non-physical entropy source is not counted, even if bitstrings produced by the
481        non-physical entropy source are included in the concatenated bitstring that is used by the RBG.
482        Method 2: The RBG implementation includes one or more non-physical entropy sources, and
483        one or more physical entropy sources may also be included in the implementation. The entropy
484        from both non-physical entropy sources and (if present) physical entropy sources is counted
485        when fulfilling an entropy request.
486        Example: Let pesi be the ith output of a physical entropy source, and npesi be the jh output of a
487        non-physical entropy source. If an implementation consists of one physical and one non-
488        physical entropy source, and a request has been made for 128 bits of entropy, the concatenated
489        bitstring might be something like:
490              pes1 || pes2 || npes1 || pes3 || ... || npesm ||pesn,
491   which is the concatenated output of the physical and non-physical entropy sources.

        Note that this document also discusses the use of non-validated entropy sources. When discussing such entropy sources, “non-validated” will
      always precede “entropy sources.” The use of the term “validated entropy source” may be shortened to just “entropy source” to avoid repetition.
