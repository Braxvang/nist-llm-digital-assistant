1048          Developing the CPLP Plan
1049   The Learning Program plan refers to the working documents that contain elements that support
1050   the strategy for each activity or campaign. A Learning Program plan, such as what might be
1051   created to build an awareness campaign or privileged account holder training, is similar to a
1052   project plan. The purpose of creating Learning Program plans is to guide the delivery of the
1053   program elements. This document defines the program element with sufficient detail to inform
1054   key stakeholders and contributors to perform their roles successfully. Many organizations utilize
1055   standard program plan templates that provide baselines for organizational expectations.
1056   The exact level of detail within the plan will vary, depending on organizational and program
1057   requirements and resources. As the program matures, the Learning Program Manager should
1058   conduct recurring reviews (i.e., at least annually) of the plan, along with the stakeholders and
1059   individuals who will support and manage the program.

1060          CPLP Resources
1061   An important element of developing the CPLP Strategy is to determine what currently exists
1062   within the organization and what resources are dedicated to the existing programs. If the
1063   Learning Program does not exist or requires significant redesign or updates, refer to the Program
1064   Strategy process outlined in Section 2.1 to review the most important program elements for
1065   inclusion. Resources are typically defined as any asset that is required to meet the goals and
1066   objectives, such as people, materials, equipment, and technology. An important consideration in
1067   obtaining resources is establishing a CPLP budget.

1068   2.10.1.        Establishing a CPLP Budget
1069   Once the CPLP strategy has been approved by the senior leadership (identified in Section 1.10.2)
1070   and the priorities have been established, funding requirements must be added to the plan. A
1071   determination must be made regarding the extent of funding support to be allocated based on the
1072   strategic goals. Senior leadership should help the Learning Program Manager understand or
1073   establish their budget. While each program will have different funding needs, some typical costs
1074   include:
1075      •   Training personnel, such as program managers, instructional designers, instructors,
1076          graphic artists, web developers, and programmers
1077      •   Classroom space and materials, such as whiteboards, markers, erasers, flip charts, note
1078          pads, pens, pencils, and name cards
1079      •   Printed program materials, handouts, and certificates or electronic distribution that may
1080          require web-based platforms
1081      •   Online (virtual) space to distribute materials, including synchronous activities such as
1082          webinars and asynchronous activities such as job aids, recorded sessions, and web-based
1083          content
1084      •   Learning Management Systems for content delivery, participant registration, and course
1085          completion records
