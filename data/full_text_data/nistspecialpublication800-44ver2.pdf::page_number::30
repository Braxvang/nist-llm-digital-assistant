3.6.2   Web Server Appliances

A Web server appliance is a software/hardware combination that is designed to be a “plug-and-play” Web
server. These appliances employ the use of a simplified OS that is optimized to support a Web server.
The simplified OS improves security by minimizing unnecessary features, services, and options. The
Web server application on these systems is often pre-hardened and pre-configured for security.

These systems offer other benefits in addition to security. Performance is often enhanced because the
system (i.e., OS, Web server application, and hardware) is designed and built specifically to operate as a
Web server. Cost is often reduced because hardware and software not specifically required by a Web
server are not included. These systems can be an excellent option for small- to medium-size
organizations that cannot afford a full-time Web administrator.

The greatest weakness in these systems is that they may not be suitable for large, complex, and multi-
layered Web sites. They may be limited in what types of active content they support (e.g., J2EE, .NET,
PHP Hypertext Preprocessor [PHP]), potentially reducing the options available to an organization. An
appliance may host the back-end database as well as the front-end Web interface, potentially preventing
organizations from having separate servers for each. Finally, it may be difficult to configure appliances
from different manufacturers to work together. Nevertheless, because they offer a secure environment
and an easy-to-configure interface, small- to medium-size organizations may find appliances an attractive
option requiring less administrative effort. Web server appliances are available from most major
hardware manufacturers and from various specialized manufacturers that concentrate solely on Web
server appliances.

In addition to Web server appliances, there are also a growing number of security appliances available for
Web servers. These systems augment the security mechanisms on the Web server itself. In some cases,
these systems can prevent attacks from reaching a Web server, which is especially helpful if the server
has known vulnerabilities (e.g., new patches have not yet been applied). The most common types of
security appliances are—

 Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) accelerators, which off-load the computationally expensive processing
  required for initiating SSL/Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections

 Security gateways, which monitor HTTP traffic to and from the Web server for potential attacks and
  take action as necessary

 Content filters, which can monitor traffic to and from the Web server for potentially sensitive or
  inappropriate data and take action as necessary

 Authentication gateways, which authenticate users via a variety of authentication mechanisms and
  control access to Universal Resource Locators (URL) hosted on the Web server itself.
