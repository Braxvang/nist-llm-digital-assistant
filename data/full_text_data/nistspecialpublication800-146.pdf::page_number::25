                                                           CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS




                                   Figure 4: Outsourced Private Cloud

Although the general statements remain true for the outsourced private scenario, the outsourced private
scenario also allows for a more detailed understanding of some of the general statements plus additional
statements that organizations considering the use of an outsourced private cloud should consider:

 Network Dependency (outsourced-private). In the outsourced private scenario, consumers may
  have an option to provision dedicated protected and reliable communication links with the provider.
  Although network dependence does not appear to be avoidable, in this scenario the impact of the
  network dependency may be ameliorated at a negotiated price (e.g., dedicated leased network
  connections supporting enhanced performance, reliability, and security).
 Workload locations are hidden from clients (outsourced-private). As in the general case, to
  manage a cloud's hardware resources, an outsourced private cloud must be able to migrate workloads
  between machines without inconveniencing the clients, i.e., without the clients being aware of the
  migrations. The outsourced private cloud scenario, however, provides an opportunity for the
  consumer's organization to have some visibility and control regarding workload locations. Assuming
  that the provider faithfully implements the security perimeter agreed upon with the consumer, the
  consumer organization workloads move only within the agreed-upon security perimeter. Depending
  on the mechanisms chosen to implement the perimeter, the consumer may know the physical location
  (e.g., cluster, network segments) of the resources devoted to the outsourced private cloud even though
  the clients are unaware.
 Risks from multi-tenancy (outsourced-private). The implications are the same as those for an on-
  site private cloud. FISMA and OMB policy require that external cloud providers handling federal
  information or operating information systems on behalf of the federal government meet the same
  security requirements as federal agencies.
 Data import/export, and performance limitations (outsourced-private). As with the general case,
  on-demand bulk data import/export is limited by the network capacity between a provider and
  consumer, and real-time or critical processing may be problematic because of networking limitations.
