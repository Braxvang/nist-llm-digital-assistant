3.2.4.    Remediation
As part of a risk analysis process, agencies should attempt to enumerate the techniques
that could be used to mitigate or remediate harm that would result from a successful re-
identifcation of de-identifed information. Remediation could include victim education,
the procurement of monitoring or security services, the issuance of new identifers, or other
measures.

3.3.     Data Life Cycle
The NIST Big Data Interoperability Framework defnes the data life cycle as “the set of pro-
cesses in an application that transform raw data into actionable knowledge” [112]. The data
life cycle can be used in the de-identifcation process to help analyze the expected benefts,
intended uses, privacy threats, and vulnerabilities of de-identifed data. As such, the data
life cycle concept can be used to select appropriate privacy controls based on a reasoned
analysis of the threats. For example, the NIST Privacy Framework [113] and other privacy-
by-design concepts [28] can be employed to decrease the number of identifers collected,
thus minimizing the requirements for de-identifcation prior to data release. The data life
cycle can also be used to design a tiered access mechanism based on this analysis [12].
Several data life cycles have been proposed, but none are widely accepted as a standard.
Michener et al. [105] (Figure 1) describe the data life cycle as a true cycle:
 → Assure → Describe → Deposit → Preserve → Discover → Integrate → Analyze →
                                   Collect
Stobierski [148] also describes the data life cycle as a cycle with different steps:
   Generation → Collection → Processing → Storage → Management → Analysis →
                    Visualization → Interpretation → Generation
De-identifcation does not ft into a circular data life cycle model, as the data owner typ-
ically retains access to the identifed data. However, if the organization employs de-
identifcation, it could be performed during Collect or between Collect and Assure if iden-
tifed data were collected but the identifying information was not actually needed. Alter-
natively, de-identifcation could be applied after Describe and prior to Deposit to avoid
archiving identifying information.
Chisholm and others [30] (Figure 2) describe the data life cycle as a linear process with a
fork for data publication:
          Data Capture → Data Maintenance → Data Synthesis → Data Usage →
                 {Data Publication and Data Archival → Data Purging}
Using this formulation, de-identifcation can take place either during Data Capture or fol-
lowing Data Usage. However, agencies should consider data release requirements from
