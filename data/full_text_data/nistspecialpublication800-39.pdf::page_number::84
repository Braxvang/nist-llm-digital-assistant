oriented. An example of this application might be the use of authentication services that validate
the authenticity or identity of an information system component or service.

The nature of a particular information technology service can also impact the suitability and the
applicability of the various trust models. The validated trust model is the more traditional model
for validating the trust of an information technology product, system, or service. However, this
trust model works best in situations where there is a degree of control between parties (e.g., a
contract between the government and an external service provider) or where there is sufficient
time to obtain and validate the evidence needed to establish a trust relationship. Validated trust is
a suboptimal model for situations where the two parties are peers and/or where the trust decisions
regarding shared/supplied services must occur quickly due to the very dynamic and rapid nature
of the service being requested/provided (e.g., service-oriented architectures).
