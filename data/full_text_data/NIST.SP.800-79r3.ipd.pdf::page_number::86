                              [FIPS201], Sec. 2.7 of during the identity proofing process
                              (observe).
                         (v) If the two identity source documents bear different names, evidence
                              of a formal name change is provided (review, observe).
             EI-4      At least one of the identity source documents used to verify the claimed      [FIPS201], Sec. 2.1 – Control
