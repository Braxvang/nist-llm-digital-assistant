                   The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



An example of an indented reference is:
           References to OVAL Definitions are expressed using the following format:
           <cpe_dict:check system=
           "http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5"
           href="Oval_URL">[Oval_inventory_definition_id]
           </cpe_dict:check>.

The general convention used when describing XML attributes within this document is to reference the
attribute as well as its associated element including the namespace alias, employing the general form
"@attributeName for the <prefix:localName>".

Indented references are intended to represent the form of actual XML content. Indented references
represent literal content by the use of a fixed-length font, and parametric (freely replaceable)
content by the use of an italic font. Square brackets ‗[]‘ are used to designate optional content. Thus
"[Oval_inventory_definition_id]" designates optional parametric content.

Both inline and indented forms use qualified names to refer to specific XML elements. A qualified name
associates a named element with a namespace. The namespace identifies the specific XML schema that
defines (and consequently may be used to validate) the syntax of the element instance. A qualified name
declares this schema to element association using the format ‗prefix:element-name‘. The association of
prefix to namespace is defined in the metadata of an XML document and generally will vary from
document to document. In this specification, the conventional mappings listed in Table 1 are used. The
namespace URIs in the table are not required to be resolvable; if you enter them into a web browser, for
example, they may or may not work.8

       Regarding a namespace URI, the W3C document titled ―Namespaces in XML 1.0 (Third Edition) states that ―it is not a goal
       that it be directly usable for retrieval of a schema (if any exists).‖ http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names/#A785
