                                                                                                  •    The Assertions XML schema, which defines the structure of the assertion.
                                                                                                  •    The SAML Protocols, which are used to request assertions and artifacts (the assertion

                                                                                                  •    The Bindings, which define the underlying communication protocols (such as HTTP or

                                                                                             The three components above define a SAML profile that corresponds to a particular use case

                                                                                             SAML Assertions are encoded in an XML schema and can carry up to three types of statements:

                                                                                                  •    Authentication statements include information about the assertion issuer, the

                                                                                                  •    Attribute statements contain specific additional characteristics related to the subscriber.
                                                                                                       For example, subject “John” is associated with attribute “Role” with value “Manager”.
                                                                                                  •    Authorization statements identify the resources the subscriber has permission to access.
                                                                                                       These resources may include specific devices, files, and information on specific web
                                                                                                       servers. For example, subject “John” for action “Read” on “Webserver1002” given
                                                                                                       evidence “Role”.

                                                                                             steps of the protocol. Kerberos also supports confidentiality and integrity protection of session
                                                                                             data between the subscriber and the RP. Even though Kerberos uses assertions, it was designed
