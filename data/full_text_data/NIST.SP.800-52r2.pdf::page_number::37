NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                           GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


Evidence that the serverâ€™s certificate has been submitted to Certificate Transparency logs may be
provided to clients either in the certificate itself or in a Signed Certificate Timestamps TLS
extension (signed_certificate_timestamp). Servers with certificates issued by publicly trusted
CAs that do not include a Signed Certificate Timestamps List extension should support the
Signed Certificate Timestamps TLS extension.

3.4.3   Discouraged TLS Extensions

The following extensions should not be used:

   1. Client Certificate URL
   2. Early Data Indication
The Raw Public Keys extension shall not be supported.

3.4.3.1 Client Certificate URL

Applies to TLS versions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2

The Client Certificate URL extension allows a client to send a URL pointing to a certificate
rather than sending a certificate to the server during mutual authentication. This can be very
useful for mutual authentication with constrained clients. However, this extension can be used
for malicious purposes. The URL could belong to an innocent server on which the client would
like to perform a denial of service attack, turning the TLS server into an attacker. A server that
supports this extension also acts as a client while retrieving a certificate and, therefore, becomes
subject to additional security concerns. For these reasons, the Client Certificate URL extension
should not be supported. However, if an agency determines that the risks are minimal and this
extension is needed for environments where clients are in constrained devices, the extension may
be supported. If the client certificate URL extension is supported, the server shall be configured
to mitigate the security concerns described above and in Section 11.3 of [29].

3.4.3.2 Early Data Indication

Applies to TLS version 1.3

The Early Data Indication extension (early_data) allows the client to send application data in the
ClientHello message when pre-shared keys are used. This includes pre-shared keys that are
established out-of-band as well as those used for session resumption. TLS does not protect this
early data against replay attacks. Servers should not process early data received in the
ClientHello message. If the server is configured to send the Early Data Indication extension, the
server shall use methods of replay protection, such as those described in Section 8 of RFC 8446
[57]. See Section 3.6 for more information on early data (also called 0-RTT data).
