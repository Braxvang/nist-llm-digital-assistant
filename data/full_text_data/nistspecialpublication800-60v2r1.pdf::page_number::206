D.16.2 Criminal Investigation and Surveillance Information Type

Criminal investigation and surveillance includes the collection of evidence required to determine
responsibility for a crime and the monitoring and questioning of affected parties. The
recommended provisional categorization of the criminal investigation and surveillance
information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of criminal investigation
and surveillance information on the ability of responsible agencies to collect evidence required to
determine responsibility for a crime, to monitor and question affected parties, and to protect the
safety of witnesses and law enforcement officers. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure
of criminal investigation and surveillance information depend 1] on the seriousness of the crime
involved, 2] timing (e.g., the ability of the criminal 39 to access the information and use it to
facilitate a crime, to evade detection or surveillance, or eliminate probable cause for searches and
warrants), and 3] on the capability and predisposition of the criminal to injure witnesses or law
enforcement officials.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In cases where 1) the crimes are not
violent and do not involve large property losses, and 2) there is no history of violence on the part
of the criminal, the confidentiality impact may be low or moderate. Given the nature of many of
the crimes that are the responsibility of Federal law enforcement agencies, the consequences
associated with unauthorized disclosure of criminal investigation and surveillance information
must often be assumed to pose a threat to human life or result in a loss of major assets.
Information that reveals the identity and/or location of informants may be of particular concern.
In such cases, the confidentiality impact level is high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for criminal investigation and surveillance information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of criminal investigation and
surveillance information depends on the urgency with which the information is needed and on
the success of subsequent prosecution of the apprehended criminal(s). Unauthorized
modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages,
electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but the
damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Where unauthorized modification or destruction of criminal investigation and surveillance
information can have an adverse effect on the granting or execution of a search or wiretap

     In this case, the term “criminal entity” includes both the criminal and legal representative(s) of the criminal (i.e.,
     council).
