                                                                    Generation Using Deterministic RBGs

10.2.1.3     Instantiation of CTR_DRBG

Notes for the instantiate function specified in Section 9.1:
   The instantiation of CTR_DRBG requires a call to the Instantiate_function specified in
   Section 9.1. Process step 9 of that function calls the instantiate algorithm specified in this
   section. The values of highest_supported_security_strength and min_length are provided in
   Table 3 of Section 10.2.1. The contents of the internal state are provided in Section 10.2.1.1.
The instantiate algorithm:
   For this DRBG mechanism, there are two cases for processing. In each case, let
   CTR_DRBG_Update be the function specified in Section 10.2.1.2. The output block length
   (blocklen), key length (keylen), seed length (seedlen) and security_strengths for the block
   cipher algorithms are provided in Table 3 of Section 10.2.1.
10.2.1.3.1   Instantiation When a Derivation Function is Not Used

When instantiation is performed using this method, full-entropy input is required, and a nonce is
not used. The following process or its equivalent shall be used as the instantiate algorithm for
this DRBG mechanism:
   CTR_DRBG_Instantiate_algorithm (entropy_input, personalization_string,
     security_strength):
       1. entropy_input: The string of bits obtained from the randomness source.
       2. personalization_string: The personalization string received from the consuming
          application. Note that the length of the personalization_string may be zero.
       3. security_strength: The security strength for the instantiation. This parameter is
          optional for CTR_DRBG.
       Output:
       1. initial_working_state: The initial values for V, Key, and reseed_counter (see Section
          10.2.1.1).
   CTR_DRBG Instantiate Process:
        1. temp = len (personalization_string).
                                              Comment: Ensure that the length of the
                                              personalization_string is exactly seedlen bits. Note
                                              that in Section 9.1, processing step 3 obtained an
                                              entropy_input of seedlen bits using Table 3 to
                                              define the minimum and maximum lengths, which
                                              are both equal to seedlen bits.
       2. If (temp < seedlen), then personalization_string = personalization_string || 0seedlen -
          temp
               .
       3. seed_material = entropy_input âŠ• personalization_string.
