NIST SP 800-38G                                       METHODS FOR FORMAT-PRESERVING ENCRYPTION



                    A parameterized family of permutations on bit strings of a fixed length; the
block cipher
                    parameter that determines the permutation is a bit string called the key.

block cipher
                    An algorithm for the cryptographic transformation of data that is based on a
mode of
                    block cipher.
operation

                    For a given block cipher and key, the fixed length of the input (or output) bit

                    A bit string whose length is a multiple of a given block size, so that it can be
block string
                    represented as the concatenation of a finite sequence of blocks.

byte                A string of eight bits.

                    A bit string whose length is a multiple of eight bits, so that it can be
byte string
                    represented as the concatenation of a finite sequence of bytes.

character           A symbol in a given alphabet.

character string    A finite, ordered sequence of characters from a given alphabet.

                    For a given block cipher and key, the function of an FPE mode that takes a

                    plaintext numeral string and a tweak as input and returns a ciphertext numeral

exclusive-OR
                    The bitwise addition, modulo 2, of two bit strings of equal length.
(XOR)

                    A framework for constructing an encryption mode. The framework consists
                    of several iterations, called rounds, in which a keyed function, called the
Feistel structure
                    round function, is applied to one part of the data in order to modify the other
                    part of the data; the roles of the two parts are swapped for the next round.

forward             For a given block cipher, the permutation of blocks that is determined by the
transformation      choice of a key.
