      NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1
      September 2023                                 PIV Card Application Namespace, Data Model, and Representation

850   to communicate with a PIV Card over its virtual contact interface obtain the card’s pairing code
851   during a registration step by asking the cardholder to enter the value or by reading it from the
852   card over the contact interface from the Pairing Code Reference Data Container and then cache
853   the pairing code until the card expires. 14 The client application MAY then connect to the card
854   and establish a virtual contact interface with it whenever the card is within read-range of the
855   client application’s contactless card reader without needing to prompt the cardholder.

856                 PIV Algorithm Identifier
857   A PIV algorithm identifier is a 1-byte identifier of a cryptographic algorithm. The identifier
858   specifies a cryptographic algorithm and key size. For symmetric cryptographic operations, the
859   algorithm identifier also specifies a mode of operation (i.e., ECB). SP 800-78, Table 9 lists the
860   PIV algorithm identifiers for the cryptographic algorithms that MAY be recognized on the PIV
861   interfaces.

862                 Cryptographic Mechanism Identifiers
863   Cryptographic mechanism identifiers are defined in Table 6. These identifiers serve as inputs to
864   the GENERATE ASYMMETRIC KEY PAIR card command and the SP 800-73-5 Part 3
865   pivGenerateKeyPair() client API function call, which initiates the generation and storage of the
866   asymmetric key pair.

                                                                                                 big-endian

                                          '14'                      ECC: Curve P-384             None

868   Higher strength keys are recommended per SP 800-56 Part 1 starting in 2031. See SP 800-78-5,
869   Tables 9 and 10, which reflect support for higher strength keys for PIV cards and supporting
870   systems, where applicable.

871   All other cryptographic mechanism identifier values are reserved for future use.

           As noted in Section 5.5, the pairing code does not need to be submitted if the Bit 3 of the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy is set to one.
