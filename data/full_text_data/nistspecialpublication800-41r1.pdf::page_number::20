2.2     Firewalls for Individual Hosts and Home Networks

Although firewalls at a network’s perimeter provide some measure of protection for internal hosts, in
many cases additional network protection is required. Network firewalls are not able to recognize all
instances and forms of attack, allowing some attacks to penetrate and reach internal hosts—and attacks
sent from one internal host to another may not even pass through a network firewall. Because of these and
other factors, network designers often include firewall functionality at places other than the network
perimeter to provide an additional layer of security. This section describes firewalls specifically designed
for deployment onto individual hosts and home networks.

2.2.1     Host-Based Firewalls and Personal Firewalls

Host-based firewalls for servers and personal firewalls for desktop and laptop personal computers (PC)
provide an additional layer of security against network-based attacks. These firewalls are software-based,
residing on the hosts they are protecting—each monitors and controls the incoming and outgoing network
traffic for a single host. They can provide more granular protection than network firewalls to meet the
needs of specific hosts.

Host-based firewalls are available as part of server operating systems such as Linux, Windows, Solaris,
BSD, and Mac OS X Server, and they can also be installed as third-party add-ons. Configuring a host-
based firewall to allow only necessary traffic to the server provides protection against malicious activity
from all hosts, including those on the same subnet or on other internal subnets not separated by a network
firewall. Limiting outgoing traffic from a server may also be helpful in preventing certain malware that
infects a host from spreading to other hosts. 11 Host-based firewalls usually perform logging, and can often
be configured to perform address-based and application-based access controls. Many host-based firewalls
can also act as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) that, after detecting an attack in progress, take actions
to thwart the attacker and prevent damage to the targeted host.

A personal firewall is software that runs on a desktop or laptop PC with a user-focused operating system
such as Microsoft Windows Vista or Macintosh OS X. A personal firewall is similar to a host-based
firewall, but because the computer being protected is meant for end users, the interface is usually different
(and presumably easier for the typical user to understand). A personal firewall provides an additional
layer of security for PCs located both inside and outside perimeter firewalls (e.g., mobile laptop users),
because it can restrict inbound communications and can often limit outbound communications as well.
This not only allows personal firewalls to protect PCs from incoming attacks, but also limits the spread of
malware from infected PCs and the use of unauthorized software such as peer-to-peer file sharing utilities.
Personal firewalls are often packaged with antimalware programs, intrusion detection software, and other
security utilities. 12

Some personal firewalls allow creation of different profiles based on location, such as a profile for use
inside the organization’s network and a different profile for use when at a remote location. This is
particularly important when a computer is used on an untrusted external network, because having a
separate firewall profile for use on such networks can restrict network activity more tightly and provide
stronger protection than having a single profile for all networks.

      If an attacker compromises a host and gains administrator-level privileges, the attacker can disable or circumvent the host-
      based firewall.
