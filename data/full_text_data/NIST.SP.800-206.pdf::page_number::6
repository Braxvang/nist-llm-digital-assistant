Cybersecurity: Picking up the pace

“The more things change, the more they stay the same.” (From a French proverb)
Ten years ago, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) annual
report on cybersecurity featured accomplishments and challenges in quantum
computing, encryption, identity management, personal identity verification,
vulnerability measurements, assessing the security controls in federal information
systems, mobile devices, international standardization, and addressing the needs of
small and medium-sized businesses, all of which were among the many pressing topics
of the day. Sound familiar?
Reviewing those topics in the NIST Fiscal Year 2008 report on computer security
activities and accomplishments might lead some to conclude that the old French
proverb is true when it comes to cybersecurity. But in this case, a more appropriate
statement might be, “The more things appear to stay the same, the more quickly they
actually change.”
That certainly is true for the threat environment in which we function today. New attack
surfaces, new vulnerabilities, and new attackers emerge constantly. The creativity,
the dramatically increased frequency of attacks, and the ready availability of new
technologically enhanced modes of attack are even more difficult to identify—much
less protect, detect, respond to, and recover from—before they inflict great harm to U.S.
organizations and our economy, security, and society in general.
A decade later, these changes have enormous implications in a world that is so much
more dependent on digital devices, systems, and connectivity for carrying out both the
specialized and ordinary activities that drive our economy and safeguard our security.
They create thorny challenges as we seek balance in battling attacks and attackers while
preserving our intellectual property, privacy, civil rights, and liberties.
The speed with which our cybersecurity risks change means that everyone involved in
managing those risks needs to pick up the pace. That is what NIST is doing with the help
of many partners and through varied programs and approaches.
In Fiscal Year 2018, we received and worked on new cybersecurity-related assignments
from Congress and the President. Those have led us to focus our attention on assisting
small businesses, forging practical solutions to address security concerns raised by the
Internet of Things, and updating our guidance on risk management and security controls
for federal agencies and others. We also launched major new initiatives, including the
development of a voluntary framework for privacy risk management, standards for
