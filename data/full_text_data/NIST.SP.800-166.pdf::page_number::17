NIST SP 800-166                                                        DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                       DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

4.      Conformance Criteria

Conformance criteria are based on the compliance of the “conformity condition” under the test
with the requirements defined in [SP800-157] or any other referenced special publication (e.g.,
[FIPS201], [SP800-73], [SP800-78]) The criterion for success for each test assertion is based on
the type of test being conducted.

4.1     Conformance Criteria for Derived PIV Application on Removable Tokens

The Derived PIV Application tests validate conformance to [SP800-157] of a Derived PIV
Application developed by a vendor. The criterion for success is documented as part of the
expected result or the required vendor documentation for each test assertion. Overall
conformance of a removable token’s Derived PIV Application is based on passing the following
three categories of tests:

      1. Transport layer conformance tests,

      2. Derived PIV Application data object access/storage conformance tests, and

      3. Derived PIV Application command interface conformance tests.

4.2     Conformance Criteria for Data Model of the Derived PIV Application

The data model tests validate the data objects that are loaded onto a conformant Derived PIV
Application’s removable token by an issuer. The criterion for success is documented as part of
the expected result or the required issuer documentation for each test assertion. Overall
conformance of the data model of the Derived PIV Application is based on passing the following
three categories of tests:

      1. BER-TLV format conformance tests,

      2. Signed Data Object conformance tests, and

      3. PKI conformance tests.

Testing entities may also validate individual credentials (e.g., Derived PIV Authentication
certificate, digital signature certificate, key management certificate) stored on embedded (non-
removable) tokens. As described in Appendix A, in many cases it will also be possible to
perform functional testing of the corresponding private keys.
