5.     Software Requirements, Evaluation, and Validation

Agencies should clearly defne the requirements for de-identifcation algorithms and the
software that implements those algorithms. They should be sure that the algorithms that
they intend to use are validated, that the software implements the algorithms as expected,
and that the data that result from the operation of the software are correct.
Today, there a growing number of algorithms and tools for performing de-identifcation,
data masking, and other privacy-preserving operations. NIST maintains a list of some
of these tools38 . Such tools are also increasingly being evaluated in academic litera-
ture [144] and by NIST [135, 1]. Although there are no widely accepted performance
standards or certifcation procedures at present, NIST is conducting a series of Collabo-
rative Challenges “designed to spur research, innovation, and understanding of data dei-
dentifcation techniques.” Details of the NIST Collaborative Challenges program can be
found at https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/privacy-engineering/collaboration-
space/challenges/collaborative-0.

5.1.    Evaluate the Privacy-Preserving Techniques
Software evaluation should begin with a determination of the privacy preserving techniques
used by the software. The agency should determine that the algorithm is appropriate for
the task at hand and that it has not been superseded by a new algorithm or approach that
provides a more appropriate risk/utility trade-off.
There have been decades of research in the feld of statistical disclosure limitation and
de-identifcation, and understanding in the feld has evolved over time. Agencies should
not base their technical evaluation of a technique solely on the fact that the technique has
been published in peer-reviewed literature or that the agency has a long history of using
the technique and has not experienced any problems. Instead, it is necessary to evaluate
proposed techniques through the totality of scientifc experience and with regard to current
threats.
Traditional statistical disclosure limitation and de-identifcation techniques base their risk
assessments – in part – on an expectation of what kinds of data are available to a data
intruder to conduct a linkage attack. Where possible, these assumptions should be docu-
mented and published along with a description of the privacy-preserving techniques that
were used to transform the datasets prior to release so that they can be reviewed by external
experts and the scientifc community.
