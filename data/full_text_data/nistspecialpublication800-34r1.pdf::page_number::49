                                                        CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



Plans should be formatted to provide quick and clear directions in the event that personnel unfamiliar with
the plan or the systems are called on to perform recovery operations. Plans should be clear, concise, and
easy to implement in an emergency. Where possible, checklists and step-by-step procedures should be
used. A concise and well-formatted plan reduces the likelihood of creating an overly complex or
confusing plan.

4.1       Supporting Information

The supporting information component includes an introduction and concept of operations section
providing essential background or contextual information that makes the contingency plan easier to
understand, implement, and maintain. These details aid in understanding the applicability of the
guidance, in making decisions on how to use the plan, and in providing information on where associated
plans and information outside the scope of the plan may be found.

The introduction section orients the reader to the type and location of information contained in the plan.
Generally, the section includes the background, scope, and assumptions. 29 These subsections are
described below.

         Background. This subsection establishes the reason for developing the ISCP and defines the
          plan objectives.

         Scope. The scope identifies the FIPS 199 impact level and associated RTOs as well as the
          alternate site and data storage capabilities (as applicable).

         Assumptions. This section includes the list of assumptions that were used in developing the
          ISCP as well as a list of situations that are not applicable. See Appendix A Sample Information
          System Contingency Plan Templates, for a sample of assumptions and situations.

The concept of operations section provides additional details about the information system, the three
phases of the contingency plan (Activation and Notification, Recovery, and Reconstitution), and a
description of the information system contingency plan roles and responsibilities. This section may
include the following elements:

         System description. It is necessary to include a general description of the information system
          addressed by the contingency plan. The description should include the information system
          architecture, location(s), and any other important technical considerations. An input/output (I/O)
          diagram and system architecture diagram, including security devices (e.g., firewalls, internal and
          external connections) are useful. The content for the system description can usually be taken
          from the System Security Plan. 30
         Overview of three phases. The ISCP recovery is implemented in three phases: (1) Activation
          and Notification, (2) Recovery, and (3) Reconstitution.
         Roles and responsibilities. The roles and responsibilities section presents the overall structure of
          contingency teams, including the hierarchy and coordination mechanisms and requirements
          among the teams. The section also provides an overview of team member roles and
          responsibilities in a contingency situation. Teams and team members should be designated for
          specific response and recovery roles during contingency plan activation.

   This plan format is meant to guide the contingency plan developer. Individuals may choose to add, delete, or modify this
   format as required, to best fit the system and organization’s contingency planning requirements.
