A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



2.9     Maurer’s “Universal Statistical” Test

2.9.1 Test Purpose
The focus of this test is the number of bits between matching patterns (a measure that is related to the
length of a compressed sequence). The purpose of the test is to detect whether or not the sequence can be
significantly compressed without loss of information. A significantly compressible sequence is
considered to be non-random.

2.9.2 Function Call
Universal(L, Q, n), where

         L       The length of each block. Note: the use of L as the block size is not consistent with the
                 block size notation (M) used for the other tests. However, the use of L as the block size
                 was specified in the original source of Maurer's test.

         Q       The number of blocks in the initialization sequence.

         n       The length of the bit string.

Additional input used by the function, but supplied by the testing code:

         ε       The sequence of bits as generated by the RNG or PRNG being tested; this exists as a
                 global structure at the time of the function call; ε = ε1, ε2, … , εn.


2.9.3    Test Statistic and Reference Distribution
fn :     The sum of the log2 distances between matching L-bit templates, i.e., the sum of the number of
         digits in the distance between L-bit templates.

The reference distribution for the test statistic is the half-normal distribution (a one-sided variant of the
normal distribution) as is also the case for the Frequency test in Section 2.1.

2.9.4    Test Description
(1)      The n-bit sequence (ε) is partitioned into two segments: an initialization segment consisting of Q
         L-bit non-overlapping blocks, and a test segment consisting of K L-bit non-overlapping blocks.
         Bits remaining at the end of the sequence that do not form a complete L-bit block are discarded.
         The first Q blocks are used to initialize the test. The remaining K blocks are the test blocks (K =
         n/L - Q).
