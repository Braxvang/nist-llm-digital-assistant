830             A.03.01.20.b[02]: the following security requirements to be satisfied on external systems prior
831             to allowing the use of or access to those systems by authorized individuals are established:
832             <A.03.01.20.ODP[02]: security requirements>.
833             A.03.01.20.c.01: authorized individuals are permitted to use an external system to access the
834             organizational system or to process, store, or transmit CUI only after verification of the
835             implementation of security requirements on the external system as specified in the
836             organizationâ€™s security plans.
837             A.03.01.20.c.02: authorized individuals are permitted to use an external system to access the
838             organizational system or to process, store, or transmit CUI only after the retention of approved
839             system connection or processing agreements with the organizational entity hosting the external
840             system.
841             A.03.01.20.d: the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices by authorized
842             individuals on external systems is restricted.

843             ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
844             Examine
845             [SELECT FROM: access control policy and procedures; procedures for the use of external
846             systems; terms and conditions for the use of external systems; external systems security
847             requirements; list of types of applications accessible from external systems; system
848             configuration settings; system security plan; other relevant documents or records]
849             Interview
850             [SELECT FROM: personnel with responsibilities for defining terms, conditions, and security
851             requirements for the use of external systems; personnel with information security
852             responsibilities; system administrators]
853             Test
854             [SELECT FROM: mechanisms for implementing and/or enforcing terms, conditions, and
855             security requirements for the use of external systems]

861             REQUIREMENT: 03.01.22

862             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
863             Determine if:
864             A.03.01.22.a: authorized individuals are trained to ensure that publicly accessible information
865             does not contain CUI.
866             A.03.01.22.b[01]: the content on publicly accessible systems is periodically reviewed for CUI.
867             A.03.01.22.b[02]: CUI is removed from publicly accessible systems if discovered.
