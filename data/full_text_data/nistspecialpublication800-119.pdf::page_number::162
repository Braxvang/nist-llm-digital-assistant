                                                                         GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


replaced include system security categorization, operating system and applications, lifecycle replacement,
and dependencies.

Each information system should designate a security categorization. FIPS 199, Standards for Security
Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems,69 is the document that guides an
organization in the determination of a system’s category. The category of the system determines which
security controls must be implemented to protect the system appropriately. The controls implemented for
IPv6 will be similar to the controls implemented for IPv4.

Most organizations have a large installed base of legacy equipment and applications. Many legacy
systems cannot support IPv6. IPv6 is widely supported by network equipment vendors, and desktop
systems and productivity applications generally support IPv6. Firewall and IDS implementations also are
beginning to have good support for IPv6. Where organizations have difficulties supporting IPv6 is with
management applications, embedded systems, and legacy applications. Legacy applications that
implement network protocols or process network addresses were not written to support IP agnostic
addressing (IPv4/IPv6). There were no requirements for IPv6 address handling. These applications’ code
assumes 32-bit addressing. The application code logic and storage allocations work with IPv4
addressing. It will take a long time to update legacy applications to support IPv6. Applications that
cannot support IPv6 require the evaluation and selection of co-existence mechanisms. Organizations
should plan that a significant number of legacy applications will not natively support IPv6 and include
requirements to support accessing IPv4 only applications and services by IPv4 and IPv6 clients.

The information captured in this inventory should populate the organization’s IPv6 configuration
management database and be maintained by configuration management. Configuration management data
will not be perfect and will become out of date with the production environment. An organization must
decide the acceptable level of accuracy needed to make good decisions and build processes to maintain
the inventory data within the established parameters.

The following decisions need to be made for each piece of equipment:

         Will the equipment be replaced to support IPv6?

         Can a service be upgraded to support IPv6?
         Will a translation mechanism be necessary?
The asset inventory is the main input into the organization’s decision process concerning the deployment
scenario. If the inventory demonstrates mostly new equipment, an IPv6 pervasive scenario is available as
a deployment option. On the other hand, if the inventory demonstrates mostly older equipment that
cannot readily support IPv6, then an IPv6 sparse deployment scenario is the more likely choice.

Organizations should consider the life cycle replacement of equipment in conjunction with the IPv6
rollout schedule. When possible, the IPv6 rollout schedule should align with the lifecycle replacement to
reduce costs of the overall transition. Organizations that do not align schedules should plan for additional
costs.
