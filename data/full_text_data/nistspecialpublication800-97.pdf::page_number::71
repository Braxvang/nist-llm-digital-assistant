                                      Figure 5-14. 4-Way Handshake



Frames 2, 3 and 4 in the exchange are protected from modification using a message integrity code (MIC)
applied to the frames. This message integrity feature, which is mandatory for all frames except the first
frame, is performed by computing a message integrity check over the entire frame and sending the MIC
along with the frame. Although Frame 1 is not integrity-protected, any modification to it can be detected
by the subsequent checking mechanisms. Message encryption is performed to protect critical data from
unauthorized disclosure. It may also be used in frame 2 to encrypt the RSNIE; however, this is optional.

5.5.2   Group Key Handshake

The Group Key Handshake is used by the AP to send a new GTK to a STA. It may occur immediately
after the 4-Way Handshake or upon STA initiation. It is necessary to support multicast or broadcast
traffic. Figure 5-15 depicts the simple two-frame Group Key Handshake.
