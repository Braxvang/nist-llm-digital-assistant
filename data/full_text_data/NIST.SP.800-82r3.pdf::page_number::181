internet
The single interconnected worldwide system of commercial, government, educational, and other computer networks
that share the set of protocols specified by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the name and address spaces
managed by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). [RFC4949] (adapted)

intrusion detection system
A security service that monitors and analyzes network or system events for the purpose of finding, and providing
real-time or near real-time warning of, attempts to access system resources in an unauthorized manner. [RFC4949]
(adapted)

intrusion prevention system
A system that can detect an intrusive activity and also attempt to stop the activity, ideally before it reaches its
targets.

jitter
The time or phase difference between the data signal and the ideal clock.

key logger
A program designed to record which keys are pressed on a computer keyboard in order to obtain passwords or
encryption keys and thus bypass other security measures.

local area network
A group of computers and other devices dispersed over a relatively limited area and connected by a communications
link that enables any device to interact with any other on the network.

machine controller
A control system/motion network that electronically synchronizes drives within a machine system instead of relying
on synchronization via mechanical linkage. [IR6859]

maintenance
Any act that either prevents the failure or malfunction of equipment or restores its operating capability. [ISADICT]

malware
Software or firmware intended to perform an unauthorized process that will have adverse impact on the
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system. A virus, worm, Trojan horse, or other code-based
entity that infects a host. [SP800-53r5] (adapted)

manipulated variable
In a process that is intended to regulate some condition, a quantity or a condition that the control alters to initiate a
change in the value of the regulated condition. [ISADICT]

master terminal unit
See Control Server.

modem
A device used to convert serial digital data from a transmitting terminal to a signal suitable for transmission over a
telephone channel to reconvert the transmitted signal to serial digital data for the receiving terminal. [IR6859]

operating system
An integrated collection of service routines for supervising the sequencing of programs by a computer. An operating
system may perform the functions of input/output control, resource scheduling, and data management. It provides
application programs with the fundamental commands for controlling the computer. [ISADICT]

operational controls
The security controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) for an information system that are primarily implemented
and executed by people (as opposed to systems). [FIPS200]
