fieldbus
A digital, serial, multi-drop, two-way data bus or communication path or link between low-level industrial field
equipment, such as sensors, transducers, actuators, local controllers, and even control room devices. Use of fieldbus
technologies eliminates the need for point-to-point wiring between the controller and each device. A protocol is used
to define messages over the fieldbus network, and each message identifies a particular sensor on the network.

File Transfer Protocol
An standard for transferring files over the internet. FTP programs and utilities are used to upload and download web
pages, graphics, and other files between local media and a remote server that allows FTP access.

firewall
An inter-network gateway that restricts data communication traffic to and from one of the connected networks (the
one said to be “inside” the firewall) and thus protects that network’s system resources against threats from the other
network (the one that is said to be “outside” the firewall). [RFC4949]

human-machine interface
The hardware or software through which an operator interacts with a controller. An HMI can range from a physical
control panel with buttons and indicator lights to an industrial PC with a color graphics display running dedicated
HMI software. [IR6859]

identification
The process of verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, usually as a prerequisite for granting access to
resources in an IT system. [SP800-47]

incident
An occurrence that actually or potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information
system or the information the system processes, stores, or transmits or that constitutes a violation or imminent threat
of violation of security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies. [FIPS200]

industrial control system
General term that encompasses several types of control systems, including supervisory control and data acquisition
(SCADA) systems, distributed control systems (DCS), and other control system configurations that are often found
in the industrial sectors and critical infrastructures, such as programmable logic controllers (PLC). An ICS consists
of combinations of control components (e.g., electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic) that act together to
achieve an industrial objective (e.g., manufacturing, transportation of matter or energy).

information security program plan
Formal document that provides an overview of the security requirements for an organization-wide information
security program and describes the program management controls and common controls in place or planned for
meeting those requirements. [OMB-A130]

input/output
A general term for the equipment that is used to communicate with a computer as well as the data involved in the
communications. [ISADICT]

insider
An entity inside the security perimeter that is authorized to access system resources but uses them in a way that is
not approved by those who granted the authorization.

integrity
Guarding against improper information modification or destruction, and includes ensuring information non-
repudiation and authenticity. [USC44-3552] (adapted)

intelligent electronic device
Any device incorporating one or more processors with the capability to receive or send data/control from or to an
external source (e.g., electronic multifunction meters, digital relays, controllers). [AGA12]
