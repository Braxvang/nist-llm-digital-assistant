 Tailoring                            The process by which a security control baseline is
 [NIST SP 800-53, CNSSI No. 4009]     modified based on: (i) the application of scoping
                                      guidance; (ii) the specification of compensating security
                                      controls, if needed; and (iii) the specification of
                                      organization-defined parameters in the security controls
                                      via explicit assignment and selection statements.
 Tailored Security Control Baseline   A set of security controls resulting from the application
 [NIST SP 800-39]                     of tailoring guidance to the security control baseline. See
                                      Tailoring.
 Technical Controls                   Security controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) for
 [FIPS 200]                           an information system that are primarily implemented
                                      and executed by the information system through
                                      mechanisms contained in the hardware, software, or
                                      firmware components of the system.
 Threat                               Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely
 [CNSSI No.4009]                      impact organizational operations (including mission,
                                      functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets,
                                      individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an
                                      information system via unauthorized access, destruction,
                                      disclosure, or modification of information, and/or denial
                                      of service.
 Threat Assessment                    Process of formally evaluating the degree of threat to an
 [CNSSI No. 4009]                     information system or enterprise and describing the
                                      nature of the threat.
 Threat Event                         An event or situation that has the potential for causing
                                      undesirable consequences or impact.
 Threat Scenario                      A set of discrete threat events, associated with a specific
                                      threat source or multiple threat sources, partially ordered
                                      in time. Synonym for Threat Campaign.
 Threat Shifting                      Response from adversaries to perceived safeguards
                                      and/or countermeasures (i.e., security controls), in which
                                      the adversaries change some characteristic of their intent
                                      to do harm in order to avoid and/or overcome those
                                      safeguards/countermeasures.
 Threat Source                        The intent and method targeted at the intentional
 [CNSSI No. 4009]                     exploitation of a vulnerability or a situation and method
                                      that may accidentally exploit a vulnerability.
 Vulnerability                        Weakness in an information system, system security
 [CNSSI No. 4009]                     procedures, internal controls, or implementation that
                                      could be exploited by a threat source.
 Vulnerability Assessment             Systematic examination of an information system or
 [CNSSI No. 4009]                     product to determine the adequacy of security measures,
                                      identify security deficiencies, provide data from which to
                                      predict the effectiveness of proposed security measures,
                                      and confirm the adequacy of such measures after
                                      implementation.
