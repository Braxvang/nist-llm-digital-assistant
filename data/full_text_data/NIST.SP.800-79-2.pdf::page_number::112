                                    implemented.

                                    Assessment
                                    Determine that:
                                       (i) the implementation can block use of Derived PIV
                                           Credential’s private key if the number of
                                           consecutive failed attempts has exceeded that
                                           set by the issuer (test, observe).
                                      (ii) Throttling mechanisms may also be used to limit
                                           the number of attempts that may be performed
                                           over a given period of time.

                       AI(DC)-16    An LoA-3 Derived PIV Credential could be issued             DPCI – LOA    [SP 800-157], Section 2.2 -
                       (NEW)        remotely. If the issuance process involves two or more      3 Only        Initial Issuance

                                    PIV Credential remotely, the subscriber identifies
                                    himself/herself in each new encounter by presenting a
                                    temporary secret that was issued in a previous
                                    transaction, as described in Section 5.3.1 of [SP 800-
                                    63-2].

                                    Assessment
                                    Determine that:
                                       (i) the issuer implements a process conformant to
                                           [SP 800-63-2] when multiple transactions are
                                           involved in issuing a Derived PIV Credential
                                           remotely at LOA 3 (review, observe),
                                      (ii) the issuer uses communications that are
                                           authenticated and protected from modification
                                           (e.g., using Transport Layer Security (TLS)), and
                                           that encryption is used, if necessary, to protect
                                           the confidentiality of any private or secret data
                                           (review and observe).

                       AI(DC)-17    An LOA-4 Derived PIV Credential is issued in person, in DPCI – LOA        [SP 800-157], Section 2.2 -
                       (NEW)        accordance with [SP 800-63-2], and the subscriber        4 Only           Initial Issuance
                                    identifies himself/herself using a biometric sample that
                                    can be verified against the subscriber’s PIV Card.

                                    Assessment
                                    Determine that:
                                      (i) the issuer implements a process conformant to
                                          [SP 800-63-2]and where a biometric sample of
                                          the subscriber is verified prior to issuance of the
                                          Derived PIV Credential (review, observe)
