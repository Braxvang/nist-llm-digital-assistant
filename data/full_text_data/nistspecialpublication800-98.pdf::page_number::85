                                                                                     SECTION 5: RFID SECURITY CONTROLS



5.3.3    Tag Data Protection

Technical controls currently available for protecting tag data include:

 Tag memory access control, which can restrict use of tag commands and protect data stored in a tag’s
  memory,
 Encrypting the data on tags,
 The kill feature, which can prevent subsequent unauthorized use of a tag, and
 Tamper protection.
These controls are described in more detail in Sections 5.3.3.1 through 5.3.3.4.

5.3.3.1 Tag Memory Access Control

Control: Many tags support a password-protected lock feature which provides read or write protection to
memory. In some RFID technologies, the lock feature is permanent and in others it is reversible. For
example, the EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 has five areas of memory, each of which can be protected
using the lock command. 62 The memory is either both read- and write-protected, or only write-
protected, depending on the parameters issued with the command. The EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2
UHF standard also has a permalock feature. If engaged, permalock will make the lock status (locked or
unlocked) permanent for all or part of a tag’s memory. ISO/IEC 18000-3 Mode 2 supports both read and
write protecting all areas of memory with a 48-bit memory access password. Finally, Mode 2 of the
ISO/IEC 18000-3 standard describes a lock pointer, which is a memory address. All areas of memory
with a lower address than the lock pointer are write-protected, while those areas of memory above the
pointer address are not.

The effectiveness of tag memory access controls depend on proper management of passwords. Section
5.3.1.1 provides additional information on password authentication.

Applicability: All applications that store data on tags.

Benefits: A write-protect lock command will prevent the contents of a tag’s memory from being altered.
A read-protect lock command will prevent unauthorized users from reading or accessing the data on tags.

Weaknesses:

 The password length on many tags is too short to provide meaningful memory access protection.
  Even when the technology supports longer passwords, password management is challenging (see
  Section 5.3.1.1 on password authentication for additional information).
 Locking a tag’s memory does not prevent data loss from electromagnetic interference or physical tag
  destruction.

     The five areas of memory are registers for the kill password, access password, EPC memory, TID memory, and User
     memory. When locked, the kill password and access password become both read and write protected. If they are locked,
     the EPC memory, TID memory, and User memory are only write protected.
