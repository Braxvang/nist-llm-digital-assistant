 Security Control Baseline            The set of minimum security controls defined for a low-
 [CNSSI No. 4009]                     impact, moderate-impact, or high-impact information
                                      system.
 [CNSSI No. 1253]                     A set of information security controls that has been
                                      established through information security strategic
                                      planning activities to address one or more specified
                                      security categorizations; this set of security controls is
                                      intended to be the initial security control set selected for a
                                      specific system once that system’s security categorization
                                      is determined.
 Security Control Enhancement         Statement of security capability to: (i) build in additional,
 [NIST SP 800-39, adapted]            but related, functionality to a basic security control;
                                      and/or (ii) increase the strength of a basic control.
 Security Control Inheritance         A situation in which an information system or application
 [CNSSI No. 4009]                     receives protection from security controls (or portions of
                                      security controls) that are developed, implemented,
                                      assessed, authorized, and monitored by entities other than
                                      those responsible for the system or application; entities
                                      either internal or external to the organization where the
                                      system or application resides. See Common Control.
 Security Controls                    The management, operational, and technical controls
 [FIPS 199, CNSSI No. 4009]           (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) prescribed for an
                                      information system to protect the confidentiality,
                                      integrity, and availability of the system and its
                                      information.
 Security Impact Analysis             The analysis conducted by an organizational official to
 [NIST SP 800-37]                     determine the extent to which changes to the information
                                      system have affected the security state of the system.
 Security Objective                   Confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
 [FIPS 199]
 Security Plan                        Formal document that provides an overview of the
 [NIST SP 800-18]                     security requirements for an information system or an
                                      information security program and describes the security
                                      controls in place or planned for meeting those
                                      requirements.
                                      See System Security Plan or Information Security
                                      Program Plan.
 Security Policy                      A set of criteria for the provision of security services.
 [CNSSI No. 4009]
 Security Posture                     The security status of an enterprise’s networks,
 [CNSSI No. 4009]                     information, and systems based on information assurance
                                      resources (e.g., people, hardware, software, policies) and
                                      capabilities in place to manage the defense of the
                                      enterprise and to react as the situation changes.
