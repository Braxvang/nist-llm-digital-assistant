GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



     digests do not match, then either the transaction data has been altered or an unauthorized device
     created the digital signature.

5. The other readers can store their own event transactions on the tag or record them in enterprise
   subsystem databases for later queries regarding the tagâ€™s chain of custody.

Applicability: Applications that require more robust evidence of authenticity than provided by HMAC
technology, including authentication of multiple chain of custody events. Applications that require
verification of authenticity without network connectivity.

Benefits: Digital signatures offer several advantages relative to HMAC authentication, including:

 Digital signature systems do not require tags to store cryptographic secrets. Instead, readers maintain
  private keys. In password and HMAC authentication, both the tag and the reader must share a secret
  for the system to function, but there are no shared secrets in the public key cryptosystems that support
  digital signatures. Tags are typically much more vulnerable to compromise than readers, so
  eliminating the need to store secrets on tags enhances overall system security. One private key and
  one or more public key certificates are on the reader. Integrity is needed for the certificates, but not
  confidentiality.
 In many cases, digital signatures do not require network connectivity to successfully perform the
  authentication function. In password and HMAC authentication, a reader is unlikely to have the
  memory to store the passwords or keys for large numbers of tags. With digital signatures, a reader
  may only need to store the public key certificate of the entity that initialized the tags or perhaps a
  relatively small number of readers. In inter-enterprise systems, each participating organization only
  has to share the public keys of its readers rather than provide its partners reliable network access to a
  password or secret key database.
 Digital signatures are compatible with existing RFID tag standards. HMAC requires tags to support
  hash algorithms and to implement a challenge-response protocol, neither of which are included in
  existing RFID standards. On the other hand, in authenticated RFID systems, tags can receive, store,
  and transmit digital signatures with existing read and write commands because the complexity resides
  in readers or middleware.
Weaknesses:

 A system of digital signatures requires a public key infrastructure (PKI), including registration and
  certification authorities, revocation functions, and associated policies and practice statements.
  Successfully implementing and operating a PKI requires careful planning and considerable expertise.
  In addition, readers or middleware need to support digital signature and other PKI functionality that is
  not commonly found in current RFID technology.
 Digital signatures systems require more memory than found on many current tags. For example,
  NIST recommends that RSA signatures have a length of 1024 bits, and a length of 2048 bits after
  2010. 55 Additional memory is required to store identifying information related to the transaction.
  Providing chain of custody evidence requires storing a digital signature and related identifying
  information for each transaction.

     Elliptic curve cryptography can reduce the size of signatures. Elliptic curve methods provide comparable assurance to 1024-
     bit RSA signatures with 163 bits, and to 2048-bit RSA signatures with 224 bits. This approach combined with greater
     memory on tags may alleviate storage concerns over time.
