For an incident response team to perform effectively, it must be able to act autonomously and
decisively. The resolution of a problem may impact many consumers of the cloud service. It is
important that cloud providers have a transparent response process and mechanisms to share
information with their consumers during and after the incident. Understanding and negotiating
the provisions and procedures for incident response should be done before entering into a service
contract, rather than as an afterthought. For example, incident response plans should address
breaches involving PII and ways to minimize the amount of PII involved when reporting and
responding to a breach [Mcc10]. The geographic location of data is a related issue that can
impede an investigation, and is a relevant subject for contract discussions.

4.10 Summary of Recommendations
A number of significant security and privacy issues were covered in the previous subsections.
Table 1 summarizes those issues and related recommendations for organizations to follow when
planning, reviewing, negotiating, or initiating a public cloud service outsourcing arrangement.

                  Table 1: Security and Privacy Issues and Recommendations


Areas               Recommendations

                    Extend organizational practices pertaining to the policies, procedures, and standards
                    used for application development and service provisioning in the cloud, as well as the
Governance          design, implementation, testing, use, and monitoring of deployed or engaged services.
                    Put in place audit mechanisms and tools to ensure organizational practices are followed
                    throughout the system lifecycle.
                    Understand the various types of laws and regulations that impose security and privacy
                    obligations on the organization and potentially impact cloud computing initiatives,
                    particularly those involving data location, privacy and security controls, records
                    management, and electronic discovery requirements.
Compliance          Review and assess the cloud provider’s offerings with respect to the organizational
                    requirements to be met and ensure that the contract terms adequately meet the
                    requirements.
                    Ensure that the cloud provider’s electronic discovery capabilities and processes do not
                    compromise the privacy or security of data and applications.

                    Ensure that service arrangements have sufficient means to allow visibility into the
                    security and privacy controls and processes employed by the cloud provider, and their
                    performance over time.
                    Establish clear, exclusive ownership rights over data.
Trust
                    Institute a risk management program that is flexible enough to adapt to the constantly
                    evolving and shifting risk landscape for the lifecycle of the system.
                    Continuously monitor the security state of the information system to support on-going
                    risk management decisions.
