Foreword
 Pablo Picasso famously said, “action is the foundational key to success". At the
 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), we have been a part of the
 action in the cybersecurity world since the very beginning, and this year is a big one
 for us. We are celebrating a major milestone as we hit 50 years of cybersecurity
 at NIST. For 50 years, NIST—formerly the National Bureau of Standards (NBS),
 until 1988—has conducted research and developed guidance that has led to
 extraordinary advancements in cybersecurity.

 We take pride in our rich history and work to honor the tradition of fostering an open,
 transparent, and collaborative environment where we cultivate trust in technology.
 Our dynamic projects are of global importance because they help advance
 technology, cybersecurity and privacy standards and guidelines, and measurement
 science for all of us. We value success, and all the learning and collaboration that
 comes along with it.

 This annual report is organized into eight key areas: cryptographic standards
 and validation, cybersecurity measurement, education and workforce, identity
 and access management, privacy engineering, risk management, trustworthy
 networks, and trustworthy platforms. This past year, NIST conducted research and
 demonstrated practical applications in several key priority areas, including post
 quantum cryptography (PQC), cybersecurity in supply chains—which was included
 in an Executive Order from the President in 2021—zero trust, and control systems
 cybersecurity. We also initiated research in some new areas, including exploring
 the cybersecurity of genomics data.

 We have a lot planned for 2022 as we help organizations better manage risk (for
 example, we are launching an update process for the Cybersecurity Framework and
 reviewing a host of other NIST frameworks and guidance documents with an eye on
 improving their alignment). We have also made selections of finalists and alternate
 candidates to be considered for PQC standardization. Stay tuned for updates to
 our foundational digital identity guidelines and for information on some of our new
 projects related to cybersecurity workforce and privacy (and be on the lookout for a
 Workforce Framework). We also will unveil a new tool that will make it simpler and
 quicker for users of NIST cybersecurity and privacy products to navigate content
 across NIST resources.

 While Picasso was famous for a completely different form of art, cybersecurity
 and privacy is our ‘art’—and our science—and we are ready for 50 more years of
 innovation, collaboration, and action.
