       TSP = timestamped_data, timestamp_signatureTTA
   where:
       user_supplied_info = SIGA(M), other_info.
       timestamped_data = user_supplied_info, TTA_supplied_info, timestamp.
       timestamp_signatureTTA = SIGTTA(user_supplied_info, TTA_supplied_info,
          timestamp).
   If there is a mutual agreement between entity A and the TTA, the following
   information may be omitted from the TSP transmitted by the TTA:
       •    Any portion of the user_supplied_info may be omitted, since it is known
            by entity A. However, if SIGA(M) is omitted from the TSP, it shall be
            inserted back into the TSP when sent to entity B (see step 3).
       •    Any portion of the TTA_supplied_info may be omitted when this
            information is known or can be determined by entity A.
   However, the entire user_supplied_info and the entire TTA_supplied_info shall be
   included in the generation / verification of timestamp_signatureTTA.
   Upon receiving the TSP from the TTA, entity A should 1) check that the
   transmitted portions of the user_supplied_info are correct and 2) verify
   timestamp_signatureTTA using the TTA’s public signature verification key.
3. Entity A signs (M, TSP), assembles D and sends it to entity B:
           D = M, TSP, SIGA(M, TSP)
   where TSP is as defined in step 2.
   If any portion of the user_supplied_info was omitted from the TSP received from
   the TTA, then the entire user_supplied_info shall be inserted into the TSP used in
   the assembly of D unless there is a mutual agreement between entity A and entity
   B, in which case, any portion of the user_supplied_info may be omitted from the
   TSP transmitted to entity B if it is known or can be determined by entity B.
   However, the entire user_supplied_info shall be included in the
   timestamped_data that is used in the generation / verification of
   timestamp_signatureTTA and SIGA(M, TSP).
   If any portion of the TTA_supplied_info was omitted from the TSP received from
   the TTA, then the entire TTA_supplied_info shall be inserted into the TSP used in
   the assembly of D unless there is a mutual agreement between entity A and entity
   B, in which case, any portion of the TTA_supplied_info may be omitted from the
   TSP data transmitted by entity A if the information is already known or can be
   determined by entity B. However, the entire TTA_supplied_info shall be included
   in the timestamped_data that is used in the generation / verification of
   timestamp_signatureTTA and SIGA(M, TSP).
4. Upon receiving D, entity B does the following:
