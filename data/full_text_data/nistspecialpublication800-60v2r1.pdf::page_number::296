           (a) An agency may refuse to confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of
           requested information whenever the fact of its existence or nonexistence is itself
           classified under this order.

           (b) When an agency receives any request for documents in its custody that contain
           information that was originally classified by another agency, or comes across such
           documents in the process of the automatic declassification or systematic review
           provisions of this order, it shall refer copies of any request and the pertinent
           documents to the originating agency for processing, and may, after consultation with
           the originating agency, inform any requester of the referral unless such association is
           itself classified under this order. In cases in which the originating agency determines
           in writing that a response under paragraph (a), above, is required, the referring agency
           shall respond to the requester in accordance with that paragraph.
