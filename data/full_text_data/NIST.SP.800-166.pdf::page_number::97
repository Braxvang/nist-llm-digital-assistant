NIST SP 800-166                                                  DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                 DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

 Test Scenario           1. Send the SELECT command with
                               • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                         2. Send the GET DATA command with
                               • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                  ('5FC10A') of the X.509 Certificate for
                                  Digital Signature data object
                         3. If the X.509 Certificate for Digital Signature data
                            object was retrieved in Step 2, read and parse the
                            byte array in accordance with BER-TLV format.
 Expected Result(s)      1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                            template with the status word '90 00'.
                         2. From Step 2, the command returns one of the following:
                             • An X.509 Certificate for Digital Signature data object
                                followed by status word '90 00';
                             • A zero-length data object followed by status word '90 00' –
                                which indicates that a container for the X.509 certificate
                                exists, but it has not been personalized; or
                             • Status word '6A 82' (data object not found) – which
                                indicates the container for the X.509 certificate does not
                                exist
                         3. From Step 3, all mandatory tags for the X.509 Certificate for
                            Digital Signature data object are present in the order indicated
                            in Table 15 of [SP800-73], Part 1.

9.1.3 X.509 Certificate for Key Management

9.1.3.1 BER-TLV of X.509 Certificate for Key Management

 Test Assertion          TA-09.01.03.01
 Purpose                 Verifies that the X.509 Certificate for Key Management (if
                         present) conforms to the Derived PIV data model requirements.
 DTR(s)                  • DTR-07.01.01.01
                         • DTR-07.01.04.01
 Issuer Documentation    None.

 Precondition(s)         •   A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                             appropriate token reader.
                         •   Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                             an instance of the reader.
 Test Scenario           1. Send the SELECT command with
                               • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                         2. Send the GET DATA command with
                               • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                  ('5FC10B') of the X.509 Certificate for Key
                                  Management data object
                         3. If the X.509 Certificate for Key Management data
                            object was retrieved in Step 2, read and parse the
                            byte array in accordance with BER-TLV format.
