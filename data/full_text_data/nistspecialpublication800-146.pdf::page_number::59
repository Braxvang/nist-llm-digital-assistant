                                                              CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



and most systems of significant scale, each component has a specific reliability given a specific context,
and therefore understanding the union of the contexts is complex and possibly intractable.

8.2.1   Network Dependence

Cloud computing, as well as most enterprise applications, depends on network connectivity. For most
clouds, the Internet must be continuously available for a consumer to access services. If a consumer is
hosting a public network service using a provider, this dependence is similar to normal hosting in that
supporting public network services are often accessed over the Internet. In the case of consumer-facing
applications (e.g., webmail) entrusted to a cloud, this dependence is a risk whenever applications need
continuous service. In numerous instances, consumer-facing applications either cannot access a cloud
because of coverage limitations (e.g., subways, airplanes, remote locations) or are vulnerable to network
disruption.

Network dependence implies that every application is a network application which suggests that the
application is relatively complex: i.e., the risk of errors or security vulnerabilities will be higher than for
non-networked, standalone applications. For example, cloud applications should typically
cryptographically sign requests to providers and cryptographically protect consumer data in transit. In
addition to normal outages or no-coverage zones, this dependence makes the application's normal
operation sensitive to: (1) the health of the Internet's routing and naming infrastructure, (2) contention for
local networking resources, and (3) force majeure events.

There have been several well-publicized regional Internet outages that have been the result of denial of
service attacks, viruses infiltrating web servers, worms taking down DNS servers, failures in undersea
cables, and fiber optic cables being damaged during earthquakes and subsequent mudslides. Although
these outages are relatively infrequent, they can have an impact on network connectivity for hours.
Contingency planning for these rare but often serious outages should be addressed as part of any
organization’s tactical IT plans. Most substantial applications are using the Internet today regardless of
whether cloud computing is employed; therefore the reader should not assume that by avoiding a cloud a
user automatically avoids risks associated with Internet outages.

8.2.2   Cloud Provider Outages

In spite of clauses in service agreements implying high availability and minimal downtimes for
consumers, service or utility outages are inevitable due to man-made causes (e.g., malicious attacks or
inadvertent administrator errors) or natural causes (e.g., floods, tornados, etc.).

Issues to be considered by consumers with regard to outages should be based on frequency of outages and
expected recovery times. The two main considerations are:

 What is the frequency and duration of outages that the consumer can tolerate without adversely
  impacting their business processes?
 What are the resiliency alternatives a consumer has for contingency situations involving a prolonged
  outage?
8.2.3   Safety-Critical Processing

Safety-critical systems, both hardware and software, are a class of systems that are usually regulated by
government authorities. Examples are systems that control avionics, nuclear materials, and medical
devices. Such systems typically incur risks for a potential of loss of life or loss of property.
