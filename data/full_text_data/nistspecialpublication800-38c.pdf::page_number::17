The input to the decryption-verification process is a purported ciphertext, an associated data
string, and the nonce that was purportedly used in the generation of the purported ciphertext.
Counter mode decryption is applied to the purported ciphertext to produce the corresponding
MAC and payload. If the nonce, the associated data string, and the payload are valid, as
discussed in Section 5.4, then these strings are formatted into blocks according to the formatting
function, and the CBC-MAC mechanism is applied to verify the MAC. If verification succeeds,
the decryption-verification process returns the payload as output; otherwise, only the error
message INVALID is returned.

When the error message INVALID is returned, the payload P and the MAC T shall not be
revealed. Moreover, the implementation shall ensure that an unauthorized party cannot
distinguish whether the error message results from Step 7 or from Step 10, for example, from the
timing of the error message.
