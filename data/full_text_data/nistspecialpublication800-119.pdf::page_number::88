Correspondent IPv6 Nodes, for using IPsec where it is suitable or desirable to secure BUs and other
communications between a MN and CN.

4.4.3.4        Other Security Considerations for MIPv6

This section briefly covers several topics that do not fit into the above sections: an alternative to IPsec for
MN-HA security proposed by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP2), issues with making
mobility and firewalls work together, security protection for the HA, and a discussion of location
privacy.34

    Some designers of 3GPP2 networks consider including IPsec in handsets too difficult. RFC 4285,
     Protocol for Mobile IPv6 Authentication, describes a shared-key, lightweight alternative to IPsec for
     securing communications between a MN and its HA designed specifically for 3GPP2 networks. The
     IETF has considered this document informational, not standards track, and it has not been
     recommended for use in other environments.
     However, additional questions have been raised about the suitability of IPsec for securing MIPv6, and
     a standards-track alternative has been proposed35. The reasons given for supporting the
     standardization of alternatives to IPsec are:
          1. Software complexity: Because IPsec is implemented in the operating system and no
             convenient application programming interface exists, it is difficult for a third party to
             implement MIPv6 on a system supporting IPsec and IKEv2.
          2. NAT traversal: The need to run MIPv6 on dual stack IPv4-IPv6 systems (RFC 5555) across
             an IPv4 network address translation (NAT) component requires UDP encapsulation and
             makes running IKEv2 and IPsec more complicated.
          3. Dynamic HoA assignment: Unless this is built into the IKEv2 processing, securely
             configuring a dynamic address leads to a chicken-and-egg problem. Using this capability
             within IKEv2 requires communicating the home prefix to IKEv2.
          4. Scalability: The number of security associations a HA must support may exceed its capacity.
          5. Availability: Some IPv6 platforms may not have IPsec and IKEv2.
          6. Communications overhead: The total overhead for IKEv2 and ESP exceeds that of other
             security solutions.
      While these opinions, taken in total, may have some merit, they are controversial. Nevertheless, it is
      likely that at least one alternative to IPsec will proceed along the IETF standards track. It is unclear
      what all of the details will look like and what the time frame for completing this work will be.

    Many IPv6 firewalls are not compatible with MIPv6. Since many MIPv6 messages are encapsulated,
     most firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) cannot parse these messages accurately.
     Current firewall policy configuration rules don’t allow a security administrator to specify both the
     external and internal (tunneled) packet contents before allowing or blocking the traffic. More
