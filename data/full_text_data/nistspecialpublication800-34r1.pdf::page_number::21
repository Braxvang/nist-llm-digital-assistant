2.2        Types of Plans

Information system contingency planning represents a broad scope of activities designed to sustain and
recover critical system services following an emergency event. Information system contingency planning
fits into a much broader security and emergency management effort that includes organizational and
business process continuity, disaster recovery planning, and incident management. Ultimately, an
organization would use a suite of plans to properly prepare response, recovery, and continuity activities
for disruptions affecting the organizationâ€™s information systems, mission/business processes, personnel,
and the facility. Because there is an inherent relationship between an information system and the
mission/business process it supports, there must be coordination between each plan during development
and updates to ensure that recovery strategies and supporting resources neither negate each other nor
duplicate efforts.

Continuity and contingency planning are critical components of emergency management and
organizational resilience but are often confused in their use. Continuity planning normally applies to the
mission/business itself; it concerns the ability to continue critical functions and processes during and after
an emergency event. Contingency planning normally applies to information systems, and provides the
steps needed to recover the operation of all or part of designated information systems at an existing or
new location in an emergency. Cyber Incident Response Planning is a type of plan that normally focuses
on detection, response, and recovery to a computer security incident or event.

In general, universally accepted definitions for information system contingency planning and the related
planning areas have not been available. Occasionally, this leads to confusion regarding the actual scope
and purpose of various types of plans. To provide a common basis of understanding regarding
information system contingency planning, this section identifies several other types of plans and describes
their purpose and scope relative to information system contingency planning. Because of the lack of
standard definitions for these types of plans, the scope of actual plans developed by organizations may
