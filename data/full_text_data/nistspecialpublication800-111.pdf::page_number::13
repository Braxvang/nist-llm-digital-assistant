                                                    GUIDE TO STORAGE ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES FOR END USER DEVICES



 OMB Memorandum M-06-16. OMB has issued a memorandum directly related to storage security.
  OMB M-06-16 addresses the protection of agency information that is either “accessed remotely or
  physically transported outside of the agency’s secured, physical perimeter”. It specifically requires
  that agencies encrypt all data stored on mobile computing devices, such as laptops and PDAs, unless
  the data has been determined by the designated agency official to be non-sensitive. 6 Similar
  requirements are also included in OMB Memorandum M-07-16. 7

 Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act regulates the collection, use, maintenance, and dissemination
  of personal information about U.S. citizens or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. It
  applies to records maintained by agencies in the executive branch of the government.

 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). GLBA requires financial institutions to protect their customers’
  information against security threats. This includes ensuring “the security and confidentiality of
  customer records and information” and protecting “against unauthorized access to or use of such
  records or information”. 8

 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). HIPAA includes security
  standards for certain health information. NIST SP 800-66, An Introductory Resource Guide for
  Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule, lists
  HIPAA-related storage security needs. 9 For example, Section 4.14 of NIST SP 800-66 describes the
  need to encrypt and decrypt electronic protected health information (EPHI).

2.3     Security Controls for Storage

The primary security controls for restricting access to sensitive information stored on end user devices are
encryption and authentication. Encryption can be applied granularly, such as to an individual file
containing sensitive information, or broadly, such as encrypting all stored data. The appropriate
encryption solution for a particular situation depends primarily upon the type of storage, the amount of
information that needs to be protected, the environments where the storage will be located, and the threats
that need to be mitigated. Section 3 discusses the most commonly used options in detail; Appendix A
briefly discusses some additional options. Storage encryption solutions require users to authenticate
successfully before accessing the information that has been encrypted. Common authentication
mechanisms are passwords, personal identification numbers (PIN), cryptographic tokens, biometrics, and
smart cards. The combination of encryption and authentication helps control access to the stored
information.

Organizations also need to consider the security of backups of stored information. Some organizations
permit users to back up their local files to a centralized system, while other organizations recommend that
their users perform local backups (e.g., burning CDs, external USB storage media). In the latter case,
organizations should ensure that the backups will be secured at least as well as the original source. This
could be done with similar controls, such as encrypting the backups, or with different types of controls,
such as storing backup tapes in a physically secured room within the organization’s facilities.

Organizations should also implement other measures that support and complement storage encryption
implementations. These measures help to ensure that storage encryption is implemented in an
