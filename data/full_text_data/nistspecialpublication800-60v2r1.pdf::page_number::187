Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of cultural and historic preservation
information would have, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external
communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public
confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In cases where undetected modification of
information might be useful to an individual or organization intent on destruction of historical
materials, the potential consequences to key national assets could be serious to severe.
Consequently, the integrity impact could be moderate to high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
cultural and historic preservation information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to cultural and historic preservation
information. The effects of disruption of access to most cultural and historic preservation
information or information systems would have a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
cultural and historic preservation information is low.

D.12.4 Cultural and Historic Exhibition Information Type

Cultural and Historic Exhibition includes all activities undertaken by the U.S. government to
promote education through the exhibition of cultural, historical, and other information, archives,
art, etc. The recommended provisional categorization of the cultural and historic exhibition
information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of cultural and historic
exhibition information on the ability of responsible agencies to promote education through the
exhibition of cultural, historical, and other information, archives, art, etc. The consequences of
unauthorized disclosure of most cultural and historic exhibition information would have a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In cases where disclosure of
information might be useful to an individual or organization intent on destruction of historical
