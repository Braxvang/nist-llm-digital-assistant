                                                                                  GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



      implementation, enforcement, audit, review). The policy must be enforced consistently throughout
      the organization to be effective. Generally, the CIO and upper management are responsible for
      drafting the organization’s security policy.
 Configuration/Change Control and Management—The process of controlling modification to a
  system’s design, hardware, firmware, and software provides sufficient assurance that the system is
  protected against the introduction of an improper modification before, during, and after system
  implementation. Configuration control leads to consistency with the organization’s information
  system security policy. Configuration control is traditionally overseen by a configuration control
  board that is the final authority on all proposed changes to an information system.
 Risk Assessment and Management—Risk assessment is the process of analyzing and interpreting
  risk. It involves determining an assessment’s scope and methodology, collecting and analyzing risk-
  related data, and interpreting the risk analysis results. Collecting and analyzing risk data requires
  identifying assets, threats, vulnerabilities, safeguards, consequences, and the probability of a
  successful attack. Risk management is the process of selecting and implementing controls to reduce
  risk to a level acceptable to the organization.
 Standardized Configurations—Organizations should develop standardized secure configurations
  for widely used operating systems and applications. This will provide guidance to mail server and
  network administrators on how to configure their systems securely and ensure consistency and
  compliance with the organizational security policy. Because it only takes one insecurely configured
  host to compromise a network, organizations with a significant number of hosts are especially
  encouraged to apply this recommendation. Section 5 contains additional information on standard
  configurations.
 Security Awareness and Training—A security training program is critical to the overall security
  posture of an organization. Making users and administrators aware of their security responsibilities
  and teaching the correct practices helps them change their behavior to conform to security best
  practices. Training also supports individual accountability, which is an important method for
  improving information system security.
 Contingency, Continuity of Operations, and Disaster Recovery Planning—Contingency plans,
  continuity of operations plans, and disaster recovery plans are established in advance to allow an
  organization or facility to maintain operations in the event of a disruption. 22
 Certification and Accreditation—Certification in the context of information systems security means
  that a system has been analyzed as to how well it meets all of the security requirements of the
  organization. Accreditation occurs when the organization’s management accepts that the system
  meets the organization’s security requirements. 23
4.4     System Security Plan

The objective of system security planning is to improve protection of information system resources. 24
Plans that adequately protect information assets require managers and information owners—directly
affected by and interested in the information and/or processing capabilities—to be convinced that their
