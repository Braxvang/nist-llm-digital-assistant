                                              GUIDELINES FOR SECURING W IRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (WLANS)


There are other technical WLAN security controls, such as configuring clients so that they will not
automatically connect to any WLANs they detect, that are beneficial for WLAN security but not robust
enough to prevent dual connections.

2.2   Configuration Implementation, Evaluation, and Maintenance

After designing a WLAN security configuration, an organization should determine how the configuration
will be implemented, evaluate the effectiveness of the implementation, deploy the implementation to the
appropriate devices, and maintain the configuration and its implementation throughout the devices’
lifecycles. Organizations should ensure that their WLAN client devices and APs have configurations at all
times that are compliant with the organization’s WLAN policies.

Organizations should standardize, automate, and centralize as much of their WLAN security
configuration implementation and maintenance as practical, particularly for their WLAN client devices
and access points. This allows organizations to implement consistent WLAN security throughout the
enterprise, to detect and correct unauthorized changes to configurations, and to react quickly when newly
identified vulnerabilities or recent incidents indicate a need to change the WLAN’s security configuration.

Organizations can often leverage existing configuration management solutions for their WLAN security
configuration management. Many organizations already have general configuration management
solutions in place that can handle a wide variety of software; such solutions may be built into operating
systems or provided through third-party software installed on their client devices and other WLAN
components. Also, WLAN client management software often has configuration management capabilities;
this software may already be installed on the WLAN devices. If the existing configuration management
solutions cannot collectively provide the necessary WLAN configuration implementation and
maintenance capabilities, then the organization should evaluate alternatives and implement a suitable
configuration management solution that provides the missing capabilities.

Organizations should evaluate all standardized WLAN security configuration implementations carefully
before deploying them throughout production environments. Even if the organization is confident that the
configuration is sound, it should still be evaluated carefully to ensure that its implementation meets the
organization’s particular security and operational requirements. Every operating environment has unique
characteristics that should be taken into account. It is particularly important to evaluate the strength of the
configuration and its potential impacts on performance and functionality (for example, a security setting
that is incompatible with use of a particular application).
