      •    Techniques used to perform the de-identification are theoretically sound and generally
           accepted;100

      •    Software used to perform the de-identification is reliable for the intended task;




 100 Specifically, agencies may wish to mirror the language of the HIPAA Privacy Rule’s expert determination method, which

       states: “The second way to de-identify PHI is to have a qualified statistician determine, using(1) A person with appropriate
       knowledge of and experience with generally accepted statistical and scientific principles and methods, for rendering
       information not individually identifiable: (i) Applying such principles and methods, determines that the risk is very small

       document; and
 (ii) Documents the methods and results of the analysis that justify such a determination.” ; See https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-
