NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                          Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                 Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


   22.   The original Appendices C and D on entropy sources and RBG constructions,
         respectively, have been removed and the topics will be discussed in SP 800-90B and C
   23.   In Appendix C.2 (originally Appendix E.2), a paragraph has been inserted after the
         table of E values that discusses the analysis associated with the table values.
   24.   The additional uses of the prediction_resistance_request parameter (as specified in
         Section 9) have been added to the following appendices:
         •   D.1.1, step 4;
         •   D.1.2, Input and step 4;
         •   D.1.3, step 7.1;
         •   D.3.2, step 4;
         •   D.3.3, Input and step 4; and
         •   D.3.4, step 7.1.
   25. The name of the update call has been changed in the following appendices:
         • D.2.1, step 4;
         • D.2.2, step 5;
         • D.3.1, title; and
         • D.4.1, title.
   26. In Appendix D.3 (originally Appendix F.3), the first paragraph, which discusses the
       example, has been modified to discuss the prediction_resistance_request parameter in
       the Get_entropy_input call.
   27. In Appendix D.5 (originally Appendix F.5), the description of the example in paragraph 2
       has been changed so that the example does not include prediction resistance, and the
       definition for the reseed_interval has been removed from the list. The
       Dual_EC_Instantiate_function has been modified to reflect the changes made to the
       Instantiate_function and Instantiate_algorithm (see the last bullet of modification 8
       above). In addition, the pseudocode for the Reseed_function has been removed, and
       steps in F.5.1 and F.5.2 that dealt with reseeding have been removed.
In June 2015, the following substantive changes were made in Revision 1 of [SP 800-90A]:
   1. The following definitions were modified to be consistent with definitions in other parts of
      this Recommendation: backtracking resistance, entropy source, non-deterministic random
      bit generator, prediction resistance, and source of entropy input. The following
      definitions have been removed: public key and public-key pair. A definition for
      "randomness source" has been added, and the definition of "source of entropy input" has
      been removed.
   2. The term "source of entropy input" has been replaced by "randomness source" to avoid
      confusion with the term "entropy source input," which is used in SP 800-90C to mean
      input from an entropy source. A "randomness source" (formerly "source of entropy
      input") could be an entropy source, an NRBG or a DRBG.
