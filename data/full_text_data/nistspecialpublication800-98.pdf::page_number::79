                                                                            SECTION 5: RFID SECURITY CONTROLS



Applicability: Cover coding is useful when eavesdropping is a risk that requires mitigation, but
adversaries are expected to be at a greater distance from the tags than readers. Intelligible reception of
back channel signals from a passive tag requires proximity of less than four meters in most applications.
In many applications, an adversary’s reception equipment would be conspicuous if it were located within
this range. In contrast, reader signals can be detected at distances of a kilometer or more under ideal
conditions.

Cover-coding is designed for RF subsystems in which the forward channel carries stronger signals than
the back channel, which essentially limits the control to passive tags. EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2
technologies support cover-coding. Proprietary technologies support similar features.

Benefits: Cover-coding helps prevent the execution of unauthorized commands that could disable a tag
or modify the tag’s data. Consequently, cover-coding mitigates business process, business intelligence,
and privacy risks.

Weaknesses:

 If an adversary can intercept a key distributed on the back channel, the adversary could decrypt any
  ciphertext message generated with that key.
 The effectiveness of cover-coding depends on the performance of the tag’s random number generator.
  If the random number is predictable due to a flaw in the tag’s design or cryptanalysis, then an
  adversary can learn the key and decrypt subsequent communication.
5.3.2.2 Encryption of Data in Transit

Control: Data collected or processed by the tag is encrypted prior to over-the-air transmission.

Applicability: Applications that require an effective countermeasure to the threat of eavesdropping and
for which cover coding offers inadequate protections. Tags typically only require on-board encryption
capabilities to protect the confidentiality of data in transit if they collect or process data from sensors or
other directly connected sources. In these cases, no alternative exists to hide the content of the data over-
the-air because the data originates on the tag.

On-board cryptography for confidentiality is not required for applications in which readers are the only
source of data. In these cases, the data can be encrypted in the enterprise subsystem or by a reader before
it is written to the tag and then retrieved in its encrypted form from the tag when needed. If the tag never
has to perform computations on the data, then it never has to decrypt it, but merely store it. Encryption
of data at rest is also discussed in Section 5.3.3.2.

Proprietary tag designs support encryption for over-the-air confidentiality, but EPCglobal and ISO/IEC
18000 standards do not as of the date of this publication.

Benefits: Encryption of data in transit prevents successful eavesdropping of over-the-air RFID
transactions.

Weaknesses:

 Data encryption requires a key management system, which can be complex to manage and operate.
 Cryptographic functions may introduce an unacceptable delay in RFID systems that require very fast
  read or write transactions.
