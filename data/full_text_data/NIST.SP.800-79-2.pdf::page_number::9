                                                                                             and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



1. Introduction
In order to enhance security, increase Federal Government efficiency, reduce identity fraud, and
protect personal privacy, Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 ([HSPD-12]), Policy for a
Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors was issued on August
27, 2004. This Directive established a federal policy to create and use government-wide secure
and reliable forms of identification for federal employees and contractors. It further defined
secure and reliable forms of identification as ones that—

           Are issued based on sound criteria for verifying an individual’s identity;
           Are strongly resistant to identity fraud, tampering, counterfeiting, and terrorist
            exploitation;
           Can be rapidly authenticated electronically; and
           Are issued only by providers whose reliability has been established by an official
            accreditation process.

NIST developed and published Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201, Personal
Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors, and several Special
Publications providing additional specifications in response to [HSPD-12]. These documents
provide the foundation for Government personal identification, verification, and access control
systems.

Appendix A.1 of FIPS 201-2 states the following:

 “…[HSPD-12] requires that all cards be issued by providers whose reliability has been
established by an official accreditation process.”

To determine consistency in operations of issuers of PIV Cards, NIST developed a set of
attributes as the basis of reliability assessment and published the first version of this document in
July 2005. Subsequent lessons learned in various agencies’ implementation, experience in
credential management and PIV Card issuance together with the evolution of PIV Card issuing
organizations motivated NIST to develop an updated methodology that is objective, efficient,
and resulted in a consistent and repeatable authorization decisions. These developments led
NIST to publish the first revision to SP 800-79 (i.e., SP 800-79-1) in June 2008. In 2013, FIPS
201 was superseded by FIPS 201 revision 2 (FIPS 201-2). FIPS 201-2 incorporates additional
lessons learned from PIV Card issuers and allows for mobile device-integrated PIV credentials.
This revision reflects the update to FIPS 201-2 and its new associated publication SP 800-157,
Guidelines for Derived Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Credentials [SP800-157], which
details the issuance and use of Derived PIV Credentials3 that are integrated in mobile devices.

    The Derived PIV Credential is an additional common identity credential under HSPD-12 and FIPS 201-2 that is issued by a
    Federal department or agency and used with mobile devices. Derived PIV Credentials are based on the general concept of
    derived credential in SP 800-63-2, Electronic Authentication Guideline [SP 800-63-2], which leverages identity proofing and
    vetting results of current and valid credentials. When applied to PIV, identity proofing and vetting processes do not have to be
    repeated to issue a Derived PIV Credential. Instead, the user proves possession of a valid PIV Card to receive a Derived PIV
    Credential. To achieve interoperability with the PIV infrastructure and its applications, a Derived PIV Credential is a subset of
