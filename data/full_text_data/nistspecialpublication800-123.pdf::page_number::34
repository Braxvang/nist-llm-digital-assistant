                                                                                          GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



 Remove all unneeded compilers.

 Apply the appropriate security template or hardening script to the server.

 For external-facing servers, reconfigure service banners not to report the server and OS type and
  version, if possible. 25

 Configure warning banners for all services that support such banners. 26

 Configure each network service to listen for client connections on only the necessary TCP and UDP
  ports, if possible. 27

Organizations should consider installing the server with non-standard directory names, directory
locations, and filenames if possible. Many server attack tools and worms targeting servers only look for
files and directories in their default locations. While this will not stop determined attackers, it will force
them to work harder to compromise the server, and it also increases the likelihood of attack detection
because of the failed attempts to access the default filenames and directories and the additional time
needed to perform an attack.

5.2     Configuring Access Controls

Most server OSs provide the capability to specify access privileges individually for files, devices, and
other computational resources on that host. Any information that the server can access using these
controls can potentially be distributed to all users accessing the server. The server software is likely to
include mechanisms to provide additional file, device, and resource access controls specific to its
operation. It is important to set identical permissions for both the OS and server application; otherwise,
too much or too little access may be granted to users. Server administrators should consider how best to
configure access controls to protect information stored on servers from two perspectives:

 Limit the access of the server application to a subset of computational resources.

 Limit the access of users through additional access controls enforced by the server, where more
  detailed levels of access control are required.

The proper setting of access controls can help prevent the disclosure of sensitive or restricted information
that is not intended for public dissemination. In addition, access controls can be used to limit resource use
in the event of a DoS attack against the server. Similarly, access controls can enforce separation of duty
by ensuring server logs cannot be modified by server administrators and potentially ensure that the server
process is only allowed to append to the log files.

Typical files to which access should be controlled are as follows:

 Application software and configuration files

 Files related directly to security mechanisms:

      This deters novice attackers and some forms of malware, but it will not deter more skilled attackers from identifying the
      server and OS type.
26
      If the organization does not already have approved standard warning banner text, work with the organizationâ€™s legal counsel
      to develop suitable banner text.
