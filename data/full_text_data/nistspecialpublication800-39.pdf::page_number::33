considers how trust can be measured. The importance of organizational governance, culture, and
transparency47 are also considered with regard to trust and its affect on risk management.

Trust is a belief that an entity will behave in a predictable manner in specified circumstances.
The entity may be a person, process, object or any combination of such components. The entity
can be of any size from a single hardware component or software module, to a piece of equipment
identified by make and model, to a site or location, to an organization, to a nation-state. Trust,
while inherently a subjective determination, can be based on objective evidence and subjective
elements. The objective grounds for trust can include for example, the results of information
technology product testing and evaluation. Subjective belief, level of comfort, and experience
may supplement (or even replace) objective evidence, or substitute for such evidence when it is
unavailable. Trust is usually relative to a specific circumstance or situation (e.g., the amount of
money involved in a transaction, the sensitivity or criticality of information, or whether safety is
an issue with human lives at stake). Trust is generally not transitive (e.g., you trust a friend but
not necessarily a friend of a friend). Finally, trust is generally earned, based on experience or
measurement. However, in certain organizations, trust may be mandated by policy (see Appendix
G, mandated trust model).

Trustworthiness is an attribute of a person or organization that provides confidence to others of
the qualifications, capabilities, and reliability of that entity to perform specific tasks and fulfill
assigned responsibilities. Trustworthiness is also a characteristic of information technology
products and systems (see Section 2.6.2 on trustworthiness of information systems). The attribute
of trustworthiness, whether applied to people, processes, or technologies, can be measured, at
least in relative terms if not quantitatively.48 The determination of trustworthiness plays a key role
in establishing trust relationships among persons and organizations. The trust relationships are
key factors in risk decisions made by senior leaders/executives.

2.6.1 Establishing Trust Among Organizations
Parties enter into trust relationships based on mission and business needs.49 Trust among parties
typically exists along a continuum with varying degrees of trust achieved based on a number of
factors. Organizations can still share information and obtain information technology services even
if their trust relationship falls short of complete trust. The degree of trust required for
organizations to establish partnerships can vary widely based on many factors including the
organizations involved and the specifics of the situation (e.g., the missions, goals, and objectives
of the potential partners, the criticality/sensitivity of activities involved in the partnership, the risk
tolerance of the organizations participating in the partnership, and the historical relationship
among the participants). Finally, the degree of trust among entities is not a static quality but can
vary over time as circumstances change.

47
  Transparency is achieved by providing visibility into the risk management and information security activities carried
out by organizations participating in partnerships (e.g., employing common security standards, specification language
for security controls including common controls, assessment procedures, risk assessment methodologies; defining
common artifacts and bodies of evidence used in making risk-related decisions).
48
  Current state-of-the-practice for measuring trustworthiness can reliably differentiate between widely different levels
of trustworthiness and is capable of producing a trustworthiness scale that is hierarchical between similar instances of
measuring activities (e.g., the results from ISO/IEC 15408 [Common Criteria] evaluations).
49
   Trust relationships can be: (i) formally established, for example, by documenting the trust-related information in
contracts, service-level agreements, statements of work, memoranda of agreement/understanding, or interconnection
security agreements; (ii) scalable and inter-organizational or intra-organizational in nature; and/or (iii) represented by
simple (bilateral) relationships between two partners or more complex many-to many relationships among many
diverse partners.
