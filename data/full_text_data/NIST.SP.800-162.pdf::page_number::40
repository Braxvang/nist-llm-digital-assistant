                                                                                             authoritative source(s) that are appropriate to the level of risk. Confidence in the access control decision

                                                                                             authentication processes (e.g., strength of authentication mechanism, identity vetting, credential issuance
                                                                                             and proofing, attestation, source Internet Protocol [IP] address). When adopting a risk-based approach to

                                                                                             Organizations may name attributes and attribute values differently. It may be important to implement
                                                                                             solutions that provide attribute mapping between enterprise organizations to minimize the need for a
                                                                                             special class of attributes called “enterprise attributes.” Attribute mapping serves as a translation between
                                                                                             attributes or attribute values that are named differently. For example, one organization may use the name
                                                                                             Citizenship and another may use the name Nationality to refer to the same set of attribute values.

                                                                                             In practice, cross-organizational ABAC may follow a collaborative approach outlined in Sections 3.1.3.1
                                                                                             and 3.1.3.2. This would allow each organization to make local decisions within a framework that provides
                                                                                             assurance of appropriate control between organizations. When new policies are created, if policy authors
                                                                                             create or designate their own attributes, policies may not be interoperable. Using pre-agreed attributes will
                                                                                             make the policies more uniform and easily understood.
