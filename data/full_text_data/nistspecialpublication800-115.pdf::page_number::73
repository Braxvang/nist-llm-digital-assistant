modems, with testing conducted after normal business hours to limit potential disruption to employees
and the organizationâ€™s phone system. (It should be considered, however, that many unauthorized modems
may be turned off after hours and might go undetected.) War dialing may also be used to detect fax
equipment. Testing should include all numbers that belong to an organization, except those that could be

Skills needed to conduct remote access testing include TCP/IP and networking knowledge; knowledge of
remote access technologies and protocols; knowledge of authentication and access control methods;
general knowledge of telecommunications systems and modem/PBX operations; and the ability to use
scanning and security testing tools such as war dialers.

     Most types of war dialing software allow testers to exempt specific numbers from the calling list.
