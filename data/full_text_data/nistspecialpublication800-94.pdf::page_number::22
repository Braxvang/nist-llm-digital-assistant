GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



IDPSs typically record information related to observed events, notify security administrators of important
observed events, and produce reports. Many IDPSs can also respond to a detected threat by attempting to
prevent it from succeeding. They use several response techniques, which involve the IDPS stopping the
attack itself, changing the security environment (e.g., reconfiguring a firewall), or changing the attackâ€™s
content.

IDPSs cannot provide completely accurate detection; they all generate false positives (incorrectly
identifying benign activity as malicious) and false negatives (failing to identify malicious activity). Many
organizations choose to tune IDPSs so that false negatives are decreased and false positives increased,
which necessitates additional analysis resources to differentiate false positives from true malicious events.
Most IDPSs also offer features that compensate for the use of common evasion techniques, which modify
the format or timing of malicious activity to alter its appearance but not its effect, to attempt to avoid
detection by IDPSs.

Most IDPSs use multiple detection methodologies, either separately or integrated, to provide more broad
and accurate detection. The primary classes of detection methodologies are as follows:

 Signature-based, which compares known threat signatures to observed events to identify incidents.
  This is very effective at detecting known threats but largely ineffective at detecting unknown threats
  and many variants on known threats. Signature-based detection cannot track and understand the state
  of complex communications, so it cannot detect most attacks that comprise multiple events.
 Anomaly-based detection, which compares definitions of what activity is considered normal against
  observed events to identify significant deviations. This method uses profiles that are developed by
  monitoring the characteristics of typical activity over a period of time. The IDPS then compares the
  characteristics of current activity to thresholds related to the profile. Anomaly-based detection
  methods can be very effective at detecting previously unknown threats. Common problems with
  anomaly-based detection are inadvertently including malicious activity within a profile, establishing
  profiles that are not sufficiently complex to reflect real-world computing activity, and generating
  many false positives.
 Stateful protocol analysis, which compares predetermined profiles of generally accepted definitions
  of benign protocol activity for each protocol state against observed events to identify deviations.
  Unlike anomaly-based detection, which uses host or network-specific profiles, stateful protocol
  analysis relies on vendor-developed universal profiles that specify how particular protocols should
  and should not be used. It is capable of understanding and tracking the state of protocols that have a
  notion of state, which allows it to detect many attacks that other methods cannot. Problems with
  stateful protocol analysis include that it is often very difficult or impossible to develop completely
  accurate models of protocols, it is very resource-intensive, and it cannot detect attacks that do not
  violate the characteristics of generally acceptable protocol behavior.
