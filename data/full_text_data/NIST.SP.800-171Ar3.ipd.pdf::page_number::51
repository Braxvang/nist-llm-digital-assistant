1537           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
1538           Determine if:
1539           A.03.05.05.ODP[01]: personnel or roles from whom authorization must be received to
1540           assign an identifier are defined.
1541           A.03.05.05.ODP[02]: a time period for preventing the reuse of identifiers is defined.
1542           A.03.05.05.a: authorization is received from <A.03.05.05.ODP[01]: personnel or roles> to
1543           assign an individual, group, role, service, or device identifier.
1544           A.03.05.05.b[01]: an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role, service, or device is
1545           selected.
1546           A.03.05.05.b[02]: an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role, service, or device is
1547           assigned.
1548           A.03.05.05.c: the reuse of identifiers for <A.03.05.05.ODP[02]: time period> is prevented.
1549           A.03.05.05.d: the status of each individual is uniquely identified with an identifying characteristic.
