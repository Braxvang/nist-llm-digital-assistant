Special Publication 800-85B                                 PIV Data Model Testing Specification


AS07.02.05: The keyUsage extension shall assert both the digitalSignature and
nonRepudiation bits. No other bits shall be asserted.
VE07.02.05.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the assertion of the
digitalSignature bit and the nonRepudiation bit in the keyUsage extension as part of the digital
signature certificate profile.
TE07.02.05.01: The tester shall validate the assertion of the digitalSignature bit and the
nonRepudiation bit in the keyUsage extension in the digital signature certificate issued by the
vendor.

7.2.2   Key Pair and Certificate Conformance


AS07.02.06: The size of the public key for digital signature shall be determined by the
expiration of the certificate in accordance with Table 3-1 of SP 800-78.
VE07.02.06.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the allowable public key size to
be used while generating digital signature keys.
TE07.02.06.01: The tester shall validate that the public key size is in accordance with Table 3-1
of SP80078.

AS07.02.07: The public key present in the digital signature certificate corresponds to the
digital signature private key.
No requirement for vendor.
TE07.02.07.01: The tester shall validate that the public key present in the digital signature
certificate is part of the key pair corresponding to the private key on the PIV card.

AS07.02.08: The expiration of the digital signature certificate is not beyond the expiration
of the CHUID.
No requirement for vendor.
TE07.02.08.01: The tester shall validate that the expiration of the digital signature certificate is
not beyond the expiration of the CHUID in the PIV card.

AS07.02.09: If the public key algorithm is RSA, the exponent shall be greater than or equal
to 65,537.
VE07.02.09.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the size of the exponent permitted
while generating an RSA key pair for digital signatures.
TE07.02.09.01: The tester shall validate that the RSA public key exponent size is greater than or
equal to 65,537.
