Special Publication 800-39                                         Managing Information Security Risk
                                                                   Organization, Mission, and Information System View

may or may not be the same as the system owner. A single information system may contain
information from multiple information owners/stewards. Information owners/stewards provide
input to information system owners regarding the security requirements and security controls for
the systems where the information is processed, stored, or transmitted.

D.5 SENIOR INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER
The senior information security officer is an organizational official responsible for: (i) carrying
out the chief information officer security responsibilities under FISMA; and (ii) serving as the
primary liaison for the chief information officer to the organizationâ€™s authorizing officials,
information system owners, common control providers, and information system security officers.
The senior information security officer: (i) possesses professional qualifications, including
training and experience, required to administer the information security program functions; (ii)
maintains information security duties as a primary responsibility; and (iii) heads an office with
the mission and resources to assist the organization in achieving more secure information and
information systems in accordance with the requirements in FISMA. The senior information
security officer (or supporting staff members) may also serve as authorizing official designated
representatives or security control assessors. The role of senior information security officer has
inherent U.S. Government authority and is assigned to government personnel only.

D.6 AUTHORIZING OFFICIAL
The authorizing official is a senior official or executive with the authority to formally assume
responsibility for operating an information system at an acceptable level of risk to organizational
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.71 Authorizing officials
typically have budgetary oversight for an information system or are responsible for the mission
and/or business operations supported by the system. Through the security authorization process,
authorizing officials are accountable for the security risks associated with information system
operations. Accordingly, authorizing officials are in management positions with a level of
authority commensurate with understanding and accepting such information system-related
security risks. Authorizing officials also approve security plans, memorandums of agreement or
understanding, and plans of action and milestones and determine whether significant changes in
the information systems or environments of operation require reauthorization. Authorizing
officials can deny authorization to operate an information system or if the system is operational,
halt operations, if unacceptable risks exist. Authorizing officials coordinate their activities with
the risk executive (function), chief information officer, senior information security officer,
common control providers, information system owners, information system security officers,
security control assessors, and other interested parties during the security authorization process.
With the increasing complexity of mission/business processes, partnership arrangements, and the
use of external/shared services, it is possible that a particular information system may involve
multiple authorizing officials. If so, agreements are established among the authorizing officials
and documented in the security plan. Authorizing officials are responsible for ensuring that all
activities and functions associated with security authorization that are delegated to authorizing
official designated representatives are carried out. The role of authorizing official has inherent
U.S. Government authority and is assigned to government personnel only.

   The responsibility of authorizing officials described in FIPS 200, was extended in NIST Special Publication 800-53
to include risks to other organizations and the Nation.
