NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                             Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                    Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


   1. highest_supported_security_strength = 128.
   2. Output block length (outlen) = 160 bits.
   3. Required minimum entropy for instantiation and reseed = security_strength.
   4. Seed length (seedlen) = 440 bits.
   5. Maximum number of bits per request (max_number_of_bits_per_request) = 5000 bits.
   6. Reseed interval (reseed_interval) = 100 000 requests.
   7. Maximum length of the personalization string (max_personalization_string_length) =
      512 bits.
   8. Maximum length of additional_input (max_additional_input_string_length) = 512 bits.
   9. Maximum length of entropy input (max _length) = 1000 bits.

B.1.1      Instantiation of Hash_DRBG

This implementation will return a text message and an invalid state handle (-1) when an error is
encountered. Note that the value of instantiation_nonce is an internal value that is always
available to the instantiate function.
Note that this implementation does not check the prediction_resistance_flag, since the
implementation has been designed to support prediction resistance. However, if a consuming
application actually wants prediction resistance, the implementation expects that
prediction_resistance_flag = 1 during instantiation; this will be used in the generate function in
Appendix B.1.3.
Hash_DRBG_Instantiate_function:
   Input: integer (requested_instantiation_security_strength, prediction_resistance_flag),
                    bitstring personalization_string.
   Output: string status, integer state_handle.
   Process:
                                              Comment: Check the input parameters.
        1. If (requested_instantiation_security_strength > 128), then Return (“Invalid
           requested_instantiation_security_strength”, -1).
        2. If (len (personalization_string) > 512), then Return (“Personalization_string too
           long”, -1).
                                              Comment: Set the security_strength to one of the
                                              valid security strengths.


        3. If (requested_instantiation_security_strength ≤ 112), then security_strength = 112
           Else security_strength = 128.
                                              Comment: Get the entropy_input.
