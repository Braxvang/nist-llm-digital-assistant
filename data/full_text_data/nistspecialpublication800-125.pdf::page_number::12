                                Figure 2-1. Full Virtualization Architectures



Servers are most often virtualized on computers using bare metal virtualization. Desktops are most often
virtualized on computers with hosted virtualization. In both bare metal and hosted virtualization, each
guest OS appears to have its own hardware, like a regular computer. This includes:

 CPU
 Memory
 Storage (hard disk, and possibly floppy and CD-ROM drives)
 Storage controllers
 Ethernet controllers
 Display and sound devices
 Keyboard and mouse
Many virtualization environments offer additional virtual hardware, such as USB controllers, parallel
ports for printing, and serial ports. Some hypervisors allow paravirtualization of some hardware
interfaces, most commonly the storage controller and Ethernet controllers. Some hypervisors also provide
direct memory access (DMA) to high-speed storage controllers and Ethernet controllers, if such features
are supported in the hardware CPU on which the hypervisor is running. DMA access from guest OSs can
significantly increase the speed of disk and network access, although this type of acceleration prevents
some useful virtualization features such as snapshots and moving guest OSs while they are running.

Deciding between bare metal and hosted virtualization—whether or not to have a host OS—is an
important operational and security decision. Adding a hypervisor on top of a host OS adds more
complexity and more vulnerabilities to the host. However, a hypervisor is much simpler and smaller than
a host OS, so it provides a smaller target. Choosing bare metal virtualization by replacing a host OS with
a hypervisor may improve security, depending on how well-secured the hypervisor is, while adding a
hypervisor on top of a host OS tends to increase risk. Organizations should balance security and
functionality when deciding whether or not a host OS should be used under a server or desktop
