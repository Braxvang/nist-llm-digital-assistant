APPENDIX B

GLOSSARY
COMMON TERMS AND DEFINITIONS




T       his appendix provides definitions for security terminology used within Special Publication
        800-39. The terms in the glossary are consistent with the terms used in the suite of
        FISMA-related security standards and guidelines developed by NIST. Unless otherwise
stated, all terms used in this publication are also consistent with the definitions contained in the
CNSS Instruction 4009, National Information Assurance (IA) Glossary.

 Adequate Security                      Security commensurate with the risk and magnitude of
 [OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III]     harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized
                                        access to or modification of information.
 Advanced Persistent Threat             An adversary that possesses sophisticated levels of
                                        expertise and significant resources which allow it to
                                        create opportunities to achieve its objectives by using
                                        multiple attack vectors (e.g., cyber, physical, and
                                        deception). These objectives typically include
                                        establishing and extending footholds within the
                                        information technology infrastructure of the targeted
                                        organizations for purposes of exfiltrating information,
                                        undermining or impeding critical aspects of a mission,
                                        program, or organization; or positioning itself to carry out
                                        these objectives in the future. The advanced persistent
                                        threat: (i) pursues its objectives repeatedly over an
                                        extended period of time; (ii) adapts to defendersâ€™ efforts
                                        to resist it; and (iii) is determined to maintain the level of
                                        interaction needed to execute its objectives.
 Agency                                 See Executive Agency.
 Assessment                             See Security Control Assessment.
 Assessor                               See Security Control Assessor.
 Assurance                              Measure of confidence that the security features,
 [CNSSI 4009]                           practices, procedures, and architecture of an information
                                        system accurately mediates and enforces the security
                                        policy.
 [NIST SP 800-53]                       Grounds for confidence that the set of intended security
                                        controls in an information system are effective in their
                                        application.
 Assurance Case                         A structured set of arguments and a body of evidence
 [Software Engineering Institute,       showing that an information system satisfies specific
 Carnegie Mellon University]            claims with respect to a given quality attribute.
 Authentication                         Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often
 [FIPS 200]                             as a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an
                                        information system.
