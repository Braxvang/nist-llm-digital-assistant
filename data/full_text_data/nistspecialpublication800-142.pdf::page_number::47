7.3   Cost and Practical Considerations

   The relationship between covering arrays and randomly generated tests presents some
interesting issues. Generating covering arrays for combinatorial tests is complex; it has
been shown to be an NP-hard problem. But generating tests randomly is trivial. Thus for
large problems, we can compare the cost and time of generating a covering array versus
producing tests randomly, measuring their coverage (Chapter 6), then adding tests as
needed to provide full combinatorial coverage. Notice the last column of Table 10. For 4Â­
way tests, once the number of parameters exceeds roughly 20, random generation will
cover 99% or more of 4-way combinations. If a problem requires tests for 100 parameters,
for example, covering array generators may require hours or days, or may simply be unable
to handle that many parameters, but random tests could be generated quickly and easily.
This is an option that may be cost effective even for smaller problems, and should be kept
in mind for test planning.


7.4   Chapter Summary

     1. Existing research has shown either no difference (for some problems) or higher
failure detection effectiveness (for most problems) for combinatorial testing. Analyzing
random test sets suggests a number of reasons for this result. In particular, a highly
optimized t-way covering array may include fewer t+1, t+2, and higher degree interaction
tests than an equivalent sized random test set. Similarly, a covering array algorithm that
produces a larger, sub-optimal array may provide better failure detection because the larger
array is statistically more likely to include t+1, t+2, and higher degree interaction tests as a
byproduct of the test generation.

      2. While the analysis reported here does not indicate that combinatorial testing is
uniformly better than random, it does support a preference for combinatorial methods if the
cost of applying the two test approaches is the same. This preference may be particularly
relevant if the SUT is likely to contain multiple failures (as is usually the case). Single
failures that depend on the interaction of two or more variables have a high likelihood of
being detected by random tests, because the random test set may cover a high percentage of
all t-way combinations. But the probability of detecting multiple failures declines rapidly
as cm, for c = percent coverage and m = number of independent failures.
