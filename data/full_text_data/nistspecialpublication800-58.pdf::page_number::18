 2     Overview of VOIP


        Many readers who have a good understanding of the Internet and data
        communications technology may have little background in transmitting voice or
        real-time imaging in a packet-switched environment. One of the main sources of
        confusion for those new to VOIP is the (natural) assumption that because
        digitized voice travels in packets just like other data, existing network
        architectures and tools can be used without change for voice transmission. VOIP
        adds a number of complications to existing network technology, and these
        problems are compounded by security considerations. Most of this report is
        focused on how to overcome the complications introduced by security
        requirements for VOIP.

        For several years, VOIP was a technology prospect, something on the horizon for
        the “future works” segment of telephony and networking papers. Now, however,
        telecommunications companies and other organizations have already, or are in the
        process of, moving their telephony infrastructure to their data networks. The
        VOIP solution provides a cheaper and clearer alternative to traditional PSTN
        phone lines. Although its implementation is widespread, the technology is still
        developing. It is growing rapidly throughout North America and Europe, but it is
        sometimes awkwardly implemented on most legacy networks, and often lacks
        compatibility and continuity with existing systems. Nevertheless, VOIP will
        capture a significant portion of the telephony market, given the fiscal savings and
        flexibility that it can provide.


 2.1    VOIP Equipment

        VOIP systems take a wide variety of forms. Just about any computer is capable
        of providing VOIP; Microsoft’s NetMeeting, which comes with any Windows
        platform, provides some VOIP services, as does the Apple Macintosh iChat, and
        Linux platforms have a number of VOIP applications to choose from. In general,
        though, the term Voice Over IP is associated with equipment that provides the
        ability to dial telephone numbers and communicate with parties on the other end
        of a connection who have either another VOIP system or a traditional analog
        telephone. Demand for VOIP services has resulted in a broad array of products,
        including:

        Traditional telephone handset – Usually these products have extra features beyond
        a simple handset with dial pad. Many have a small LCD screen that may provide
        browsing, instant messaging, or a telephone directory, and which is also used in
        configuring the handset to gain access to enhanced features such as conference
        calls or call-park (automatic callback when a dialed number is no longer busy).
        Some of these units may have a “base station” design that provides the same
        convenience as a conventional cordless phone.
