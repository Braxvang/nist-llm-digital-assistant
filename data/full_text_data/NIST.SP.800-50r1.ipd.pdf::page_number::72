       NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                               Building a Cybersecurity and
       August 2023                                                                                 Privacy Learning Program

2143   Learning Program Manager
2144   The people in the organization responsible for the development, procurement, integration, modification, operation,
2145   maintenance, or final disposition of the elements of the Learning Program(s). In some organizations, there will be
2146   multiple iterations of Learning Programs where cybersecurity and privacy are managed separately.

2147   Learning Program Plan
2148   A formal document that provides an overview of an agency’s cybersecurity and privacy Learning Program,
2149   including a description of the structure of the Learning Program, the resources dedicated to the Learning Program,
2150   the role of senior agency officials and staff, and the strategic goals and objectives of the Learning Program as a
2151   control planned for meeting applicable privacy requirements and managing privacy risks.

2152   literacy
2153   An individual’s familiarity with a basic set of knowledge.

2154   manageability
2155   Providing the capability for granular administration of data, including alteration, deletion, and selective disclosure.

2156   needs assessment
2157   The process of identifying gaps in learning and the needs of learning activities.

2158   predictability
2159   Enabling reliable assumptions by individuals, owners, and operators about data and their processing by a system,
2160   product, or service.

2161   privacy event
2162   The occurrence or potential occurrence of problematic data actions.

2163   privileged network account
2164   A network account with elevated privileges which is typically allocated to system administrators, network
2165   administrators, DBAs, and others who are responsible for system/application control, monitoring, or administration
2166   functions.

2167   privileged user
2168   A user who is authorized (and therefore trusted) to perform security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not
2169   authorized to perform. This may include special access to software applications or web publishing and will require
2170   additional training and the signing of an acceptable use policy. A user with a privileged account.

2171   problematic data action
2172   A data action that could cause an adverse effect for individuals.

2173   program metrics
2174   Tools designed to facilitate decision-making and improve performance and accountability through the collection,
2175   analysis, and reporting of relevant performance-related data.

2176   role-based training (RBT)
2177   A multi-step process in the Learning Program that begins with defining the significant cybersecurity or privacy work
2178   roles in the organization, as well as the personnel aligned to the designated work role. The learning material is then
2179   assigned, acquired, or developed based on the tasks necessary to perform the work role. (See the NICE Framework
2180   [3] for “work role”.)
2181            NOTE: In addition, NIST SP 800-53 control AT-3 [8] provides the following on Role-Based Training:
2182            Comprehensive role-based training addresses management, operational, and technical roles and
2183            responsibilities covering physical, personnel, and technical controls. Role-based training also includes
2184            policies, procedures, tools, methods, and artifacts for the cybersecurity and privacy roles defined.
2185            Organizations provide the training necessary for individuals to fulfill their responsibilities related to
2186            operations and supply chain risk management within the context of organizational cybersecurity and
2187            privacy programs. Role-based training also applies to contractors who provide services to federal agencies.
