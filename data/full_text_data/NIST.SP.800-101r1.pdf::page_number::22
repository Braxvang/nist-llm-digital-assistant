      Each MSC controls a set of RNCs and manages overall communications throughout the
      cellular network, including registration, authentication, location updating, handovers, and call
      routing. An MSC interfaces with the public switch telephone network (PSTN) via a Gateway
      MSC (GMSC). To perform its tasks, an MSC uses several databases. A key database is the
      central repository system for subscriber data and service information, called the Home
      Location Register (HLR). Another database used in conjunction with the HLR is the Visitor
      Location Register (VLR), which is used for mobile devices roaming outside of their service
      area. An SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) performs a similar role as that of MSC/VLR,
      but instead supports General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) (i.e., packet-switched services) to
      the Internet. Likewise, GGSN (Gateway GPRS Support Node) functionality is close to that of
      a GMSC, but for packet-switched services.

      Account information, such as data about the subscriber (e.g., a billing address), the subscribed
      services, and the location update last registered with the network are maintained at the HLR
      and used by the MSC to route calls and messages and to generate usage records called Call
      Detail Records (CDR). The subscriber account data, CDRs, and related technical information
      obtained from the network carrier are often a valuable source of evidence in an investigation
      [Con09].
