organization. The IT security function should have a mix of several IT services at various levels
(management, operational, and technical) and a service arrangement has technical, policy, cultural,
personnel, and other impacts. Therefore, managers should ensure that the service arrangement has not
negatively affected other areas while performing the service.

4.5.3    Evaluate and Evolve

The service will evolve as it matures. The monitoring and measures of the service provider and
organization will allow IT security stakeholders to evaluate the organizationâ€™s performance and seek ways
to improve, even when meeting the targets. The world of IT security services is ever changing and
security arrangements and agreements also need to change.

4.6     Phase 6: Closeout

As mentioned during the initiation phase, life cycles may overlap. As one IT security service, service
arrangement, or agreement ends, another may begin. Depending on the reason for ending a service, a
difficult management situation could exist. Exiting service providers may not always have the best
interests of the organization in mind and may not make it easy for those replacing them. Therefore, IT
security managers need to be sure to select the appropriate exit strategy and implement it well.

Figure 4-7 illustrates Phase 6, Closeout, of the IT security services life cycle.
