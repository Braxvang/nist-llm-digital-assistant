       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                        Authentication and Lifecycle Management


1063   If the authenticator output or activation secret has less than 64 bits of entropy, the verifier
1064    SHALL implement a rate-limiting mechanism that effectively limits the number of
1065   failed authentication attempts that can be made on the subscriber account as described
1066   in Sec. 5.2.2.

1067   5.1.6. Single-Factor Cryptographic Software
1068   A single-factor cryptographic software authenticator is a cryptographic key stored on
1069   disk or some other “soft” media. Authentication is accomplished by proving possession
1070   and control of the key. The authenticator output is highly dependent on the specific
1071   cryptographic protocol, but it is generally some type of signed message. The single-factor
1072   cryptographic software authenticator is something you have.

1073   5.1.6.1. Single-Factor Cryptographic Software Authenticators
1074   Single-factor cryptographic software authenticators encapsulate one or more secret keys
1075   unique to the authenticator. The key SHALL be stored in suitably secure storage available
1076   to the authenticator application (e.g., keychain storage, TPM, or TEE if available). The
1077   key SHALL be strongly protected against unauthorized disclosure by the use of access
1078   controls that limit access to the key to only those software components on the device
1079   requiring access.
1080   External cryptographic authenticators that do not meet the requirements of cryptographic
1081   hardware authenticators (e.g., that have a mechanism to allow private keys to be exported)
1082   are also considered to be cryptographic software authenticators. They SHALL meet the
1083   requirements for connected authenticators in Sec. 5.2.12.

1084   5.1.6.2. Single-Factor Cryptographic Software Veriﬁers
1085   The requirements for a single-factor cryptographic software verifier are identical to those
1086   for a single-factor cryptographic device verifier, described in Sec. 5.1.7.2.

1087   5.1.7. Single-Factor Cryptographic Devices
1088   A single-factor cryptographic device is a hardware device that performs cryptographic
1089   operations using protected cryptographic keys and provides the authenticator output
1090   via direct connection to the user endpoint. The device uses embedded symmetric or
1091   asymmetric cryptographic keys, and does not require activation through a second factor
1092   of authentication. Authentication is accomplished by proving possession of the device
1093   via the authentication protocol. The authenticator output is provided by direct connection
1094   to the user endpoint and is highly dependent on the specific cryptographic device and
1095   protocol, but it is typically some type of signed message. A single-factor cryptographic
1096   device is something you have.
