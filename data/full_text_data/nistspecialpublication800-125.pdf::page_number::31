                                                       GUIDE TO SECURITY FOR FULL VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGIES



      may also be problems with loading the guest OS (e.g., boot device errors) or communicating properly
      with the hypervisor.
 Introspection. Determine whether the virtualization solution gives the necessary capability to
  monitor security events occurring within the guest OSs. If not, deploying additional security
  monitoring, such as with security devices, may need to be added and tested before the overall system
  is deployed.
 Authentication. Authentication is required at each of the appropriate solution layers and cannot be
  readily compromised or circumvented. If token-based authentication is needed in virtualized systems,
  test whether or not the tokens work in the emulated hardware.
 Connectivity. Users can connect to all of the resources that they are permitted to and cannot connect
  to any other resources. Each traffic flow is protected, if necessary, in accordance with the
  organization’s established requirements.
 Applications. The virtualization solution does not interfere with the use of applications or servers
  within the guest OSs.
 Networking. The internal networking offered by the virtualization solution can be configured to
  conform to the organization’s security policy. This includes the ability to monitor communications
  between guest OSs and to block particular types of traffic.
 Management. Administrators can configure and manage the solution effectively and securely. This
  includes all components, including hypervisors and images.
 Performance. The solution provides adequate performance during normal and peak usage. This is
  particularly important for server virtualization and may require the use of simulated traffic generators
  to mimic the actual characteristics of expected traffic as closely as possible. Test all appropriate load
  characteristics, such as CPU, network, and storage load.
 Security of the Implementation. The virtualization implementation itself may contain vulnerabilities
  and weaknesses that attackers could exploit. Organizations with high security needs may choose to
  perform extensive vulnerability assessments against the virtualization components. At a minimum, all
  components should be updated with the latest patches and configured following sound security
  practices.
5.4     Operations and Maintenance

Operational processes that are particularly important for maintaining virtualization security, and thus
should be performed regularly, include the following:

 Administration. Being sure that only authorized administrators have physical access to the
  hypervisor hardware and logical access to the hypervisor software and host OS.
 Staying Current. Check for upgrades and patches to the hypervisor, each guest OS, the host OS (if
  relevant), and all application software running on each guest OS and the host OS. Acquire, test, and
  deploy the updates to all systems in the virtualized environment.
 Time Synchronization. Ensure that each virtualization component has its clock synched to a
  common time source so that its timestamps will match those generated by other systems. In some
  virtualization systems, guest OSs can be synchronized with the host OS. At a minimum, use the guest
  OS’s built-in time synchronization to synchronize with a reliable time server.
