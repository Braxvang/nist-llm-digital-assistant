                                                                 COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE



 Start recording all information as soon as the team suspects that an incident has occurred.
  Every step taken, from the time the incident was detected to its final resolution, should be
  documented and timestamped. Information of this nature can serve as evidence in a court of law if
  legal prosecution is pursued. Recording the steps performed can also lead to a more efficient,
  systematic, and less error-prone handling of the problem.
 Safeguard incident data. It often contains sensitive information regarding such things as
  vulnerabilities, security breaches, and users that may have performed inappropriate actions. The team
  should ensure that access to incident data is restricted properly, both logically and physically.
 Prioritize handling of the incidents based on the relevant factors. Because of resource limitations,
  incidents should not be handled on a first-come, first-served basis. Instead, organizations should
  establish written guidelines that outline how quickly the team must respond to the incident and what
  actions should be performed, based on relevant factors such as the functional and information impact
  of the incident, and the likely recoverability from the incident. This saves time for the incident
  handlers and provides a justification to management and system owners for their actions.
  Organizations should also establish an escalation process for those instances when the team does not
  respond to an incident within the designated time.
 Include provisions regarding incident reporting in the organization’s incident response policy.
  Organizations should specify which incidents must be reported, when they must be reported, and to
  whom. The parties most commonly notified are the CIO, head of information security, local
  information security officer, other incident response teams within the organization, and system
  owners.
 Establish strategies and procedures for containing incidents. It is important to contain incidents
  quickly and effectively to limit their business impact. Organizations should define acceptable risks in
  containing incidents and develop strategies and procedures accordingly. Containment strategies
  should vary based on the type of incident.
 Follow established procedures for evidence gathering and handling. The team should clearly
  document how all evidence has been preserved. Evidence should be accounted for at all times. The
  team should meet with legal staff and law enforcement agencies to discuss evidence handling, then
  develop procedures based on those discussions.
 Capture volatile data from systems as evidence. This includes lists of network connections,
  processes, login sessions, open files, network interface configurations, and the contents of memory.
  Running carefully chosen commands from trusted media can collect the necessary information
  without damaging the system’s evidence.
 Obtain system snapshots through full forensic disk images, not file system backups. Disk images
  should be made to sanitized write-protectable or write-once media. This process is superior to a file
  system backup for investigatory and evidentiary purposes. Imaging is also valuable in that it is much
  safer to analyze an image than it is to perform analysis on the original system because the analysis
  may inadvertently alter the original.
 Hold lessons learned meetings after major incidents. Lessons learned meetings are extremely
  helpful in improving security measures and the incident handling process itself.
