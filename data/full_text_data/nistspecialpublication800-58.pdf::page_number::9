      which may be used in large deployments for gateway decomposition. These
      standards may be used to ease message handling with media gateways, or on the
      other hand they can easily be used to implement terminals without any
      intelligence, similar to today’s phones connected to a PBX using a stimulus
      protocol.

      Packet networks depend for their successful operation on a large number of
      configurable parameters: IP and MAC (physical) addresses of voice terminals,
      addresses of routers and firewalls, and VOIP specific software such as call
      processing components (call managers) and other programs used to place and
      route calls. Many of these network parameters are established dynamically every
      time network components are restarted, or when a VOIP telephone is restarted or
      added to the network. Because there are so many places in a network with
      dynamically configurable parameters, intruders have a wide array of potentially
      vulnerable points to attack [1].

      Firewalls are a staple of security in today’s IP networks. Whether protecting a
      LAN or WAN, encapsulating a DMZ, or just protecting a single computer, a
      firewall is usually the first line of defense against would be attackers. Firewalls
      work by blocking traffic deemed to be invasive, intrusive, or just plain malicious
      from flowing through them. Acceptable traffic is determined by a set of rules
      programmed into the firewall by the network administrator. The introduction of
      firewalls to the VOIP network complicates several aspects of VOIP, most notably
      dynamic port trafficking and call setup procedures.

      Network Address Translation (NAT) is a powerful tool that can be used to hide
      internal network addresses and enable several endpoints within a LAN to use the
      same (external) IP address. The benefits of NATs come at a price. For one
      thing, an attempt to make a call into the network becomes very complex when a
      NAT is introduced. The situation is somewhat similar to an office building where
      mail is addressed with employees’ names and the building address, but internal
      addressing is handled by the company mailroom. There are also several issues
      associated with the transmission of voice data across the NAT, including an
      incompatibility with IPsec. Although the use of NATs may be reduced as IPv6 is
      adopted, they will remain a common component in networks for years to come, so
      VOIP systems must deal with the complexities of NATs.

      Firewalls, gateways, and other such devices can also help keep intruders from
      compromising a network. However, firewalls are no defense against an internal
      hacker. Another layer of defense is necessary at the protocol level to protect the
      voice traffic. In VOIP, as in data networks, this can be accomplished by
      encrypting the packets at the IP level using IPsec, or at the application level with
      secure RTP, the real-time transport protocol (RFC 3550). However, several
      factors, including the expansion of packet size, ciphering latency, and a lack of
      QoS urgency in the cryptographic engine itself can cause an excessive amount of
      latency in the VOIP packet delivery. This leads to degraded voice quality, again
