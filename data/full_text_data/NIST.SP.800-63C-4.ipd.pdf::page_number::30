753   considered FAL1. Likewise if a federation takes in an assertion at FAL1 but presents a
754   downstream assertion to the RP at FAL3, the entire transaction is still considered FAL1.
755   The proxy SHALL communicate this aspect to the RP either at runtime or through pre-
756   configuration as part of the trust agreement.

757   5.2. Registration
758   Within federation protocols, protocol-specific information such as cryptographic
759   keys, system identifiers, service endpoint URLs, and required access rights need to be
760   established between the IdPs and RPs, allowing them to communicate securely with each
761   other. Furthermore, subscriber-facing information such as system display names and
762   home pages can be established to facilitate trust in and usability of the system. All of this
763   information is used to digitally and programmatically establish trust between the IdP and
764   RP within the scope of the federation protocol.
765   These exchanges of information happen in a pairwise fashion for each IdP and RP
766   communicating within a federation transaction, regardless of the trust agreement
767   underlying that transaction. The two phases of this process are commonly known as
768   discovery of the IdP by the RP and registration of the RP at the IdP. These processes
769   can happen in a manual, static fashion, where system administrators or developers enter
770   the information into the target systems, or in an automated, dynamic fashion, where the
771   systems themselves exchange information without direct human involvement.
