       queries that might violate privacy or are inconsistent with the stated purpose of the
       research. However, even vetted queries may lead to unanticipated privacy risks when
       the results are released and combined with external data.
Sharing models should consider the possibility of multiple or periodic releases. Just as
repeated queries to the same dataset may leak personal data from the dataset, repeated de-
identifed releases (whether from the same dataset or from different datasets that contain
some of the same individuals) by an agency may result in compromising the privacy of in-
dividuals unless each subsequent release is viewed in light of the previous release. Even if
a contemplated release of a de-identifed dataset does not directly reveal identifying infor-
mation, federal agencies should ensure that the release – combined with previous releases
– will also not reveal identifying information [167].
Instead of sharing an entire dataset, the data owner may choose to release a sample. If
only a sample is released, the probability of re-identifcation decreases because a data in-
truder will not know whether a specifc individual from the data universe is present in the
de-identifed dataset [57]. However, releasing only a sample may decrease the statistical
power of tests on the data, may cause users to draw incorrect inferences if proper statistical
sampling methods are not used, or may not align with agency goals regarding transparency
and accountability.

3.5.   The Five Safes
Agencies should use a repeatable methodology for evaluating the terms under which data
will be made available, such as The Five Safes [42, 16]. The Five Safes was created in the
United Kingdom to assist a national statistical agency in evaluating proposed collaborative
projects with a larger research community. The framework was developed to assist in
“designing, describing and evaluating” data access systems. Here, the term “data access
system” is viewed broadly as any mechanism that allows outsiders to gain access to the
agency’s confdential data. That is, a data access system might include setting up an enclave
for academic researchers who undergo extensive background checks, but it also includes
publishing data on the internet.
The Five Safes framework derives its name from the use of fve categories (called “risk” or
“access” dimensions) that are used in the evaluation:
   1. Safe projects. Is this use of the data appropriate?
   2. Safe people. Can the researchers be trusted to use it in an appropriate manner?
   3. Safe data. Is there a disclosure risk in the data itself?
   4. Safe settings. Does the access facility limit unauthorized use?
   5. Safe outputs. Are the statistical results non-disclosive?
