â€¢    The limits of certainty 44

In particular, the limits of certainty apply to requirements and accepting the potential errors,
inconsistencies, or gaps in the completeness and coverage of those requirements. Therefore, the
requirements and associated verification and validation methods, while a necessary aspect of
demonstrating adequate security, are not sufficient to deem a system as adequately secure. The
level of confidence provided must be commensurate with the asset loss consequences addressed.
The evidence basis for demonstrating confidence must be recorded, traced, maintained, and
evolved as variances that are relevant to demonstrating adequate security occur throughout the
system life cycle. Additionally, the evidence basis must be meaningful to subject-matter experts
across the subjective, competing, and often contradicting needs and beliefs of stakeholders.

Demonstrating this justified confidence or assurance is achieved by an evidentiary basis provided
by systems analyses and other evidence-producing activities. 45 The evidentiary basis is used
within an approach for structured reasoning, as demonstrated in assurance cases (Section 4.3).
The reasoning considers the system needs and capabilities, contributing system quantitative and
qualitative factors, and how these capabilities and factors produce an evidentiary base upon
which further analyses are conducted in the context of system security. In turn, these analyses
support substantiated and reasoned conclusions that serve as the basis for consensus among
stakeholders that the system is adequately secure (Appendix F).


                 No system can provide absolute security due to the limits of human certainty,
                 the uncertainty that exists in the life cycle of every system, and the constraints
                 of cost, schedule, performance, feasibility, and practicality. As such, trade-offs
                 made routinely across contradictory, competing, and conflicting needs and
                 constraints are optimized to achieve adequate security, which reflects a decision
                 made by stakeholders.




           Systems Security Engineering
As a subdiscipline of systems engineering, systems security engineering is a transdisciplinary
and integrative approach to enabling the successful realization, use, and retirement of engineered
trustworthy secure systems. Systems security engineering employs systems, security, and other
principles and concepts, as well as scientific, technological, and management methods. Systems
security engineering ensures that these principles, concepts, methods, and practices are applied
during the system life cycle to achieve stakeholder objectives for assured trustworthiness and
asset protection despite adversity. It also helps to reduce and control the causes and conditions
that can lead to vulnerability and, as a result, reduces the effect that adversity can have on the
system.


44
   An individual function or mechanism can be verified and validated for correctness against its quality and performance attributes. Those results
help inform the determination of system security but are insufficient alone.
45
   While the evidence obtained through demonstrating compliance to a set of expectations or criteria may support judgments of adequate security,
such evidence alone does not support a claim of adequate security.
