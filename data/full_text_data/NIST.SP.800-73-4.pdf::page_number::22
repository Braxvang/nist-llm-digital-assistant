Special Publication 800-73-4      Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification â€“ Part 1: PIV
                               Card Application Namespace, Data Model and Representation

operations can be performed without requiring the PIN or OCC data again. This enables multiple
private key operations without additional cardholder consent.

3.3       Optional Data Elements

The twenty-seven optional data elements of FIPS 201, when implemented, shall conform to the
specifications provided in this document.

3.3.1      Printed Information

All FIPS 201 mandatory information printed on the card is duplicated on the chip in this data object.
The printed information data object shall not be modified post-issuance. The Security Object enforces
integrity of this information according to the issuer. This provides specific protection that the card
information must match the printed information, mitigating alteration risks on the printed media.

3.3.2      Discovery Object

The Discovery Object, if implemented, is the 0x7E interindustry ISO/IEC 7816-6 template that nests
interindustry data objects. For the Discovery Object, the 0x7E template nests two mandatory BER-
TLV structured interindustry data elements: 1) tag 0x4F contains the AID of the PIV Card
Application and 2) tag 0x5F2F lists the PIN Usage Policy.

      +    Tag 0x4F encodes the PIV Card Application AID as follows:
              {'4F 0B A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 10 00 01 00'}

      +    Tag 0x5F2F encodes the PIN Usage Policy in two bytes:
              First byte: Bit 7    is set to 1 to indicate that the mandatory PIV Card Application PIN
                                   satisfies the PIV Access Control Rules (ACRs) for command
                                   execution 6 and data object access.

                          Bit 6    indicates whether the optional Global PIN satisfies the PIV ACRs for
                                   command execution and PIV data object access.

                          Bit 5    indicates whether the optional OCC satisfies the PIV ACRs for
                                   command execution and PIV data object access

                          Bit 4    indicates whether the optional VCI is implemented

                          Bit 3    is set to zero if the pairing code is required to establish a VCI and is
                                   set to one if a VCI is established without pairing code

                          Bits 8, 2, and 1 of the first byte shall be set to zero.

              Table 1 lists the acceptable values for the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy and
              summarizes the meaning of each value.




6 Command execution pertains to the VERIFY APDU and optionally to the CHANGE REFERENCE DATA APDU.
