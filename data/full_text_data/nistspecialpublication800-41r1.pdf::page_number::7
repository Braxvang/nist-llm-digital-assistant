Executive Summary

Firewalls are devices or programs that control the flow of network traffic between networks or hosts that
employ differing security postures. At one time, most firewalls were deployed at network perimeters. This
provided some measure of protection for internal hosts, but it could not recognize all instances and forms
of attack, and attacks sent from one internal host to another often do not pass through network firewalls.
Because of these and other factors, network designers now often include firewall functionality at places
other than the network perimeter to provide an additional layer of security, as well as to protect mobile
devices that are placed directly onto external networks.

Threats have gradually moved from being most prevalent in lower layers of network traffic to the
application layer, which has reduced the general effectiveness of firewalls in stopping threats carried
through network communications. However, firewalls are still needed to stop the significant threats that
continue to work at lower layers of network traffic. Firewalls can also provide some protection at the
application layer, supplementing the capabilities of other network security technologies.

There are several types of firewalls, each with varying capabilities to analyze network traffic and allow or
block specific instances by comparing traffic characteristics to existing policies. Understanding the
capabilities of each type of firewall, and designing firewall policies and acquiring firewall technologies
that effectively address an organization’s needs, are critical to achieving protection for network traffic
flows. This document provides an overview of firewall technologies and discusses their security
capabilities and relative advantages and disadvantages in detail. It also provides examples of where
firewalls can be placed within networks, and the implications of deploying firewalls in particular
locations. The document also makes recommendations for establishing firewall policies and for selecting,
configuring, testing, deploying, and managing firewall solutions.

This document does not cover technologies that are called “firewalls” but primarily examine only
application layer activity, not lower layers of network traffic. Technologies that focus on activity for a
particular type of application, such as email firewalls that block email messages with suspicious content,
are not covered in detail in this document.

To improve the effectiveness and security of their firewalls, organizations should implement the
following recommendations:

Create a firewall policy that specifies how firewalls should handle inbound and outbound network
traffic.

A firewall policy defines how an organization’s firewalls should handle inbound and outbound network
traffic for specific IP addresses and address ranges, protocols, applications, and content types based on the
organization’s information security policies. Organizations should conduct risk analysis to develop a list
of the types of traffic needed by the organization and how they must be secured—including which types
of traffic can traverse a firewall under what circumstances. Examples of policy requirements include
permitting only necessary Internet Protocol (IP) protocols to pass, appropriate source and destination IP
addresses to be used, particular Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
ports to be accessed, and certain Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) types and codes to be used.
Generally, all inbound and outbound traffic not expressly permitted by the firewall policy should be
blocked because such traffic is not needed by the organization. This practice reduces the risk of attack and
can also decrease the volume of traffic carried on the organization’s networks.
