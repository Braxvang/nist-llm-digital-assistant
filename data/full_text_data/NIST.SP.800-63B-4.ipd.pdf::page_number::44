       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                       Authentication and Lifecycle Management


1243       • Accepting only authentication requests that come from an allowlist of IP addresses
1244         from which the subscriber has been successfully authenticated before.
1245       • Leveraging other risk-based or adaptive authentication techniques to identify user
1246         behavior that falls within, or out of, typical norms. These might, for example,
1247         include use of IP address, geolocation, timing of request patterns, or browser
1248         metadata.
1249   When the subscriber successfully authenticates, the verifier SHOULD disregard any
1250   previous failed attempts for that user from the same IP address.

1251   5.2.3. Use of Biometrics
1252   The use of biometrics (something you are) in authentication includes both measurement
1253   of physical characteristics (e.g., fingerprint, iris, facial characteristics) and behavioral
1254   characteristics (e.g., typing cadence). Both classes are considered biometric modalities,
1255   although different modalities may differ in the extent to which they establish
1256   authentication intent as described in Sec. 5.2.9.
1257   For a variety of reasons, this document supports only limited use of biometrics for
1258   authentication. These reasons include:
1259       • The biometric False Match Rate (FMR) does not provide confidence in the
1260         authentication of the subscriber by itself. In addition, FMR does not account for
1261         spoofing attacks.
1262       • Biometric comparison is probabilistic, whereas the other authentication factors are
1263         deterministic.
1264       • Biometric template protection schemes provide a method for revoking biometric
1265         credentials that is comparable to other authentication factors (e.g., PKI certificates
1266         and passwords). However, the availability of such solutions is limited, and
1267         standards for testing these methods are under development.
1268       • Biometric characteristics do not constitute secrets. They can often be obtained
1269         online or, in the case of a facial image, by taking a picture of someone with or
1270         without their knowledge. Latent fingerprints can be lifted from objects someone
1271         touches, and iris patterns can be captured with high resolution images. While
1272         presentation attack detection (PAD) technologies can mitigate the risk of these
1273         types of attacks, additional trust in the sensor or biometric processing is required
1274         to ensure that PAD is operating in accordance with the needs of the CSP and the
1275         subscriber.
1276   Therefore, the limited use of biometrics for authentication is supported with the following
1277   requirements and guidelines:
1278   Biometrics SHALL be used only as part of multi-factor authentication with a physical
1279   authenticator (something you have).
