     The CAVP and the CMVP have stimulated improved
quality and security assurance of cryptographic algorithm
implementations and modules. The latest set of statistics,
which are collected quarterly from each of the testing
laboratories, shows that 5 % (dropped from 7 % in FY 2013)
of the cryptographic algorithms and 54 % (increased from
35 % in FY 2013) of the cryptographic modules brought in
for voluntary testing had security flaws that were corrected
during testing. By the end of FY 2014, the CMVP had
validated and issued a total of 2258 cryptographic module
validation certificates that represent 5785 modules. These
modules have been developed by more than 475 domestic
and international vendors. Likewise, to date, the CAVP
has issued approximately 15 963 validations, representing                 Figure 13: CAVP Validation Status for FY 2014
the algorithm validations of approximately 17 approved
algorithms.                                                         The CAVP issued approximately 2200 algorithm
                                                               validations in FY 2014. Included in this total, is the 3000th
