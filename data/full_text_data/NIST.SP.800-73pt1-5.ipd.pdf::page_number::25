      NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1
      September 2023                                 PIV Card Application Namespace, Data Model, and Representation

656   requiring the PIN or OCC data again. This enables multiple private key operations without
657   additional cardholder consent.

658   3.3.5. Cardholder Iris Images
659   The iris images data object specifies compact images of the cardholderâ€™s irises. The images are
660   suitable for use in iris recognition systems for automated identity verification. The iris images
661   data object SHALL be encoded as specified in [SP800-76].

662   3.3.6. Biometric Information Templates Group Template
663   The Biometric Information Templates (BIT) Group data object encodes the configuration
664   information of the OCC data. The encoding of the BIT Group Template SHALL be as specified
665   in Table 7 of [SP800-76]. When OCC satisfies the PIV ACRs for PIV data objects access and
666   command execution, both the Discovery Object and the BIT Group Template data object
667   SHALL be present, and bit 5 of the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy SHALL be set. The BIT
668   Group Template MAY be present when OCC does not satisfy the PIV ACRs for PIV data objects
669   access but, if present, SHALL contain no BITs. 6 The Security Object enforces integrity of the
670   BIT Group Template data object according to the issuer.

671   3.3.7. Secure Messaging Certificate Signer
672   The Secure Messaging Certificate Signer data object, which SHALL be present if the PIV Card
673   supports secure messaging for non-card management operations, contains the certificates needed
674   to verify the signature on the secure messaging card verifiable certificate (CVC), as specified in
675   SP 800-73-5 Part 2, Section 4.1.5.
676   The public key required to verify the digital signature of the secure messaging CVC is an ECC
677   key. It SHALL be provided in either an X.509 Certificate for Content Signing or an Intermediate
678   CVC. If the public key required to verify the digital signature of the secure messaging CVC is
679   provided in an Intermediate CVC, then the format of the Intermediate CVC SHALL be as
680   specified in SP 800-73-5 Part 2, Section 4.1.5, and the public key required to verify the digital
681   signature of the Intermediate CVC SHALL be provided in an X.509 Certificate for Content
682   Signing.
683   The X.509 Certificate for Content Signing SHALL be a digital signature certificate issued under
684   the id-fpki-common-piv-contentSigning policy of [COMMON]. The X.509 Certificate for
685   Content Signing SHALL also include an extended key usage (extKeyUsage) extension asserting
686   id-PIV-content-signing. Additional descriptions for the PIV object identifiers are provided in
687   Appendix B of FIPS 201-3. The X.509 Certificate for Content Signing needed to verify the
688   digital signature of a secure messaging CVC or Intermediate CVC of a valid PIV Card 7 SHALL
689   NOT be expired.



      6
          A BIT Group Template with no BITs is encoded as '7F 61 03 02 01 00'.
      7
          A valid PIV Card is defined as a PIV Card that is neither expired nor revoked.
