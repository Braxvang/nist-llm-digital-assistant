able to distinguish among secure, insecure, and indeterminate states and to keep the system
operating in secure states by applying the principles of Protective Failure and Protective
Recovery.

System states may be secure states (i.e., what states are desired and allowed) and insecure states
(i.e., what states are not desired nor allowed). Ideally, a secure system is a system that begins
execution in a secure state and does not transition to an insecure state. That is, every state
transition results in the same or another secure state. Each state transition must also be secure.
Figure 5 illustrates a subset of these idealized secure system state transitions.

Protective failure requires the ability to (1) detect that the system is in an insecure state and (2)
detect a transition that will place the system into an insecure state for the purposes of responding
to avoid the propagation of new failure. Protective failure calls for responsive and corrective
actions, including (when needed) transitioning to a secure halt state with a protected recovery to
allow for the continuation of operations in a reconstituted, reconfigured, or alternative secure
operational mode. Other stakeholder objectives may necessitate the continuation of operations in
a less-than-fully-secure state and should be reflected as necessary in such things as policy and
requirements (Section C.3).

Protective recovery requires the ability to take reactive, responsive, or corrective action to
securely transition from an insecure state to a secure state (or a less insecure state). The secure
state achieved after completing protective recovery actions includes those actions that limit or
prevent any further state transition and those that constitute a type of degraded capability, mode,
or operation.
