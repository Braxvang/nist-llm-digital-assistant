PL-2   PLAN PROJECT AND TECHNICAL MANAGEMENT
       PL-2.1 Define and maintain the security aspects of a project schedule based on management
              and technical objectives, and work estimates.
       Note: This includes security aspects that impact the definition of the duration, relationship,
       dependencies, and sequence of activities; achievement milestones; resources employed;
       reviews (including security subject matter expertise employed); and schedule reserves for
       security risk management necessary to achieve timely completion of the project.
       PL-2.2 Define the security aspects of achievement criteria for the life cycle decision gates,
              delivery dates, and major dependencies on external inputs and outputs.
       Note: This includes the criteria defined by regulatory, certification, evaluation, and other
       approval authorities.
       PL-2.3 Define the security aspects of project performance criteria.
       PL-2.4 Define the security-relevant project costs, and plan the budget.
       PL-2.5 Define the security-relevant roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, and authorities.
       Note: This includes defining the project organization, staff acquisitions, and development of
       staff security-relevant skills. Authorities include legally responsible roles and individuals, as
       appropriate. These security-relevant authorities include security design authorization, security
       test and operation authorization, and the award of certification, accreditation, or authorization.
       PL-2.6 Define the security aspects of the infrastructure and services required.
       Note: This includes defining the capacity needed for security infrastructure and services, its
       availability, and its allocation to project tasks. Security infrastructure includes facilities (e.g.,
       Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities [SCIFs] and isolated networks), specific strength
       of mechanism mediated access, cross-domain solutions, tools, communication, and information
       technology assets.
       PL-2.7 Plan the security aspects of acquiring materials and enabling system services supplied
              from outside of the project.
       PL-2.8 Generate and communicate a plan for the security aspects of project and technical
              management and execution, including security reviews that address security
              considerations.
       Note: Security considerations and the planning to address those considerations are captured in a
       Systems Engineering Management Plan, Software Engineering Management Plans, and similar
       plans.
