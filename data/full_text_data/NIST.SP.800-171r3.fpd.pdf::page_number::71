2059   3.15.3. Rules of Behavior
2060             REQUIREMENT: 03.15.03
2061             a. Establish and provide to individuals requiring access to the system, rules that describe their
2062                responsibilities and expected behavior for handling CUI and system usage.
2063             b. Receive a documented acknowledgement from individuals indicating that they have read,
2064                understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior before authorizing access to CUI
2065                and the system.
2066             c.   Review and update the rules of behavior periodically.

2067             DISCUSSION
2068             Rules of behavior represent a type of access agreement for system users. Organizations consider
2069             rules of behavior for the handling of CUI based on individual user roles and responsibilities and
2070             differentiate between rules that apply to privileged users and rules that apply to general users.

2074           System and Services Acquisition

2075   3.16.1. Acquisition Process
2076             REQUIREMENT: 03.16.01
2077             Include the following security requirements, explicitly or by reference, in the acquisition contract
2078             for the system, system component, or system service: [Assignment: organization-defined
2079             security requirements].

2080             DISCUSSION
2081             Security requirements include security functional and security assurance requirements. Security
2082             functional requirements are typically derived from mission or business requirements as well as
2083             requirements stated in laws, regulations, policies, and standards. The derived requirements can
2084             include security capabilities, functions, and mechanisms. Assurance requirements can include
2085             development processes, procedures, methodologies, and the evidence from development and
2086             assessment activities that provide grounds for confidence that the required functionality is
2087             implemented and possesses the required strength of mechanism. Strength of mechanism
2088             requirements associated with such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include degree of
2089             correctness, completeness, resistance to tampering or bypass, and resistance to direct attack.
2090             This requirement is related to 03.16.03 and 03.17.02.
