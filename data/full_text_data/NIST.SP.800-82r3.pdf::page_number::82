4.3.7. Monitor
The Monitor step continuously tracks changes to the system that may affect controls and assesses
control effectiveness. NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 2 provides guidance on cybersecurity continuous
monitoring [SP800-37r2].
Table 12 provides additional details on applying the Monitor step to OT.
