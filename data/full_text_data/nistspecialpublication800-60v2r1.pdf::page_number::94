Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: While, in many cases, unauthorized disclosure of
funds control information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or
individuals, the potential for serious harm is such that the provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for funds control information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Funds control
activities are not generally time-critical. An accumulation of small changes to data or deletion of
small entries can result in budget shortfalls or cases of excessive obligations or disbursements.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: In most cases, the adverse effects of consequent negative
publicity on mission functions, image or public confidence in the agency can be serious.
Therefore, the provisional integrity impact level recommended for funds control information is
moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the funds control information. Funds
control processes are generally tolerant of delay. Typically, disruption of access to funds control
information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
funds control information is low.
C.3.2.4 Accounting Information Type

Accounting entails accounting for assets, liabilities, fund balances, revenues and expenses
associated with the maintenance of Federal funds and expenditure of Federal appropriations
(Salaries and Expenses, Operation and Maintenance, Procurement, Working Capital, Trust
Funds, etc.), in accordance with applicable Federal standards (FASAB, Treasury, OMB, GAO,
etc.). The recommended security categorization for the accounting information type is as
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of accounting
information on the abilities of government agencies to maintain Federal funds and expenditure of
Federal appropriations in accordance with applicable Federal standards. Unauthorized disclosure
of accounting information for programs that process classified or high-impact information can
give adversaries damaging insights into details of agency plans, priorities, and operations. In
most cases, unauthorized disclosure of accounting information will have only a limited adverse
effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. (Classified programs and systems are outside
the scope of this guideline.)
