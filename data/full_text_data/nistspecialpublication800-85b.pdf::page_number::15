3.    Test Methodology


3.1   Derived Test Requirements
DTRs show the type of tests required based on the normative specifications in FIPS201 and
supporting special publications. These specifications cover expected data object representations
and content. Each DTR consists of the following:

Actual condition statements taken/derived from the specification — these include conditions
for successful command execution for each command as well as exception behaviors explicitly
specified by statements using the words “shall,” “must,” and other normative delimiters in the
standard. The condition statements are identified by codes starting with ‘AS’ followed by a
running sequence.
Required Vendor Information — these include information that the vendors (could also be
agencies or integrators) are mandated to provide in their documentation. The Required Vendor
Information is identified by codes starting with ‘VE’ followed by a running sequence.
Required Test Procedures — these are actions that the tester has to perform in order to satisfy
the requirements stated in actual condition statements. These include verifying the information
mandated in the “Required Vendor Information” for the condition as well as performing
software-based tests. Some of the required test procedures do not call explicitly for verification
of information in the associated “Required Vendor Information.” In these instances it is
implicitly assumed that such information is provided by the vendor and verified by the tester.
The Required Test Procedures are identified by codes starting with ‘TE’ followed by a running
sequence that denotes the section in this document where they occur.
Validation of some DTRs are not covered by the test assertions provided in this document.
These DTRs require compliance of a component with an external specification or standard such
as EFTS. No required test procedures are provided for these DTRs, and a note is added to
indicate that “this assertion is externally tested.” The tester is required to check the vendor
documentation for claimed compliance with such requirements or confirm the presence of an
external test/compliance certificate obtained from the test organization, when applicable.

In some instances, testing of DTRs may not be feasible using the test methodologies described in
this document. For example, a test tool built on these methods cannot test the procedure by
which fingerprints are taken at an agency PIV installation. Most of these DTRs, however, can be
tested by inspection of the system description document. Where this is the case, an adequate
description is generally required by the VE section of the DTR. Where testing is not feasible, a
note is added to indicate that “this assertion is not separately tested.”


3.2   Test Assertions
Test assertions are statements of behavior, action, or condition that can be measured or tested.
They provide the procedures to guide the tester in executing and managing the test. They
