                                                      GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



7.      Using Data from Applications

Applications such as e-mail, Web browsers, and word processors are what make computers valuable to
users. OSs, files, and networks are all needed to support applications: OSs to run the applications,
networks to send application data between systems, and files to store application data, configuration
settings, and logs. From a forensic perspective, applications bring together files, OSs, and networks.
This section describes application architectures—the components that typically make up applications—
and provides insights into the types of applications that are most often the focus of forensics. The section
also provides guidance on collecting, examining, and analyzing application data.

7.1     Application Components

All applications contain code in the form of executable files (and related files, such as shared code
libraries) or scripts. In addition to code, many applications have one or more of the following
components: configuration settings, authentication, logs, data, and supporting files. Sections 7.1.1
through 7.1.5 describe these components in detail, and Section 7.1.6 discusses the major types of
application architectures, which relate to the intended distribution of the major components.

7.1.1     Configuration Settings

Most applications allow users or administrators to customize certain aspects of the application’s behavior
by altering configuration settings. From a forensics perspective, many settings are trivial (e.g., specifying
background colors), but others might be very important, such as the host and directory where data files
and logs are stored or the default username. Configuration settings may be temporary—set dynamically
during a particular application session—or permanent. Many applications have some settings that apply
to all users, and also support some user-specific settings. Configuration settings may be stored in several
ways, including the following:

      ! Configuration File. Applications may store settings in a text file or a file with a proprietary
        binary format.114 Some applications require the configuration file to be on the same host as the
        application, whereas other applications allow configuration files to be located on other hosts. For
        example, an application might be installed on a workstation, but the configuration file for a
        particular user could be stored on the user’s home directory on a file server.
      ! Runtime Options. Some applications permit certain configuration settings to be specified at
        runtime through the use of command-line options. For example, the UNIX e-mail client mutt has
        options for specifying the location of the mailbox to open and the location of the configuration
        file. Identification of the options being used for an active session is OS- and application-specific;
        possible identification methods include reviewing the list of active OS processes, examining an
        OS history file, and reviewing an application log. Runtime options can also be specified in icons,
        startup files, batch files, and other ways.
      ! Added to Source Code. Some applications that make source code available (e.g., open source
        applications, scripts) actually place user or administrator-specified configuration settings directly
        into the source code. If the application is then compiled (e.g., converted from human-readable
        code to a binary, machine-readable format), the configuration settings may actually be contained
        within executable files, potentially making the settings far more difficult to access than if they
        were specified in configuration files or as runtime options. In some cases, the settings can be
        found by searching for text strings within the executable files.
114
      For example, on Windows systems, many configuration settings are stored in the Windows registry, which is essentially a
      set of large configuration files.
