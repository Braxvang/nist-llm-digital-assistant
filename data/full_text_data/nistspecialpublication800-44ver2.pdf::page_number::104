                                                                  GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



9.1.5     Automated Log File Analysis Tools

Most public Web servers receive significant amounts of traffic, and the log files quickly become
voluminous. Automated log analysis tools should be installed to ease the burden on the Web server
administrator. These tools analyze the entries in the Web server log files and identify suspicious and
unusual activity. As mentioned in Section 9.1.2, some organizations use SIEM software for centralized
logging, which can also perform automated log file analysis.

Many commercial and public domain tools are available to support regular analysis of Transfer Logs.
Most operate on either the common or the combined log formats. These tools can identify IP addresses
that are the source of high numbers of connections and transfers.

Error Log tools indicate not only errors that may exist within available Web content (such as missing
files) but also attempts to access nonexistent URLs. Such attempts could indicate the following:

 Probes for the existence of vulnerabilities to be used later in launching an attack

 Information gathering

 Interest in specific content, such as databases.

The automated log analyzer should forward any suspicious events to the responsible Web server
administrator or security incident response team as soon as possible for follow-up investigation. Some
organizations may wish to use two or more log analyzers, which will reduce the risk of missing an
attacker or other significant events in the log files [NIST06b].

9.2     Web Server Backup Procedures

One of the most important functions of a Web server administrator is to maintain the integrity of the data
on the Web server. This is important because Web servers are often some of the most exposed and vital
servers on an organization’s network. There are two principal components to backing up data on a Web
server: regular backup of the data and OS on the Web server, and maintenance of a separate protected
authoritative copy of the organization’s Web content.

9.2.1     Web Server Backup Policies and Strategies

The Web server administrator needs to perform backups of the Web server on a regular basis for several
reasons. A Web server could fail as a result of a malicious or unintentional act or a hardware or software
failure. In addition, Federal agencies and many other organizations are governed by regulations on the
backup and archiving of Web server data. Web server data should also be backed up regularly for legal
and financial reasons.

All organizations need to create a Web server data backup policy. Three main factors influence the
contents of this policy:

 Legal requirements

       Applicable laws and regulations (Federal, state, and international)

       Litigation requirements

 Mission requirements
