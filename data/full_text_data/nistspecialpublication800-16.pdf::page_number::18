Information Technology Security Training Requirements


        Second, the critical differences between "Training" and "Education" are often
        overlooked. "Education" is clearly identified in this new model as a separate learning
        level, while recognizing that the education level's applicability is limited to an
        organization's designated IT security specialists.    Providing formal education to this
        group is outside the purview of most Federal agency training programs     —with some
        notable exceptions among national security-related agencies. This document takes the
        view that education (as distinguished from training) eind associated on-the-job experience
        are essential for IT security specialists to be able to fulfill their roles in an effective
        manner. The provision of specific criteria for the education level is beyond the scope of
        NIST's mandate and, therefore, is beyond the scope of this document.

    •   Provides an integrated framework (planning tool) to identify training needs
        throughout the workforce and ensure that everyone receives appropriate training.

        The model presented in this document relates job function to required IT security
        knowledge. This allows managers to identify the training needed to fulfill their FT
        security responsibilities, to understand the consequences of denying or deferring training,
        and to plan and schedule training according to organizational priorities.

    •   Provides a course development tool.


        Course developers can readily identify the learning outcomes expected for individuals in
        various roles with varying responsibilities. This will facilitate the development of IT
        security course material targeted to the needs of the Federal workforce and will encourage
        the development of "plug and play" training modules that can be readily customized or
        adapted to an organization's needs.


    •   Provides a structure for evaluating learning effectiveness.


        Providing training to individuals does not necessarily ensure that learning has occurred.
        Learning can best be demonstrated by subsequent on-the-job performance. This
        document's learning objectives are designed to be performance-based, rather than
        content-based, and to provide benchmarks for evaluating learning effectiveness. Further,
        this document requires evaluation as a component of an organization's IT security
        training program and provides an evaluation planning process and a discussion of levels
        of evaluation.


    •   Is extensible.


        This document is intended to be issued in looseleaf format for extensibility and ease of
        updating.   It is designed to   be used as a "living" handbook and reference, with evolving
