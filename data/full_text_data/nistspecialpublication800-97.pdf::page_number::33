                                           ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



enhanced security over the flawed WEP. Most large enterprise deployments of RSN technology will use
IEEE 802.1X and EAP rather than PSKs because of the difficulty of managing PSKs on numerous
devices. WLAN connections employing ad hoc mode, which typically involve only a few STAs, are
more likely to use PSKs. The RSN security architecture and RSNAs are discussed in detail in Section 4.

This section provides a brief introduction to the IEEE 802.1X standard, which is specified by the IEEE
802.11i amendment. Two components defined in IEEE 802.1X are relied upon for the establishment of
RSNAs: authentication servers and IEEE 802.1X port-based access control. The IEEE 802.1X standard
provides a framework for access control that leverages EAP to provide centralized, mutual authentication.
IEEE 802.1X was originally developed for wired LANs to prevent unauthorized use in open
environments such as university campuses, but it has been used by IEEE 802.11i for WLANs as well.
The IEEE 802.1X framework provides the means to block user access until authentication is successful,
thereby controlling access to WLAN resources.

The IEEE 802.1X standard defines several terms related to authentication. The authenticator is an entity
at one end of a point-to-point LAN segment that facilitates authentication of the entity attached to the
other end of that link. For example, the AP in Figure 3-2 serves as an authenticator. The supplicant is the
entity being authenticated. The STA may be viewed as a supplicant. 21 The authentication server (AS) is
an entity that provides an authentication service to an authenticator. This service determines from the
credentials provided by the supplicant whether the supplicant is authorized to access the services provided
by the authenticator. The AS provides these authentication services and delivers session keys to each AP
in the wireless network; each STA either receives session keys from the AS or derives the session keys
itself. The AS either authenticates the STA and AP itself, or provides information to the STA and AP so
that they may authenticate each other. The AS typically lies inside the DS, as depicted in Figure 3-2.
When employing a solution based on the IEEE 802.11i standard, the AS most often used for
authentication is an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server that uses the Remote
Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) 22 or Diameter 23 protocol to transport authentication-
related traffic. This is discussed further in Section 4. The supplicant/authenticator model is intrinsically a
unilateral rather than mutual authentication model: the supplicant authenticates to the network. IEEE
802.11i combats this bias by requiring that the EAP method used provides mutual authentication.




21
     In ad hoc mode, the STA and AP of the IBSS must implement both supplicant and authenticator.
22
     RADIUS is an IP-based protocol that facilitates the centralized management of authentication, authorization, and accounting
     (AAA) data. For more information on RADIUS, see RFC 2865, RADIUS, at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2865.txt, and RFC
     2869, RADIUS Extensions, at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2869.txt.
23
     Diameter is specified in RFC 3588, Diameter Base Protocol, available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3588.txt. Like
     RADIUS, Diameter provides an AAA framework for applications such as network access.
