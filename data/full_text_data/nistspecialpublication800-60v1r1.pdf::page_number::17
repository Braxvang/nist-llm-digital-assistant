3.0 SECURITY CATEGORIZATION OF INFORMATION AND
    INFORMATION SYSTEMS
Federal Information Processing Standard 199 (FIPS 199), Standards for Security Categorization
of Federal Information and Information Systems, defines the security categories, security
objectives, and impact levels to which SP 800-60 maps information types. FIPS 199 establishes
security categories based on the magnitude of harm expected to result from compromises rather
than on the results of an assessment that includes an attempt to determine the probability of
compromise. FIPS 199 also describes the context of use for this guideline. Some of the content
of FIPS 199 is included in this section in order to simplify the use of this guideline.

3.1 Security Categories and Objectives
3.1.1     Security Categories

FIPS 199 establishes security categories for both information 6 and information systems. The
security categories are based on the potential impact on an organization should certain events
occur. The potential impacts could jeopardize the information and information systems needed
by the organization to accomplish its assigned mission, protect its assets, fulfill its legal
responsibilities, maintain its day-to-day functions, and protect individuals. Security categories
are to be used in conjunction with vulnerability and threat information in assessing the risk to an
organization.
FIPS 199 establishes three potential levels of impact (low, moderate, and high) relevant to
securing Federal information and information systems for each of three stated security objectives
(confidentiality, integrity, and availability).

3.1.2     Security Objectives and Types of Potential Losses

As reflected in Table 1, FISMA and FIPS 199 define three security objectives for information
and information systems.
                       Table 1: Information and Information System Security Objectives
       Security
                           FISMA Definition [44 U.S.C., Sec. 3542]                     FIPS 199 Definition
      Objectives
    Confidentiality   “Preserving authorized restrictions on information      A loss of confidentiality is the
                      access and disclosure, including means for protecting   unauthorized disclosure of
                      personal privacy and proprietary information…”          information.
    Integrity         “Guarding against improper information                  A loss of integrity is the unauthorized
                      modification or destruction, and includes ensuring      modification or destruction of
                      information non-repudiation and authenticity…”          information.
    Availability      “Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of      A loss of availability is the disruption
                      information…”                                           of access to or use of information or
                                                                              an information system.

  Information is categorized according to its information type. An information type is a specific category of
information (e.g., privacy, medical, proprietary, financial, investigative, contractor sensitive, security
management) defined by an organization or, in some instances, by a specific law, Executive Order, directive,
policy, or regulation.
