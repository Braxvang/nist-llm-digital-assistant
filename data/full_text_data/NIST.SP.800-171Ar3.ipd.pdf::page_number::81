2617             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
2618             Determine if:
2619             A.03.14.01.ODP[01]: time period within which to install security-relevant software
2620             updates after the release of the updates is defined.
2621             A.03.14.01.ODP[02]: time period within which to install security-relevant firmware
2622             updates after the release of the updates is defined.
2623             A.03.14.01.a[01]: system flaws are identified.
2624             A.03.14.01.a[02]: system flaws are reported.
2625             A.03.14.01.a[03]: system flaws are corrected.
2626             A.03.14.01.b[01]: security-relevant software updates are installed within <A.03.14.01.ODP[01]:
2627             time period> of the release of the updates.
2628             A.03.14.01.b[02]: security-relevant firmware updates are installed within <A.03.14.01.ODP[02]:
2629             time period> of the release of the updates.

2630             ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
2631             Examine
2632             [SELECT FROM: system and information integrity policy and procedures; procedures for flaw
2633             remediation; procedures for configuration management; list of recent security flaw remediation
2634             actions performed on the system; list of flaws and vulnerabilities that may potentially affect the
2635             system; test results from the installation of software and firmware updates to correct system
