5 Secure/Multipart Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)
5.1 Description
Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) provides a consistent way to
send and receive secure Internet mail. S/MIME is a set of specifications that are defined
by a series of IETF RFCs, namely [RFC 5751], [RFC 5652], [RFC 2045], [RFC 2046],
[RFC 2047], [RFC 4288], [RFC 4289] and [RFC 2049]. S/MIME provides the following
cryptographic security services for electronic messaging applications:

      Authentication of a sending party using digital signatures,
      Message integrity and non-repudiation of origin using digital signatures, and
      Confidentiality using encryption.

S/MIME, therefore, requires a suite of algorithms for creating digital signatures,
generating hash values, establishing keys and encrypting the content of the e-mail, as
well as some means of establishing and sharing digital identities. Federal
implementations rely on a public key infrastructure, specifically X.509 PKI, to establish
S/MIME user identities, to bind those identities to the user’s public key through public
key certificates, to provide digital signatures, to provide keys to be used for content
encryption, or to establish symmetric keys for use on a per message basis. For detailed
information on PKIs, see Section 2 of this Recommendation.

Stored electronic mail encompasses key management issues associated with encrypted
file integrity and with transmission over a network. It is therefore necessary 1) to
establish pair-wise and/or multicast (sent to more than one recipient) key management
relationships between the sender and receiver(s) and 2) to securely store the key(s)
associated with encrypted e-mail until it is no longer necessary for a recipient to be able
to decrypt or verify the integrity of the e-mail.

S/MIME is not restricted to e-mail; it can be used with any transport mechanism that
employs MIME protocols, such as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).


5.2 Security and Compliance Issues
S/MIME products can be implemented with different combinations of security features
and a variety of cryptographic algorithms. Senders and receivers may have different
capabilities and may be sending messages protected with algorithms of different
strengths. This can lead to numerous interoperability issues. Federal clients using secure
e-mail shall be able to perform the following:

      Send and receive signed messages,
      Send and receive encrypted messages,
