       electrical generators will be required. Costs for these include fuel, fuel storage
       facilities, and cost of fuel disposal at end of storage life.

 3.7   Quality of Service Implications for Security

       The strict performance requirements of VOIP have significant implications for
       security, particularly denial of service (DoS) issues [14]. VOIP-specific attacks
       (i.e., floods of specially crafted SIP messages) may result in DoS for many VOIP-
       aware devices. For example, SIP phone endpoints may freeze and crash when
       attempting to process a high rate of packet traffic SIP proxy servers also may
       experience failure and intermittent log discrepancies with a VOIP-specific
       signaling attack of under 1Mb/sec. In general, the packet rate of the attack may
       have more impact than the bandwidth; i.e., a high packet rate may result in a
       denial of service even if the bandwidth consumed is low.
