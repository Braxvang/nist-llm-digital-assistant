       NIST SP 800-63C-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                                      Federation and Assertions


1251    11. FAL: An indicator of the IdP’s intended FAL of the federation process represented
1252        by the assertion.
1253   If the assertion is used at FAL3 with a bound authenticator as described in Sec. 6.1.2, the
1254   assertion SHALL include the following:
1255      1. Authenticator binding: The public key, key identifier, or other identifier of
1256         subscriber-held bound authenticator (for IdP-managed bound authenticators) or
1257         indicator that an RP-managed bound authenticator is required for verification of this
1258         assertion.
1259   Assertions MAY also include additional items, including the following information:
1260      1. Attribute values and derived attribute values: Information about the subscriber.
1261      2. Attribute metadata: Additional information about one or more subscriber attributes,
1262         such as those described in NIST Internal Report 8112 [NISTIR8112].
1263   Assertions SHOULD specify the AAL when an authentication event is being asserted and
1264   IAL when identity proofed attributes (or values derived from those attributes) are being
1265   asserted.
1266   All metadata within the assertion SHALL be validated by the RP upon receipt:
1267       • Issuer verification: ensuring the assertion was issued by the IdP the RP expects it to
1268         be from.
1269       • Signature validation: ensuring the signature of the assertion is valid and
1270         corresponds to a key belonging to the IdP sending the assertion.
1271       • Time validation: ensuring the expiration and issue times are within acceptable limits
1272         of the current timestamp.
1273       • Audience restriction: ensuring this RP is the intended recipient of the assertion.
1274   An RP SHALL treat subject identifiers as not inherently globally unique. Instead, the
1275   value of the assertion’s subject identifier is usually in a namespace under the assertion
1276   issuer’s control. This allows an RP to talk to multiple IdPs without incorrectly conflating
1277   subjects from different IdPs.
1278   Assertions MAY include additional attributes about the subscriber. Section 6.2.3 contains
1279   privacy requirements for presenting attributes in assertions. The RP MAY be given
1280   limited access to an identity API as discussed in Sec. 6.3 along with the assertion, which
1281   the RP can use to fetch additional identity attributes for the subscriber.
1282   Although details vary based on the exact federation protocol in use, an assertion
1283   represents a discrete login event to the RP. The validity time window of an assertion
1284   is related to but separate from any session management at the IdP or RP. Specifically,
1285   an assertion is created during an authenticated session at the IdP, and processing an

                                                    35
