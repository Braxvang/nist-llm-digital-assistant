Message digest           The result of applying a hash function to a message. Also
                         known as a “hash value” or “hash output”.
Preimage                 A message X that produces a given message digest when it is
                         processed by a hash function.
Preimage resistance      An expected property of a hash function such that, given a
                         randomly chosen message digest, message_digest, it is
                         computationally infeasible to find a preimage of the
                         message_digest, See “Preimage”.
Random bit               A bit for which an attacker has exactly a 50% probability of
                         success of guessing the value of the bit as either a zero or one. It
                         is also called an unbiased bit.
Random bit generator     A device or algorithm that can produce a sequence of bits that
                         appear to be both statistically independent and unbiased.
Randomized hashing       A process by which the input to a hash function is randomized
                         before being processed by the hash function.
Random number            A value in a set of numbers that has an equal probability of
                         being selected from the total population of possibilities and, in
                         that sense, is unpredictable. A random number is an instance of
                         an unbiased random variable, that is, the output produced by a
                         uniformly distributed random process. Random numbers may,
                         e.g., be obtained by converting suitable stings of random bits
                         (see [SP 800-90A], Appendix B.5 for details).
Second preimage          A message X’, that is different from a given message X , such
                         that its message digest is the same as the known message digest
                         of X.
Second preimage          An expected property of a hash function whereby it is
resistance               computationally infeasible to find a second preimage of a
                         known message digest, See “Second preimage”.
Secret keying material   The binary data that is used to form secret keys, such as AES
                         encryption or HMAC keys.
Security strength        A number associated with the amount of work (that is, the
(Also “bits of           number of operations) that is required to break a cryptographic
security”)               algorithm or system. If 2N execution operations of the algorithm
                         (or system) are required to break the cryptographic algorithm,
                         then the security strength is N bits.

Shall                    Used to indicate a requirement of this Recommendation.
Shared secret            A secret value that has been computed using a key agreement
                         algorithm and is used as input to a key derivation function.
