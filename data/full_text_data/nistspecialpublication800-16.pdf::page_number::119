       INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING MATRIX                             — Cell 3.2B
 Training Area: System Life Cycle Security             — Development
 Functional Specialty: Acquire

 Definition   —         The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an FT system
                        from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                        model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                        Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                        ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                        needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                        The development phase is the series of steps followed to ensure that
                        security requirements are considered, resolved, and incorporated as
                        information systems and technologies are developed or changed.

 Behavioral Outcome         —   Individuals with acquisition responsibilities are able to monitor
                                procurement actions to ensure that IT security requirements are
                                satisfied.
