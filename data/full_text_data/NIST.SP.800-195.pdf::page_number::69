(OMB) requirements, CSD developed SP 800-63, Electronic
Authentication Guideline. OMB defines four levels of
assurance that a federal agency must select, based on a risk
assessment to determine the impact of an authentication
failure. This guideline covers remote authentication of users
(such as private individuals) interacting with government IT
systems over the Internet. It defines technical requirements
for each of the four levels of assurance in the areas of identity
proofing, authenticators, credential binding, management
processes, authentication protocols and federation. The
