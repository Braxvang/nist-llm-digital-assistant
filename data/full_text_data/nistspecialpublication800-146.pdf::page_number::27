                                                           CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS




                                    Figure 5: On-site Community Cloud

In Figure 5 it is easy to see that the access policy of a community cloud may be complex: if there are N
community members, a decision must be made, either implicitly or explicitly, on how to share a member's
local cloud resources with each of the other members. A number of policy specification techniques (e.g.,
discretionary access control using a standard such as XACML [Mos05], or following a security model
such as role-based access control [Fer92] or attribute-based access control [Kar09]) might be used to
express sharing policies. Besides controlling access to resources, identity management [Oid11, Rag08,
Oix10] is important in this scenario since clients from multiple participant organizations access a common
pool of resources.

As with the on-site private cloud and the outsourced private cloud, although the general statements remain
true for the on-site community scenario, the on-site community cloud scenario also allows for a more
detailed understanding of some of the general statements as well as additional statements that
organizations considering the use of an on-site community cloud should consider:

ÔÅÆ Network Dependency (on-site community). As with the on-site private scenario, where the
  organization spans multiple sites, the consumers in an on-site community cloud need to either
  provision controlled inter-site communication links or use cryptography over a less controlled
  communications media (such as the public Internet). The reliability and security of the community
  cloud will depend on the reliability and security of the communication links. Dedicated leased
  network connections can also be used to support enhanced performance, reliability, and security. In
  the on-site community case, in addition, care should be taken to understand the actual dependencies
  between member organizations since there are multiple organizations participating and any subset of
  them could suffer a cloud infrastructure failure (e.g., going offline). Additionally, local clouds will
