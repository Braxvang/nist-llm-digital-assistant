Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Very sensitive information is
typically personal information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974. (The Privacy Act Information
provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication
information type.) Such information will often be assigned a moderate confidentiality impact
level. Some information associated with investigative services may be particularly sensitive and
require a high confidentiality impact level.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for central personnel management information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of undetected unauthorized modification or destruction of central personnel
management information can conceivably disrupt central personnel management operations (e.g.,
(e.g., by modifying sensitive private personal information or compromising confidentiality
mechanisms).

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external publication of central
personnel management information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect
public confidence in the government. However, damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
central personnel management information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the central personnel management
information. Central personnel management processes are generally tolerant of reasonable
delays. In most cases, disruption of access to central personnel management information can be
expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
central personnel management information is low.
C.2.8.6 Taxation Management Information Type

Taxation Management includes activities associated with the implementation of the Internal
Revenue Code and the collection of taxes in the United States and abroad. The recommended
security categorization for the taxation management information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of taxation management
information on the ability of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to enforce the Internal Revenue
