disruptions in network communications. Prevention capabilities are most often used for NBA sensors
when blocking a specific known threat, such as a new worm.

6.3     Management

Most NBA products offer similar management capabilities. This section discusses major aspects of
management—implementation, operation, and maintenance—and provides recommendations for
performing them effectively and efficiently.

6.3.1    Implementation

Once an NBA product has been selected, the administrators need to design an architecture, perform NBA
component testing, secure the NBA components, and then deploy them. The only addition to the material
presented in Section 3.3.1 involves component testing and deployment. When NBA components are
being deployed to production networks, organizations should typically install the sensors in a relatively
short period of time, so that they can all build their inventories and generate their initial baselines at the
same time. Detection accuracy is likely to be decreased during implementation and initial usage because
the sensors will have substantially incomplete information about their environment until they have
monitored it for days or weeks. Other than that, deployment of NBA sensors and consoles is essentially
the same as it is for network-based IDPS sensors and consoles.

6.3.2    Operation and Maintenance

NBA products are designed to be operated and maintained through consoles, which typically have very
similar capabilities to the consoles for network-based IDPSs. A key difference is that NBA consoles
usually offer visualization tools that can display the flow of attacks through an organization’s networks.
These tools can show a user which hosts were affected by an attack, the sequence of hosts that an attack
passed through, and the first host to be involved in the attack. Some NBA products also offer command-
line interfaces.

Ongoing maintenance of NBA products is also very similar to that for network-based IDPSs. The
primary exception is the application of updates. Because most NBA products do not use signatures,
administrators only need to test and apply updates to the NBA software itself. Because NBA sensors are
appliance-based, updating them usually involves replacing an existing CD and either rebooting the sensor
or installing software from the CD. For NBA products that do have signature capabilities, administrators
should also acquire, test, and apply signature updates in the same way that network-based IDPS signature
updates are performed.

6.4     Summary

A network behavior analysis (NBA) system examines network traffic or statistics on network traffic to
identify unusual traffic flows. NBA solutions usually have sensors and consoles, with some products also
offering management servers. Some sensors are similar to network-based IDPS sensors in that they sniff
packets to monitor network activity on one or a few network segments. Other NBA sensors do not
monitor the networks directly, but instead rely on network flow information provided by routers and other
networking devices.

Most NBA sensors can be deployed in passive mode only, using the same connection methods (e.g.,
network tap, switch spanning port) as network-based IDPSs. Passive sensors that are performing direct
network monitoring should be placed so that they can monitor key network locations, such as the
divisions between networks, and key network segments, such as DMZ subnets. Inline sensors are
