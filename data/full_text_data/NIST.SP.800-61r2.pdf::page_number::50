                                                                   COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE



    – Determining if the actual cause of the incident was identified, and identifying the vector of attack,
        the vulnerabilities exploited, and the characteristics of the targeted or victimized systems,
        networks, and applications

    – Determining if the incident is a recurrence of a previous incident
    – Calculating the estimated monetary damage from the incident (e.g., information and critical
        business processes negatively affected by the incident)

    – Measuring the difference between the initial impact assessment and the final impact assessment
        (see Section 3.2.6)

    – Identifying which measures, if any, could have prevented the incident.
 Subjective Assessment of Each Incident. Incident response team members may be asked to assess
  their own performance, as well as that of other team members and of the entire team. Another
  valuable source of input is the owner of a resource that was attacked, in order to determine if the
  owner thinks the incident was handled efficiently and if the outcome was satisfactory.
Besides using these metrics to measure the team’s success, organizations may also find it useful to
periodically audit their incident response programs. Audits will identify problems and deficiencies that
can then be corrected. At a minimum, an incident response audit should evaluate the following items
against applicable regulations, policies, and generally accepted practices:

 Incident response policies, plans, and procedures
 Tools and resources
 Team model and structure
 Incident handler training and education
 Incident documentation and reports
 The measures of success discussed earlier in this section.
3.4.3   Evidence Retention

Organizations should establish policy for how long evidence from an incident should be retained. Most
organizations choose to retain all evidence for months or years after the incident ends. The following
factors should be considered during the policy creation:

 Prosecution. If it is possible that the attacker will be prosecuted, evidence may need to be retained
  until all legal actions have been completed. In some cases, this may take several years. Furthermore,
  evidence that seems insignificant now may become more important in the future. For example, if an
  attacker is able to use knowledge gathered in one attack to perform a more severe attack later,
  evidence from the first attack may be key to explaining how the second attack was accomplished.
 Data Retention. Most organizations have data retention policies that state how long certain types of
  data may be kept. For example, an organization may state that email messages should be retained for
  only 180 days. If a disk image contains thousands of emails, the organization may not want the image
  to be kept for more than 180 days unless it is absolutely necessary. As discussed in Section 3.4.2,
  General Records Schedule (GRS) 24 specifies that incident handling records should be kept for
  three years.
