GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



management servers, database servers, and consoles are attached to the management network only. This
architecture effectively isolates the management network from the production networks. The benefits of
doing this are to conceal the existence and identity of the IDPS from attackers; to protect the IDPS from
attack; and to ensure that the IDPS has adequate bandwidth to function under adverse conditions (e.g.,
worm attack or distributed denial of service [DDoS] on the monitored networks). Disadvantages of using
a management network include the additional costs in networking equipment and other hardware (e.g.,
PCs for the consoles) and the inconvenience for IDPS users and administrators of using separate
computers for IDPS management and monitoring.

If an IDPS is deployed without a separate management network, another way of improving IDPS security
is to create a virtual management network using a virtual local area network (VLAN) within the standard
networks. Using a VLAN provides protection for IDPS communications, but not as much protection as a
separate management network. For example, misconfiguration of the VLAN could lead to the exposure
of IDPS data. Another concern is that under adverse conditions, such as DDoS attacks or major malware
incidents, the network devices shared by the organizationâ€™s primary networks and VLAN might become
completely saturated, negatively impacting the availability and performance of the IDPS.

3.2     Security Capabilities

Most IDPS technologies can provide a wide variety of security capabilities. Sections 3.2.1 through 3.2.4
describe common security capabilities, divided into four categories: information gathering, logging,
detection, and prevention, respectively.

3.2.1     Information Gathering Capabilities

Some IDPS technologies offer information gathering capabilities, such as collecting information on hosts
or networks from observed activity. Examples include identifying hosts and the operating systems and
applications that they use, and identifying general characteristics of the network.

3.2.2     Logging Capabilities

IDPSs typically perform extensive logging of data related to detected events. This data can be used to
confirm the validity of alerts, investigate incidents, and correlate events between the IDPS and other
logging sources. Data fields commonly used by IDPSs include event date and time, event type,
importance rating (e.g., priority, severity, impact, confidence), and prevention action performed (if any).
Specific types of IDPSs log additional data fields, such as network-based IDPSs performing packet
captures and host-based IDPSs recording user IDs. IDPS technologies typically permit administrators to
store logs locally and send copies of logs to centralized logging servers (e.g., syslog, security information
and event management software). Generally, logs should be stored both locally and centrally to support
the integrity and availability of the data (e.g., a compromise of the IDPS could allow attackers to alter or
destroy its logs). 8 Also, IDPSs should have their clocks synchronized using the Network Time Protocol
(NTP) or through frequent manual adjustments so that their log entries have accurate timestamps. 9
