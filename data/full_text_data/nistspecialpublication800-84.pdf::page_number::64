GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



Injects are created by the functional exercise team during the Development Phase. These messages are
introduced by Controllers during the Conduct Phase and are provided to exercise participants via the
means shown on the Inject form. In the case of the Sample Inject provide below, a Controller would play
the role of the Chief Information Officer and would call the Team Chief to provide information and
request follow-on action. Expected actions by the Team Chief or other exercise participants are
documented in the “Notes to Control/Response Cell” at the bottom of this form to aid controllers,
simulators, or data collectors in anticipating what actions will result from the Inject.

From:                        [Insert by whom the message is delivered] (i.e., Chief Information Officer)

To:                          [Insert for whom the message is intended] (i.e., Team Chief)

Example

Now that we know the magnitude of the damage to the Building and our data center there, it is apparent
that we will be operating out of the alternate facility (AF) for the foreseeable future. Given the continued
threat of terrorist attacks, we need to develop contingency plans in the event of a major outage affecting
the AF. What is our strategy to ensure continuity of mission critical systems at the AF? Which systems
and applications are prioritized for recovery? How long will it take to develop a viable backup for those
systems?




Note to Control/Response Cell:

[Insert any type of information that the Control/Response Cell may need to consider to track, evaluate, or
respond to exercise players]

Example

Expect the AF Team Chief to consult the AF Contingency Plan and coordinate with appropriate system
and application engineers to develop a recovery strategy.
