D.14 Health
Public Health involves Federal programs and activities charged with ensuring and providing for
the health and well being of the public. This includes the direct provision of health care services
and immunizations as well as the monitoring and tracking of public health indicators for the
detection of trends and identification of widespread illnesses/diseases. It also includes both
earned and unearned health care benefit programs. Note that impacts to some public health
information and information systems may affect the security of critical elements of the public
health infrastructure.

D.14.1 Access to Care Information Type

Access to Care focuses on the access to appropriate care. This includes streamlining efforts to
receive care; ensuring care is appropriate in terms of type, care, intensity, location and
availability; providing seamless access to health knowledge, enrolling providers; performing
eligibility determination, and managing patient movement. The recommended provisional
security categorization for access to care information is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of access to care
information on the ability of responsible agencies to focus on the access to appropriate care. This
includes streamlining efforts to receive care; ensuring care is appropriate in terms of type, care,
intensity, location and availability; providing seamless access to health knowledge, enrolling
providers; performing eligibility determination, and managing patient movement will have only a
limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Some information associated with
health care involves confidential patient information subject to the Privacy Act and to HIPAA.
The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity
and Authentication information type. Other information (e.g., information proprietary to
hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, insurers, and care givers) must be protected under rules
governing proprietary information and procurement management. In some cases, unauthorized
disclosure of this information such as privacy-protected medical records can have serious
consequences for agency operations. In such cases, the confidentiality impact level may be
moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for disclosure of access to care information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.
