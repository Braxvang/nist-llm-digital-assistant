NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

server is the repository for user information, access privileges, and audit logs. Depending on the
system, the server might be on-premises or managed in the cloud.
While this guide contains recommendations that are applicable and could be used as a reference
to protect a PACS against cybersecurity threats, readers are encouraged to perform a risk-based
assessment on their systems and tailor the recommended guidelines and solutions to meet their
specific security, business, and operational requirements.

2.3.7. Safety Systems
Many of the physical processes that OT systems control have the potential to create hazardous
situations to human life and safety, property, and the environment. Safety systems are designed
to reduce the likelihood and/or consequence of these potentially hazardous situations by bringing
the system to a safe state. There are several types of safety systems related to OT environments,
including emergency shut down (ESD), process safety shutdown (PSS), and fire and gas systems
(FGS).
One of the more well-known types of safety system is the safety instrumented system (SIS),
which is composed of one or more safety instrumented functions (SIFs). An SIF is an engineered
system that is typically comprised of sensors, logic solvers, and final control elements (e.g.,
actuators) whose purpose is to bring a system to a safe state when predetermined thresholds are
violated. An SIS is implemented as part of an overall risk reduction strategy to reduce the
likelihood and/or potential consequences of a previously identified event so that it is within the
organizationâ€™s risk tolerance. Although numerous other terms are associated with safety systems,
the SIS is specifically designed in accordance with [IEC61511]. An SIS is typically found in
chemical, refinery, and nuclear processes.
An SIS is often independent from all other control systems in such a manner that a failure of the
basic process control system (BPCS) will not impact SIS functionality in a deleterious manner.
Historically, an SIS was designed to be stand-alone, physically and logically separated, and air-
gapped from the rest of the control system. In the configuration shown in Fig. 11, the SIS and
BPCS operate completely independent of each other with no direct communication between the
systems. However, some modern SISs have been designed to allow communication with the
control system. These types of SISs are called Integrated Control and Safety Systems (ICSSs).
An ICSS solution may be an all-in-one device from a single vendor or incorporate multiple
devices from multiple vendors. While an ICSS combines the functionality of both control and
safety systems, the SIS must still comply with the requirements outlined in [IEC61511]. One of
the advantages to this ICSS methodology is the ability to communicate information from the SIS
to the BPCS.
While this guide contains recommendations that are applicable and could be used as a reference
to protect safety systems against cybersecurity threats, readers are encouraged to perform a risk-
based assessment on their systems and tailor the recommended guidelines and solutions to meet
their specific security, business, and operational requirements.
