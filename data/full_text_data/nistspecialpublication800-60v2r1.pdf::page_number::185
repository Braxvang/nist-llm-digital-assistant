Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
elementary, secondary, and vocational education information is low.
Availability
The effects of disruption of access to most elementary, secondary, and vocational education
information or information systems would have a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
elementary, secondary, and vocational education information is low.

D.12.2 Higher Education Information Type

Higher Education refers to education beyond the secondary level; specifically, education
provided by a college or university. It includes external higher educational activities performed
by the government (e.g., Military Academies, ROTC, and USDA Graduate School). The
recommended provisional categorization of the higher education information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of higher education
information on the ability of responsible agencies to support education beyond the secondary
level (e.g., Military Academies, ROTC, USDA Graduate School, and other public and private
universities and colleges). The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most higher
education information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets,
or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Exceptions are based on the mission
supported by the external training and education activity. In such cases, the impact on the
system is defined by the information associated with the supported mission. This can result in
assignment of a moderate or high impact level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for higher education information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of higher education information would
have, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.
Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications
(e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the
agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited
