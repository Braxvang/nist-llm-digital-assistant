                                                                                          GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



 Decrypted traffic from the device to the internal network must be sent in cleartext through the DMZ
  network. This traffic is vulnerable to sniffing or ARP attacks by other machines in the DMZ that
  could be compromised by attackers.
 The firewall is bypassed when user traffic is destined for hosts in the DMZ. This assumes that clients
  use the VPN device to reach these DMZ hosts and do not use a split tunnel configuration (described
  in the next section).
It is recommended that if the VPN device is placed in the DMZ then it should be configured with two
interfaces. Remote users use the external interface to connect to the device, while traffic destined for the
internal network traverses the internal interface. This internal interface is connected to either another
firewall or another interface on the same firewall. Figure 4-4 illustrates this design.

This approach has the following advantages and disadvantages compared to the other options:

Advantages:

 All of the previously mentioned advantages of placing the device in the DMZ still apply.
 The unencrypted traffic headed for internal hosts is protected from sniffing or ARP attacks from other
  hosts in the DMZ.
 Only the firewall interface connected to the device’s internal interface must be configured to permit
  traffic from the VPN device. An intruder who compromises another host in the DMZ cannot use this
  internal interface to access the internal network unless the VPN device is compromised too.
