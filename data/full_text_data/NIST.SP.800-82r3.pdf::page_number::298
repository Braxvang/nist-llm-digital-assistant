OT Discussion: Organizations engage with OT suppliers to raise awareness of cybersecurity
needs. The SCADA/Control Systems Procurement Project provides example cybersecurity
procurement language for OT.
Control Enhancements: (1) (2) (9) OT Discussion: When acquiring OT products, consideration
for security requirements may not have been incorporated into the design. Procurement may need
to consider alternative products or complementary hardware or plan for compensating controls.
Control Enhancement: (10) OT Discussion: The use of approved PIV products is only required
for organizations that follow OMB Memorandum M-19-17 (e.g., federal agencies and
contractors). Example compensating controls include employing external products on the FIPS
201-approved products list for PIV capabilities in conjunction with OT products.
Control Enhancement: (5) (12) No OT Discussion for this control.
Rationale for adding SA-4 (12) to LOW, MOD, and HIGH baselines: Organizationally sensitive
or proprietary OT data is often provided to contractors for project development or support, so
data ownership should be defined prior to exchanging data with a vendor or integrator. The
potential sharing of data with other parties and the potential deletion of the data after project
completion should be determined. OT systems that are operated by contractors on behalf of the
organization may be subject to the same requirements (e.g., legal, regulatory, etc.) for data
ownership and retention.
