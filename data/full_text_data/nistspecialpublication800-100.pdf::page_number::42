CHAPTER 4                                                   Awareness and Training


4.4.2   Evaluation and Feedback

    Formal evaluation and feedback mechanisms are critical components of any
security awareness and training program. Continuous improvement cannot occur
without a good sense of how the existing program is working. In addition, the
feedback mechanism must be designed to address objectives initially established for
the program. Once the baseline requirements have been solidified, a feedback
strategy can be designed and implemented. Various evaluation and feedback
mechanisms that can be used to update the awareness and training program plan
include surveys, evaluation forms, independent observation, status reports,
interviews, focus groups, technology shifts, and/or benchmarking.

   A feedback strategy should incorporate elements that address quality, scope,
deployment method (e.g., Web-based, onsite, offsite), level of difficulty, ease of use,
duration of session, relevancy, currency, and suggestions for modification.
   Metrics are essential to feedback and evaluation. They can be used to:
   • Measure the effectiveness of the security awareness and training program;
   • Provide information for many of the data requests that an agency must provide
     with regard to compliance; and,
   • Provide an important gauge for demonstrating progress and identifying areas
     for improvement.

4.5 Managing Change
    It is necessary to ensure that the program, as structured, continues to evolve as
new technology and associated security issues emerge. Training needs will shift as
new skills and capabilities become necessary to respond to new architectural and
technology changes. A change in the organizational mission and/or objectives can
also influence ideas on how best to design training solutions and content. Emerging
issues, such as homeland defense, will also impact the nature and extent of security
awareness and training activities necessary to keep users informed and/or trained
about the latest threats, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures. New laws and court
decisions may also impact agency policy that, in turn, may affect the development
and/or implementation of awareness and training material. Finally, as security
policies evolve, awareness and training material should reflect these changes.

4.6 Program Success Indicators
    CIOs, program officials, and SAISOs should be primary advocates for awareness,
training, education, and professionalization. Securing an organization’s information
and infrastructure is a team effort, requiring the dedication of capable individuals to
carry out their assigned security roles within the organization. Listed below are
some key indicators to gauge the support for, and acceptance of, the program:
   • Key stakeholder demonstrates commitment and support;
   • Sufficient funding is budgeted and available to implement the agreed-upon
     awareness and training strategy;
   • Appropriate organizational placement of senior officials with key security
     responsibilities (CIO, program officials, and SAISO) facilitates strategy
     implementation;
