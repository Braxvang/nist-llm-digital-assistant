Testing Services

Because of its highly specialized and technical nature, testing is one security activity that is frequently
considered for external service providers. However, because it is a highly invasive measure, it is
important that service providers be capable and trusted by the organization. Testing can be conducted as
a separate activity or as part of the risk management program, under risk assessment. The service
provider will need clear and unambiguous direction from management (a written “rules of engagement”),
a set of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and clearly defined scope for testing as well as input on what is
required for planning and assessment, requirements analysis, test execution, and analysis results and
documentation.

5.2.4   Training

Training is one of the most critical components in maintaining the security posture of operational
systems. Securing any organization’s IT systems cannot be achieved without skilled, knowledgeable, and
trained personnel at all levels. Security training and education must be considered an ongoing effort that
is an integral part of conducting business. With constantly evolving technology, education—especially in
the security arena—must keep pace with the perpetual changes and advances. Managers must understand
the current status of their security programs and controls to make informed judgments and investments to
appropriately mitigate risks to an acceptable level. All users of IT systems must be aware of their
responsibilities for protecting information and IT resources.

The IT Security Learning Continuum from NIST SP 800-16, Information Technology Security Training
Requirements, and shown in Figure 5-1, represents instructional guidance for IT security awareness,
training, and education programs. The model is created from requirements of several federal regulations,
including OMB Circular A-130.
