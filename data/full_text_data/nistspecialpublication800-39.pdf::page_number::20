monitoring of organizational information systems. Based on these day-to-day operational risk-
based decisions, authorizing officials make follow-on risk-based decisions on whether or not the
information systems are initially authorized to operate within the designated environments of
operation or continue to receive authorization to operate on an ongoing basis. These ongoing risk-
based decisions are informed by the risk management process with guidance from the risk
executive (function) and the various architectural considerations supporting the mission/business
processes. In addition, the activities at Tier 3 provide essential feedback to Tiers 1 and 2. New
vulnerabilities discovered in an organizational information system, for example, may have
systemic implications that extend organization-wide. Those same vulnerabilities may trigger
changes to the enterprise architecture and embedded information security architecture or may
require an adjustment to the organizational risk tolerance. Section 2.5 provides a more detailed
description of the specific activities associated with Tier 3.


     Since mission and business success in organizations depends on information systems, those systems
     must be dependable. To be dependable in the face of sophisticated threats, the information systems
     must be used wisely in accordance with the degree of protection and resilience achieved.




2.3 TIER ONE—ORGANIZATION VIEW
Tier 1 addresses risk from an organizational perspective by establishing and implementing
governance structures that are consistent with the strategic goals and objectives of organizations
and the requirements defined by federal laws, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
missions/business functions. Governance structures provide oversight for the risk management
activities conducted by organizations and include: (i) the establishment and implementation of a
risk executive (function); (ii) the establishment of the organization’s risk management strategy
including the determination of risk tolerance; and (iii) the development and execution of
organization-wide investment strategies for information resources and information security.

2.3.1 Governance
In general, governance is the set of responsibilities and practices exercised by those responsible
for an organization (e.g., the board of directors and executive management in a corporation, the
head of a federal agency) with the express goal of: (i) providing strategic direction; (ii) ensuring
that organizational mission and business objectives are achieved; (iii) ascertaining that risks are
managed appropriately; and (iv) verifying that the organization’s resources are used responsibly.21
Risks and resources can be associated with different organizational sectors (e.g., legal, finance,
information technology, regulatory compliance, information security). Different sectors require
specialized expertise in order to manage the risks associated with that sector. Thus, governance
within organizations frequently is organized by sector.22 The five outcomes of governance related
to organization-wide risk management are:

the International Federation of Accountants also adopted this definition in 2004.

  While governance is frequently organized by sectors, organizations are well served by establishing a single aligned
governance approach. A unified governance approach can coordinate the individual sector governance activities and
provide a consistent governance approach, organization-wide.
