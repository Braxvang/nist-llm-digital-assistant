SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


7 Interoperability and Transitioning
In general, interoperability is the ability of diverse systems to communicate and work
together (i.e., to inter-operate). In this document, two or more entities may be considered
interoperable if they are able to exchange cryptographic keys in a manner that complies with
Federal standards and is considered sufficiently secure by both entities. Since this document
allows for a variety of implementations to service many diverse applications, compliance
with this document does not by itself guarantee interoperability. Interoperability can only be
achieved by having a detailed specification and common protocols to which all
communicating entities intend to comply. These specifications and protocols may differ,
depending on the applications being serviced. If no interoperability is required, then the PRs
containing conditional interoperability phases are not applicable.

An FCKMS should use cryptographic algorithms and keys whose anticipated security
lifetimes will span the maximum lifetime of the information being protected. If the FCKMS
is intended to remain in service beyond the security lifetimes of its cryptographic algorithms,
then there should be a transition strategy for migration to stronger algorithms in the future.
Cryptographic algorithms should be implemented so that they can be replaced when needed.
[SP 800-57 Part 1] and [SP 800-131A] specify NIST-recommended lifetimes of NIST-
approved cryptographic algorithms. [SP 800-57 Part 1] provides transition guidance.

FR:7.1 The CKMS design shall specify how interoperability requirements across device
interfaces are to be satisfied.

FR:7.2 The CKMS design shall specify the standards, protocols, interfaces, supporting
services, commands and data formats required to interoperate with the applications it is
intended to support.

FR:7.3 The CKMS design shall specify the standards, protocols, interfaces, supporting
services, commands and data formats required to interoperate with other CKMS for which
interoperability is intended.

FR:7.4 The CKMS design shall specify all external interfaces to applications and other
CKMS.

FR:7.5 The CKMS design shall specify all provisions for transitions to new, interoperable,
peer devices.

its cryptographic algorithms.

FR:7.7 The CKMS design shall specify how interoperability will be supported during
cryptographic algorithm transition periods.

FR:7.8 The CKMS design shall specify its protocols for negotiating the use of cryptographic
algorithms and key lengths.
