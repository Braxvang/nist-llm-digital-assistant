       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                          Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                                                 and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

2332   G.2.     Controls and Assessment Procedures for DPCIs
2333   The following tables specify the controls and assessment procedures for derived PIV credential
2334   issuance. Unlike for a PIV Card issuer, not all controls are applicable to a derived PIV credential
2335   issuer as the issuance of a derived PIV credential is an instance of post-enrollment binding,
2336   which leverages the identity proofing and vetting associated with an existing PIV identity
2337   account. Certain issuer controls are only applicable to AAL2 or AAL3 derived PIV credentials
2338   and must therefore be implemented by the issuer only if they are issuing that level of a derived
2339   PIV credential. Similarly, certain issuer controls are applicable to PKI-based derived PIV
2340   credentials, while some are applicable to non-PKI-based derived PIV credentials. This is
2341   represented via the “applicability” columns, which identify whether the issuer control needs to be
2342   met by a PKI-based or non-PKI, AAL2, or AAL3 derived PIV credential issuer. If the
2343   “applicability” column states “DPCI,” then the issuer control is applicable to all derived
2344   credential issuers, regardless of what type of derived PIV credential is issued by the issuer.
