1.2 Changes for this Revision

The major changes for this revision include additions and updates to issuer controls in response
to new or changed requirements in FIPS 201-2. These are:

        Inclusion of issuer controls for Derived PIV Credentials Issuers (DPCI),
        Addition of issuer controls for issuing PIV Cards under the grace period and for issuing
         PIV Cards to individuals under pseudonymous identity,
        Addition of issuer controls for the PIV Card’s visual topography,
        Provided detailed controls to address post-issuance updates for PIV Cards,
        Updated references to more recent credentialing guidance issued by Office of Personnel
         Management (OPM),
        Addition of issuer controls with respect to the chain-of-trust records maintained by a PIV
         Card issuer,
        Modified process to include an independent review prior to authorization of issuer.

1.3 Timelines for using the revised Guidelines

This publication is effective immediately and it supersedes the previous version.

FIPS 201-2 mandates the implementation of some PIV Card features that were previously
optional to implement. The standard also requires that all new or replacement PIV Cards include
these previously optional features beginning September 2014 (i.e., one year publication of FIPS
201-2). These new FIPS 201-2 requirements result in the following re-authorization scenarios:

        Organizations whose current Authorization to Operate (ATO) (under SP 800-79-1)
         covers issuance of PIV Cards with the new mandatory features of FIPS 201-2 do not have
         to be re-authorized under SP 800-79-2;4

        Organizations whose current ATO (under SP 800-79-1) covers issuance of PIV Cards
         without the new mandatory features are required to be re-authorized under SP 800-79-2.

Derived PIV Credentials are optional PIV credentials introduced in FIPS 201-2 and detailed in
SP 800-157 Guidelines for Derived Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Credentials [SP 800-
157]. The timeline for their use on mobile devices depends on Department and Agencies to
achieve the ATO to issue Derived PIV Credential based on this document and on the availability
of validated Derived PIV Credential tokens. No Derived PIV Credentials shall be issued unless
the issuer has met the requirements of and is operating in accordance to the guidelines of SP 800-
79-2.

 Re-Authorization using the revised guidelines (SP 800-79-2) is required within three (3) years of current Authorization to
Operate (ATO).
