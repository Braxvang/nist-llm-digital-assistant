                                       COOP vs. ISCP – The Basic Facts
  RECOVERY TIMES
     COOP functions must be sustained within 12 hours and for up to 30 days from an alternate site;
      ISCP recovery time objectives are determined by the system-based BIA.
      o    Information systems that support COOP functions must have an RTO that meets COOP
           requirements.
      o    Information systems that do not support COOP functions do not require alternate sites as
           part of the ISCP recovery strategy, but may have an alternate site security control
           requirement.


The ISCP Coordinator, working with management, should determine the optimum point to recover the
information system by addressing the factors mentioned above while balancing the cost of system
inoperability against the cost of resources required for restoring the system and its overall support for
critical mission/business processes. This can be depicted using a simple chart, such as the example in
Figure 3-3.

                                                                           (Tape Backup)



                                           Length of Disruption Time



                                              Figure 3-3: Cost Balancing

The longer a disruption is allowed to continue, the more costly it can become to the organization and its
operations. Conversely, the shorter the RTO, the more expensive the recovery solutions cost to
implement. For example, if the system must be recovered immediately, zero downtime solutions and
alternate processing site costs will be much higher, whereas a low-impact system with a longer RTO
would be able to implement a less costly simple tape backup system. Plotting the cost balance points will
show an optimal point between disruption and recovery costs. The intersecting point (Cost Balance Point
in Figure 3-3: Cost Balancing) will be different for every organization and system based on the financial
constraints and operating requirements.
