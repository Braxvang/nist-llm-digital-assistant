Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of training and
employment information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide job or skill training,
employment services and placement, and programs to promote the hiring of marginal,
unemployed, or low-income workers. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most
training and employment information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Exceptions that might have a
potential for more serious consequences are based on privacy information processed in training
and employment systems (e.g., information required by the Privacy Act of 1974 or other statutes
and executive orders to receive special handling to protect the privacy of individuals). The
Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and
Authentication information type. This can result in assignment of a moderate impact level to
such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for training and employment information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of training and employment
information would have, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external
communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public
confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In the case of training aimed at
achieving or improving proficiency in specialty occupations (e.g., astronaut training), the
consequences of integrity compromises can threaten missions, or even human safety. In such
cases, the integrity impact level can range from moderate to high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
training and employment information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to training and employment
information. The effects of disruption of access to most training and employment information
or information systems would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals.
