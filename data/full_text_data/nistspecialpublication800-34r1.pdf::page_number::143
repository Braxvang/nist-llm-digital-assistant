                                              CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



Appendix G—Glossary

This appendix provides definitions for terminology used within Special Publication 800-34. The terms in
the glossary are consistent with the terms used in the suite of FISMA-related security standards and
guidelines developed by NIST.

Backup:                                 A copy of files and programs made to facilitate recovery if
                                        necessary.

Business Continuity Plan (BCP):         The documentation of a predetermined set of instructions or
                                        procedures that describe how an organization’s mission/business
                                        processes will be sustained during and after a significant
                                        disruption.

Business Impact Analysis (BIA):         An analysis of an information system’s requirements, functions,
                                        and interdependencies used to characterize system contingency
                                        requirements and priorities in the event of a significant
                                        disruption.

Cold Site:                              A backup facility that has the necessary electrical and physical
                                        components of a computer facility, but does not have the
                                        computer equipment in place. The site is ready to receive the
                                        necessary replacement computer equipment in the event that the
                                        user has to move from their main computing location to an
                                        alternate site.

Computer:                               A device that accepts digital data and manipulates the
                                        information based on a program or sequence of instructions for
                                        how data is to be processed.

Contingency Planning:                   See Information System Contingency Plan.

Continuity of Operations (COOP) Plan: A predetermined set of instructions or procedures that describe
                                      how an organization’s mission essential functions will be
                                      sustained within 12 hours and for up to 30 days as a result of a
                                      disaster event before returning to normal operations.

Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP):           A written plan for recovering one or more information systems at
                                        an alternate facility in response to a major hardware or software
                                        failure or destruction of facilities.

Disruption:                             An unplanned event that causes an information system to be
                                        inoperable for a length of time (e.g., minor or extended power
                                        outage, extended unavailable network, or equipment or facility
                                        damage or destruction).

Hot Site:                               A fully operational offsite data processing facility equipped with
                                        hardware and software, to be used in the event of an information
                                        system disruption.
