AND MEASUREMENT TOOLS
Federal agencies, industry, and the public rely on many elements of software and
technology for the protection of information and communications used in electronic
commerce, the critical infrastructure, and other application areas. This reliance depends
on the effective measurement and conformance testing of the standards being applied.
In FY 2019, NIST continued to create reference data, offer guidance, and participate
in international engagement for the development of flexible, open standards. These
efforts will be continued in FY 2020 as NIST seeks to improve the interoperability, broad
acceptance, and adoption of security automation solutions to address the current and
future security challenges. In turn, this will create opportunities for innovation.


Automated Combinatorial Testing
As important as software is to modern, complex information and technology systems,
that complexity makes it difficult and expensive to conduct adequate vulnerability
testing in a timely manner. Engineers often encounter security failures that result from
unexpected interactions among components. If all faults in a system can be triggered
by applying test methods that combine a known number of parameters, then testing
all possible combinations of those parameters with a practical number of tests can
provide strong fault detection efficiency. These methods are being applied to software
