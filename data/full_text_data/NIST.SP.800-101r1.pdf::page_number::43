                                                               Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

      outgoing calls) and SMS messages present within the internal memory of the mobile device to
      be erased [Rei08].

      A better approach is to create a substitute UICC (i.e., CNIC) to use with the mobile device that
      mimics key characteristics of the original UICC, tricking the device to accept it as the original.
      Most mobile forensic tools provide the forensic examiner with the ability to create a CNIC.

      Substituting UICCs, sometimes referred to as CNICs, may be useful in a number of situations:

             If a mobile device’s UICC is missing or damaged and is required for acquisition with
              a forensic tool, creation of a CNIC permits data to be recovered from the handset.

             If the UICC for a device is present, but requires a PUK code, a substitute UICC can be
              created providing acquisition to proceed without having to contact the service
              provider for the PUK.

             If cellular network isolation is required (e.g., avoiding incoming calls or text
              messages) a CNIC provides a method permitting acquisition of data from the handset
              while simultaneously denying cellular network authentication.

             If a forensic tool accesses the UICC during the acquisition process, using a CNIC in
              the handset eliminates the possibility of the original being modified (e.g., status flag of
              SMS messages modified from unread to read).

      The values by which the mobile device correlates to the previously inserted UICC are the
      ICCID and the IMSI [Rei08]. Often only one of these values is used. Both identifiers are
      unique and used to authenticate the user to the network. While the minimum data needed to
      create a UICC may be simply one of these two values, some mobile devices may require
      additional data to be populated on the CNIC to be properly recognized. The possibility exists
      that data, other than user data, may change on the handset as the result of inserting a CNIC
      [INT06].

4.4   Packaging, Transporting, and Storing Evidence

      Once the mobile device is ready to be seized, the forensic specialist should seal the device in
      an appropriate container and label it appropriately according to agency specifications.

      Due to the volatile nature of some mobile devices, they should immediately be checked into a
      forensic laboratory for processing and the power requirements should be discussed with the
      evidence custodian. Battery powered devices held in storage for more than a day risk power
      depletion and data loss, unless a process is in place to avoid this outcome.

      Storage facilities that hold evidence should provide a cool, dry environment appropriate for
      valuable electronic equipment. All evidence should be in sealed containers in a secure area
      with controlled access.

4.5   On-Site Triage Processing

      Currently many organizations are challenged with large backlogs of digital forensics casework.
      An on-site triage solution is being employed more and more world-wide to accommodate for
      this exponential growth in digital forensic caseload. Triaging involves performing a data
                                                 33
