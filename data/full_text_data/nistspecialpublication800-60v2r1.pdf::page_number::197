unauthorized modification or destruction of health care information may result in incorrect,
inappropriate, or excessively delayed treatment of patients. In these cases, serious adverse
effects can include legal actions and danger to human life. Unauthorized modification or
destruction of information affecting external communications that contain health care
information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and public
confidence in the agency and the agency mission.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: Because of the potential for the loss of human life, the
provisional integrity impact level recommended for health care delivery services information is
high.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish Health Care Administration information. Except
for cases of emergency actions necessary to correct urgent threats to patient health, health care
processes are usually tolerant of reasonable delays.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Some health care delivery services
information is time-critical and is dependent on the severity of the health threat(s) and the
rapidity with which the threat is spreading/ growing. Delays in the communication of specific
situations may be life threatening. This can result in assignment of a moderate or high impact
level to such information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
health care delivery services information is low.

D.14.5 Health Care Research and Practitioner Education Information Type

Health Care Research and Practitioner Education fosters advancement in health discovery and
knowledge. This includes developing new strategies to handle diseases; promoting health
knowledge advancement; identifying new means for delivery of services, methods, decision
models and practices; making strides in quality improvement; managing clinical trials and
research quality; and providing for practitioner education. The recommended provisional
security categorization for health care research and practitioner education information is as
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of health care research
and practitioner education on the ability of responsible agencies to fosters advancement in health
discovery and knowledge will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or
individuals.
