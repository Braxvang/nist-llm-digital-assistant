                                                  CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



Chapter 4.      Information System Contingency Plan Development

This chapter discusses the key elements that compose the ISCP. As described in Chapter 3, ISCP
development is a critical step in the process of implementing a comprehensive contingency planning
program. The plan contains detailed roles, responsibilities, teams, and procedures associated with
restoring an information system following a disruption. The ISCP should document technical capabilities
designed to support contingency operations and should be tailored to the organization and its
requirements. Plans need to balance detail with flexibility; usually, the more detailed the plan, the less
scalable and versatile the approach. The information presented here is meant to be a guide; nevertheless,
the plan format in this document may be modified as needed to better meet the user’s specific system,
operational, and organization requirements. Appendix A provides templates that organizations may use
to develop ISCPs for their information systems at the appropriate FIPS 199 impact level. The information
and templates provided are guides and may be modified, customized, and/or adapted as necessary to best
meet the specific system, operational, and organizational requirements for contingency planning.
Appendix D discusses planning considerations regarding personnel which should be coordinated with the
ISCP development.

As shown in Figure 4-1, this guide identifies five main components of the contingency plan. The
supporting information and plan appendices provide essential information to ensure a comprehensive
plan. The Activation and Notification, Recovery, and Reconstitution Phases address specific actions that
the organization should take following a system disruption or emergency. Each plan component is
discussed later in this section.
