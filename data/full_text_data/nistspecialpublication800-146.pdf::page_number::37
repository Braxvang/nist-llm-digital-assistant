                                                             CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



5.3.1   Very Modest Software Tool Footprint

As browsers that are capable of efficiently displaying interactive content have become ubiquitous, SaaS
application deployment has become increasingly convenient and efficient with little or no client-side
software required. Several factors contribute to this value proposition:

 Unlike shrink-wrapped software applications, SaaS applications can be accessed without waiting for
  complex installation procedures.
 Because SaaS applications have very small footprints on client computers, risk of configuration
  interference between applications on client computers is reduced.
 Distribution costs for the software are fundamentally reduced. As discussed in [Cho06], lower
  distribution costs allow for economical development and deployment of software features even if they
  appeal to only a small portion of consumers.
5.3.2   Efficient Use of Software Licenses

License management overheads can be dramatically reduced using SaaS. As discussed in [Sii01],
consumers can employ a single license on multiple computers at different times instead of purchasing
extra licenses for separate computers that may not be used and thus over-provisioning the license.
Additionally, traditional license management protocols and license servers are not needed to protect the
intellectual property of application developers because the software runs in the provider's infrastructure
and can be directly metered and billed.

5.3.3   Centralized Management and Data

For public and outsourced scenarios, the SaaS service model implies that the majority of the data
managed by an application resides on the servers of the cloud provider. The provider may store this data
in a decentralized manner for redundancy and reliability, but it is centralized from the point of view of
consumers. This logical centralization of data has important implications for consumers. One implication
is that, for public and outsourced scenarios, the SaaS provider can supply professional management of the
data, including for example, compliance checking, security scanning, backup, and disaster recovery.
When these services are provided away from the consumer's premises in public and outsourced scenarios,
SaaS management of data gives consumers protection against the possibility of a single catastrophe
destroying both the consumer's facility and data. This benefit, however, is contingent upon the SaaS
provider protecting its facilities from catastrophic attack or other undesirable events. For on-site private
and community SaaS clouds, the benefits of centralized management are similar however there is less
resilience against catastrophic losses unless consumers explicitly plan for those contingencies. The “on
demand” network access of SaaS applications also relieves consumers from the need to carry their data
with them in some settings, thus potentially reducing risks from loss or theft. When supported by the
application's logic, remote data management also facilitates sharing among other consumers.

5.3.4   Platform Responsibilities Managed by Providers

Generally, for outsourced or public SaaS clouds, consumers need not become involved with the
management of a provider's infrastructure. For example, consumers need not be distracted by which
operating system, hardware devices or configuration choices, or software library versions underlie a SaaS
application. In particular, providers have responsibility for operational issues such as backups, system
maintenance, security patches, power management, hardware refresh, physical plant security, etc.
Providers also have an obligation to field services that guard against known exploits at the application
level. Further, consumers are not required to maintain on premises IT support to perform these tasks, with
