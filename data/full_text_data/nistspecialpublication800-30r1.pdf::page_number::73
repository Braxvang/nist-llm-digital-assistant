 Conduct data scavenging attacks in a cloud                   Adversary obtains data used and then deleted by organizational processes running
 environment.                                                 in a cloud environment.
 Conduct brute force login attempts/password guessing         Adversary attempts to gain access to organizational information systems by random
 attacks.                                                     or systematic guessing of passwords, possibly supported by password cracking
                                                              utilities.
 Conduct nontargeted zero-day attacks.                        Adversary employs attacks that exploit as yet unpublicized vulnerabilities. Attacks
                                                              are not based on any adversary insights into specific vulnerabilities of organizations.
 Conduct externally-based session hijacking.                  Adversary takes control of (hijacks) already established, legitimate information
                                                              system sessions between organizations and external entities (e.g., users connecting
                                                              from off-site locations).
 Conduct internally-based session hijacking.                  Adversary places an entity within organizations in order to gain access to
                                                              organizational information systems or networks for the express purpose of taking
                                                              control (hijacking) an already established, legitimate session either between
                                                              organizations and external entities (e.g., users connecting from remote locations) or
                                                              between two locations within internal networks.
 Conduct externally-based network traffic modification        Adversary, operating outside organizational systems, intercepts/eavesdrops on
 (man in the middle) attacks.                                 sessions between organizational and external systems. Adversary then relays
                                                              messages between organizational and external systems, making them believe that
                                                              they are talking directly to each other over a private connection, when in fact the
                                                              entire communication is controlled by the adversary. Such attacks are of particular
                                                              concern for organizational use of community, hybrid, and public clouds.
 Conduct internally-based network traffic modification        Adversary operating within the organizational infrastructure intercepts and corrupts
 (man in the middle) attacks.                                 data sessions.
 Conduct outsider-based social engineering to obtain          Externally placed adversary takes actions (e.g., using email, phone) with the intent
 information.                                                 of persuading or otherwise tricking individuals within organizations into revealing
                                                              critical/sensitive information (e.g., personally identifiable information).
 Conduct insider-based social engineering to obtain           Internally placed adversary takes actions (e.g., using email, phone) so that
 information.                                                 individuals within organizations reveal critical/sensitive information (e.g., mission
                                                              information).
 Conduct attacks targeting and compromising personal          Adversary targets key organizational employees by placing malware on their
 devices of critical employees.                               personally owned information systems and devices (e.g., laptop/notebook
                                                              computers, personal digital assistants, smart phones). The intent is to take
                                                              advantage of any instances where employees use personal information systems or
                                                              devices to handle critical/sensitive information.
 Conduct supply chain attacks targeting and exploiting        Adversary targets and compromises the operation of software (e.g., through
 critical hardware, software, or firmware.                    malware injections), firmware, and hardware that performs critical functions for
                                                              organizations. This is largely accomplished as supply chain attacks on both
                                                              commercial off-the-shelf and custom information systems and components.
                                         Achieve results (i.e., cause adverse impacts, obtain information)
 Obtain sensitive information through network sniffing of     Adversary with access to exposed wired or wireless data channels that
 external networks.                                           organizations (or organizational personnel) use to transmit information (e.g., kiosks,
                                                              public wireless networks) intercepts communications.
 Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration.               Adversary directs malware on organizational systems to locate and surreptitiously
                                                              transmit sensitive information.
 Cause degradation or denial of attacker-selected             Adversary directs malware on organizational systems to impair the correct and
 services or capabilities.                                    timely support of organizational mission/business functions.
 Cause deterioration/destruction of critical information      Adversary destroys or causes deterioration of critical information system
 system components and functions.                             components to impede or eliminate organizational ability to carry out missions or
                                                              business functions. Detection of this action is not a concern.
 Cause integrity loss by creating, deleting, and/or           Adversary vandalizes, or otherwise makes unauthorized changes to, organizational
 modifying data on publicly accessible information            websites or data on websites.
 systems (e.g., web defacement).
 Cause integrity loss by polluting or corrupting critical     Adversary implants corrupted and incorrect data in critical data, resulting in
 data.                                                        suboptimal actions or loss of confidence in organizational data/services.
