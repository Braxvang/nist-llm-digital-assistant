      NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                                     Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                                       Enrollment and Identity Proofing


721      9. The CSP’s policy for conducting assessments to determine potential equity impacts,
722         including the timing of its periodic reviews and any specific conditions that will
723         trigger an out-of-cycle review (see Section 5.1.3); and

724   5.1.1.1. Ceasing Operations
725      1. The CSP SHALL document its policy and plan for when it ceases its operations.
726      2. This plan SHALL include whether the CSP’s identity service is subject to retention
727         requirements and how it will protect any sensitive data (including identity attributes,
728         and information contained in subscriber accounts and audit logs) during the period
729         of retention.
730      3. At the end of any required retention period, the CSP SHALL be responsible for
731         fully disposing of or destroying all sensitive data.

732   5.1.1.2. Fraud Mitigation Measures
733      1. The CSP SHOULD obtain additional confidence in identity proofing using fraud
734         mitigation measures (e.g., examining the device characteristics of the applicant,
735         evaluating behavioral characteristics, and checking vital statistic repositories such
736         as the Death Master File ([DMF]).
737      2. In the event the CSP uses fraud mitigation measures, the CSP SHALL conduct a
738         privacy risk assessment for these mitigation measures.
739      3. Such assessments SHALL include any privacy risk mitigations (e.g., risk
740         acceptance or transfer, limited retention, use limitations, notice) or other
741         technological mitigations (e.g., cryptography), and be documented per these
742         guidelines.

743   5.1.2. General Privacy Requirements
744   The following privacy requirements apply to all CSPs providing identity services at any
745   IAL.

746   5.1.2.1. Privacy Risk Assessment
747      1. The CSP SHALL conduct and document a privacy risk assessment for the
748         processes used for identity proofing and enrollment.2 At a minimum, the privacy
749         risk assessment SHALL assess the risks associated with:
750            a) Any processing of PII for the purpose of identity proofing and enrollment,
751               including identity attributes, biometrics, images, video, scans, or copies of
752               identity evidence;
