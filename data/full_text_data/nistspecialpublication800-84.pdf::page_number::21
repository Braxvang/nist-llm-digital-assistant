4.      Tabletop Exercises

Tabletop exercises are discussion-based events where personnel with roles and responsibilities in a
particular IT plan meet in a classroom setting or in breakout groups to discuss their roles during an
emergency and their responses to a particular emergency situation. Tabletop exercises are conducted in
an informal environment, with a facilitator guiding participants through a discussion designed to meet
pre-defined objectives. One or more scenarios may be discussed during a single tabletop exercise. The
duration of a tabletop exercise (typically two to eight hours) varies depending on the audience, the topic
being exercised, and the exercise objectives. Tabletop exercises are cost-effective tools to validate the
content of IT plans, such as contingency plans and incident response plans, to ensure the plan content is
viable and implementable in an emergency situation.

This section provides guidance on evaluating the need for a tabletop exercise, and designing, developing,
conducting, and evaluating a tabletop exercise. The section then summarizes the key elements to consider
before, during, and after the conduct of a tabletop exercise. Appendix A provides a sample tabletop
exercise facilitator guide, sample participant guide, and sample after action report.
4.1     Evaluate the Need for a Tabletop Exercise and Create a Schedule

As part of the TT&E program, the program coordinator should routinely determine the need for a tabletop
exercise for a particular IT plan by considering the organizationâ€™s overall objectives for conducting a
tabletop exercise and answering questions such as the following:

       Have the personnel who would participate in the tabletop exercise been trained on their roles and
        responsibilities within the plan? If the personnel have not yet been trained, the TT&E program
        coordinator should consider conducting a training event before the tabletop exercise so that the
        personnel can participate more effectively in the tabletop exercise, increasing its benefits. 12
       When was the last time the organization conducted a tabletop exercise for the plan?
       Have recent organizational changes been made that could impact the content of the plan?
       Has new TT&E guidance been issued that could impact the content of the plan?

Organizations should conduct tabletop exercises periodically; following organizational changes, updates
to an IT plan, or the issuance of new TT&E guidance; or as otherwise needed. For each tabletop exercise,
the program coordinator should choose a form of tabletop exercise that is well-suited to meeting the
identified needs and objectives. The tabletop exercise schedule should be coordinated closely with the
schedules of the other events of the TT&E program. The TT&E program coordinator usually ensures that
tabletop exercises are scheduled within a reasonable timeframe after a training event so that the personnel
participating in the tabletop exercise are recently trained in their roles and responsibilities. It is important
that when an exercise is being scheduled, managers are notified and their approval obtained. Ensuring
that management has agreed to an exercise is an essential step in the development of the exercise.

4.2     Design the Tabletop Exercise Event

Once the need to conduct a tabletop exercise has been established, the TT&E program coordinator should
work with the tabletop exercise design team to design the event. The design phase is often the most time-
consuming phase of planning a tabletop exercise. Planning is typically started at least three months

12
      Some organizations find it more cost-effective to combine a tabletop exercise with a training session that immediately
      precedes the tabletop exercise.
