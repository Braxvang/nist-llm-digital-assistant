NIST SP 800-85A-4                                       PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                 INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

                            2. The command returns the Printed Information data object
                               along with the status word '90 00'.
                            3. The command returns the status word '90 00'.
                            4. The steps 4-6 have the same responses as steps 1-3.
                            5. In step 7, the command returns '69 82' (security status not
                               satisfied).
                            5. In steps 8 and 9, the command returns '6A 80' (incorrect
                               parameter command data field).
                            7. In step 10, the command returns:
                                    • '63 CX' until the maximum number of OCC tries is
                                        reached (X indicates the number of further allowed
                                        retries).
                                    • '69 83' (authentication method blocked) when the
                                        maximum number of OCC tries is exceeded.
                            8. In step 11, the repeated steps have the same responses as
                                when performed with key reference '96'.
 Postcondition        The card is blocked.

C.2.1.2        Contactless Interface
 Purpose              Validates that the PIV Card does not accept the VERIFY command
                      through the contactless interface when secure messaging is not used.
 Reference(s)         1. SP 800-73-4 Part 2, Table 2
                      2. AS05.03, AS05.04, AS05.13, AS05.15
 Precondition(s)      1. The IUT is placed within the reading range of the contactless
                          reader.
                      2. There exists a valid PC/SC connection between the test system
                          and the contactless reader.
                      3. No other contactless card is within the proximity of the reader.
                      4. Cardholder fingerprint minutia is recorded (if OCC is
                          implemented).
                      5. Pairing code (if supported) is recorded.
                      6. The reset retry counter values of PIV Card Application PIN,
                          Global PIN (if implemented), OCC (if implemented) are
                          recorded.
 Test Scenario        1.  Send SELECT card command with
                         • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 10 00 01 00'
                      2. Send GET DATA command with
                         • Data field of the command containing the tag of the
                            Discovery Object. Parse the PIN Usage Policy to
                            discover the PIN, pairing code, and OCC supported by
                            the card. Perform the test for all cases that match the
                            PIN Usage Policy
                         2a. Test case for the mandatory PIV Card Application PIN
                              ('80')
                               1. Send VERIFY card command with
