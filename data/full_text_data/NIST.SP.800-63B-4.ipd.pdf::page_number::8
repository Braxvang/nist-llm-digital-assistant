201   Call for Patent Claims

202   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims
203   whose use would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this
204   Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or
205   requirements may be directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another
206   publication. This call also includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending
207   U.S. or foreign patent applications relating to this ITL draft publication and of any
208   relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.
209   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its
210   behalf, in written or electronic form, either:
211      a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not
212         hold and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
213     b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available
214        to applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the
215        guidance or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:
216            i. under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
217               discrimination; or
218           ii. without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
219               demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.
220   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make
221   assurances on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents
222   subject to the assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the
223   assurance are binding on the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include
224   appropriate provisions in the event of future transfers with the goal of binding each
225   successor-in-interest.
226   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
227   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.
228   Such statements should be addressed to: mailto:dig-comments@nist.gov.
