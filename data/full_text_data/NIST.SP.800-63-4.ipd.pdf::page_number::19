      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                                 Digital Identity Guidelines

501   employ compensating or supplemental controls not specified in this publication. They
502   may also consider partitioning the functionality of a digital service to allow less sensitive
503   functions to be available at a lower level of assurance.
504   The considerations detailed below support enterprise risk management efforts and
505   encourage informed, inclusive, and human-centric service delivery. While this list of
506   considerations is not exhaustive, it highlights a set of cross-cutting factors likely to impact
507   decision-making associated with digital identity management.

508   2.3.1. Security
509   It is increasingly important for enterprise organizations to assess and manage digital
510   identity security risks, such as unauthorized access, availability issues, impersonation, and
511   other types of fraudulent claims, as well as institute strong identity governance practices.
512   As organizations consult this guidance, they should consider potential impacts to the
513   confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems that they
514   manage and that their service providers and business partners manage on behalf of the
515   individuals and communities that they serve.
516   Federal agencies implementing these guidelines need to adhere to their statutory
517   responsibilities, including those under the Federal Information Security Modernization
518   Act (FISMA) of 2014 [FISMA] and related NIST standards and guidelines. NIST
519   recommends that non-federal organizations implementing these guidelines follow
520   equivalent standards to ensure the secure operation of their digital systems.
521   FISMA requires federal agencies to implement appropriate controls to protect federal
522   information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure,
523   disruption, or modification. The NIST RMF [NISTRMF] provides a process that
524   integrates security, privacy, and cyber supply chain risk management activities into the
525   system development life cycle. It is expected that federal agencies and organizations
526   that provide services under these guidelines have already implemented the controls and
527   processes required under FISMA and associated NIST risk management processes and
528   publications.
529   The controls and requirements encompassed by the identity, authentication, and
530   federation assurance levels under these guidelines augment, but do not replace or alter,
531   the information and information system controls as determined under FISMA and the
532   RMF.

533   2.3.2. Privacy
534   When designing, engineering, and managing digital identity systems, it is imperative to
535   consider the potential of that system to create privacy-related problems for individuals
536   when processing PII — a problematic data action — and the potential impact of the
537   problematic data action should it occur. Additionally, by focusing on the privacy
