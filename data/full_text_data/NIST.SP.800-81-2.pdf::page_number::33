5.        DNS Hosting Environment—Threats, Security Objectives, and Protection
          Approaches

The DNS hosting environment consists of the following elements:

      •    Host platform (operating system [OS], file system, communication stack)

      •    DNS software (name server, resolver)

      •    DNS data (zone file, configuration file)
This section describes threats and recommended protection approaches for these portions of the hosting
environment.

5.1       Host Platform Threats

Threats to the platform that hosts DNS software are no different from threats that any host in the Internet
faces. These generic threats and their impact—viewed specifically from the point of view of DNS hosts—
are as follows:

      •    Threat T1: The OS, any system software, or any other application software on the DNS host
           could be vulnerable to attacks such as buffer overflows, resulting in denial of name resolution
           service.

      •    Threat T2: The TCP/IP stack in DNS hosts (stub resolver, caching/resolving/recursive name
           server, authoritative name server, etc.) could be subjected to packet flooding attacks (such as
           SYNC and smurf), resulting in disruption of communication. An application layer counterpart of
           this attack is to send a large number of forged DNS queries to overwhelm an authoritative or
           resolving name server.

      •    Threat T3: A malicious insider who has access to local area network (LAN) segments where
           DNS hosts reside could launch an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing attack that
           disrupts DNS message flows. 2

      •    Threat T4: The platform-level configuration file that enables communication (e.g., resolv.conf
           and host.conf in Unix platforms) can be corrupted by viruses and worms or subject to
           unauthorized modifications due to inadequate file-level protections, resulting in breakdown of
           communication among DNS hosts (e.g., between a stub resolver and a resolving name server,
           between a resolving name server and an authoritative name server).

      •    Threat T5: The DNS-specific configuration files (named.conf, root.hints, etc.), data files (zone
           file), and files containing cryptographic keys could be corrupted by viruses and worms or
           subjected to unauthorized modifications due to inadequate file-level protections, resulting in
           improper functioning of name resolution service.

      This is not strictly a host threat, but rather a network threat, which is mitigated by placing DNS servers within their own
      restricted LAN segments (e.g., via VLANs). Since generic network level threats are outside the scope of this document, this
      threat has been included since it involves a DNS parameter (i.e., IP address).
