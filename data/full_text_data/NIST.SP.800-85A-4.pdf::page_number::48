NIST SP 800-85A-4                                             PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                       INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

AS05.11: If the currently selected application is the PIV Card Application when the SELECT
command is given and the AID in the data field of the SELECT command is not the PIV Card
Application (nor the right-truncated version thereof), but a valid AID supported by the ICC,
then the PIV Card Application shall be deselected and all the PIV Card Application security
status indicators in the PIV Card Application shall be set to FALSE.

Required Vendor Information

VE05.11.01: The vendor shall provide information in its documentation validating the compliance
with the statement in AS05.11.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.11.01: The tester shall validate that when the currently selected application is the PIV Card
Application and the SELECT command is sent with a valid AID supported by the ICC that is
different from the PIV Card Application AID (or its right-truncated version), then PIV Card
Application is deselected and its security status indicators are set to FALSE.

AS05.11A-R4: A PIV Card Application may use a subset of the cryptographic algorithms
defined in SP 800-78-4. Tag 0xAC encodes the cryptographic algorithms supported by the PIV
Card Application. The encoding of tag 0xAC shall be as specified in Table 5, Part 2 of SP 800-
73-4. Each instance of tag 0x80 shall encapsulate one algorithm. The presence of algorithm
identifier '27' or '2E' indicates that the corresponding cipher suite is supported by the PIV
Card Application for secure messaging and that the PIV Card Application possesses a PIV
Secure Messaging key of the appropriate size for the specified cipher suite. Tag 0xAC shall be
present and indicate algorithm identifier 0x27 or 0x2E (but not both) when the PIV Card
Application supports secure Messaging.

Note: This assertion is tested as part of AS05.34.

A.5.1.2     GET DATA Card Command

AS05.12: The GET DATA card command retrieves the data content of the single data object
whose tag is given in the data field.

Note: This assertion is tested as part of AS05.01.

AS05.12A: The GET DATA card command retrieves the data content of the data object only
after the access rule associated with the data object (Appendix A, Table 7, Part 1 of SP 800-73-
4) evaluates to TRUE.

Required Vendor Information

VE05.12A.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the access rule for each of the data
objects or make a reference to Table 7 in Appendix A, Part 1 of SP 800-73-4.
