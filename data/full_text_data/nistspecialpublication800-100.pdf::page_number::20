     architecture requirements are adequately addressed by applying FEA and the
     Security and Privacy Profile (SPP).

2.2.3.5 Related Roles
    Many other individuals within an organization have a stake in information
security, from top senior management down to individual users. A few of the
primary senior management roles and their coinciding responsibilities are listed
below. The scope of each role will depend on whether or not these roles should be
redundant in the decentralized governance structure. These individuals should work
collaboratively to ensure that information security exists within their organizational
responsibility.
    Inspector General (IG). The IG is a statutory office within an organization that,
in addition to other responsibilities, works to assess an organization’s information
security practices and identifies vulnerabilities and the possible need to modify
security measures. The IG completes this task by:
   • Detecting fraud or instances of waste, abuse, or misuse of an organization’s
     funds;
   • Identifying operational deficiencies within the organization;
   • Ensuring that the underlying problems that permit such failings are rectified;
     and
   • Offering recommendations for preventing problems in the future.
    Chief Financial Officer. The CFO is the senior financial advisor to the
investment review board (IRB) and the agency head. Information security
investments fall within the purview of the CFO and are included in the CFO’s reports.
In this capacity, the CFO is responsible for:
   • Reviewing cost goals of each major information security investment;
   • Reporting financial management information to OMB as part of the President’s
     budget;
   • Complying with legislative and OMB-defined responsibilities as they relate to IT
     capital investments;
   • Reviewing systems that impact financial management activities; and
   • Forwarding investment assessments to the IRB.
    Chief Privacy Officer or other designated official with privacy
responsibilities. The chief privacy officer is responsible for privacy compliance
across an organization, including privacy compliance measures that apply to
information security assets and activities. The chief privacy officer works to maintain
a balance between security and privacy requirements, and works to ensure that one
is not compromised for the sake of the other. To this end, the chief privacy officer
serves as the senior official responsible for:
   • Developing, promoting, and supporting the organization’s privacy programs;
   • Encouraging awareness of potential privacy issues and policies; and
   • Reviewing and implementing privacy regulations and legislation.
    Physical Security Officer or other designated official with physical
security responsibilities. The physical security officer is responsible for the overall
implementation and management of physical security controls across an
organization, to include integration with applicable information security controls. As
information security programs are developed, senior agency officials should work to




                                                                                      11
