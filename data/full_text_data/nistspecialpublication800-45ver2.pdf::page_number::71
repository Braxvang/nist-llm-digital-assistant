A two-firewall DMZ configuration improves protection over a router-firewall DMZ, since the dedicated
firewalls can have more complex and powerful security rule sets. In addition, because a dedicated
firewall is often able to analyze incoming and outgoing mail traffic, it can detect and defend against
application layer attacks aimed at the mail server. Depending on the rule sets of the firewalls and the
level of traffic the DMZ receives, this type of DMZ may result in some performance degradation.

For organizations that desire the security of the two-firewall DMZ, but do not have the resources to
purchase two firewalls, another option exists called the “service leg” DMZ. In this configuration, a
firewall is constructed with three (or more) network interfaces. One network interface attaches to the
border router, another interface attaches to the internal network, and a third interface connects to the DMZ
(see Figure 7.3).

This configuration subjects the firewall to an increased risk of service degradation during a DoS attack
aimed at the DMZ. In the standard single-firewall DMZ network configuration discussed above, a DoS
attack against the mail server generally affects only the mail server. In a service-leg DMZ network
