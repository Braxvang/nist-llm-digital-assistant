component-ref      element –          1-n        MUST contain a reference to a check component (a component
                   component-ref                 containing check content). See Section 3.2.4.2 for information on
                                                 SCAP check system support and requirements.



                                            Table 7 - ds:extended-components

Element Name: ds:extended-components
Element            A container element that holds references to one or more extended components for the SCAP data
Definition         stream, including non-standard components.
Properties
Name               Type               Count      Property Definition
component-ref      element –          1-n        MUST contain a reference to a non-standard component (a
                   component-ref                 <ds:extended-component> element ). See Table 11.



                                               Table 8 - ds:component-ref

Element Name: ds:component-ref
Element         An element that encapsulates the information necessary to link to a component within the data stream
Definition      collection, or to external content, which gives context to the reference. This is a simple XLink [XLINK].
Properties
Name      Type            Count     Property Definition
id        literal - ID    1         The identifier for the reference. This identifier MUST be globally unique (see
                                    Section 3.1.3).
type      literal –       0-1       The type of XLink represented. The <ds:component-ref> is constrained to a
          xlink:type                simple XLink, so the value of this field MUST be ‘simple’ if specified.
href      literal –       1         A URI to the target component (either local to the data stream collection or
          xlink:href                remote). When referencing a local component, the URI MUST be in the form ‘#’ +
                                    componentId (e.g. “#component1”). When referencing external content, the URI
                                    MUST dereference to an XML stream representing the content of the target
                                    component.
catalog   element –       0-1       An XML Catalog that defines the mapping between external URI links in the
          cat:catalog               component being referenced by this <ds:component-ref>, and where those
                                    URIs should map to within the context of this data stream. See Table 9.
