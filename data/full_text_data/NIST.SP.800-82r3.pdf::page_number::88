5.2.3. Layer 3 â€“ Network Security
Building from physical security, organizations should investigate network communications and
how to protect the data and devices used to support their OT environment. This section focuses
on several foundational elements to assist organizations with planning and implementing their
network security capabilities. These include applying the network architecture principles of
segmentation and isolation, centralizing logging, network monitoring, and malicious code
protection. Additionally, this section discusses zero trust architecture (ZTA) and considerations
for applying these architecture enhancements to an OT environment.

5.2.3.1.       Network Architecture
A good practice for network architectures is to characterize, segment, and isolate IT and OT
devices. For example, devices may be segmented based on management authority, level of trust,
functional criticality, data flow, location, or other logical combinations. Organizations may also
consider using an industry-recognized model to organize their OT network segmentation, such as
the Purdue model [Williams], ISA-95 levels [IEC62264], the three-tier IIoT system architecture
[IIRA19], or a combination of these models.
