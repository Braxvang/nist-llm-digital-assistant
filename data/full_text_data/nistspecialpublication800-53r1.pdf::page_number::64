AC-4      INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT

          Control: The information system enforces assigned authorizations for controlling the flow of
          information within the system and between interconnected systems in accordance with applicable
          policy.
          Supplemental Guidance: Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel
          within an information system and between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to
          access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information. A
          few, of many, generalized examples of possible restrictions that are better expressed as flow
          control than access control are: keeping export controlled information from being transmitted in
          the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, and
          not passing any web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy. Information
          flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly employed by organizations to
          control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks,
          individuals, devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow
          control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Specific
          examples of flow control enforcement can be found in boundary protection devices (e.g., proxies,
          gateways, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls, and routers) that employ rule sets or establish
          configuration settings that restrict information system services or provide a packet filtering
          capability. Related security control: SC-7.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system implements information flow control enforcement using explicit labels on
                information, source, and destination objects as a basis for flow control decisions.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Information flow control enforcement using explicit
                labels is used, for example, to control the release of certain types of information.
          (2)   The information system implements information flow control enforcement using protected
                processing domains (e.g., domain type-enforcement) as a basis for flow control decisions.
          (3)   The information system implements information flow control enforcement using dynamic security
                policy mechanisms as a basis for flow control decisions.
