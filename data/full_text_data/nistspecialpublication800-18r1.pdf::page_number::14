                        Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


    •    Plays an active role in developing and updating the system security plan as well as
         coordinating with the information system owner any changes to the system and
         assessing the security impact of those changes.

1.7.6 Authorizing Official
The authorizing official (or designated approving/accrediting authority as referred to by
some agencies) is a senior management official or executive with the authority to
formally assume responsibility for operating an information system at an acceptable level
of risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.8 The authorizing official has
the following responsibilities related to system security plans:

    •    Approves system security plans,

    •    Authorizes operation of an information system,

    •    Issues an interim authorization to operate the information system under specific
         terms and conditions, or

    •    Denies authorization to operate the information system (or if the system is already
         operational, halts operations) if unacceptable security risks exist.


1.8 Rules of Behavior
The rules of behavior, which are required in OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, and is a
security control contained in NIST SP 800-53, should clearly delineate responsibilities
and expected behavior of all individuals with access to the system. The rules should state
the consequences of inconsistent behavior or noncompliance and be made available to
every user prior to receiving authorization for access to the system. It is required that the
rules contain a signature page for each user to acknowledge receipt, indicating that they
have read, understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior. Electronic signatures
are acceptable for use in acknowledging the rules of behavior.

Figure 2 lists examples from OMB Circular A-130 Appendix III of what should be
covered in typical rules of behavior. These are examples only and agencies have
flexibility in the detail and contents. When developing the rules of behavior, keep in mind
that the intent is to make all users accountable for their actions by acknowledging that
they have read, understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior. The rules should
not be a complete copy of the security policy or procedures guide, but rather cover, at a
high level, some of the controls described in the following Figure.

  In some agencies, the senior official and the Chief Information Officer may be co-authorizing officials. In
this situation, the senior official approves the operation of the information system prior to the Chief
Information Officer.
