       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                         Authentication and Lifecycle Management


2160            – Allow at least 10 entry attempts for authenticators requiring the entry of the
2161              authenticator output by the user. The longer and more complex the entry text,
2162              the greater the likelihood of user entry errors.
2163            – Provide clear, meaningful feedback on the number of remaining allowed
2164              attempts. For rate limiting (i.e., throttling), inform users how long they have to
2165              wait until the next attempt to reduce confusion and frustration.
2166       • Minimize the impact of form-factor constraints, such as limited touch and display
2167         areas on mobile devices:
2168            – Larger touch areas improve usability for text entry since typing on small
2169              devices is significantly more error prone and time consuming than typing
2170              on a full-size keyboard. The smaller the onscreen keyboard, the more difficult
2171              it is to type, due to the size of the input mechanism (e.g., a finger) relative to
2172              the size of the on-screen target.
2173            – Follow good user interface and information design for small displays.
2174   Intermittent events include events such as reauthentication, subscriber account lock-out,
2175   expiration, revocation, damage, loss, theft, and non-functional software.
2176   Usability considerations for intermittent events across authenticator types include:
2177       • To prevent users from needing to reauthenticate due to user inactivity, prompt users
2178         in order to trigger activity just before (e.g., 2 minutes) an inactivity timeout would
2179         otherwise occur.
2180       • Prompt users with adequate time (e.g., 1 hour) to save their work before the fixed
2181         periodic reauthentication event required regardless of user activity.
2182       • Clearly communicate how and where to acquire technical assistance. For example,
2183         provide users with information such as a link to an online self-service feature, chat
2184         sessions or a phone number for help desk support. Ideally, sufficient information
2185         can be provided to enable users to recover from intermittent events on their own
2186         without outside intervention.

2187   10.2. Usability Considerations by Authenticator Type
2188   In addition to the previously described general usability considerations applicable to most
2189   authenticators (Sec. 10.1), the following sections describe other usability considerations
2190   specific to particular authenticator types.

2191   10.2.1. Memorized Secrets
2192   Typical Usage
2193   Users manually input the memorized secret (commonly referred to as a password or PIN).
2194   Usability considerations for typical usage include:

                                                    64
