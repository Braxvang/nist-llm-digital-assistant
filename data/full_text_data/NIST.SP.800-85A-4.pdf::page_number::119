                               1. The command returns '90 00' (verify that the retry counter
                                  is set to reset retry value).
                               2. The command returns '90 00' (verify that the retry counter
                                  is set to reset retry value).
                               3. The command returns an error status word.
                         2d:
                               1. The command returns '63 00' (verification failed).
                               2. The command returns '69 82' (security status not satisfied).
                               3. The command returns either '63 00' (verification failed) or
                                   '6A 80' (incorrect parameter in command data field).
                               4. The command returns '69 82' (security status not satisfied).
                               5. The command returns either '63 00' (verification failed) or
                                   '6A 80' (incorrect parameter in command data field).
                               6. The command returns '69 82' (security status not satisfied).
                               7. The command returns '90 00'.
                               8. The command returns the Card Capability Container
                                   object along with the status word '90 00'.
                               9. The command returns '90 00'.
                               10. The command returns '69 82' (security status not satisfied).
 Postcondition(s)     N/A

C.2.1.4        Virtual Contact Interface
 Purpose               Verify the behavior of the VERIFY command under VCI is identical
                       to the contact interface.
 Reference(s)          1. SP 800-73-4 Part 2, Section 3.2.1
                       2. SP 800-73-4 Part 1, Table 4
                       3. AS01.17, AS05.01, and AS05.12 through AS05.22A
 Precondition(s)       1. The IUT is placed within the reading range of the contactless
                           reader.
                       2. There exists a valid PC/SC connection between the test system
                           and the contactless reader.
                       3. No other contactless card is within the proximity of the reader.
                       4. The PIV Card Application is the currently selected application.
                       5. PIV Card Application PIN is recorded.
                       6. Global PIN (if supported) is recorded.
                       7. Cardholder fingerprint minutia for on-card comparison is
                           recorded (if OCC is implemented).
                       8. The reset retry counter value(s) (maximum number of tries
                           allowed) of the PIV Card Application PIN, Global PIN (if
                           implemented), OCC (if implemented) are recorded.
                       9. There exists a valid VCI connection to the card.
 Test Scenario         Repeat steps 2, 2a, 2b, 2c from the Test C.2.1.1 using the
                      '0C' CLA byte
