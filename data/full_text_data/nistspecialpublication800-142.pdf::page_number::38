Figure 17.                      The test array covers all possible 2­way combinations of a, b, c,
                                             and d to different levels.
Figure 18 is an example of coverage for a 2873245 set (87 binary, two 3-value, and five 4­
value) of input variables (blue=2-way, pink=3-way, yellow=4-way). This particular test set
was not a covering array, but pairwise coverage is still quite good, with about 95% of the
variables having all possible 2-way configurations covered. Even for 4-way combinations
we see that all variables have at least 28% of their configurations covered, and about 25%
of them have about 98% or more of 4-way configurations covered. Figure 19 shows a
similar plot for a 27931416191 configuration.
