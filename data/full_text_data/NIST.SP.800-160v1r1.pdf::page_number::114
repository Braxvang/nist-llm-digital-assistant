A more complex design increases uncertainty. Such uncertainty leads to errors and hinders acquiring
confidence in the understanding of the design. A complex design is also more prone to erroneous
interpretation when conducting the engineering activities of analysis, implementation, and verification
throughout the system life cycle [45]. Thus, reduced design complexity contributes to confidence in the
technical understanding of the design, enabling more informed trade decisions and decreasing uncertainty
in the design and the subsequent realization of the design as a system.
Complexity also increases the difficulty in identifying and assessing loss scenarios, susceptibilities, and
vulnerabilities. Conclusions about the nature and effect of vulnerabilities can be reached with a higher
degree of assurance in cases of reduced design complexity in contrast to cases where the design is overly
complex.
The principle of reduced complexity may also be referred to as the principle of simplification or least
common mechanism.

E.26. Redundancy
Principle: The system design delivers the required capability by replication of system functions
or elements.
Note: Redundancy employs multiples of the same system elements, data and control flows, or paths to
avoid single points of failure. Redundancy requires a strategy for how multiple system elements are used
individually or in combination (e.g., load-balancing, fail-over, concurrently, backup, voting, agreement,
consensus).
Redundant solutions are susceptible to common mode failure (i.e., a single event that results in the same
or equivalent elements failing in the same manner). Diversity is a means to address the concerns of
common mode failure.

E.27. Self-Reliant Trustworthiness
Principle: The trustworthiness of a system element is achieved with minimal dependence on
other elements.
Note: In the ideal case, the trustworthiness of a system element occurs when the claim of trustworthiness
is not dependent on protection from another system element. If an element is dependent on other elements
to satisfy its trustworthiness claims, then that elementâ€™s trustworthiness is susceptible to any loss or
degradation of the protection capability provided by the other element. The considerations for the extent
to which a system element exhibits self-reliant trustworthiness include:
-   The trustworthiness objective for the capability
-   The trustworthiness of the system element in providing the capability
-   The extent to which the capability provided by a system element is dependent on another element
-   The extent to which the trustworthiness associated with a capability is dependent on another system
    element
An argument for self-reliant trustworthiness can be applied at the discrete system element level, at the
level of an aggregate of elements, at the system level, or at the system of systems level. In all cases, the
distinction between the capability provided and the trustworthiness responsibility for that capability must
