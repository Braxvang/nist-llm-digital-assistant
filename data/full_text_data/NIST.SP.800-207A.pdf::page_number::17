   •   ID-SEG-REC-5: End user to resource authorization — As part of each service access
       request, the system must ensure that the authenticated end user principal (ID-SEG-REC-
       4) is authorized to act on the resources designated in the request. This authorization may
       be performed by the application itself or checked locally (e.g., by checking against a set
       of claims in a JWT) or externally against an authorization system’s policy decision point.
       The JWT libraries that process the token must be enabled to both decode (base64url
       encoding) and verify the signature. Enforcing end user authorization via the service
       mesh’s sidecar PEP is particularly effective [3].
Context for the application of these policy recommendations and the improved security
assurance that emanates from their deployment and enforcement are explained in [2] and [3].

       Limitations of Identity-Based Segmentation Policies for Enterprise ZTA
While identity-based segmentation is powerful, purely identity-based policies cannot currently
be adopted due to the following scenarios:
   •   Identity-based segmentation policies can include access scenarios that cover all origins
       (e.g., users, services) and all target resources that consist of services and data. However,
       enterprise scenarios that involve both on-premises and cloud-based applications require
       identification of the location of those resources using network parameters. Purely
       identity-based enforcement should by augmented by other factors (e.g., network location)
       to evaluate risk when performing context-based authorization.
   •   A subset of identity-based segmentation policies (i.e., service identity-based) can be
       difficult to administer since service identity assignments are often based on specific
       domains, which makes consistent policy deployment difficult across on-premises
       systems, cloud-based systems, and different compute runtimes. However, this is
       mitigated by adopting consistent service names across the infrastructure using the
       concept of a universal identity domain, as recommended in SM-DR11 of [2].
   •   Having network-level policies alone requires high maintenance due to the continuous
       changes to their location parameters as containers and virtualized workloads are
       frequently migrated for availability and performance reasons (e.g., migration to different
       VMs or to a different pod in containerized applications).
Network-tier policies cannot be completely eliminated given current compliance requirements
(e.g., PCI/DSS) and regulations. However, relaxing requirements at the network level in
exchange for introducing more descriptive policy at the identity level could lead to an improved
overall security posture compared to network-tier security alone.

       Multi-Tier Policies for Enterprise ZTA
 A successful enterprise ZTA requires multi-tier policies that combine network-tier and identity-
tier policies:
