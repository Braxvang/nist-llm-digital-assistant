                                                                                           GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



2.2.1   SSL Portal VPNs

An SSL portal VPN allows a user to use a single standard SSL connection to a Web site to securely
access multiple network services. The site accessed is typically called a portal because it has a single
page that leads to many other resources. SSL portal VPNs act as transport-layer VPNs that work over a
single network port, namely the TCP port for SSL-protected HTTP (443).

The remote user accesses the SSL VPN gateway using any modern Web browser, identifies himself or
herself to the gateway using an authentication method supported by the gateway, and then is presented
with a Web page that acts as the portal to the other services. These other services might be links to other
Web servers, shared file directories, Web-based email systems, applications that run on protected servers,
and any other services that can be channeled through a Web page.

To the user, an SSL portal VPN is a Web site with more options of services available after the user has
authenticated. To access an SSL portal VPN, the user enters the portal’s URL in a Web browser just as
the user would enter the URL for any other Web page. These URLs typically use the https: scheme to
start SSL immediately, but many SSL VPNs allow users to first enter an http: URL that then redirects to a
secure SSL port.

SSL portal VPNs work with essentially any modern Web browser. Specifically, they work with browsers
whether or not the browsers allow (or support) active content. Thus, SSL portal VPNs are accessible to
more users than SSL tunnel VPNs.

2.2.2   SSL Tunnel VPNs

An SSL tunnel VPN allows a user to use a typical Web browser to securely access multiple network
services through a tunnel that is running under SSL. SSL tunnel VPNs require that the Web browser be
able to handle specific types of active content (e.g., Java, JavaScript, Flash, or ActiveX) and that the user
be able to run them. (Most browsers that handle such applications and plug-ins also allow the user or
administrator to block them from being executed.)

The “tunnel” in an SSL tunnel VPN is both similar and quite different from the tunnels seen in typical
IPsec VPNs. The two types of tunnels are similar in that almost all IP traffic is fully protected by the
tunnel, giving the user full access to services on the network protected by the VPN gateway. The tunnels
are quite different in that SSL/VPN tunnels are usually created in SSL using a non-standard tunneling
method, while IPsec tunnels are created with methods described in the IPsec standard.

The tunneling in an SSL tunnel VPN allows a wide variety of protocols and applications to be run
through it. For example, essentially any protocol that runs over TCP or UDP can be tunneled through
such a gateway, making the remote user’s experience of the protected network very similar to being
directly on the network. To the user, an SSL tunnel VPN may appear quite different from a typical Web
site because the tunneling plug-in or application needs to be loaded into the user’s browser before the user
can access the VPN. This might involve warning messages about the software being loaded, and it could
also prevent users from entering the VPN if their Web browsers are instructed not to allow such programs
to run. Because of the active content requirement, SSL tunnel VPNs may be accessible to fewer users
than SSL portal VPNs.

2.2.3   Administering SSL VPNs

The administration of both SSL portal VPNs and SSL tunnel VPNs is similar. The gateway administrator
needs to specify local policy in at least two broad areas:
