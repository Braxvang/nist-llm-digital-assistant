Special Publication 800-79-2                             Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



directly impact other organizations. For example, an interoperable credential issued by an
authorized organization becomes the source of trust for another organization to grant access to
physical and logical resources, based on verification of that identity. The DAO’s signature on the
authorization letter thus signifies his/her acceptance of responsibility (i.e., accountability) for the
operations of the issuer, not only to the issuing organization, but also to other organizations that
are in the federated circle of trust.

2.11 Authorization Submission Package and Supporting Documentation

The authorization submission package documents the results of the assessment phase and
provides the DAO with the essential information needed to make a credible, risk-based decision
on whether to authorize operation of the issuer. Unless specifically designated otherwise by the
DAO, the OIMO is responsible for the assembly, compilation, and presentation of the
authorization submission package. The authorization submission package contains the following
documents:

       operations plan (including all Issuing Facilities Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
        and attachments);
       [SP 800-37-1] authorization letters;
       assessment report; and
       Corrective Actions Plan (CAP) (if required).

The operations plan contains the policies, procedures, and processes for all the major PIV
functional areas. The operations plan provides a complete picture of the structure, management,
and operations of an issuer to the Assessor and DAO. Appendix D provides templates of what to
include in the operations plan for PIV Card Issuers and for Derived PIV Credential Issuers. One
of the most significant pieces of information contained within the operations plan is the list of
issuer controls, how they were implemented, and who is responsible for their management. This
description of the issuer controls makes it a simple process for the Assessor to quickly ascertain
how they were implemented and by whom.

If certain functions described in the operations plan are outsourced, the operation plan can
reference or “point to” the external service provider’s operation plan and related documentation,
such as support agreements and any contracts. In this manner, the Assessor has access to the
information regarding the external service provider’s operations without requiring the issuer to
duplicate any documentation. Upon receiving and reviewing the authorization package and in
consultation with the Assessor, the DAO decides whether to authorize operations of the issuer.
The authorization decision letter transmits the authorization decision from the DAO to the
OIMO. The authorization decision letter contains the following information:

       Authorization decision;
       Supporting rationale for the decision; and
       Terms and conditions for the authorization, including which issuing facilities
        (Authorization Boundary) are included.
