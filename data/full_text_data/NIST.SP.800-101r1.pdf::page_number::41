                                                                          Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

                 Explosives and Booby Traps – Mobile devices may be rigged to detonate bombs
                  remotely or explode themselves if a specific action is carried out on the device (e.g.,
                  receiving an incoming call, text message or pressing a specific key chord sequence,
                  etc.).14

                 Alarms – Many mobile devices have an audible alarm feature. The alarm function is
                  capable of powering on an inactive device, establishing network connectivity and the
                  potential for a remote wipe.

      The following sections 4.3.1 through 4.3.3 discuss the use and characteristics of radio isolation
      containers and cellular network isolation techniques.

4.3.1 Radio Isolation Containers

      A field test on the effectiveness of various mobile phone shielding devices (i.e., a tool designed
      to act as a Faraday cage) was conducted at Purdue University. There are many shielding
      devices that claim to radio isolate a mobile device unfortunately these tools do not always
      successfully prevent network communication [Kat10]. The tests conducted at Purdue used
      multiple shielding devices with mobile devices operating over three of the largest U.S.
      providers while varying the distance from the provider’s towers.

      The majority of the test cases proved that the shielding devices tested did not prevent network
      communication in all cases, and SMS messages most often penetrated the device while
      shielded, followed by voice calls and MMS messages. Three reasons why the shielding
      devices may fail are due to: the materials not providing enough attenuation, leaks or seams in
      the shield or the conductive shield acting as an antenna.

      While many manufacturers claim the effectiveness of their shielding device it is important to
      understand the effectiveness of the isolation device is based upon attenuating signal between
      specific decibels. Therefore, the effectiveness of the isolation containers tested were not 100%
      effective in most cases and devices used to preserve evidence require verification.

      Some of the products mentioned in the above paper have since been improved to provide a
      more effective radio isolation solution. Examiners should test their own products to validate
      that they are working properly before use.

4.3.2 Cellular Network Isolation Techniques

      A number of techniques exist for isolating a mobile device from cell tower communications
      [INT06]. The device should be fully charged prior to examination and consideration should be
      given to having a fixed or portable power source attached. The following provides an overview
      of various cellular network isolation techniques.

                 Cellular Network Isolation Card (CNIC) - A CNIC mimics the identity of the original
                  UICC and prevents network access to/from the handset. Such cards prevent the
                  handset from erasing call log data due to a foreign SIM being inserted. This technique
                  permits acquisition without concern of wireless interference.
