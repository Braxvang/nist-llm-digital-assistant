D.2.10.        NIST Cybersecurity for Smart Grid Systems Project
Smart grid cybersecurity must address both inadvertent compromises of the electric
infrastructure due to user error, equipment failures, and natural disasters, as well as deliberate
attacks, such as from disgruntled employees, industrial espionage, and terrorists. NIST will
address these challenges through research conducted in the NIST Smart Grid Testbed facility and
leadership within the Smart Electric Power Alliance (SEPA) Cybersecurity Committee (SGCC)
to evaluate cybersecurity policies and measures in industry standards and develop relevant
guidance documents for the smart grid cybersecurity community. The primary goal is to develop
a cybersecurity risk management strategy for the smart grid to enable secure interoperability of
solutions across different domains and components. The Cybersecurity for Smart Grid Systems
Project is moving forward to address critical cybersecurity needs by promoting the technology
transfer of best practices, standards, voluntary guidance, and research in the areas of applied
cryptography and cybersecurity for microgrids. This project will provide foundational
cybersecurity guidance, cybersecurity reviews and recommendations for standards and
requirements, outreach, and collaborations in the cross-cutting issue of cybersecurity in the smart
grid.

D.2.11.        NIST Cybersecurity for Smart Manufacturing Systems Project
The Cybersecurity for Smart Manufacturing Systems project develops cybersecurity
implementation methods, metrics, and tools to enable manufacturers to implement cybersecurity
capabilities in smart manufacturing systems while addressing the demanding performance,
reliability, and safety requirements of these systems.

D.2.12.    NIST Reliable, High Performance Wireless Systems for Factory
   Automation
The Reliable, High Performance Wireless Systems for Factory Automation project develops
robust requirements, system models, recommended architectures, and guidelines for the
integration of trustworthy wireless systems within a factory workcell where wireless is the
primary mode of communication enabling robot mobility and ease of installation of edge
devices.
