386   a certificate that is nearing expiration. Certificate modification is used to replace a
387   certificate if information about the subscriber that appears in the certificate, such as their
388   name, needs to be changed.
389   While non-PKI-based derived PIV credentials are not typically re-keyed and do not
390   contain PII about the subscriber, they may require maintenance, such as replacing the
391   activation secret or biometric factor used to activate the physical authenticator. Instead
392   of re-keying, the current non-PKI-based derived PIV credential SHALL be invalidated
393   and the initial issuance process (except for the device or authenticator approval process)
394   repeated to bind a new derived PIV credential. When a non-PKI-based derived PIV
395   credential is lost, stolen, or damaged, the issuer SHALL invalidate the credential to
396   prevent its further use.
397   When an authenticator that contains the private key corresponding to a PKI-based derived
398   PIV credential is lost, stolen, or damaged, the issuer SHALL prevent further use of the
399   affected credential by either collecting and destroying the associated private key or by
400   revoking the associated certificate. These processes are described in Sec. 2.4. If the
401   subscriber becomes ineligible to possess a PIV Card, all derived PIV credentials for that
402   subscriber are revoked or otherwise invalidated.

403   2.2. Initial Issuance
404   The issuance of a derived PIV credential is an instance of the post-enrollment binding
405   of an authenticator described in [SP800-63B]. Issuance SHALL be performed in
406   accordance with the requirements that apply to cryptographic authenticators as well as
407   the requirements in this section. The term issuance is used in cases where the device or
408   authenticator is provided to the subscriber as well as when the device or authenticator is
