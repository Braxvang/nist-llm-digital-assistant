 Remote Maintenance                  Maintenance activities conducted by individuals communicating
                                     through an external, non-organization-controlled network (e.g.,
                                     the Internet).
 Risk                                The level of impact on organizational operations (including
 [FIPS 200]                          mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, or
                                     individuals resulting from the operation of an information system
                                     given the potential impact of a threat and the likelihood of that
                                     threat occurring.
 Risk Assessment                     The process of identifying risks to agency operations (including
 [NIST SP 800-30, Adapted]           mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, or
                                     individuals arising through the operation of the information
                                     system. Part of risk management, synonymous with risk analysis,
                                     incorporates threat and vulnerability analyses, and considers
                                     mitigations provided by planned or in place security controls.
 Risk Management                     The process of managing risks to organizational operations
 [FIPS 200]                          (including mission, functions, image, or reputation),
                                     organizational assets, or individuals resulting from the operation
                                     of an information system, and includes: (i) the conduct of a risk
                                     assessment; (ii) the implementation of a risk mitigation strategy;
                                     and (iii) employment of techniques and procedures for the
                                     continuous monitoring of the security state of the information
                                     system.
 Safeguards                          Protective measures prescribed to meet the security requirements
 [CNSS Inst. 4009, Adapted]          (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability) specified for an
                                     information system. Safeguards may include security features,
                                     management constraints, personnel security, and security of
                                     physical structures, areas, and devices. Synonymous with security
                                     controls and countermeasures.
 Scoping Guidance                    Provides organizations with specific policy/regulatory-related,
                                     technology-related, physical infrastructure-related,
                                     operational/environmental-related, public access-related,
                                     scalability-related, common security control-related, and security
                                     objective-related considerations on the applicability and
                                     implementation of individual security controls in the control
                                     baseline.
 Security Category                   The characterization of information or an information system
 [FIPS 199]                          based on an assessment of the potential impact that a loss of
                                     confidentiality, integrity, or availability of such information or
                                     information system would have on organizational operations,
                                     organizational assets, or individuals.
 Security Controls                   The management, operational, and technical controls (i.e.,
 [FIPS 199]                          safeguards or countermeasures) prescribed for an information
                                     system to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
                                     the system and its information.
 Security Control Baseline           The set of minimum security controls defined for a low-impact,
 [FIPS 200]                          moderate-impact, or high-impact information system.
