destruction (e.g., repeatedly overwriting data with random values) and physical destruction (e.g.,
shredding media, degaussing hard drives). 61

5.5      Provide Other Operational Support

In addition to the operational processes described earlier in this section, infrastructure and system-level
administrators need to provide additional types of support for logging operations. They should perform
the following actions regularly:

       Monitor the logging status of all log sources to ensure that each source is enabled, configured
        properly, and functioning as expected.
       Monitor log rotation and archival processes to ensure that logs are archived and cleared correctly
        and that old logs are destroyed once they are no longer needed. Log rotation monitoring should
        also include regular checks through automated or manual means of the remaining space available
        for logs. 62
       Check for upgrades and patches for logging software; acquire, test, and deploy the updates.
       Ensure that each system’s clock is synched to a common time source so that its timestamps will
        match those generated by other systems.
       Reconfigure logging as needed based on factors such as policy changes, audit findings,
        technology changes, and new security needs.
       Document anomalies detected in log settings, configurations, and processes. Such anomalies
        might indicate malicious activity, deviations from policy and procedures, and flaws in logging
        mechanisms. System-level administrators should report anomalies to infrastructure
        administrators.
5.6      Perform Testing and Validation

Organizations should perform testing and validation activities periodically to confirm that the
organization’s logging policies, processes, and procedures are being followed properly both at the
infrastructure level and the system level throughout the organization. Log management audits can
identify deficiencies in policies, procedures, technology, and training that can then be addressed. Audits
can also be helpful in identifying effective practices, such as particular configuration or filtering settings,
that may be beneficial for use on other systems.

The most common techniques for testing and validating logging are as follows:

       Passive. Auditors or others performing testing and validation can review the logging
        configuration and settings, as well as the system logs, infrastructure logs, and archived logs, for a
        representative sampling of systems and infrastructure servers to ensure that they comply with
        policies and procedures.
       Active. Auditors (or security administrators under the direction of auditors) or others performing
        testing and validation can create security events on a representative sampling of systems through

      Many administrators place log files on a separate partition. This helps to ensure that disk space intended to be used for logs
      is not unexpectedly consumed by user data and other files on the system. Also, administrators can monitor the free space
      available for logs more easily by having the logs in a single location.
