SP 800-152                                                    A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


6.6.4 Key-Establishment Protocols
Several protocols have been developed for the establishment of cryptographic keys. Often,
these protocols are designed for a particular application or set of applications (e.g., secure
email or secure data file transfer).

A high-level overview of several key-establishment protocols can be found in [SP 800-57
Part 3], along with guidance as to which cryptographic options are recommended for U.S.
Government use. In this document (i.e., SP 800-152), these protocols are referred to as NIST-
allowed key-establishment protocols.

FR:6.87 The CKMS design shall specify all the protocols that are employed by the CKMS
for key establishment and storage purposes.

                            When key establishment is required, a Federal CKMS shall
PR:6.72
                            use a NIST-allowed key-establishment protocol.

6.7    Restricting Access to Key and Metadata Management Functions

Access to an FCKMS’s key and metadata management functions should be supported for
authorized entities and controlled to prevent unauthorized access to keys and metadata. An
entity requesting an FCKMS service or initiating a cryptographic function should be
authenticated, and that entity’s authorization should be verified (see the Section 5
requirements).

6.7.1 The Access Control System (ACS)
An access control system is needed by an FCKMS to assure that every key and metadata
management function can only be initiated by the FCKMS itself or in response to a request
by an authorized entity. When key-management functions are initiated by an entity, an access
control system must assure that the initiator is authenticated (i.e., by means of identity-based
authentication or role-based authentication), performing only the requested functions that are
authorized, and that all applicable constraints are satisfied. See Section 6.7.1 of the
Framework for additional discussion.

FR:6.88 The CKMS design shall specify the topology of the CKMS by indicating the
locations of the entities, the ACS, the function logic, and the connections between them.

FR:6.89 The CKMS design shall specify the constraints on the key management functions
that are implemented to assure proper operation.

FR:6.90 The CKMS design shall specify how access to the key management functions is
restricted to authorized entities.

FR:6.91 The CKMS design shall specify the ACS and its policy for controlling access to key
management functions.

FR:6.92 The CKMS design shall specify at a minimum:

       a) The granularity of the entities (e.g., person, device, organization),
