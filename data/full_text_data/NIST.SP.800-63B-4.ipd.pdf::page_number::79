       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                         Authentication and Lifecycle Management


2262            – If the single-factor OTP device supplies its output via an electronic interface
2263              (e.g, USB) this is preferable since users do not have to manually enter the
2264              authenticator output. However, if a physical input (e.g., pressing a button)
2265              is required to operate, the location of the USB ports could pose usability
2266              difficulties. For example, the USB ports of some computers are located on
2267              the back of the computer and will be difficult for users to reach.
2268            – Limited availability of a direct computer interface such as a USB port could
2269              pose usability difficulties. For example, the number of USB ports on laptop
2270              computers is often very limited. This may force users to unplug other USB
2271              peripherals in order to use the single-factor OTP device.

2272   10.2.5. Multi-Factor OTP Device
2273   Typical Usage
2274   Users access the OTP generated by the multi-factor OTP device through a second
2275   authentication factor. The OTP is typically displayed on the device and the user manually
2276   enters it for the verifier. The second authentication factor may be achieved through
2277   some kind of integral entry pad to enter a memorized secret, an integral biometric
2278   (e.g., fingerprint) reader, or a direct computer interface (e.g., USB port). Usability
2279   considerations for the additional factor apply as well — see Sec. 10.2.1 for memorized
2280   secrets and Sec. 10.4 for biometrics used in multi-factor authenticators.
2281   Usability considerations for typical usage include:
2282       • User experience during manual entry of the authenticator output.
2283            – For time-based OTP, provide a grace period in addition to the time during
2284              which the OTP is displayed. Users need adequate time to enter the
2285              authenticator output, including looking back and forth between the multi-
2286              factor OTP device and the entry screen.
2287            – Consider form-factor constraints if users must unlock the multi-factor OTP
2288              device via an integral entry pad or enter the authenticator output on mobile
2289              devices. Typing on small devices is significantly more error prone and time-
2290              consuming than typing on a traditional keyboard. The smaller the integral
2291              entry pad and onscreen keyboard, the more difficult it is to type. Providing
2292              larger touch areas improves usability for unlocking the multi-factor OTP
2293              device or entering the authenticator output on mobile devices.
2294            – Limited availability of a direct computer interface like a USB port could pose
2295              usability difficulties. For example, laptop computers often have a limited
2296              number of USB ports, which may force users to unplug other USB peripherals
2297              to use the multi-factor OTP device.
