AS03.09-R4: If OCC is implemented, the export of the biometric reference data shall not be
allowed.

Required Vendor Information

VE03.09-R4.01: The vendor shall state in its documentation that the exportation of the biometric
reference data is not allowed by the card.

Required Test Procedures

TE03.09-R4.01: The tester shall review the vendorâ€™s documentation and validate that the
exportation of the biometric reference data is not allowed by the card.

A.4         Client Application Programming Interface

A.4.1            Entry Points for Communication

AS04.01: Entry points on the PIV client API shall include all functions listed in Table 1, Part
3 of SP 800-73-4 for middleware that supports secure messaging. For middleware that does not
support secure messaging entry points on the PIV client API shall include all functions listed in
Table 1, Part 3 of SP 800-73-4 with the exception of pivEstablishSecureMessaging.

Note: This assertion is tested as part of AS04.02 through AS04.10A-R4.

Required Vendor Information & Required Test Procedures

To test the entry points or commands that are supported by the PIV Middleware the only information
that the vendor has to provide is the PIV Middleware version. All parameter values for exercising
the commands have to be obtained from the vendor documentation, using the mapping of PIV
Middleware functions to the PIV Card Application card commands that are listed in Table A-1
below. Hence this section contains only tester requirements in terms of Required Test Procedures.

  It is assumed that some of these functions will use GET RESPONSE and chaining to accomplish the read or write to
the card.
