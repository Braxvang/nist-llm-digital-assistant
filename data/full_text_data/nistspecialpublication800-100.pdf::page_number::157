Q. What is an ISA?
A. An Interconnection Security Agreement (ISA) is an agreement established
   between the organizations that own and operate connected information systems
   to document the technical requirements of the interconnection. The ISA is a
   security document that specifies the requirements for connecting the information
   systems, describes the security controls that will be used to protect the systems
   and data, and contains a topographical drawing of the interconnection. It is a
   commitment between the owners of two systems to abide by specific rules of
   behavior. These rules are discretionary and should be based on risk.

Q. What are the components of ISA?
A. An ISA should contain a cover sheet followed by a document of four numbered
   sections. The information presented within those four sections should address the
   need for the interconnection and the security controls required and implemented
   to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the systems and data.
   The extent of the information should be sufficient for the two OAs to make a
   prudent decision about approving the interconnection. The four sections are as
   follows:
   • Section 1: Interconnection Statement of Requirements;
   • Section 2: Systems Security Considerations;
   • Section 3: Topological Drawing; and
   • Section 4: Signatory Authority.

Q. What is an MOU/MOA?
A. A Memorandum of Understanding/Memorandum of Agreement (MOU/MOA) is a
   document that defines the responsibilities of two or more organizations in
   establishing, operating, and securing a system interconnection. It defines the
   purpose of the interconnection, identifies relevant authorities, specifies the
   responsibilities of each organization, defines the apportionment of costs, and
   identifies the timeline for terminating or reauthorizing the interconnection. The
