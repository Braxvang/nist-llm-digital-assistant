Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the customer service information. The
effects of disruption of access to or use of customer service information can usually be In
addition, customer service operations are not typically tolerant of delay. Even temporary loss of
availability of customer service information is likely to disrupt customer operations. In most
cases, disruption of access to customer service information can be expected to have only a
limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: While most outages will result in only
limited adverse effects on government operations, repeated outages can have a serious adverse
effect on public confidence in the agency. In such cases, the availability impact might be
moderate.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
customer service information is low.
C.2.6.2 Official Information Dissemination Information Type

Official Information Dissemination includes all efforts to provide official government
information to external stakeholders through the use of various types of media, such as video,
paper, web, etc. The recommended security categorization for the official information
dissemination information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of official information
dissemination information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide official Federal
government information to external stakeholders through the use of various communications
media. Official information dissemination information is usually in the public domain and poses
no confidentiality impact.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for official information dissemination information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In general, the
adverse effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of official information dissemination
information on overall agency mission functions will be limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: There is a potential for customer actions
taken based on modified or incomplete information. In addition, unauthorized modification or
destruction of official information dissemination information may result in distribution of false
and misleading information (e.g., modified web pages, electronic mail, video). Such events can
adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency. This can significantly degrade
the official information dissemination mission capability. In such cases, a moderate integrity
