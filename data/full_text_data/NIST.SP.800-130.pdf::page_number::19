2.6 CKMS Profiles
A CKMS Profile specifies requirements that a qualifying CKMS, its implementation, and
its operation must meet for a particular sector of organizations, such as Federal Agencies.
A CKMS Profile specifies how the CKMS must be designed, implemented, tested,
evaluated, and operated. A sector is a group of organizations that have common
requirements for a product, system, or service. A CKMS Profile is a set of requirements
concerning security and interoperability that must be satisfied by a CKMS as
implemented in an operational system. This Framework may be used to derive a specific
CKMS Profile for a particular sector. As with the Framework, one or more Profile
Requirements correspond to each Profile Topic.

2.7 CKMS Framework and Derived Profile
Figure 4 depicts the relationship between the CKMS Framework and a derived sector
Profile. When deriving a CKMS Profile from a Framework, the requirements of the
Framework could be augmented and refined to meet the needs of the selected sector. For
example, NIST could use this Framework to develop a Federal CKMS Profile for U.S.
Federal Government agencies by selecting certain standards and protocols that comply
with applicable Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), NIST Special
Publications (SPs), and guidelines as necessary to meet the refined requirements.
