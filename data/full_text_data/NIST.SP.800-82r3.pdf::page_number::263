            EXCEPTION

OT Discussion: The organization implements least functionality by allowing only the specified
functions, protocols, and/or services required for OT operations. For non-routable protocols,
such as serial communications, interrupts could be disabled or set points could be made read-
only except for privileged users to limit functionality. Ports are part of the address space in
network protocols and are often associated with specific protocols or functions. For routable
protocols, ports can be disabled on many networking devices to limit functionality to the
minimum required for operation.
Control Enhancement: (1) (2) No OT Discussion.
Control Enhancement: (5) OT Discussion: The set of applications that run in OT is relatively
static, making allowlisting practical. DHS recommends using application allowlisting for OT
equipment.
