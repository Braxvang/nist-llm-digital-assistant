3.        Typical Commercial Terms of Service

A consumer’s terms of service for a cloud are determined by a legally binding agreement between the two
parties often contained in two parts: (1) a service agreement, and (2) a Service Level Agreement (SLA).
Generally, the service agreement is a legal document specifying the rules of the legal contract between a
consumer and provider, and the SLA is a shorter document stating the technical performance promises
made by a provider including remedies for performance failures. For simplicity, this publication refers to
the combination of these two documents as a service agreement. 4

Service Agreements of various types exist. Service agreements are sometimes used internally between
the information systems units and other organizational units of an enterprise to ensure that the information
technology services provided are aligned with the mission objectives of the organization. Service
agreements are normally not used in agreements for services acquired by one government organization
from another. Instead, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA) is
typically used to codify the terms of service.

Section 3 discusses certain elements of typical commercial cloud service agreements that directly express
the quality of service and security that providers offer. Although the self-service aspect of clouds as
defined in the Section 2 implies that a consumer either: (1) accepts a provider’s pricing and other terms,
or (2) finds a provider with more acceptable terms, potential consumers anticipating heavy use of cloud
resources may be able to negotiate more favorable terms. For the typical consumer, however, a cloud’s
pricing policy and service agreement are nonnegotiable.

Published service agreements between consumers and providers can typically be terminated at any time
by either party, either “for cause” such as a consumer’s violation of a cloud’s acceptable use policies, or
for failure of a consumer to pay in a timely manner. Further, an agreement can be terminated for no
reason at all. Consumers should analyze provider termination and data retention policies.

Provider promises, including explicit statements regarding limitations, are codified in their service
agreements. A provider’s service agreement has three basic parts: (1) a collection of promises made to
consumers, (2) a collection of promises explicitly not made to consumers, i.e., limitations, and (3) a set of
obligations that consumers must accept.

3.1       Promises

Generally, providers make four key promises to consumers:

 Availability. Providers typically advertise availability promises as uptime percentages ranging from
  99.5% to 100.0%. These are strong claims, and care is needed to understand how these percentages
  are calculated. Often, the percentage applies to the number of time intervals within a billing cycle (or
  longer periods such as a year) in which services are not “up” for the entire interval. Examples of time
  intervals used by prominent providers are 5 minutes, 15 minutes, and 1 hour. For example, if a
  provider specifies an availability interval of 15 minutes, and the service is not functional for 14
  minutes, 100% availability is preserved using this metric. Generally, the definition of “up” is
  intuitively defined as service responsiveness, but in some cases, multiple cloud subsystems must fail
  before the service is judged as unavailable. Providers may also limit availability promises if failures
  are specific to particular functions or Virtual Machines (VMs).

    Some cloud providers historically have not provided service agreements, or have provided them only to large or persistent
      users. An service agreement is extremely important to understand a cloud provider’s promises.
