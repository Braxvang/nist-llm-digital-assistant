                      Measure 11: Maintenance (MA) (system-level)
         Field                                                Data
Measure ID       Maintenance Measure 1 (or a unique identifier to be filled out by the organization)
Goal             •   Strategic Goal: Accelerate the development and use of an electronic information
                     infrastructure.
                 •   Information Security Goal: Perform periodic and timely maintenance on
                     organizational information systems and provide effective controls on the tools,
                     techniques, mechanisms, and personnel used to conduct information system
                     maintenance.
Measure          Percentage (%) of system components that undergo maintenance in accordance with
                 formal maintenance schedules
                 NIST SP 800-53 Controls – MA-2: Controlled Maintenance and MA-6: Timely
                 Maintenance
Measure Type     Effectiveness/Efficiency
Formula          (Number of system components that undergo maintenance according to formal
                 maintenance schedules/total number of system components) *100
Target           This should be a high percentage defined by the organization.
Implementation   1. Does the system have a formal maintenance schedule (MA-2)?
Evidence
                       Yes                     No

                 2. How many components are contained within the system (CM-8)? _____
                 3. How many components underwent maintenance in accordance with the formal
                 maintenance schedule (MA-6)? _____
Frequency        Collection Frequency: Organization-defined (example: quarterly)
                 Reporting Frequency: Organization-defined (example: annually)
Responsible      •   Information Owner: Organization-defined (example: System Owner)

Data Source      Maintenance schedule, maintenance logs
Reporting        Pie chart comparing the percentage of system components receiving maintenance in
Format           accordance with the formal maintenance schedule versus the percentage of system
                 components not receiving maintenance in accordance with the formal maintenance
                 schedule over the specified period
