                            GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



Appendix C—Other Terms and Definitions for Personal Information

Laws, regulations, and guidance documents provide various terms and definitions used to describe
personal information, such as information in identifiable form (IIF), system of records (SOR), and
protected health information (PHI). Some of these are similar to the definition of PII used in this
document. However, organizations should not use the term PII (as defined in this document)
interchangeably with these terms and definitions because they are specific to their particular context. The
table below provides examples of these other terms and definitions, and it is not intended to be
comprehensive.
