aspect by providing an informed basis and means for an external entity (e.g., a human operator or
system) to act when failures occur. Essentially, the reactive aspect is a proactive engineering
activity about providing a reactive capability.

An effective design will optimize protection against loss to the extent practical while recognizing
that losses will occur irrespective of the protections put in place. Optimization decisions across
preemptive and reactive approaches must consider assets, stakeholders, concerns, and objectives.
Achieving a proper mix requires establishing security objectives and conducting requirements
elicitation and analysis to unambiguously ascertain the scope of security in terms of addressing
failure and the associated consequences in its preemptive and reactive aspects.

D.2.       Design Considering Emergence
A system is expected to deliver the required capabilities as authorized, as intended, and at the
specified level of performance. It should not deliver unauthorized or unintended capabilities. One
cause of unintended behaviors and outcomes lies with the concept of emergence. Emergence
refers to the behaviors and outcomes that result from how individual system elements compose
to form the system beyond the collection of behaviors and outcomes of the individual system
elements. This composition is covered in the design principle of Structured Decomposition and
Composition and illustrated in Figure 2.

Some emergence is desired and productive; other emergence is not desired or productive,
creating unknown, unforeseen, or adverse effects. 68 Engineering trustworthy secure systems
seeks to deliver only desired emergence. Trustworthiness judgments are based on the expectation
that the system can satisfy the stated capability needs. To achieve this, the design must address
emergence at all levels of system abstraction in terms of how the system is decomposed into its
constituent elements and how those system elements compose to produce the system. This is
covered in the design principle of Compositional Trustworthiness.


                                                        SECURITY IS EMERGENT
            The objective of security is to achieve only authorized and intended system behaviors
            and outcomes. This requires a fundamental understanding of how individual system
            elements are composed into the system as a whole. Systems are designed from that
            basis of understanding to limit emergent behaviors and outcomes that are not specified
            (including desired and undesired unspecified behaviors and outcomes).

   Emergence may be described in terms of properties exhibited by entities only when attributed to the whole, not to any individual constituent
element.
