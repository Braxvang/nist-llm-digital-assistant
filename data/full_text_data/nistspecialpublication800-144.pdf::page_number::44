            mainly with event data from self-deployed applications (e.g., via application logging).
            Similarly, SaaS consumers are completely dependent upon the cloud provider to provide
            event data such as activity logging, while IaaS consumers control more of the information
            stack and have access to associated event sources.

           Incident Analysis and Resolution. An analysis to confirm the occurrence of an incident
            or determine the method of exploit needs to be performed quickly and with sufficient
            detail of documentation and care to ensure that traceability and integrity is maintained for
            subsequent use, if needed (e.g., a forensic copy of incident data for legal proceedings)
            [Gro10]. To gain a full understanding of an incident, the scope of affected networks,
            systems, and applications must be determined, the intrusion vector must be uncovered,
            and the activities carried out must be reconstructed [Gro10]. Issues faced by cloud
            consumers when performing incident analysis include lack of detailed information about
            the architecture of the cloud relevant to an incident, lack of information about relevant
            event and data sources held by the cloud provider, ill-defined or vague incident handling
            responsibilities stipulated for the cloud provider, and limited capabilities for gathering
            and preserving pertinent data sources as evidence.

            Once the scope of the incident and the assets affected are determined, measures can be
            taken to contain and resolve the incident, bringing systems back to a secure operational
            state [Gro10]. The roles and responsibilities between the cloud provider and cloud
            consumer for containing an attack vary based on the service model and cloud
            architecture. For example, in SaaS and PaaS cloud environments, containment
            essentially amounts to reducing or removing the functionality (e.g., by filtering out
            certain users or features with a web application firewall) that the attacker is using to carry
            out unauthorized activities, if necessary, taking the entire application off-line [Gro10]. In
            IaaS cloud environments, the cloud consumer has a more prominent role; however, the
            cloud provider’s assistance is essential to resolve vulnerabilities exploited in the
            underlying cloud infrastructure.

Response to an incident should be handled in a way that limits damage and minimizes recovery
time and costs. Collaboration between the cloud consumer and provider in recognizing and
responding to an incident is vital to security and privacy in cloud computing. Federal agencies
have an obligation to report certain categories of incidents to the U.S. Computer Emergency
Readiness Team (US-CERT) within one or two hours of discovery or detection.18 A clear
understanding is needed of the type of incidents that are reportable by the cloud provider (e.g.,
data breaches) versus those that are not reportable (e.g., intrusion detection alarms). Remedies
may involve only a single party or require the participation of both parties. Being able to
convene a mixed team of representatives from the cloud provider and cloud consumer quickly is
an important facet of an efficient and cost-effective response.
