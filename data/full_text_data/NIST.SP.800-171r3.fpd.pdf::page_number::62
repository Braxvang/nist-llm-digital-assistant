       NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                       Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
       November 2023

1720             DISCUSSION
1721             Managed interfaces include gateways, routers, firewalls, network-based malicious code
1722             analysis, virtualization systems, and encrypted tunnels implemented within a security
1723             architecture. Subnetworks that are either physically or logically separated from internal
1724             networks are referred to as demilitarized zones or DMZs. Restricting or prohibiting interfaces
1725             within organizational systems includes restricting external web traffic to designated web servers
1726             within managed interfaces, prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal
1727             addresses, and prohibiting internal traffic that appears to be spoofing external addresses.

1736   3.13.4. Information in Shared System Resources
1737             REQUIREMENT: 03.13.04
1738             Prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources.

1739             DISCUSSION
1740             Preventing unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources stops
1741             information produced by the actions of prior users or roles (or actions of processes acting on
1742             behalf of prior users or roles) from being available to current users or roles (or current processes
1743             acting on behalf of current users or roles) that obtain access to shared system resources after
1744             those resources have been released back to the system. Information in shared system resources
1745             also applies to encrypted representations of information. In other contexts, the control of
1746             information in shared system resources is referred to as object reuse and residual information
1747             protection. Information in shared system resources does not address information remanence,
1748             which refers to the residual representation of data that has been nominally deleted, covert
1749             channels (including storage and timing channels) in which shared system resources are
1750             manipulated to violate information flow restrictions, or components within systems for which
1751             there are only single users or roles.
