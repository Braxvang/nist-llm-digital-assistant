       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                        Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

1899           Implementation Validation
1900   Implementation validation is the process of verifying that an RBG and its components fulfill the
1901   requirements of this Recommendation. Validation is accomplished by:
1902       •   Validating the components from [SP800-90A] and [SP800-90B].
1903       •   Validating the use of the constructions in SP 800-90C via code inspection, known-answer
1904           tests, or both, as appropriate.
1905       •   Validating that the appropriate documentation as specified in SP 800-90C has been
1906           provided (see below).
1907   Documentation shall be developed that will provide assurance to testers that an RBG that claims
1908   compliance with this Recommendation has been implemented correctly. This documentation shall
1909   include the following as a minimum:
1910       •   An identification of the constructions and components used by the RBG, including a
1911           diagram of the interaction between the constructions and components.
1912       •   If an external conditioning function is used, an indication of the type of conditioning
1913           function and the method for obtaining any keys that are required by that function.
1914       •   Appropriate documentation, as specified in [SP800-90A] and [SP800-90B]. The DRBG
1915           and the entropy sources shall be validated for compliance with SP 800-90A or SP 800-
1916           90B, respectively, and the validations successfully finalized before the completion of RBG
1917           implementation validation.
1918       •   For an RBG1 or RBG2 construction, the maximum security-strength that can be supported
1919           by the DRBG.
1920       •   A description of all validated and non-validated entropy sources used by the RBG,
1921           including identifying whether the entropy source is a physical or non-physical entropy
1922           source.
1923       •   Documentation justifying the independence of all validated entropy sources from all other
1924           validated and non-validated entropy sources.
1925       •   An identification of the features supported by the RBG (e.g., access to the underlying
1926           DRBG of an RBG3 construction).
1927       •   A description of the health tests performed, including an identification of the periodic
1928           intervals for performing the tests.
1929       •   A description of any support functions other than health testing.
1930       •   A description of the RBG components within the RBG security boundary (see Section 2.5).
1931       •   For an RBG1 construction, a statement indicating that the randomness source must be a
1932           validated RBG2(P) or RBG3 construction (e.g., this could be provided in user
1933           documentation and/or a security policy).
1934       •   If sub-DRBGs can be used in an RBG1 construction, the maximum number of sub-DRBGs
1935           and the security strengths to be supported by the sub-DRBGs.
