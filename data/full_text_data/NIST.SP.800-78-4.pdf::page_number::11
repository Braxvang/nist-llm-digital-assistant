                      Table 3-1. Algorithm and Key Size Requirements for PIV Key Types

                        PIV Key Type                    Algorithms and Key Sizes
                   PIV Authentication key   RSA (2048 bits)
                                            ECDSA (Curve P-256)
                   asymmetric Card          RSA (2048 bits)
                   Authentication key       ECDSA (Curve P-256)
                                                   3
                   symmetric Card           3TDEA
                   Authentication key       AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256
                   digital signature key    RSA (2048 bits)
                                            ECDSA (Curve P-256 or P-384)
                   key management key       RSA key transport (2048 bits);
                                            ECDH (Curve P-256 or P-384)
                   PIV Secure Messaging     ECDH (Curve P-256 or P-384)
                   key


While this specification requires that the RSA public exponent associated with PIV keys be
65 537, applications should be able to process RSA public keys that have any public exponent
that is an odd positive integer greater than or equal to 65 537 and less than 2256.

This specification requires that the key management key must be an RSA key transport key or an
Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key. The specifications for RSA key transport are
[PKCS1] and [SP800-56B]; the specification for ECDH is [SP800-56A].

3.2       Authentication Information Stored on the PIV Card
3.2.1      Specification of Digital Signatures on Authentication Information

FIPS 201-2 requires the use of digital signatures to protect the integrity and authenticity of
information stored on the PIV Card. FIPS 201-2 and SP 800-73-4 require digital signatures on
the following objects stored on the PIV Card:

      +    X.509 public key certificates;
      +    the optional secure messaging card verifiable certificate (CVC);
      +    the optional Intermediate CVC;
      +    the CHUID;
      +    biometric information (e.g., fingerprints); and
      +    the SP 800-73-4 Security Object.
Approved digital signature algorithms are specified in [FIPS186]. Table 3-2 provides specific
requirements for public key algorithms and key sizes, hash algorithms, and padding schemes for
generating digital signatures for digitally signed information stored on the PIV Card. Agencies
are cautioned that generating digital signatures with elliptic curve algorithms may initially limit
interoperability.

 3TDEA is Triple DES using Keying Option 1 from [SP800-67], which requires that all three keys be unique (i.e.,
Key1 ≠ Key2, Key2 ≠ Key3, and Key3 ≠ Key1).
