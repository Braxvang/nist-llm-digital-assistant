    Recommendation for Obtaining Assurances for Digital
                Signature Applications
1 Introduction
A digital signature is an electronic analogue of a written signature; the digital signature
can be used to provide assurance that the claimed signatory signed the information. In
addition, a digital signature may be used to detect whether or not the information was
modified after it was signed (i.e., to detect the integrity of the signed data). Each
signatory has a public and private key and is the owner of that key pair. The private key
is used by the owner to generate a digital signature; the public key is used in the signature
verification process.
Entities participating in the generation or verification of digital signatures depend on the
authenticity of the process. This Recommendation specifies methods for obtaining the
assurances necessary for valid digital signatures: assurance of domain parameter validity,
assurance of public key validity, assurance that the key pair owner actually possesses the
private key, and assurance of the identity of the key pair owner.
Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 186-3 allows three techniques for the
generation of digital signatures: the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), RSA1, and the
Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). For DSA and ECDSA, assurance
of the validity of the domain parameters must be obtained (see Section 4). RSA has no
domain parameters. Domain parameters may be generated by anyone, and assurance of
domain parameter validity shall be obtained prior to performing any other process
associated with digital signatures, including the generation of digital signature key pairs
and the generation and verification of digital signatures.
Digital signature keys may be generated by the intended signatory, cooperatively
generated by the intended signatory and a Trusted Third Party (TTP), or generated
entirely by a TTP and provided to the intended signatory. For all digital signature
algorithms, each party associated with the digital signature process shall have assurance
of the validity of the public keys (see Section 5) and assurance that the key pair owner
actually possesses the private key used for generating the digital signature (see Section
6). In addition, assurance of the claimed signatoryâ€™s identity is required by all verifiers,
including any TTPs involved in the process (see Section 7).
All methods that are used to provide assurance assume the security and reliability of any
routines involved in the process. Obtaining assurances normally requires explicit actions
by someone. However, once the appropriate assurances are obtained, the explicitly
obtained assurance can be leveraged as assurance for subsequent messages. Note that it
may be appropriate to renew this assurance periodically.
