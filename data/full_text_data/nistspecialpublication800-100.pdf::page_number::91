CHAPTER 9                                                       Contingency Planning


necessary to understand the context in which the plan is to be used and gives
additional information that may be necessary to execute procedures (e.g.,
emergency contact information and the BIA).

9.6 Step 6: Plan Testing, Training, and Exercises
   Personnel selected to execute the IT contingency plan must be trained to perform
the procedures, the plan must be exercised, and the system strategy must be tested.
      Plan testing should include:
      • System recovery on an alternate             • System performance using
        platform from backup media                    alternate equipment
      • Coordination among recovery teams           • Restoration of normal operations
      • Internal and external connectivity          • Notification procedures.

      Personnel training should include:
      • Purpose of the plan                         • Security requirements
      • Cross-team coordination and                 • Team-specific processes
        communication                               • Individual responsibilities.
      • Reporting procedures

    Plan exercises should be designed to individually and then collectively examine
various components of the entire plan. Exercises may be conducted in a classroom
setting: discussing specific components of the plan and/or impact issues; or they
may be functional exercises: simulating the recovery using actual replacement
equipment, data, and alternate sites.

9.7      Step 7: Plan Maintenance
     The IT contingency plan must always be maintained in a ready state for use
immediately upon notification. Periodic reviews of the plan must be conducted for
currency of key personnel and vendor information, system components and
dependencies, the recovery strategy, vital records, and operational requirements.
While some changes may be obvious (e.g., personnel turnover or vendor changes),
others will require analysis. The BIA should be reviewed periodically and updated
with new information to identify new contingency requirements and priorities.
Changes made to the plan are noted in a record of changes, dated, and signed or
initialed by the person making the change. The revised plan, or plan sections, are
circulated to those with plan responsibilities. Because of the impact that plan
changes may have on interdependent business processes or information systems,
the changes must be clearly communicated and properly annotated in the beginning
of the document.
