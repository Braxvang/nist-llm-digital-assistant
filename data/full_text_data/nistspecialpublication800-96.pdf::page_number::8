Special Publication 800-96                                   PIV Card to Reader Interoperability Guidelines

2.3.7    Type A and B Transmission Protocols
The contactless interface of the reader shall support both Type A and Type B transmission protocols as defined
in ISO/IEC 14443-4:2001.

2.3.8    Retrieval Time
Retrieval time for 4 KB of data through the contactless interface of the reader shall not exceed 2.0 seconds.

2.3.9    Transmission Speeds
The contactless interface of the reader shall support bit rates of fc/128 (~106 kbits/s), fc/64 (~212 kbits/s), and
fc/32 (~424 kbits/s) as defined in ISO/IEC 14443-3:2001/Amd.1:2005. Bit rates fc/64 and fc/32 may be
configurable to allow activation / deactivation.

2.3.10 Readability Range
The reader shall not be able to read a PIV card more than 10cm from the reader.

2.4     PIV Contactless Card Reader (Physical Access)

2.4.1    Common Requirements
The contactless interface of the reader shall support all requirements in sections 2.3.2 through 2.3.10.
