757             REQUIREMENT: 03.01.16

758             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
759             Determine if:
760             A.03.01.16.a[01]: each type of wireless access to the system is defined.
761             A.03.01.16.a[02]: usage restrictions are established for each type of wireless access to the
762             system.
763             A.03.01.16.a[03]: configuration requirements are established for each type of wireless access
764             to the system.
765             A.03.01.16.a[04]: connection requirements are established for each type of wireless access to
766             the system.
767             A.03.01.16.b: each type of wireless access to the system is authorized prior to establishing
768             such connections.
769             A.03.01.16.c: wireless networking capabilities not intended for use are disabled prior to
770             issuance and deployment.
