NIST SP 800-215                                                            Guide to a Secure Enterprise
November 2022                                                                      Network Landscape

subnet (e.g., external network or internet) from accessing a device on another network location
or subnet (e.g., intranet or Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) or corporate network). In that setup, it
primarily secured a network perimeter. The evolution of firewall functions can be traced based
on the following feature sets [6]:
   •   Packet filters and network address translation: Packet filtering and Network address
       translation (NAT) are used to monitor and control packets moving across a network
       interface, apply predetermined security rules, and obscure the internal network from the
       public internet.
   •   Stateful inspection: Stateful firewalling, also known as dynamic packet filtering, monitors
       the state of connections and makes determinations as to what types of data packets belong
       to a known active connection and can be allowed to pass through the firewall.
   •   Deep packet inspection (DPI): This feature, also known as packet sniffing, examines the
       content of packets (both the header and the payload, unlike the stateful inspection that
       inspects only the packet header). In addition to the capability provided by stateful
       inspection, this has capabilities related to finding hidden threats within the data stream,
       such as attempts at data exfiltration, violations of content policies, malware, and more.
   •   Threat detection and response: Modern firewalls can gather and analyze enough data
       across multiple packets and sessions to detect threats and security incidents targeted at a
       particular system or a family of systems. These data from multiple firewalls can also be
       directed toward security information and event management (SIEM) and correlated with
       data from other security tools and IT systems to detect enterprise-wide attacks that span
       multiple systems and network layers. In addition, these data can be used to understand
       evolving threats and define new access rules, attack patterns, and defensive strategies [6].
   •   Logging and auditing capabilities: Logging and auditing capabilities result in the
       construction of network events that can be used to identify patterns of performance and
       security issues.
   •   Access control functions: Access control functions enforce granular sophisticated access
       control policies.
   •   Multiple locations and functions: Firewalls reside at different locations to perform
       different functions. Firewalls at the network edge perform the network perimeter
       protection function by filtering disallowed sources and destinations and blocking the
       packets of potential threats. Firewalls inside a data center can segment the internal
       network to prevent the lateral movement of traffic and isolate sensitive resources (e.g.,
       services and data stores). Device-based firewalls prevent malicious traffic in and out of
       endpoints.
   •   Open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs): These enable integration with many
       networking products that provide additional security capabilities.
   •   Policy Composition Capabilities: Some firewalls can have the capabilities to merge
       policies at enforcement time so as to ensure that consistent policies are applied to
       different classes of users (e.g., those on-premises and on private and public clouds).
   •   Web application firewalls (WAF): This class of firewalls has been used ever since web
       applications accessed through web protocols, such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol
