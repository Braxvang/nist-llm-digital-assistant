825      2. All PII, in the form of identity attributes, collected as part of the identity proofing

837      2. The agency SHALL consult with their SAOP to conduct an analysis determining
838         whether the collection of PII, including biometrics, to conduct identity proofing

852         with identity proofing. This may include materials detailing information about how
853         to use the technology associated with the service, a Frequently Asked Questions
854         (FAQs) page, prerequisites to participate in the identity proofing process (such as
