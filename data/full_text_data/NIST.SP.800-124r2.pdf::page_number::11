Executive Summary
Modern mobile devices, which are essentially general-purpose computing platforms capable of
performing tasks far beyond the voice and text capabilities of legacy mobile devices, are
widespread within modern enterprise networks. Mobility has transformed how enterprises
deliver information technology (IT) services and accomplish their missions. Targeted toward
consumers for on-demand personal access to communications, information, and services, these
devices are not configured by default for business use. As mobile devices perform everyday
enterprise tasks, they regularly process, modify, and store sensitive data. While organizations
understand that using mobile devices and mobile applications for anytime, anywhere access can
increase employee productivity and enhance decision making and situational awareness, these
devices bring unique threats to the enterprise.
As consumers and enterprise organizations have increased their adoption and use of mobile
technologies, the mobile threat landscape has also shifted. This includes an increase in mobile
malware and vulnerabilities that span the device (e.g., operating system, firmware, the baseband
processor used to access cellular networks), mobile apps, networks, and management
infrastructure. The diversity and complexity of the mobile ecosystem and the rapid pace of
change challenge the selection, integration, and management of mobile technologies in enterprise
IT environments. To reduce the risk to sensitive data and systems, enterprises need to institute
appropriate policies and infrastructure to manage and secure mobile devices, applications,
content, and access.
Mobile devices often need additional protections as a result of their portability, small size, and
common use outside of an organizationâ€™s network, which generally places them at higher
exposure to threats than other endpoint devices. Laptops are excluded from the scope of this
publication. Although some laptop/desktop management technologies are converging with
mobile device management technologies, the security capabilities currently available for laptops
are different than those available for smartphones, tablets, and other mobile device types.
Furthermore, mobile devices contain features that are not generally available in laptops (e.g.,
multiple wireless network interfaces, Global Positioning System, numerous sensors, built-in
mobile apps). Devices with minimal computing capability, such as the most basic cell phones
and general Internet of Things (IoT) devices, are also out of scope because they typically do not
have a full-fledged operating system (OS), and their functionality and available security options
are limited.
Organizations can use the Enterprise Mobile Device Deployment Life Cycle (Fig. 1) to improve
the security of their mobile devices.
