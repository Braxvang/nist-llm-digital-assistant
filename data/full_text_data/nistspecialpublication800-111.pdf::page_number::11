                                                       GUIDE TO STORAGE ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES FOR END USER DEVICES



2.      Storage Security Overview

An end user device is a personal computer (desktop or laptop), consumer device (e.g., personal digital
assistant [PDA], smart phone), or removable storage media (e.g., USB flash drive, memory card, external
hard drive, writeable CD or DVD) that can store information. 1 Storage security is the process of allowing
only authorized parties to access and use stored information. This section introduces the basic concepts
of storage security for end user devices. 2

2.1      File Storage Basics

A file is a collection of information logically grouped into a single entity and referenced by a unique
name, such as a filename. On end user devices, there are typically two types of files: data files, such as
text documents, spreadsheets, images, and videos, and system files, such as operating system and
application binaries and libraries. A filesystem defines the way that files are named, stored, organized,
and accessed. Directories, also known as folders, are organizational structures used by filesystems to
group files. Another feature of a filesystem is metadata, which is data about data—in the context of a
filesystem, information regarding the files and folders themselves, such as file and folder names, creation
dates and times, and sizes.

Filesystems are designed to store folders, system and data files, and metadata on storage media.
However, storage media may also hold residual data, which is data from deleted files (including earlier
versions of existing files and temporary files). Residual data can often be recovered from an end user
device through forensic analysis. The following items describe common forms of residual data:

 Unused File Allocation Units. Filesystems store files in chunks known as file allocation units.
  Unused file allocation units are the units within a partition that are not currently being used by the
  filesystem. When a file is deleted, it is typically not erased from the media; instead, the information
  in the directory’s data structure that points to the location of the file is marked as deleted. This means
  that the file is still stored on the media but is no longer enumerated by the operating system (OS).
  The OS considers this to be unused space and can overwrite any portion of or the entire deleted file at
  any time.
 Slack Space. Even if a file requires less space than the file allocation unit size, an entire file
  allocation unit is still reserved for the file. For example, if the file allocation unit size is 32 kilobytes
  (KB) and a file is only 7 KB, the entire 32 KB is still allocated to the file, but only 7 KB is used,
  resulting in 25 KB of unused space. This unused space is referred to as file slack space, and it may
  hold residual data such as portions of deleted files.
 Free Space. Free space is the area on media that is not currently allocated to a partition. This often
  includes space on the media where files may have resided at one point but have since been deleted.
  The free space may still contain pieces of data.
Before media can be used to store files, the media must usually be partitioned and formatted into logical
volumes. Partitioning is the act of logically dividing a media into portions that function as separate units.
A logical volume is a partition or a collection of partitions acting as a single entity that has been formatted

      This publication only addresses technologies for encrypting files stored on end user devices. Information on storage security
      for servers, storage area networks, enterprise backup tapes, and other devices is outside the scope of this publication.

      Storage security is only one component of data security, which includes network, host, and application security, and also
      addresses how data may be used after it is accessed. All elements of data security other than storage security, such as
      encrypting data in motion (e.g., network communications), are outside the scope of this publication.
