                                                GUIDE TO STORAGE ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES FOR END USER DEVICES



      –    The characteristics of the devices that need protection, especially the OSs, applications, and
           filesystems they use, and their hardware capabilities and characteristics

      –    The technical attributes of the interfaces of other systems with which the storage encryption
           solution might be integrated, such as authentication services, centralized logging servers and
           security information and event management (SIEM) software, and patch management software

 Support Limitations. The organization should identify any negative impacts that storage encryption
  technologies could have on existing vendor support mechanisms. For example, installing a storage
  encryption technology onto an end user device could violate the terms of a support contract for
  existing software on the end user device or void a warranty for another product used on or with the
  end user device.

The outcome of the organization’s analysis should be a determination of which files or types of files need
to be encrypted and which types of threats the storage encryption software should protect against, stating
the concerns as specifically as possible. For example, the organization may decide to encrypt sensitive
information on all devices used outside the organization’s facilities and to encrypt certain types of
sensitive information on devices used from any location.

The analysis should also lead to the identification of the type or types of storage encryption technologies
that can meet the organization’s security needs. Another outcome of the analysis is the documentation of
the requirements for the storage encryption technologies themselves, including security capabilities (e.g.,
authentication, cryptography, key management), performance requirements, management requirements
(including reliability, interoperability, scalability), the security of the technology itself, usability (by both
administrators and users), and maintenance requirements (such as applying updates).

In most cases, a single storage encryption product cannot meet all of the organization’s identified needs.
For example, the organization may need to protect information on devices running several different OSs,
yet no appropriate product can work on all those platforms. Some devices might also not meet the
minimum hardware requirements for storage encryption products. Organizations can solve this problem
in several ways, such as acquiring multiple products, using multiple types of storage encryption
technologies, replacing older devices, or identifying compensating controls to be used instead of storage
encryption that provide the same level of protection. Appendix A discusses some potential alternatives to
storage encryption. Organizations should ensure that effective solutions are identified for all the types of
end user devices that need their stored information protected, if possible, and that a waiver process is
created for unusual cases that cannot be addressed by the identified solutions.

4.2       Design the Solution

Once the needs have been identified and the appropriate type(s) of storage encryption technology have
been chosen, the next phase is to design a solution that meets the needs. If these design decisions are
incorrect, then the storage encryption implementation will be more susceptible to compromise. Major
aspects of solution design that are particularly important for storage encryption are as follows:

 Cryptography. Encryption and integrity protection algorithms must be selected, as well as the key
  strength for algorithms that support multiple key lengths. Key management and protection is another
  important component of solution design. Section 4.2.1 contains additional cryptography information.

 Authentication. Authentication methods must be chosen for users and administrators. Decisions
  also need to be made regarding the protection of the authenticators themselves. Section 4.2.2
  contains a more detailed discussion of authentication.
