1.       Introduction

Federal agencies and organizations cannot protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
information in today’s highly networked systems environment without ensuring that all people involved
in using and managing IT:

     Understand their roles and responsibilities related to the organizational mission;
     Understand the organization’s IT security policy, procedures, and practices; and
     Have at least adequate knowledge of the various management, operational, and technical controls
      required and available to protect the IT resources for which they are responsible.
As cited in audit reports, periodicals, and conference presentations, it is generally understood by the IT
security professional community that people are one of the weakest links in attempts to secure systems
and networks. The “people factor” - not technology - is key to providing an adequate and appropriate
level of security. If people are the key, but are also a weak link, more and better attention must be paid to
this “asset.” A robust and enterprise wide awareness and training program is paramount to ensuring that
people understand their IT security responsibilities, organizational policies, and how to properly use and
protect the IT resources entrusted to them.

1.1      Purpose

This document provides guidelines for building and maintaining a comprehensive awareness and training
program, as part of an organization’s IT security program. The guidance is presented in a life-cycle
approach, ranging from designing (Section 3), developing (Section 4), and implementing (Section 5) an
awareness and training program, through post-implementation evaluation of the program (Section 6). The
document includes guidance on how IT security professionals can identify awareness and training needs,
develop a training plan, and get organizational buy-in for the funding of awareness and training program
efforts. This document also describes how to:

     Select awareness and training topics;
     Find sources of awareness and training material;
     Implement awareness and training material, using a variety of methods;
     Evaluate the effectiveness of the program; and
     Update and improve the focus as technology and organizational priorities change.
1.2      Audience

This guidance is intended to be useful to several key audiences in an organization, including, but not
limited to: the CIO, the IT security program manager1 and staff, managers (including system and
application owners) and their contractors, and agency training coordinators. The success of an

      Under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) this position is titled Senior Agency Information
      Security Officer. While this guideline uses the term “IT security program manager,” it is understood that organizations use
      a variety of terms to identify the person responsible for the department’s or agency’s IT security program. For example,
      some organizations use “information systems security manager,” “information systems security officer,” “automated data
      processing (ADP) security officer,” “automated information systems (AIS) security officer,” or “information assurance
      security officer.” Regardless of the term used, the position (or role) being described is that of the person responsible for the
      organization’s enterprisewide IT security program.
