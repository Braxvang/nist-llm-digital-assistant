SP 800-130                                                      August 2013



                      The key and metadata management function used to compute or
Generate Key
                      create a cryptographic key.
                      A process to eliminate a means of attack by patching
Hardening             vulnerabilities and turning off nonessential services. Hardening a
                      computer involves several steps to form layers of protection.
Hash Value            The fixed-length bit string produced by a hash function.
                      A text string used to indicate an entity (e.g., one that is
                      performing a key management function) and by the CKMS
Identifier
                      access control system to select a specific key from a collection of
                      keys.
                      A measure of the ability of one set of entities to physically
Interoperability
                      connect to and logically communicate with another set of entities.
Key                   See cryptographic key.
                      A key establishment procedure where the resultant keying
                      material is a function of information contributed by two or more
Key Agreement         participants, so that no entity can predetermine the resulting value
                      of the keying material independently of any other entity’s
                      contribution.
                      A procedure to provide assurance to one entity (the key
                      confirmation recipient) that another entity (the key confirmation
Key Confirmation
                      provider) actually possesses the correct secret keying material
                      and/or shared secret.
                      The transport of a key and other keying material from an entity
Key Distribution      that either owns or generates the key to another entity that is
                      intended to use the key. (Sometimes called key transport.)
                      The process by which a key (and perhaps its metadata) is entered
Key Entry
                      into a cryptographic module in preparation for active use.
                      The process by which a key is securely shared between two or
                      more entities, either by transporting a key from one entity to
Key Establishment
                      another (key transport) or deriving a key from information shared
                      by the entities (key agreement).
                      A key label is a text string that provides a human-readable and
                      perhaps machine-readable set of descriptors for the key.
Key Label
                      Hypothetical examples of key labels include: “Root CA Private
                      Key 2009-29”; “Maintenance Secret Key 2005.”
                      One of the set of finite states that describes the accepted use of a
                      cryptographic key at a given point in its lifetime, including: Pre-
Key Lifecycle State
                      Activation; Active; Suspended; Deactivated; Revoked;
                      Compromised; Destroyed; Destroyed Compromised.
