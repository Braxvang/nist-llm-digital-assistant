SP 800-152                                               A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


FCKMS functions           Functions that perform cryptographic key and metadata
                          management operations (see Section 6.4 for examples).
FCKMS module              A device that performs a set of key and metadata-management
                          functions for at least one FCKMS and is associated with a
                          cryptographic module. The device may be implemented as
                          hardware, software, and/or firmware.
FCKMS personnel           The individuals of an FCKMS service-providing organization
                          that are authorized to assume the supported roles of the
                          FCKMS.
FCKMS Security            A collection of entities that share a common FCKMS Security
Domain                    Policy
FCKMS Security Policy     A security policy specific to an FCKMS.
FCKMS services            Protections provided to data, such as data integrity
(protections)             authentication, confidentiality, and source authentication.
FCKMS service             An entity that provides FCKMS key-management services to
provider (FCKMS           one or more FCKMS service-using organizations in
service-providing         accordance with their respective FCKMS Security Policies.
organization)
FCKMS service-using       A Federal organization or contractor that has selected an
organization              FCKMS service provider to provide key-management
                          services.
FCKMS Security Policy     The security policy defined by an FCKMS service provider
                          and the FCKMS service-using organization that specifies how
                          the FCKMS will be operated.
FIPS 140 security level   A metric of the security provided by a cryptographic module
                          that is specified as Level 1, 2, 3, or 4, as specified in [FIPS
                          140], where Level 1 is the lowest level, and Level 4 is the
                          highest level.
Firewall                  A part of a computer system or network that is designed to
                          block unauthorized access while permitting outward
                          communication.
Framework (for CKMS)      The CKMS requirements specified in [SP 800-130].
Functional testing        Testing that verifies that an implementation of some function
                          operates correctly.
Hardening                 A process intended to eliminate a means of attack by patching
                          vulnerabilities and turning off nonessential services.
