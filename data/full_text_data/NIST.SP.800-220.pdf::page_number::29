In FY 2021, the Robust Inter Domain Routing project developed the NIST RPKI (Resource Public
Key Infrastructure) Monitor – a test and measurement system designed to monitor Internet routing
dynamics. Its purpose is to provide measurement data and analyses to research, standardization,
and operations communities to improve the trust and confidence in the underlying Internet security
technologies.
NIST’s contributions to expedite the design, standardization and adoption of technologies to
dramatically improve the security and resilience of the Internet's routing infrastructure are widely
recognized. Numerous major enterprises and service providers use NIST’s test and measurement
tools, reference implementations, and deployment guidance. NIST’s leadership, based on
beneficial impacts in this area, was awarded a Department of Commerce Gold Medal in 2021.
Transition to IPv6-Only Networks
In November 2020, OMB published Completing the Transition to Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6),
Memorandum M-21-07, setting milestones for the Federal Government to deliver its information
services, operate its networks, and access the services of others using only IPv6. This U.S.
Government (USG) implementation of IPv6 is frequently referenced as USGv6. This memorandum
tasked NIST with two key roles: (1) updating the USGv6 standards profiles and test program to
facilitate USG acquisition of secure and interoperable IPv6 products and services and (2) leading
an NCCoE demonstration pilot focused on the secure deployment of IPv6-only networks within
the enterprise.
In response to this tasking, in FY 2021, NIST published a significant revision to the USGv6 Profile
and Test Program to incorporate the latest advances in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
standards, security requirements, and practice guides. Enhancements to the USGv6 product
testing framework provide the conformance, interoperability, and functional testing necessary to
foster trust and confidence in the deployment of IPv6 products in mission-critical government
networks. NIST also initiated work on a new NCCoE project focused on Secure IPv6-Only
Implementation in the Enterprise. In this effort, NIST will collaborate with industry partners to
demonstrate the commercial viability of and document recommended practices for the secure
evolution of government enterprise networks to meet the new OMB IPv6-only requirements.
Zero Trust Networks
A transition to a “zero trust” approach to security provides a defensible architecture. As described
in the Department of Defense Zero Trust Reference Architecture, “The foundational tenet of
the Zero Trust Model is that no actor, system, network, or service operating outside or within
the security perimeter is trusted. Instead, we must verify anything and everything attempting to
establish access. It is a dramatic paradigm shift in philosophy of how we secure our infrastructure,
networks, and data, from verify once at the perimeter to continual verification of each user, device,
application, and transaction.”
In FY 2021, the NCCoE, in collaboration with industry participants, initiated a project to demonstrate
several approaches to a zero trust architecture applied to a conventional, general-purpose
enterprise IT infrastructure on-premises and in the cloud, which will be designed and deployed
according to the concepts and tenets documented in Zero Trust Architecture (SP 800-207). Over
20 companies have joined the collaborative effort to demonstrate the application of zero trust
technologies to modern enterprise IT environments. The example implementations will integrate
commercial and open-source products that leverage cybersecurity standards and recommended
practices to showcase the robust security features of zero trust architectures. This project will result
