Appendix Bâ€”Example of Update Mechanism 1

This appendix provides an example of how Update Mechanism 1 could be implemented in a server.
Update Mechanism 1 includes authenticated BIOS updates at server runtime. In this example, runtime
BIOS updates are performed by the Service Processor (SP). Figure 1, a system block diagram for this
example, shows the BIOS flash SPI controller accessible by both the host and the SP. Extra logic along
the host-to-SPI controller path may be needed to prevent write access by the host to the BIOS flash
memory. This logic may either be internal chipset registers or external to the chipset. Because it has write
access to the system flash, the SP environment in this example must be a secure, protected environment as
described in Section 5.
