time of SIGA(M, TSP1) must trust both TTAs.
Figure 6 shows entity B requesting a second timestamp after receiving D from entity A.
The first four steps of this scheme1 are the same as those specified in one of the schemes
in Sections 4.3.1 - 4.3.3.
After verifying the signatures, etc. in D (in step 4), the scheme proceeds as follows:
       5. Entity B obtains SIGA(M, TSP1) from D and sends it (and possibly other
          information) to TTA2 in a timestamp request, i.e., user_supplied_info2 = SIGA
          (M, TSP1), other_info2. Note that other_info2 may be Null.
