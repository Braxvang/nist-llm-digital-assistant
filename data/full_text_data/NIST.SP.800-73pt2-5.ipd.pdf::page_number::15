      NIST SP 800-73pt2-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)           Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 2

342   2.4.2. Security Status
343   A set of one or more Boolean variables — each called a security status indicator of the
344   authenticable entity — SHALL be associated with each authenticable entity. Each security status
345   indicator is, in turn, associated with a credential that CAN be used to authenticate the entity. The
346   security status indicator of an authenticable entity SHALL be TRUE if the credentials associated
347   with the security status indicator of the authenticable entity have been authenticated and FALSE
348   otherwise.
349   A successful execution of an authentication protocol SHALL set the security status indicator
350   associated with the credential used in the protocol to TRUE. An aborted or failed execution of an
351   authentication protocol SHALL set the security status indicator associated with the credential
352   used in the protocol to FALSE.
353   As an example, the credentials associated with three security status indicators of the cardholder
354   might be a PIN, fingerprint, and pairing code. Demonstrating knowledge of the PIN is the
355   authentication protocol for the first security status indicator wherein the PIN is the credential.
356   Comparing the fingerprint template on the card with a fingerprint acquired from the cardholder is
357   the authentication protocol for the second security status indicator wherein the fingerprint is the
358   credential. Demonstrating knowledge of the pairing code is the authentication protocol for the
359   third security status indicator wherein the pairing code is the credential. A security condition
360   using these three security status indicators might be “pairing code AND (PIN OR fingerprint).”
361   A security status indicator SHALL be said to be a global security status indicator if it is not
362   changed when the currently selected application changes from one application to another. In
363   essence, when changing from one application to another, the global security status indicators
364   SHALL remain unchanged.
365   A security status indicator is said to be an application security status indicator if it is set to
366   FALSE when the currently selected application changes from one application to another. Every
367   security status indicator is either a global security status indicator or an application security
368   status indicator. The security status indicators associated with the PIV Card Application PIN, the
369   PIN Unblocking Key (PUK), OCC, pairing code, and the PIV Card Application Administration
370   Key are application security status indicators for the PIV Card Application, whereas the security
371   status indicator associated with the Global PIN is a global security status indicator.
372   The term global security status refers to the set of all global security status indicators. The term
373   application security status refers to the set of all application security status indicators for a
374   specific application.

375   2.4.3. Authentication of an Individual
376   Knowledge of a PIN is the means by which an individual CAN be authenticated to the PIV Card
377   Application.
378   The pairing code SHALL be exactly 8 bytes in length, and the PIV Card Application PIN
379   SHALL be between 6 and 8 bytes in length. If the actual length of the PIV Card Application PIN
380   is less than 8 bytes, it SHALL be padded to 8 bytes with 'FF' when presented to the card
381   command interface. The 'FF' padding bytes SHALL be appended to the actual value of the PIN.
