                                                  GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



Appendix A—Glossary

Selected terms used in the Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) are defined
below.

Agent: A host-based intrusion detection and prevention program that monitors and analyzes activity and
may also perform prevention actions.

Alert: A notification of an important observed event.

Anomaly-Based Detection: The process of comparing definitions of what activity is considered normal
against observed events to identify significant deviations.

Antivirus Software: A program that monitors a computer or network to identify all major types of
malware and prevent or contain malware incidents.

Application-Based Intrusion Detection and Prevention System: A host-based intrusion detection and
prevention system that performs monitoring for a specific application service only, such as a Web server
program or a database server program.

Blacklist: A list of discrete entities, such as hosts or applications, that have been previously determined
to be associated with malicious activity.

Blinding: Generating network traffic that is likely to trigger many alerts in a short period of time, to
conceal alerts triggered by a “real” attack performed simultaneously.

Channel Scanning: Changing the channel being monitored by a wireless intrusion detection and
prevention system.

Console: A program that provides user and administrator interfaces to an intrusion detection and
prevention system.

Database Server: A repository for event information recorded by sensors, agents, or management
servers.

Evasion: Modifying the format or timing of malicious activity so that its appearance changes but its
effect on the target is the same.

False Negative: An instance in which an intrusion detection and prevention technology fails to identify
malicious activity as being such.

False Positive: An instance in which an intrusion detection and prevention technology incorrectly
identifies benign activity as being malicious.

Flooding: Sending large numbers of messages to a host or network at a high rate. In this publication, it
specifically refers to wireless access points.

Flow: A particular network communication session occurring between hosts.

Host-Based Intrusion Detection and Prevention System: A program that monitors the characteristics
of a single host and the events occurring within that host to identify and stop suspicious activity.
