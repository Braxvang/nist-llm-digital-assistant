                                           ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



3.      Overview of IEEE 802.11 Security

This section provides an overview of IEEE 802.11 security. It begins by explaining the main security
concerns and threats against WLANs. Next, it reviews the security features and weaknesses of IEEE
802.11 before the introduction of the IEEE 802.11i amendment to the IEEE 802.11 WLAN standard, and
the IEEE 802.11i framework for Robust Security Networks (RSN). The review of pre-RSN IEEE 802.11
security demonstrates the shortcomings of the standard and the motivation behind the development of the
IEEE 802.11i amendment and the RSN framework, which is intended to provide strong authentication for
WLAN devices and strong protection for WLAN communications. The section then introduces the major
security-related components that are defined in the IEEE 802.11i amendment.

This publication covers IEEE 802.11i-based wireless LANs only. It does not replace NIST Special
Publication (SP) 800-48, Wireless Network Security: 802.11, Bluetooth and Handheld Devices, which
addresses IEEE 802.11b and 802.11g-based wireless LANs, Bluetooth implementations, and wireless
handheld devices (e.g., text messaging devices, PDAs, smart phones). Organizations with existing IEEE
802.11b or 802.11g implementations should continue to use the recommendations in SP 800-48 to secure
them; 14 they should also review this publication to understand the new IEEE 802.11i technology and how
it addresses the shortcomings of the WEP protocol used to secure IEEE 802.11b and 802.11g networks.
Organizations that are considering the deployment of new wireless LANs should be evaluating IEEE
802.11i-based products and following the recommendations for IEEE 802.11i implementations in this
publication.

This section is intended to provide a high-level overview of IEEE 802.11 security concepts; subsequent
sections of the guide discuss individual concepts in much greater depth. Readers who are already familiar
with IEEE 802.11 security and the basic additions of IEEE 802.11i might wish to skip this section.

3.1     WLAN Security Concerns

Like other wireless technologies, WLANs typically need to support several security objectives. This is
intended to be accomplished through a combination of security features built into the wireless networking
standard. The most common security objectives for WLANs are as follows:

       Confidentiality—ensure that communication cannot be read by unauthorized parties
       Integrity—detect any intentional or unintentional changes to data that occur in transit
       Availability—ensure that devices and individuals can access a network and its resources
        whenever needed
       Access Control—restrict the rights of devices or individuals to access a network or resources
        within a network.
The security objectives for wireless and wired LANs are the same, as are the major high-level categories
of threats that they face. Table 3-1 provides a list of the main categories of threats against LANs.

Most WLAN threats typically involve an attacker with access to the radio link between a STA and an AP
or between two STAs. Several of the threats listed in Table 3-1 rely on an attacker’s ability to intercept
and inject network communications. This highlights the most significant difference between protecting
wireless and wired LANs: the relative ease of intercepting network communications and inserting new
ones from what can only be presumed as the authentic source. In a wired LAN, an attacker would have to
