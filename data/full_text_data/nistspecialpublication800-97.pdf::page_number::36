ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



        encryption algorithm and the use of a 24-bit IV, which is too small to prevent recurring IVs on a
        busy WLAN.
     Data Integrity. WEP attempts to perform data integrity checking for messages and reject
      messages that have been changed in transit. WEP uses a simple non-cryptographic checksum to
      detect errors in data transmission and protects this checksum with a stream cipher. Unfortunately,
      stream ciphers offer no protection against bit-flipping attacks, which means that in many cases a
      determined adversary can alter both data and the corresponding checksums without detection.
     Availability. Individuals without physical access to the WLAN can impact its availability
      through two types of attacks: jamming and flooding. Jamming occurs when a device emits
      electromagnetic energy on the WLANâ€™s frequency, making it unusable. Flooding involves an
      attacker sending large numbers of messages to an AP at a high rate to prevent the AP from
      processing traffic. The IEEE 802.11 standard offers no defense against jamming or flooding.
      Also, attackers can establish rogue APs, which could make the legitimate WLAN effectively
      unavailable to users.
The IEEE 802.11i specification introduces the concept of an RSN, which is a wireless network that allows
the creation of RSNAs only. RSNAs are logical connections between communicating IEEE 802.11
entities established through the IEEE 802.11i 4-Way Handshake. RSNAs allow for the protection of data
frames and provide enhanced security relative to the flawed WEP. The IEEE 802.1X framework
specified by the IEEE 802.11i amendment provides the means to block user access until authentication is
successful, thereby controlling access to the WLAN resources. The technique used to block access is
known as port-based access control; it involves the AP distinguishing between EAP and non-EAP frames,
then passing EAP frames through an uncontrolled port and non-EAP frames through a controlled port,
which can block access.

The IEEE 802.1X standard defines several terms related to authentication: authenticator, supplicant, and
authentication server. The authenticator is an entity such as an AP that facilitates an authentication
attempt. The supplicant is an entity such as a STA that is authenticated by an authenticator. The
authentication server (AS) is an entity that provides an authentication service to an authenticator. This
service determines, from the credentials provided by the supplicant, whether the supplicant is authorized
to access the services provided by the authenticator. The AS either authenticates the STA and AP itself,
or it provides information to the STA and AP so that they may authenticate each other.
