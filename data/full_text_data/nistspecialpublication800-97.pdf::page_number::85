                                    ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I




                             Figure 6-2. Illustration of EAP-TTLS Environment



An advantage of EAP-TTLS relative to EAP-TLS is that it can support legacy authentication methods,
using them as the inner authentication method. For example, if an organization has mature security
processes and a large investment in an existing identity management system based on passwords, tokens,
or biometrics, then it might make sense to leverage that system for its WLANs. It might appear that
eliminating the requirement for certificates on STAs (the clients) greatly reduces the administrative
complexity of the required supporting PKI; installing certificates on a small number of ASs is
considerably easier than installing them on hundreds or thousands of computers or smart cards. However,
the root certificate must be delivered securely to every client to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Many
desktop operating systems include system management tools for the distribution of root certificates to
clients. Alternatively, root certificate distribution can be accomplished by the IT department when
configuring computers for end users.

The TLS tunnel protects the inner application from several attack types, including replay attacks and
dictionary attacks. Unfortunately, it does not always offer strong assurance against man-in-the-middle
attacks. Another shortcoming of EAP-TTLS is that it is only as strong as the inner application
authentication method that occurs within the TLS tunnel. For instance, if EAP-TTLS is used with a
legacy system that allows weak passwords, then that implementation of EAP-TTLS is weak, which in
turn means the IEEE 802.1X port-based access control that relies on that implementation of EAP-TTLS is
weak. In a cascading fashion, the strength of nearly all elements’ RSN protections is rooted in the
strength of the EAP-TTLS inner application to authenticate the STA, which is left unspecified.
Therefore, organizations that implement EAP-TTLS should carefully consider the risks associated with
any candidate method before deploying it.

6.1.3.3 PEAP

PEAP is the product of a joint development effort by engineers from Microsoft, Cisco Systems, and
Extundo. PEAP’s characteristics are very similar to EAP-TTLS. Like EAP-TTLS, PEAP uses
certificates and leverages TLS only to verify the AS’s identity to the STA and establish a secure
communications channel to protect the transaction in which the STA authenticates to the AS. As with
EAP-TTLS, no client certificates are required; however, provisioning the root certificate on each and
every client is a mandatory security requirement.
