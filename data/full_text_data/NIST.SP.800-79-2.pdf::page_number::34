4. ISSUER CONTROLS ASSESSMENT & AUTHORIZATION DECISION PROCESS

An assessment is a set of activities performed by the Assessor to gain assurance that the issuer
controls for a PIV Card Issuer or a Derived PIV Credential Issuer have been implemented
properly and meet their required function or purpose. Understanding the overall effectiveness of
the issuer controls implemented by the issuer and its facilities is essential in determining the risk
to the organization’s overall mission, and forms the basis for the authorization decision by the
Designated Authorizing Official.

An Assessor must– (i) compile evidence that the issuer controls are implemented correctly,
operating as intended, and producing the desired results; and (ii) present this evidence in a
manner such that the DAO can make a credible, risk-based decision about the operation of the
issuer.

The focus of an assessment is the issuer controls, each of which is designed to satisfy one or
more specific requirements from FIPS 201-2 and related documents. The objective for the
Assessor is to use the assessment procedures associated with each issuer control (described in
Appendix G) as a means to measure conformance to the requirements. The assessment
procedures are designed to facilitate the gathering of evidence that issuer controls are
implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome.

In preparation for an assessment, the Assessor performs the following two preparatory steps:

       Determination of the authorization boundary to understand the target of the assessment.
        The authorization boundary dictates which issuing facilities and outsourced services are
        to be included in the assessment.

       Review of the operations plan to determine which issuer controls are implemented at the
        organizational level and which at the facility level. This analysis should provide the
        Assessor with an understanding of where different responsibilities lie within the issuer
        organization and how to address them during the assessment.

In cases where PIV functions have been outsourced, the issuer is responsible for ensuring that the
external service provider has implemented the control. During the assessment, it is the service
provider’s responsibility to provide documentation to the Assessor regarding the implementation
of that control. If results from a previous assessment of the service provider (provided the current
assessment is part of re- authorization after substantial changes) can be referenced, the Assessor
may elect to incorporate these results (not exceeding one year) or re-do part or all of the
assessment. The extent of re-use of the results of the previous assessment is entirely at the
discretion of the Assessor.

Issuer controls implemented at the organizational level generally need to be assessed only once,
since these controls span across the entire issuer and its issuing facilities. In other words, these
controls may not be re-assessed when the authorization boundary changes (e.g., due to addition
of facilities). Examples of organizational level controls include the set of controls under the
authorization focus areas Preparation and Maintenance of Documentation (DO) and Assignment
of Roles and Responsibilities (RR).
