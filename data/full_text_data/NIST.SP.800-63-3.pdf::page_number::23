                                                                                                 1. The claimant proves possession and control of the authenticator(s) to the verifier through
                                                                                                    an authentication protocol.

                                                                                                 3. The CSP or verifier provides an assertion about the subscriber to the RP, which may use

                                                                                                 4. An authenticated session is established between the subscriber and the RP.

                                                                                              In all cases, the RP should request the attributes it requires from a CSP before authenticating the
                                                                                              claimant. In addition, the claimant should be requested to consent to the release of those

                                                                                              In some cases, the verifier does not need to communicate in real time with the CSP to complete
