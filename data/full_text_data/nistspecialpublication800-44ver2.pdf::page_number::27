      practices. Training also supports individual accountability, which is an important method for
      improving information system security. If the user community includes members of the general
      public, providing security awareness specifically targeting them might also be appropriate.

 Contingency, Continuity of Operations, and Disaster Recovery Planning—Contingency plans,
  continuity of operations plans, and disaster recovery plans are established in advance to allow an
  organization or facility to maintain operations in the event of a disruption. 10

 Certification and Accreditation—Certification in the context of information systems security means
  that a system has been analyzed to determine how well it meets all of the security requirements of the
  organization. Accreditation occurs when the organization’s management accepts that the system
  meets the organization’s security requirements. 11

3.4     System Security Plan

The objective of system security planning is to improve protection of information system resources. 12
Plans that adequately protect information assets require managers and information owners—directly
affected by and interested in the information and/or processing capabilities—to be convinced that their
information assets are adequately protected from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or modification,
unavailability, and undetected activities.

The purpose of the system security plan is to provide an overview of the security and privacy
requirements of the system and describe the controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements.
The system security plan also delineates responsibilities and expected behavior of all individuals who
access the system. The system security plan should be viewed as documentation of the structured process
of planning adequate, cost-effective security protection for a system. It should reflect input from various
managers with responsibilities concerning the system, including information owners, the system owner,
and the ISSPM.

For Federal agencies, all information systems must be covered by a system security plan. Other
organizations should strongly consider the completion of a system security plan for each of their systems
as well. The information system owner 13 is generally the party responsible for ensuring that the security
plan is developed and maintained and that the system is deployed and operated according to the agreed-
upon security requirements.

In general, an effective system security plan should include the following:

 System Identification—The first sections of the system security plan provide basic identifying
  information about the system. They contain general information such as the key points of contact for
  the system, the purpose of the system, the sensitivity level of the system, and the environment in
  which the system is deployed.

      The information system owner is responsible for defining the system’s operating parameters, authorized functions, and
      security requirements. The information owner for information stored within, processed by, or transmitted by a system may
      or may not be the same as the information system owner. In addition, a single system may use information from multiple
      information owners.
