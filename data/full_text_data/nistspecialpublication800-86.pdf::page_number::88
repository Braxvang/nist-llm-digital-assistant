GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



          These are standardized protocols that do not protect the confidentiality of the data in transit,
          including any supplied authentication credentials, such as passwords. Secure alternatives, such as
          Secure FTP (SFTP) and Secure Copy (scp), encrypt their network communications. Most OSs
          have built-in file sharing clients (e.g., FTP, SMB), but users can also install various third-party
          programs that provide similar functionality.
      ! Peer-to-Peer. Most peer-to-peer file sharing services are primarily used to trade music, graphics,
        or software across the Internet. Unlike client/server file sharing, in which a single server holds
        the file repository, peer-to-peer file sharing is distributed, with files located on many different
        hosts. Peer-to-peer file sharing services typically have a central server that gives clients
        information on where other clients are located, but the server does not participate in the
        transmission of files or file information. Peer-to-peer file sharing services typically require no
        user authentication. All file browsing and transfers occur directly between the clients (peers).
        Users typically can choose from several client programs when using a particular service.
        Although most services allow each user to control which files are shared on their system, services
        known as encrypted peer-to-peer work by storing others’ files on an encrypted portion of each
        user’s hard drive, and giving users no control over or knowledge of what is stored in that area of
        their own systems. Anonymous peer-to-peer services send requested files through multiple
        intermediate hosts instead of simply sending them from source to destination, with the goal of
        making it very difficult to identify the true source or destination of any given file.
7.2.5     Document Usage

Many users spend much of their time working with documents, such as letters, reports, and charts.
Documents may contain any type of data, so they are often of interest to analysts. The class of software
used for creating, viewing, and editing such documents is known as office productivity applications. This
includes word processor, spreadsheet, presentation, and personal database software. Documents often
have user or system information embedded in them, such as the name or username of the person who
created or most recently edited the document, or the license number of the software or the MAC address
of the system used to create the document.125

7.2.6     Security Applications

Hosts often run one or more security applications that attempt to protect the host from misuse and abuse
occurring through commonly used applications, such as e-mail clients and Web browsers. Some
commonly used security applications are antivirus software, spyware detection and removal utilities,
content filtering (e.g., anti-spam measures), and host-based intrusion detection software. The logs of
security applications may contain detailed records of suspicious activity and may also indicate whether a
security compromise occurred or was prevented. If the security application is part of an enterprise
deployment, such as centrally managed and controlled antivirus software, logs may be available both on
individual hosts and on a centralized application log.

7.2.7     Data Concealment Tools

Some people use tools that conceal data from others. This might be done for benign purposes, such as
protecting the confidentiality and integrity of data against access by unauthorized parties, or for malicious
purposes, such as concealing evidence of improper activities. Examples of data concealment tools
include file encryption utilities, steganographic tools, and system cleanup tools. System cleanup tools are

      One example of an office productivity application that might capture user or system information within a document is
      Microsoft Office. More information on this topic is available from Microsoft Knowledge Base article 834427, located at
