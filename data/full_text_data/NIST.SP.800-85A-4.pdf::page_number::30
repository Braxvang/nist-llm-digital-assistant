                                                                       INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

A.1.2.1      Personal Identity Verification Card Application

AS01.06: The AID of the PIV Card Application shall be: 'A0 00 00 03 08         00 00 10 00    01
00'.

Note: This assertion is tested as part of the AS05.05 through AS05.10.

AS01.07: The AID of the PIV Card Application shall consist of the NIST Registered
application provider IDentifier (RID) 'A0 00 00 03 08' followed by the application portion of
the NIST PIX indicating the PIV Card Application '00 00 10 00' and then the version portion
of the NIST PIX '01 00' for the first version of the PIV Card Application.

Note: This assertion is tested as part of the AS05.05 through AS05.10.
A.1.2.2      Default Selected Card Application

AS01.08: The card platform shall support a default selected card application. In other words,
there shall be a currently selected application immediately after a cold or warm reset.

Required Vendor Information

VE01.08.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the default selected card application.

Required Test Procedures

TE01.08.01: The tester shall review the vendorâ€™s documentation and validate that there is a default
selected card application, which matches with the one specified by the vendor in VE01.08.01.
A.1.3      Security Architecture

A.1.3.1      Access Control Rule

AS01.09: An access control rule shall consist of an access mode and a security condition.

Note: This assertion is not separately tested.

AS01.10: The action described by the access mode can be performed on the data object if and
only if the security condition evaluates to TRUE for the current values of the security statuses.

Note: This assertion is not separately tested.

AS01.11: If there is no access control rule with an access mode describing a particular action,
then that action shall never be performed on the data object.

Note: This assertion is not separately tested.
