demilitarized zone
An interface on a routing firewall that is similar to the interfaces found on the firewall’s protected side. Traffic
moving between the DMZ and other interfaces on the protected side of the firewall still goes through the firewall
and can have firewall protection policies applied. [SP800-41r1]

denial of service
The prevention of authorized access to a system resource or the delaying of system operations and functions.
[RFC4949]

diagnostics
Information concerning known failure modes and their characteristics. Such information can be used in
troubleshooting and failure analysis to help pinpoint the cause of a failure and help define suitable corrective
measures. [ISADICT]

disaster recovery plan
A written plan for processing critical applications in the event of a major hardware or software failure or destruction
of facilities. [SP800-34r1] (adapted)

discrete process
A type of process where a specified quantity of material moves as a unit (part or group of parts) between work
stations and each unit maintains its unique identity. [ISADICT]

distributed control system
In a control system, refers to control achieved by intelligence that is distributed about the process to be controlled,
rather than by a centrally located single unit. [ISADICT]

disturbance
An undesired change in a variable being applied to a system that tends to adversely affect the value of a controlled
variable. [ANSI-ISA-51-1]

domain
An environment or context that includes a set of system resources and a set of system entities that have the right to
access the resources as defined by a common security policy, security model, or security architecture. [RFC4949]
(adapted)

encryption
Cryptographic transformation of data (called “plaintext”) into a form (called “ciphertext”) that conceals the data’s
original meaning to prevent it from being known or used. If the transformation is reversible, the corresponding
reversal process is called “decryption,” which is a transformation that restores encrypted data to its original state.
[RFC4949] (adapted)

enterprise
An organization that coordinates the operation of one or more processing sites.

fault tolerant
A system having the built-in capability to provide continued, correct execution of its assigned function in the
presence of a hardware and/or software fault.

field device
Equipment that is connected to the field side on an ICS. Types of field devices include RTUs, PLCs, actuators,
sensors, HMIs, and associated communications.

field site
A subsystem that is identified by physical, geographical, or logical segmentation within the ICS. A field site may
contain RTUs, PLCs, actuators, sensors, HMIs, and associated communications.
