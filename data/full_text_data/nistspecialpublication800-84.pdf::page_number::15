                                    GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



viability; and IT components or systems are tested to validate their operability in the context of an IT
plan. The TT&E plan should outline all elements of the program and ensure that information surrounding
the program is documented. In addition to creating the TT&E plan, other major steps in creating a TT&E
program are as follows:

       Develop a comprehensive policy
       Identify roles and responsibilities
       Establish overall schedule
       Document methodology.
These steps are described in more detail in Sections 2.1 through 2.4.

2.1     Develop Comprehensive TT&E Policy

A TT&E program should include a policy that outlines the organization’s internal and external
requirements associated with training personnel, exercising plans, and testing components and systems.
The policy forms the framework for the purpose and objectives of the program and cites applicable
Federal and internal guidance. The policy further provides the framework or “rules” that govern how the
organization develops and administers the TT&E events. The policy establishes a clear and consistent
framework for creating all of the documentation associated with TT&E events.

Key steps for developing a TT&E policy are as follows:

       Win the support and involvement of senior management, which includes ensuring that senior
        managers understand the program, the resources needed to make the program successful, the
        benefits and need for having the program, and any potential risks involved in creating the
        program
       Identify all relevant planning documentation (internal and external), such as past training records;
        organization’s policies; Federal guidance; and other practices obtained from other organizations
        or industry partners
       Collect all governing documentation and maintain the documentation within a central repository.
The following are suggested elements to include in a TT&E policy:

       Purpose
       Effective date
       Objectives
       Applicability and scope
       Authorities and related policies
       Roles and responsibilities of key business units and staff positions
       TT&E requirements
       TT&E review and approval
