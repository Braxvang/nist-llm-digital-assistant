D.13.3 Worker Safety Information Type

Worker Safety refers to those activities undertaken to save lives, prevent injuries, and protect the
health of America's workers. The recommended provisional categorization of the worker safety
information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of worker safety
information on the ability of responsible agencies to protect the health and safety of Americaâ€™s
workers. In some cases, premature release of draft worker safety bulletins might adversely affect
the effectiveness of agency operations. In general, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure
of worker safety information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for worker safety information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of worker safety information would
have, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.
Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications
(e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the
agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
worker safety information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to worker safety information. The
effects of disruption of access to most worker safety information or information systems
would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
worker safety information is low.
