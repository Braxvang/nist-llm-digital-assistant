      October 2023                                                                            Planning Guide

100   Call for Patent Claims
101   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use
102   would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information
103   Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or requirements may be
104   directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another publication. This call also
105   includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending U.S. or foreign patent applications
106   relating to this ITL draft publication and of any relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.
107   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its behalf,
108   in written or electronic form, either:
109      a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not hold
110         and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
111      b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available to
112         applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the guidance
113         or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:
114             i.   under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
115                  discrimination; or
116            ii.   without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
117                  demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.
118   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make assurances
119   on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents subject to the
120   assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the assurance are binding on
121   the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of
122   future transfers with the goal of binding each successor-in-interest.
123   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
124   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.
125   Such statements should be addressed to: log-mgmt@nist.gov
