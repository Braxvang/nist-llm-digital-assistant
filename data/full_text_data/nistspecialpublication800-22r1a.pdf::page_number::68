                                   very small (≤ 0.005) when M ≥ 10.

    For the N square matrices obtained,
                                €       their ranks Rl ,l = 1,…,N are evaluated, and the frequencies
    FM ,FM −1, and N − FM − FM −1 of the values M, M-1 and of ranks not exceeding M-2 are determined:

                                                      FM =# {Rl = M } ,

    To apply the Χ 2 -test, use the classical statistic

                      ( FM − 0.2888N ) + ( FM −1 − 0.5776N ) + (N − FM − FM −1 − 0.1336N ) ,
     €                       0.2888N                   0.5776N                   0.13336N

    which, under the null (randomness) hypothesis, has an approximate Χ 2 -distribution with 2 degrees of
    freedom. The reported P-value is exp{−Χ 2 (obs) /2}.
     €
    Interpretation of this test: large values of Χ 2 (obs) indicate
                                                                € that the deviation of the rank distribution from
    that corresponding to a random sequence is significant. For example, pseudo random matrices produced
                             € formed by less than M successive vectors systematically have rank Rl ≡ M ,
    by a shift-register generator
    while for truly random data, the proportion of such occurrences should be only about 0.29.

    3.6 Discrete Fourier Transform (Specral) Test
    The test described here is based on the discrete Fourier transform. It is a member of a class of procedures
    known as spectral methods. The Fourier test detects periodic features in the bit series that would indicate
    a deviation from the assumption of randomness.

    Let xk be the kth bit, where k = 1, ..., n. Assume that the bits are coded -1 and +1. Let
