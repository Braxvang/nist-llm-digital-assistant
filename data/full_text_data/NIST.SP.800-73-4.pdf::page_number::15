Special Publication 800-73-4      Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification â€“ Part 1: PIV
                               Card Application Namespace, Data Model and Representation

exception of the requirement for the PIV Card Application to enforce the minimum length
requirements for the PINs.

The requirement to enforce minimum length for the PINs at the card level is a security
requirement that did not appear in previous versions of SP 800-73. The implementation schedule
for this new requirement shall be phased in as part of new card stock acquisition by Federal
departments and agencies after final publication of this document.

1.4       Audience and Assumptions

This document is targeted at Federal agencies and implementers of PIV systems. Readers are
assumed to have a working knowledge of smart card standards and applications.
