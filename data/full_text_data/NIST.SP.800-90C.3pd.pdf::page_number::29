      NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                                                 Recommendation for RBG Constructions

784                                                        Fig. 6. Reseed_function

785       A Reseed_function (shown in Figure 6) is used to acquire at least s bits of fresh entropy for the
786       DRBG instance indicated by the state handle (or the only instance if no state handle has been
787       provided), where s is the security strength of the DRBG. 7 In addition to the randomness input
788       provided from the randomness source(s) during reseeding, optional additional input may be
789       incorporated into the reseed process. As discussed in Section 2.4.1, the capability for handling
790       and using additional input is recommended. (Details about the Reseed_function are provided in
791       [SP800-90A].)
792       An indication of the status is returned.
793       The Reseed_function is not permitted in an RBG1 construction (see Section 4) but is permitted
794       in the RBG2 and RBG3 constructions (see Sections 5 and 6, respectively).

795   2.8.1.4.             The Get_randomness-source_input Call
796   A Get_randomness-source_input call is used in the Instantiate_function and Reseed_function
797   in [SP800-90A] to indicate when a randomness source (i.e., an entropy source or RBG) needs to
798   be accessed to obtain randomness input. Details are not provided in SP 800-90A about how the
799   Get_randomness-source_input call needs to be implemented. SP 800-90C provides guidance on
800   how the call should actually be implemented based on various situations. Sections 4, 5, and 6
801   provide instructions for obtaining input from a randomness source when the Get_randomness-
802   source_input call is encountered in SP 800-90A. 8

803   2.8.2. Interfacing with Entropy Sources Using the GetEntropy and
804          Get_ES_Bitstring Functions

805   2.8.2.1.             The GetEntropy Call
806   An entropy source, as discussed in [SP800-90B], is a mechanism for producing bitstrings that
807   cannot be predicted and whose unpredictability can be quantified in terms of min-entropy. SP 800-
808   90B uses the following call for accessing an entropy source:
809                                  (status, ES_output) = GetEntropy (bits_of_entropy),


      7
       The value of s is available in the DRBGâ€™s internal state.
      8
        Note that, at this time, modifications to the Instantiate_function and Reseed_function specification in SP 800-90A and to the appropriate
      algorithms in Section 10 of that document may be required to accommodate the specific requests for entropy for each RBG construction.
