                                                                  INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

C.3.3.2        Contactless Interface
 Purpose              Validates that the card handles secure messaging error conditions
                      properly when using the contactless interface.
 Reference(s)         1. SP 800-73-4 Part 2, Table 2
                      2. AS05.43-R4
 Precondition(s)      1. The IUT is placed within the reading range of the contactless
                          reader.
                      2. There exists a valid PC/SC connection between the test system
                          and the contactless reader.
                      3. No other contactless card is within the proximity of the reader.
                      4. Secure messaging keys have not been established.
 Test Scenario        Perform the same steps as in C.3.3.1
 Expected Result(s) The commands will have the same expected results as C.3.3.1
 Postcondition(s)     N/A
