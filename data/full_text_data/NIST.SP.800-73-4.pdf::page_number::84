A PIV Card Application may use a subset of the cryptographic algorithms defined in SP 800-78. Tag
0xAC encodes the cryptographic algorithms supported by the PIV Card Application. The encoding of tag
0xAC shall be as specified in Table 5. Each instance of tag 0x80 shall encapsulate one algorithm. The
presence of algorithm identifier '27' or '2E' indicates that the corresponding cipher suite is supported by
the PIV Card Application for secure messaging and that the PIV Card Application possesses a PIV Secure
Messaging key of the appropriate size for the specified cipher suite. Tag 0xAC shall be present and
indicate algorithm identifier 0x27 or 0x2E (but not both) when the PIV Card Application supports secure
messaging.
