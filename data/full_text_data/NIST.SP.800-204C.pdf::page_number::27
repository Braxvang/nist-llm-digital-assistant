                                                                                              Compared to other models of software development, which involve a linear progression from

                                                                                              ship/package, and release) and a reverse process with a feedback loop (i.e., plan and monitor) that

                                                                                              Continuous integration emphasizes testing automation to ensure that the application is not broken

                                                                                                 •   Generation of data regarding software static and runtime flows.
                                                                                                 •   Reduction of development and deployment times.
                                                                                                 •   Built-in security, privacy, and compliance for the architecture.

                                                                                              of organizational resources and derive the greatest benefit in terms of an efficient, secure

                                                                                                 •   Testing of modules that perform time-sequenced operations, such as message publishers
                                                                                                     and message subscribers.
                                                                                                 •   Testing of workflows (e.g., request tracing) involving transactions that span multiple
