       Names and contact information of vendors, including alternate and offsite vendor POCs;
       Alternate and offsite facility requirements; and
       Vital records (electronic and hardcopy).

Because the ISCP contains potentially sensitive operational and personnel information, its distribution
should be marked accordingly and controlled. Typically, copies of the plan are provided to recovery
personnel for storage. A copy should also be stored at the alternate site and with the backup media.
Storing a copy of the plan at the alternate site ensures its availability and good condition in the event local
plan copies cannot be accessed because of disaster. The ISCP Coordinator should maintain a record of
copies of the plan and to whom they were distributed. Other information that should be stored with the
plan includes contracts with vendors (SLAs and other contracts), software licenses, system user manuals,
security manuals, and operating procedures.

Changes made to the plan, strategies, and policies should be coordinated through the ISCP Coordinator,
who should communicate changes to the representatives of associated plans or programs, as necessary.
The ISCP Coordinator should record plan modifications using a record of changes, which lists the page
number, change comment, and date of change. The record of changes, depicted in Table , should be
integrated into the plan as discussed in Section 4.1.

The ISCP Coordinator should coordinate frequently with associated internal and external organizations
and system POCs to ensure that impacts caused by changes within any organization will be reflected in
the contingency plan. Strict version control must be maintained by requesting old plans or plan pages to
be returned to the ISCP Coordinator in exchange for the new plan or plan pages. The ISCP Coordinator
also should evaluate supporting information to ensure that the information is current and continues to
meet system requirements adequately. This information includes the following:

       Alternate site contract, including testing times;
       Offsite storage contract;
       Software licenses;
       MOUs or vendor SLAs;
       Hardware and software requirements;
