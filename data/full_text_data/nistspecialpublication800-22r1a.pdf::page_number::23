A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



2.    Random Number Generation Tests

The NIST Test Suite is a statistical package consisting of 15 tests that were developed to test the
randomness of (arbitrarily long) binary sequences produced by either hardware or software based
cryptographic random or pseudorandom number generators. These tests focus on a variety of different
types of non-randomness that could exist in a sequence. Some tests are decomposable into a variety of
subtests. The 15 tests are:

        1.       The Frequency (Monobit) Test,
        2.       Frequency Test within a Block,
        3.       The Runs Test,
        4.       Tests for the Longest-Run-of-Ones in a Block,
        5.       The Binary Matrix Rank Test,
        6.       The Discrete Fourier Transform (Spectral) Test,
        7.       The Non-overlapping Template Matching Test,
        8.       The Overlapping Template Matching Test,
        9.       Maurer's "Universal Statistical" Test,
        10.      The Linear Complexity Test,
        11.      The Serial Test,
        12.      The Approximate Entropy Test,
        13.      The Cumulative Sums (Cusums) Test,
        14.      The Random Excursions Test, and
        15.      The Random Excursions Variant Test.

This section (Section 2) consists of 15 subsections, one subsection for each test. Each subsection provides
a high level description of the particular test. The corresponding subsections in Section 3 provide the
technical details for each test.

Section 4 provides a discussion of testing strategy and the interpretation of test results. The order of the
application of the tests in the test suite is arbitrary. However, it is recommended that the Frequency test
be run first, since this supplies the most basic evidence for the existence of non-randomness in a
sequence, specifically, non-uniformity. If this test fails, the likelihood of other tests failing is high.
(Note: The most time-consuming statistical test is the Linear Complexity test; see Sections 2.10 and
3.10).

Section 5 provides a user's guide for setting up and running the tests, and a discussion on program layout.
The statistical package includes source code and sample data sets. The test code was developed in ANSI
C. Some inputs are assumed to be global values rather than calling parameters.

A number of tests in the test suite have the standard normal and the chi-square ( χ 2 ) as reference
distributions. If the sequence under test is in fact non-random, the calculated test statistic will fall in
extreme regions of the reference distribution. The standard normal distribution (i.e., the bell-shaped
curve) is used to compare the value of the test statistic obtained from the RNG with the expected value of
the statistic under the assumption of randomness. The test statistic for the standard normal distribution is
of the form z = (x - µ)/σ, where x is the sample test statistic value, and µ and σ2 are the expected value
and the variance of the test statistic. The χ 2 distribution (i.e., a left skewed curve) is used to compare the
goodness-of-fit of the observed frequencies of a sample measure to the corresponding expected
