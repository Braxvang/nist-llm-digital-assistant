RESEARCH & APPLICATIONS DEVELOPMENT
NIST’s cybersecurity research and applications development activities include identifying
emerging and high-priority technologies, developing security solutions that will have a
high impact on the U.S. critical information infrastructure, and developing and showing
how to manage foundational building-block security mechanisms and techniques that
can be integrated into an organization’s mission-critical information systems.


Enabling Forensic Analysis Using Hypervisor Vulnerabilities Data
Virtualization drives much of today’s computing, and a basic component of that is the
use of hypervisors—the software, firmware, or hardware that creates and runs many
virtual machines. Because of the role that hypervisors play in critical technology such as
cloud computing, they are often the target of attacks. To help address this need, NIST
has developed a methodology to enable forensic analysis on attacks on hypervisors. Two
open-source hypervisors—Xen and Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)—were chosen as
platforms to illustrate the methodology by analyzing the most recent vulnerability data
from NIST’s National Vulnerability Database (NVD). The vulnerabilities were classified in
terms of hypervisor functionality, attack type, and attack source. Based on the relative
distribution of vulnerabilities in a hypervisor functionality, sample attacks were launched
to exploit vulnerabilities in the target hypervisor functionality, and the associated system
calls were logged. The gaps in evidence data that is required for fully detecting and
reconstructing those attacks were identified, and techniques required to gather missing
