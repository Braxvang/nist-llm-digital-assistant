1.     INTRODUCTION

The requirement to measure information security performance is driven by regulatory, financial,
and organizational reasons. A number of existing laws, rules, and regulations cite information
performance measurement in general, and information security performance measurement in
particular, as a requirement. These laws include the Clinger-Cohen Act, the Government
Performance and Results Act (GPRA), the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA), and
the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).
While these laws, rules, and regulations are important drivers for information security
measurement, equally compelling are the benefits that information security performance
measurement can yield for organizations. Agencies can use performance measures as
management tools in their internal improvement efforts and link implementation of their
information security programs to agency-level strategic planning efforts. Information security
measures are used to facilitate decision making and improve performance and accountability
through collection, analysis, and reporting of relevant performance-related data. They provide
the means for tying the implementation, efficiency, and effectiveness of security controls to an
agency’s success in its mission-critical activities. The performance measures development
process described in this document will assist agency information security practitioners in
establishing a relationship between information system and program security activities under
their purview and the agency mission, helping to demonstrate the value of information security
to their organization.

1.1    Purpose and Scope

This document is a guide for the specific development, selection, and implementation of
information system-level and program-level measures to indicate the implementation,
efficiency/effectiveness, and impact of security controls, and other security-related activities. It
provides guidelines on how an organization, through the use of measures, identifies the adequacy
of in-place security controls, policies, and procedures. It provides an approach to help
management decide where to invest in additional information security resources, identify and
evaluate nonproductive security controls, and prioritize security controls for continuous
monitoring. It explains the measurement development and implementation processes and how
measures can be used to adequately justify information security investments and support risk-
based decisions. The results of an effective information security measurement program can
provide useful data for directing the allocation of information security resources and should
simplify the preparation of performance-related reports. Successful implementation of such a
program assists agencies in meeting the annual requirements of the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) to report the status of agency information security programs.
NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-55, Revision 1, expands upon NIST’s previous work in the
field of information security measures to provide additional program-level guidelines for
quantifying information security performance in support of organizational strategic goals. The
processes and methodologies described in this document link information system security
performance to agency performance by leveraging agency-level strategic planning processes. By
doing so, the processes and methodologies help demonstrate how information security
