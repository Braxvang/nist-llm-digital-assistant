     NIST SP 800-171Ar3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                    Assessing CUI Security Requirements
     November 2023

47   Note to Reviewers
48   This update to NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-171A represents over one year of data
49   collection, technical analysis, customer interaction, redesign, and development of the procedures
50   for assessing the security requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Many
51   trade-offs have been made to ensure that the assessment procedures have been stated clearly and
52   concisely while also recognizing the specific needs of both federal and nonfederal organizations.
53   The following significant changes have been made in the initial public draft (ipd) of NIST SP
54   800-171A, Revision 3:
55       •   The restructuring of the assessment procedure syntax to align with NIST SP 800-53A [5].
56       •   The addition of a references section to provide source assessment procedures from NIST
57           SP 800-53A [5].

58   There has also been a one-time change to the publication version number to align with NIST SP
59   800-171, Revision 3 [3].

60   NIST is specifically interested in comments, feedback, and recommendations for the following
61   topics:
62       •   The alignment of the assessment procedures to NIST SP 800-53A [5].
63       •   The use of organization-defined parameters (ODPs) in the assessment procedures.
64       •   The ease-of-use of the assessment procedures in conducting assessments of the CUI
65           security requirements.

66   Reviewers are encouraged to comment on all or parts of NIST SP 800-171A, Revision 3 ipd.
67   NIST requests that all comments be submitted to 800-171comments@list.nist.gov by 11:59 p.m.
