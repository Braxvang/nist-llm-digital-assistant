5.1.2 Microsegmentation – Implementation Approaches
Before discussion of microsegmentation, a discussion of a traditional network segmentation –
called a segment-based approach – is in order to point out its limitations and difficulties. In this
approach, the applications and service resources with similar security requirements are grouped
into a unique segment, and firewall rules are created to block or allow communication with each
group or segment. The segments are created using network layer abstractions, such as VLAN IDs
or some other tagging approaches, while policies are defined using network address constructs
(e.g., IP addresses and ports). Policies apply to subnets (e.g., VLANs) and not to individual hosts.
Each segment is protected by gateway devices, such as intelligent switches and routers or next-
generation firewalls (NGFWs), which should have the capacity to react and adapt in response to
the threats and changes in the application workflows. Segmentation gateways monitor traffic, stop
threats, and enforce granular access across east-west traffic (rarely for north-south traffic) within
on-premises data centers or cloud regions. The main difficulty with this approach is in mapping
the applications’ security requirements-based segments to corresponding network segments [23].
Another difficulty is change management. The mapping between applications and network
identities that are being statically maintained has to continuously be kept in sync with the
operational scenario where the application’s network locations are continuously changing due to
performance and security reasons.
A schematic diagram of the segment-based microsegmentation is shown in Figure 1. Each
numbered microsegment in the figure is a unique VLAN identified by a VLAN ID. The group of
applications that will run in that particular VLAN segment can be defined using different criteria,
one of which is “all applications with similar security requirements”. Another criterion is that
“all tiers (web front-end, application logic servers, and database servers) associated with a
particular application” should run in a single microsegment, as shown in Figure 1.
