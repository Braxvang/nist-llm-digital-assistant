Synergies Among Risks
If a risk materializes that is closely related to multiple risks, it is likely that a cluster of risks will
materialize at or near the same time. Managing the adverse impact from one risk materializing
may be possible; managing multiple risks of high impact that materialize at the same time may
challenge the capacity of the organization and therefore needs to be managed much more closely.
The following questions address relationships among risks.

Will the materialization of a particular risk result in:
•     A high likelihood or virtual certainty of other identified risks materializing?
•     A high likelihood or virtual certainty of other identified risks not materializing?
•     No particular effect on other identified risks materializing?

If a risk is highly coupled to other risks or seen as likely to lead to other risks materializing
(whether the risk is the cause or materializes concurrently), the risk should be given higher
priority than a risk that has no particular effect on other risks. If a risk materializing actually
decreases the likelihood of other risks materializing, then further analysis is warranted to
determine which risks become a lower priority to mitigate.

In conclusion, organizations can benefit significantly by refining risk assessment results in
preparation for the risk response step in the risk management process. During the risk response
step, which is described in NIST Special Publication 800-39, organizations: (i) analyze different
courses of action; (ii) conduct cost-benefit analyses; (iii) address scalability issues for large-scale
implementations; (iv) examine the interactions/dependencies among risk mitigation approaches
(e.g., dependencies among security controls); and (v) assess other factors affecting organizational
missions/business functions. In addition, organizations address cost, schedule, and performance
issues associated with information systems and information technology infrastructure supporting
organizational missions/business functions.



                                             CAUTIONARY NOTE
    Organizations are cautioned that risk assessments are often not precise instruments of measurement
    and reflect the limitations of the specific assessment methodologies, tools, and techniques employed—
    as well as the subjectivity, quality, and trustworthiness of the data used. Risk determinations may be
    very coarse due to the assessment approach selected, the uncertainty in the likelihood of occurrence
    and impact values, and the potential mischaracterization of threats. Risks that are on the borderline
    between bins using the organization-defined binning scales, must ultimately be assigned to one bin.
    This determination could have a significant effect on the risk prioritization process. Thus, organizations
    should incorporate as much information as practical on particular risks during the prioritization process
    to ensure that the values for risks are appropriately determined (e.g., very low, low, moderate, high, very
    high).
