5.3.1    Firewalls

A firewall is a device that has a network protection application installed to safeguard the network from
intentional or unintentional intrusion. A firewall sits at the junction point or gateway between the two
networks, usually a private network and a public network such as the Internet. The term “firewall” is

Service providers can perform any or all of the following firewall functions:

 Design a firewall solution that incorporates single and/or multiple firewalls
 Install and integrate a firewall(s) into new and existing networks
 Monitor firewall services to ensure availability and integration with other technical controls, such as
  incident response or intrusion detection systems (IDS)
 Manage the organization’s firewalls, including periodically upgrading them.
The organization can select specific service providers with a trusted family of products that belongs to
them or general service providers who specialize in offering a wide variety of security services while
using products and components from outside vendors.

5.3.2    Intrusion Detection
