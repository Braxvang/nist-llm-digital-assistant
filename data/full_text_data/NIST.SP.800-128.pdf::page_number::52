                                                                                                         identify the likelihood of a threat exercising the vulnerability and the impact of such an
                                                                                                         event. Although vulnerabilities may be identified in changes as they are proposed, built,
                                                                                                         and tested, the assessed risk may be low enough that the risk can be accepted without
                                                                                                         remediation (i.e., risk acceptance). In other cases, the risk may be high enough that the
                                                                                                         change is not approved (i.e., risk avoidance), or that safeguards and countermeasures are
                                                                                                         implemented to reduce the risk (i.e., risk mitigation). 22

                                                                                                    iv. Assess Impact on Existing Security Controls - In addition to assessing the risk from the
                                                                                                        change, organizations analyze whether and how a change will impact existing security
                                                                                                        controls. For example, the change may involve installation of software that alters the
                                                                                                        existing baseline configuration, or the change itself may cause or require changes to the
                                                                                                        existing baseline configuration. The change may also affect other systems or system
                                                                                                        components that depend on the function or component being changed, either temporarily
                                                                                                        or permanently. For example, if a database that is used to support auditing controls is
                                                                                                        being upgraded to the latest version, auditing functionality within the system may be
                                                                                                        halted while the upgrade is being implemented.

                                                                                                    v. Plan Safeguards and Countermeasures - In cases where risks have been identified and
                                                                                                       are unacceptable, organizations use the security impact analysis to revise the change or to
                                                                                                       plan safeguards and countermeasures to reduce the risk. For instance, if the security
                                                                                                       impact analysis reveals that the proposed change causes a modification to a common
                                                                                                       secure configuration setting, plans to rework the change to function within the existing
                                                                                                       setting are initiated. If a change involves new elevated privileges for users, plans to
                                                                                                       mitigate the additional risk are made (e.g., submission of requests for higher clearance
