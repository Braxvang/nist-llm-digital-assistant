NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                  Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

       SR-1.1 Define the security aspects of the intended behavior and outcomes at the functional
              boundary of the system.
       Note: The intended behavior and security properties to be realized at the functional boundary
       consider the characteristics of the capability provided or used, the characteristics of the entities
       that interact with the system of interest at the functional boundary, and the associated
       assurance needs.
       SR-1.2 Define the security domains of the system and their correlation to the functional
              boundaries of the system.
       SR-1.3 Define the security aspects of the system requirements definition strategy.
       SR-1.4 Identify the security aspects for enabling systems or services needed to support system
              requirements definition.
       SR-1.5 Identify and plan for enabling systems or services needed to support the security
              aspects of system requirements definition.
       SR-1.6 Obtain or acquire access to the security aspects of enabling systems or services to be
              used in the system requirements definition.

SR-2   DEFINE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
       SR-2.1 Define each security function that the system is required to perform.
       Note: Security functions are defined for all system states, modes, and conditions of system
       operation and use, including the associated transitions between system states and modes.
       Security functions include those oriented to delivery of capability and the ability of the system
       to execute while preserving its inherent security characteristics.
       SR-2.2 Define the security aspects of each function that the system is required to perform.
       Note: This includes the need for other system functions to be non-interfering (Section D.4.1).
       SR-2.3 Define necessary security-driven implementation constraints.
       Note: Security-driven constraints on the system are from adversity, uncertainty, and risk,
       considering performance objectives and assurance needs. These constraints are informed by
       stakeholder requirements, the system architecture definition, and solution limitations across the
       life cycle.
       SR-2.4 Define necessary constraints on security implementation.
       Note: Constraints on security implementation are to satisfy expectations for non-security
       capabilities and performance.
       SR-2.5 Define system security requirements and rationale.
       Note: System security requirements include security capability and functional requirements,
       security performance and effectiveness requirements, security assurance requirements, and
       implementation constraints (SR-2.3 and SR-2.4 outcomes expressed as requirements).
       SR-2.6 Apply security metadata to the system security requirements.
