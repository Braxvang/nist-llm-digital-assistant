fulfillment of those purposes or such others as are not incompatible with those purposes
and as are specified on each occasion of change of purpose.

▪ Use Limitation. Personal data should not be disclosed, made available or otherwise
used for purposes other than those specified in accordance with the preceding principle
except: with the consent of the data subject; or by the authority of law.

▪ Security Safeguards. Personal data should be protected by reasonable security
safeguards against such risks as loss or unauthorized access, destruction, use,
modification or disclosure of data.

▪ Openness. There should be a general policy of openness about developments,
practices and policies with respect to personal data. Means should be readily available of
establishing the existence and nature of personal data, and the main purposes of their
use, as well as the identity and usual residence of the data controller.

▪ Individual Participation. An individual should have the right:
a) to obtain from a data controller, or otherwise, confirmation of whether or not the data
controller has data relating to him;
b) to have communicated to him, data relating to him within a reasonable time; at a
charge, if any, that is not excessive; in a reasonable manner; and in a form that is readily
intelligible to him;
c) to be given reasons if a request made under subparagraphs(a) and (b) is denied, and
to be able to challenge such denial; and
d) to challenge data relating to him and, if the challenge is successful to have the data
erased, rectified, completed or amended.

▪ Accountability. A data controller should be accountable for complying with measures
which give effect to the principles stated above.

Five core principles of privacy protection are also embodied in the Fair Information
Practice Codes [FTC07]. They are similar to those in the OECD guidelines, but targeted
toward commercial entities. Nevertheless, these principles provide a useful, supplemental
perspective on privacy protection.

▪ Notice/Awareness. Consumers should be given notice of an entity's information
practices before any personal information is collected to allow an informed decision to be
made about what extent, if any, to disclose personal information. Notice of some or all of
the following items are considered essential for ensuring that consumers are properly
informed: identification of the entity collecting the data; identification of the uses to which
the data will be put; identification of any potential recipients of the data; the nature of the
data collected and the means by which it is collected if not obvious (e.g., passively, by
means of electronic monitoring, or actively, by asking the consumer to supply the
information); indication of whether the provision of the requested data is voluntary or
required, and the consequences of a refusal to provide the requested information; and the
steps taken to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and quality of the collected data.

▪ Choice/Consent. Choice means giving consumers options about the use of personal
information that is collected. Choice relates specifically to secondary uses of information
that go beyond those needed to carry out the contemplated transaction. Opt-in or opt-out
are the two main types of choice/consent regimes. The former requires affirmation by the
consumer to allow collection, while the latter requires affirmation to prevent it. Choice can
also involve more than a binary option and allow consumers to tailor the type of the
information they reveal and the acceptable uses for it.
