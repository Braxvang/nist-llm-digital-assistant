Appendix C—Glossary

Selected terms used in the Guide to Secure Web Services are defined below. The sources of the
definitions are listed at the end of the appendix.

Agent: A program acting on behalf of a person or organization. [1]

Attribute: A distinct characteristic of an object often specified in terms of their physical traits, such as
size, shape, weight, and color, etc., for real-world objects. Objects in cyberspace might have attributes
describing size, type of encoding, network address, etc. [1]

Attribute Based Access Control: An access control approach in which access is mediated based on
attributes associated with subjects (requesters) and the objects to be accessed. Each object and subject
has a set of associated attributes, such as location, time of creation, access rights, etc. Access to an object
is authorized or denied depending upon whether the required (e.g., policy-defined) correlation can be
made between the attributes of that object and of the requesting subject. [2]

Brokered Trust: Describes the case where two entities do not have direct business agreements with each
other, but do have agreements with one or more intermediaries so as to enable a business trust path to be
constructed between the entities. The intermediary brokers operate as active entities, and are invoked
dynamically via protocol facilities when new paths are to be established. [3]

Choreography: Defines the requirements and sequences through which multiple Web services interact.
[1]

Component: A software object, meant to interact with other components, encapsulating certain
functionality or a set of functionalities. A component has a clearly defined interface and conforms to a
prescribed behavior common to all components within an architecture. [1]

Conversation: Where Web services maintain some state during an interaction that involves multiple
messages or participants. [1]

Coordination: Refers to the building, from a set of Web services, of something at a higher level,
typically itself exposed as a larger Web service. Also referred to as “Composability.” Choreography and
orchestration are two approaches to coordination. [4]

Defense Discovery Metadata Standard (DDMS): Defines discovery metadata elements for resources
posted to community and organizational shared spaces throughout the DoD enterprise. Specifically
DDMS defines a set of information fields that are to be used to describe any data or service asset that is
made known to the enterprise. [5]

Discovery: The act of locating a machine-processable description of a Web service-related resource that
may have been previously unknown and that meets certain functional criteria. It involves matching a set
of functional and other criteria with a set of resource descriptions. The goal is to find an appropriate Web
service-related resource. [1]

Discovery Service: A service that enables agents to retrieve Web services-related resource description.
