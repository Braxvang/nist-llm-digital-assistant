                                                                                                 This might be the case for several reasons, including:
                                                                                                    1. The cryptoperiod of the key has expired, and the keying material is no longer in operational
                                                                                                       storage;
                                                                                                    2. The keying material has been corrupted (e.g., the system has crashed, or a virus has
                                                                                                       modified the saved keying material in operational storage); or
                                                                                                    3. The key’s owner is not available, and the owner’s organization needs to obtain the plaintext
                                                                                                       information.
                                                                                                 In order to have this keying material available when required, the keying material needs to be
                                                                                                 saved somewhere or be constructible (e.g., derivable) from other available keying material. The
                                                                                                 process of reacquiring the keying material is called key recovery. Key recovery is often used as
                                                                                                 one method of information recovery when the plaintext information needs to be recovered from
                                                                                                 encrypted information. However, keying material or other related information may need to be
                                                                                                 recovered for other reasons, such as the corruption of keying material in normal operational storage
                                                                                                 (e.g., for the verification of MACs for archived documents); see Section 8.2.1. Key recovery may
                                                                                                 also be appropriate for situations in which it is easier or faster to recover the keying material than
                                                                                                 it is to generate and distribute new keying material.
                                                                                                 However, there are applications that may not need to save the keying material for an extended time
                                                                                                 because of other procedures to recover an operational capability when the keying material or the
                                                                                                 information protected by the keying material becomes inaccessible. Applications of this type could
                                                                                                 include telecommunications where the transmitted information could be resent or applications that
                                                                                                 could quickly derive or acquire new keying material for distribution.
                                                                                                 It is the responsibility of an organization to determine whether or not the recovery of keying

                                                                                                 should be made on a case-by-case basis, and this decision should be reflected in the Key-
