C.3        EPA Information on Electronic Recycling (e-Cycling)

Organizations and individuals wishing to donate used electronic equipment or seeking guidance
on disposal of residual materials after sanitization should consult the Environmental Protection
Agency’s (EPA) electronic recycling and electronic waste information website at
http://www.epa.gov/e-Cycling/. This site offers advice, regulations, and standard publications
related to sanitization, disposal, and donations. It also provides external links to other
sanitization tool resources.

C.4        Outsourcing Media Sanitization and Destruction

Organizations can outsource media sanitization and Destruction if business and security
management decide that this would be the most reasonable option for them to maintain
confidentiality while optimizing available resources. When exercising this option, this guide
recommends that organizations exercise “due diligence” when entering into a contract with
another party engaged in media sanitization. Due diligence for this case is accepted as outlined
in 16 CFR 682 which states “due diligence could include reviewing an independent audit of the
disposal company’s operations and/or its compliance with this rule [guide], obtaining
information about the disposal company from several references or other reliable sources,
requiring that the disposal company be certified by a recognized trade association or similar third
party, reviewing and evaluating the disposal company’s information security policies or
procedures, or taking other appropriate measures to determine the competency and integrity of
the potential disposal company.’ 25
