2. System Boundary Analysis and Security Controls
Before the system security plan can be developed, the information system and the
information resident within that system must be categorized based on a FIPS 199 impact
analysis. Then a determination can be made as to which systems in the inventory can be
logically grouped into major applications or general support systems. The FIPS 199
impact levels must be considered when the system boundaries are drawn and when
selecting the initial set of security controls (i.e., control baseline). The baseline security
controls can then be tailored based on an assessment of risk and local conditions
including organization-specific security requirements, specific threat information, cost-
benefit analyses, the availability of compensating controls, or special circumstances.
Common security controls, which is one of the tailoring considerations, must be
identified prior to system security plan preparation in order to identity those controls
covered at the agency level, which are not system-specific. These common security
controls can then be incorporated into the system security plan by reference.


2.1 System Boundaries
The process of uniquely assigning information resources9 to an information system
defines the security boundary for that system. Agencies have great flexibility in
determining what constitutes an information system (i.e., major application or general
support system). If a set of information resources is identified as an information system,
the resources should generally be under the same direct management control. Direct
management control10 does not necessarily imply that there is no intervening
management. It is also possible for an information system to contain multiple
subsystems.

A subsystem is a major subdivision or component of an information system consisting of
information, information technology, and personnel that perform one or more specific
functions. Subsystems typically fall under the same management authority and are
included within a single system security plan. Figure 3 depicts a general support system
with three subsystems.

In addition to the consideration of direct management control, it may be helpful for
agencies to consider if the information resources being identified as an information
system:

    â€¢   Have the same function or mission objective and essentially the same operating
        characteristics and security needs, and

  Information resources consist of information and related resources, such as personnel, equipment, funds,
and information technology.

   Direct management control typically involves budgetary, programmatic, or operational authority and
associated responsibility. For new information systems, management control can be interpreted as having
budgetary/programmatic authority and responsibility for the development and deployment of the
information systems. For information systems currently in the federal inventory, management control can
be interpreted as having budgetary/operational authority for the day-to-day operations and maintenance of
the information systems.
