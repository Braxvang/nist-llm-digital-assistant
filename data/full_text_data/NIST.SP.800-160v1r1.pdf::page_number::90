D.3.       Security Design Order of Precedence
The security design order of precedence (SecDOP) 69 is a design approach with the objective of
minimizing the system design basis for loss potential. SecDOP emphasizes the importance of
establishing a secure structural context for the employment of engineered features and devices.
Using a principled engineering approach, the SecDOP eliminates susceptibility, hazard, and
vulnerability to the extent practicable, thereby eliminating the associated risk. For those cases in
which susceptibility, hazard, or vulnerability cannot be eliminated, the SecDOP reduces the
potential of experiencing a loss to an acceptable level within the constraints of cost, schedule,
and performance. The SecDOP identifies design alternatives in order of decreasing effectiveness,
thus enabling a maximized return on investment.

The SecDOP alternatives are:
•    Eliminate the potential for loss through design selection
     Susceptibility, hazard, and vulnerability are eliminated by selecting a design or material
     alternative that completely removes susceptibility, hazard, and vulnerability and, thus,
     prevents loss.
     -     Example: The design selected for a system function of interest results in the minimum
           number of external interfaces to other systems and the minimum number of internal
           interfaces that provide the required functions. Since every interface presents a potential
           for susceptibility, hazard, and vulnerability, a design selection with the minimum number
           of interfaces results in less susceptibility, hazard, and vulnerability than a design that
           includes additional and unnecessary internal and external interfaces.
     -     Note: The design selection also considers the need to accommodate mechanisms that
           provide mediated access and trusted communication as these engineered features and
           devices are necessary for a secure system.
•    Reduce the potential for loss through design alteration
     If adopting an alternative design or material to eliminate susceptibility, hazard, and
     vulnerability is not feasible, consider design changes or material selections that would reduce
     the frequency, potential, severity, and/or extent of loss caused by the susceptibility, hazard,
     or vulnerability.
     -     Example: The selected design has interfaces and, therefore, has inherent susceptibilities,
           hazards, and vulnerabilities, both with respect to interactions with the environment and
           with respect to interactions within the system. The potential for loss can be reduced by
           altering design to segment functionality that interacts with external entities and influences
           from functionality strictly within system boundaries.
     -     Note: The design alteration also considers the need to accommodate mechanisms that
           provide mediated access and trusted communication, as these engineered features and
           devices are necessary for a secure system.

   The security design order of precedence is inspired by the System Safety Design Order of Precedence, an optimized design approach for system
safety described in [34].
