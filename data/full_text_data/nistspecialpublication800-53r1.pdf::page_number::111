PE-5      ACCESS CONTROL FOR DISPLAY MEDIUM

          Control: The organization controls physical access to information system devices that display
          information to prevent unauthorized individuals from observing the display output.
          Supplemental Guidance: None.

          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW Not Selected              MOD PE-5                     HIGH PE-5



PE-6      MONITORING PHYSICAL ACCESS

          Control: The organization monitors physical access to the information system to detect and respond
          to physical security incidents.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization reviews physical access logs periodically and investigates
          apparent security violations or suspicious physical access activities. Response to detected physical
          security incidents is part of the organizationâ€™s incident response capability.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization monitors real-time physical intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment.
          (2)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to recognize potential intrusions and initiate
                appropriate response actions.


           LOW PE-6                      MOD PE-6 (1)                 HIGH PE-6 (1) (2)



PE-7      VISITOR CONTROL

          Control: The organization controls physical access to the information system by authenticating
          visitors before authorizing access to the facility where the information system resides other than
          areas designated as publicly accessible.
          Supplemental Guidance: Government contractors and others with permanent authorization
          credentials are not considered visitors. Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials for federal
          employees and contractors conform to FIPS 201, and the issuing organizations for the PIV
          credentials are accredited in accordance with the provisions of NIST Special Publication 800-79.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization escorts visitors and monitors visitor activity, when required.


           LOW PE-7                      MOD PE-7 (1)                 HIGH PE-7 (1)
