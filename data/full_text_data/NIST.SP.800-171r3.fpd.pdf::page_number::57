       NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                       Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information

1532             DISCUSSION
1533             Alternate work sites include the private residences of employees or other facilities designated
1534             by the organization. Alternate work sites can provide readily available alternate locations during
1535             contingency operations. Organizations can define different security requirements for specific
1536             alternate work sites or types of sites, depending on the work-related activities conducted at the
1537             sites. Assessing the effectiveness of the requirements and providing a means to communicate
1538             incidents at alternate work sites supports the contingency planning activities of organizations.

1542   3.10.7. Physical Access Control
1543             REQUIREMENT: 03.10.07
1544             a. Control physical access at the location where the system resides by:
1545                  1. Verifying individual physical access authorizations before granting access; and
1546                  2. Controlling ingress and egress with physical access control systems/devices or guards.
1547             b. Maintain physical access audit logs for entry or exit points.
1548             c.   Escort visitors and control visitor activity [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances
1549                  requiring visitor escorts and control of visitor activity].
1550             d. Secure keys, combinations, and other physical access devices.

1551             DISCUSSION
1552             This requirement addresses physical locations containing systems or system components that
1553             process, store, or transmit CUI. Organizations determine the types of guards needed, including
1554             professional security staff or administrative staff. Physical access devices include keys, locks,
1555             combinations, biometric readers, and card readers. Physical access control systems comply with
1556             applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines.
1557             Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be procedural,
1558             automated, or some combination thereof. Physical access points can include exterior access
1559             points, interior access points to systems that require supplemental access controls, or both.
1560             Physical access control applies to employees and visitors. Individuals with permanent physical
1561             access authorizations are not considered visitors.

1565   3.10.8. Access Control for Transmission and Output Devices
1566             REQUIREMENT: 03.10.08
1567             a. Control physical access to system distribution and transmission lines in organizational
1568                facilities.
1569             b. Control physical access to output devices to prevent unauthorized individuals from
1570                obtaining access to CUI.
