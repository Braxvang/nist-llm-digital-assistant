SC-7      BOUNDARY PROTECTION

          Control: The information system monitors and controls communications at the external boundary
          of the information system and at key internal boundaries within the system.
          Supplemental Guidance: Any connections to the Internet, or other external networks or information
          systems, occur through managed interfaces consisting of appropriate boundary protection devices
          (e.g., proxies, gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, encrypted tunnels) arranged in an effective
          architecture (e.g., routers protecting firewalls and application gateways residing on a protected
          subnetwork commonly referred to as a demilitarized zone or DMZ). Information system boundary
          protections at any designated alternate processing sites provide the same levels of protection as
          that of the primary site.
          As part of a defense-in-depth protection strategy, the organization considers partitioning higher-
          impact information systems into separate physical domains (or environments) and applying the
          concepts of managed interfaces described above to restrict or prohibit network access in
          accordance with an organizational assessment of risk. FIPS 199 security categorization guides the
          selection of appropriate candidates for domain partitioning.
          The organization carefully considers the intrinsically shared nature of commercial
          telecommunications services in the implementation of security controls associated with the use of
          such services. Commercial telecommunications services are commonly based on network
          components and consolidated management systems shared by all attached commercial customers,
          and may include third party provided access lines and other service elements. Consequently, such
          interconnecting transmission services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract
          security provisions. Therefore, when this situation occurs, the organization either implements
          appropriate compensating security controls or explicitly accepts the additional risk. NIST Special
          Publication 800-77 provides guidance on virtual private networks. Related security controls: MP-
          4, RA-2.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization physically allocates publicly accessible information system components to
                separate subnetworks with separate, physical network interfaces.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Publicly accessible information system components
                include, for example, public web servers.
          (2)   The organization prevents public access into the organizationâ€™s internal networks except as
                appropriately mediated.
          (3)   The organization limits the number of access points to the information system to allow for better
                monitoring of inbound and outbound network traffic.
          (4)   The organization implements a managed interface (boundary protection devices in an effective
                security architecture) with any external telecommunication service, implementing controls
                appropriate to the required protection of the confidentiality and integrity of the information being
                transmitted.
          (5)   The information system denies network traffic by default and allows network traffic by exception
                (i.e., deny all, permit by exception).
          (6)   The organization prevents the unauthorized release of information outside of the information
                system boundary or any unauthorized communication through the information system boundary
                when there is an operational failure of the boundary protection mechanisms.
