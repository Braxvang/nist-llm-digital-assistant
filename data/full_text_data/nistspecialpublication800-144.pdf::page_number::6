Executive Summary
Cloud computing has been defined by NIST as a model for enabling convenient, on-demand
network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers,
storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal
management effort or cloud provider interaction [Mel11]. Cloud computing technologies can be
implemented in a wide variety of architectures, under different service and deployment models,
and can coexist with other technologies and software design approaches. The security challenges
cloud computing presents are formidable, including those faced by public clouds whose
infrastructure and computational resources are owned and operated by an outside party that
delivers services to the general public via a multi-tenant platform.

The emergence of cloud computing promises to have far-reaching effects on the systems and
networks of federal agencies and other organizations. Many of the features that make cloud
computing attractive, however, can also be at odds with traditional security models and controls.
The primary purpose of this report is to provide an overview of public cloud computing and the
security and privacy considerations involved. More specifically, this document describes the
threats, technology risks, and safeguards surrounding public cloud environments, and their
treatment. This document does not prescribe or recommend any specific cloud computing
service, service arrangement, service agreement, service provider, or deployment model. Each
organization is instead expected to apply the guidelines provided when performing its own
analysis of its requirements, and to assess, select, engage, and oversee the public cloud services
that can best fulfill those requirements.

The key guidelines from the report are summarized and listed below and are recommended to
federal departments and agencies.

Carefully plan the security and privacy aspects of cloud computing solutions before
engaging them.
Public cloud computing represents a significant paradigm shift from the conventional norms of
an organizational data center to a deperimeterized infrastructure open to use by potential
adversaries. As with any emerging information technology area, cloud computing should be
approached carefully with due consideration to the sensitivity of data. Planning helps to ensure
that the computing environment is as secure as possible and in compliance with all relevant
organizational policies and that privacy is maintained. It also helps to ensure that the agency
derives full benefit from information technology spending.

The security objectives of an organization are a key factor for decisions about outsourcing
information technology services and, in particular, for decisions about transitioning
organizational data, applications, and other resources to a public cloud computing environment.
Organizations should take a risk-based approach in analyzing available security and privacy
options and deciding about placing organizational functions into a cloud environment. The
information technology governance practices of the organizations that pertain to the policies,
procedures, and standards used for application development and service provisioning, as well as
the design, implementation, testing, use, and monitoring of deployed or engaged services, should
be extended to cloud computing environments.
