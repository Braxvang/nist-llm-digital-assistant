       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines

1587   Appendix A.      Deﬁnitions and Abbreviations
1588   This section is informative.

1589   A.1. Deﬁnitions
1590   A wide variety of terms is used in the realm of authentication. While many terms’
1591   definitions are consistent with earlier versions of SP 800-63, some have changed in this
1592   revision. Many of these terms lack a single, consistent definition, warranting careful
1593   attention to how the terms are defined here.
1594   Access
1595   To make contact with one or more discrete functions of an online, digital service.

1596   Activation
1597   The process of inputting an activation factor into a multi-factor authenticator to enable its
1598   use for authentication.

1599   Activation factor
1600   An additional authentication factor that is used to enable successful authentication
1601   with a multi-factor authenticator. Since all multi-factor authenticators are physical
1602   authenticators, activation factors are either memorized secrets or biometric factors.

1603   Active Attack
1604   An attack on the authentication protocol where the attacker transmits data to the claimant,
1605   Credential Service Provider (CSP), verifier, or Relying Party (RP). Examples of active
1606   attacks include attacker-in-the-middle (AitM), impersonation, and session hijacking.

1607   Address of Record
1608   The validated and verified location (physical or digital) where a subscriber can receive
1609   communications using approved mechanisms.

1610   Allowlist
1611   A documented list of specific elements that are allowed, per policy decision. In federation
1612   contexts, this is most commonly used to refer to the list of RPs allowed to connect to
1613   an IdP without subscriber intervention. This concept has historically been known as a
1614   whitelist.

1615   Applicant
1616   A subject undergoing the processes of enrollment and identity proofing.

1617   Approved Cryptography
