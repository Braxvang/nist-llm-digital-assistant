   Subject: Security Awareness and Reporting of Foreign Contacts
   [See http://www.usaid.gov/policy/ads/500/pdd-nsc-12.pdf.]

      Presidential Decision Directive/NSC-12 requires that government employees report all
      contacts with individuals of any nationality, either within or outside the scope of the
      employee's official activities, in which:

      •   Illegal or unauthorized access is sought to classified or otherwise sensitive
          information.
      •   The employee is concerned that he/she may be the target of actual or attempted
          exploitation by a foreign entity.

      Government employees must immediately report any discussion in which someone asks
      them to provide sensitive information which they are not authorized to receive. If in
      doubt, the agency Security Office has or knows personnel that are available to assess
      information and determine if a potential counterintelligence threat exists.
