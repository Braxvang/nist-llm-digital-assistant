   Traditional Enterprise Network Access Approaches and Their Limitations
Section 1 outlined the structural and security implications of the drivers for the current enterprise
network landscape, which have impacted the mechanics of secure access to applications through
the network. This section analyzes the security limitations of traditional network access
approaches.
   •   Limitation of network perimeter-based protections
   •   Limitations of VPN-based access
   •   Limitations of MPLS technology as enterprise WANs
   •   Limitations of authentication infrastructure

       Limitations of Network Perimeter-based Protections
Early solutions for secure enterprise network access were geared toward environments with well-
defined network perimeters. All enterprise IT resources were endpoints of enterprise LANs
(usually defined as a floor in a large enterprise, building, or small campus), and multiple LANs
connected together inside a defined building or campus constituted the internal corporate
network. Entry points into this corporate network were protected using devices called firewalls.
In this environment, all devices and users within firewalled LANs were totally trusted and,
hence, considered safe for accessing application resources. However, the following factors have
annulled the concept of that perimeter and greatly expanded the attack surface:
   •   Distributed nature of the application into ones located within a corporate data center,
       remote branch offices, and multiple cloud locations
   •   Perimeter approach based on the premise that the threat originates outside of the network,
       which is why most perimeter security solutions (e.g., intrusion prevention system - IPS,
       intrusion detection systems - IDS, firewalls) focus only on north-south traffic (i.e.,
       ingress, which refers to traffic that originates from outside of the local network and
       destined for endpoints in the local cluster network). However, over 75 % of network
       traffic is now east-west (i.e., within the local network) or server-to-server (due to
       applications being based on microservices), which is largely invisible to security teams,
       though some visibility is now sought through endpoint detection and response (EDR)
       solutions that collect security telemetry data on endpoints. Any threat that is already
       inside of a network can move laterally and remain undetected for days or even months.
   •   Edge computing [1], where much of the computing takes place close to the location of
       multiple IoT devices that may be geographically dispersed
   •   Users located both within and outside of the corporate network, such as in homes, remote
       branch offices, and public locations (e.g., hotels, pubs); some enterprises must also
       provide access to ecosystem partners, who may be on their own corporate networks

       Limitations of VPN-based Access
The increase in teleworking employees due to the pandemic has necessitated a means for secure
access to IT resources inside an enterprise network in the form of VPNs. A VPN allows
