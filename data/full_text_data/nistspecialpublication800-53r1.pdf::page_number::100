FAMILY: MAINTENANCE                                                                     CLASS: OPERATIONAL


MA-1      SYSTEM MAINTENANCE POLICY AND PROCEDURES

          Control:The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a formal,
          documented, information system maintenance policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
          responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and
          compliance; and (ii) formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the
          information system maintenance policy and associated system maintenance controls.
          Supplemental Guidance:   The information system maintenance policy and procedures are consistent
          with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.
          The information system maintenance policy can be included as part of the general information
          security policy for the organization. System maintenance procedures can be developed for the
          security program in general, and for a particular information system, when required. NIST Special
          Publication 800-12 provides guidance on security policies and procedures.
          Control Enhancements: None.

MA-2      CONTROLLED MAINTENANCE

          Control: The organization schedules, performs, documents, and reviews records of routine
          preventative and regular maintenance (including repairs) on the components of the information
          system in accordance with manufacturer or vendor specifications and/or organizational
          requirements.
          Supplemental Guidance: All maintenance activities to include routine, scheduled maintenance and
          repairs are controlled; whether performed on site or remotely and whether the equipment is
          serviced on site or removed to another location. Organizational officials approve the removal of
          the information system or information system components from the facility when repairs are
          necessary. If the information system or component of the system requires off-site repair, the
          organization removes all information from associated media using approved procedures. After
          maintenance is performed on the information system, the organization checks all potentially
          impacted security controls to verify that the controls are still functioning properly.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization maintains maintenance records for the information system that include: (i) the
                date and time of maintenance; (ii) name of the individual performing the maintenance; (iii) name of
                escort, if necessary; (iv) a description of the maintenance performed; and (v) a list of equipment
                removed or replaced (including identification numbers, if applicable).
          (2)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to schedule and conduct maintenance as
                required, and to create up-to date, accurate, complete, and available records of all maintenance
                actions, both needed and completed.
