 Precondition(s)      •   A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                          appropriate token reader.
                      •   Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and an
                          instance of the reader.
                      •   The Derived PIV Application Password is recorded.
                      •   The Derived PIV Application Password’s retry counter is not 0.
 Test Scenario        1. Send the SELECT command with
                            • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                      2. Send the GENERAL AUTHENTICATE command
                            • CLA is set to:
                                1. '00' if command chaining is not needed or
                                2. '10' if command chaining is used. (The last
                                   chain of the command sets CLA to '00')
                            • P1, algorithm reference, is set to '07', '11' or
                               '14'
                            • P2, key reference, is set to '9C' indicating the
                               digital signature key
                            • Data field in the command is to include '81'
                               specifying a challenge, followed by a randomly
                               generated challenge, and '82 00' in order to
                               request a response
                      3. Send the VERIFY command with
                            • P2, key reference value, is set to ‘80’
                            • Data field of the command will contain the
                               correct Derived PIV Application Password, padded
                               with ‘FF’ (if necessary) to complete the total
                               length of the value to 8 bytes
                      4. Repeat Step 2
                      5. Repeat Step 2
 Expected Result(s)   1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property template
                         with the status word ‘90 00’.
                      2. From Step 2, the command returns status word '69 82' (security
                         status not satisfied).
                      3. From Step 3, the command returns status word '90 00'.
                      4. From Step 4, the command returns the signed challenge with status
                         word ‘90 00’. Verify the signature using the public key from the
                         digital signature certificate and the challenge sent to the token.
                      5. From Step 5, the command returns status word '69 82' (security
                         status not satisfied), since the digital signature key has a “PIN
                         Always” security condition.
