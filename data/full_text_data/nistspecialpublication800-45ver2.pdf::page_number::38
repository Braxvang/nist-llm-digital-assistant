GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



information assets are adequately protected from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or modification,
unavailability, and undetected activities.

The purpose of the system security plan is to provide an overview of the security and privacy
requirements of the system and describe the controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements.
The system security plan also delineates responsibilities and expected behavior of all individuals who
access the system. The system security plan should be viewed as documentation of the structured process
of planning adequate, cost-effective security protection for a system. It should reflect input from various
managers with responsibilities concerning the system, including information owners, the system owner,
and the senior agency information security officer (SAISO).

For Federal agencies, all information systems must be covered by a system security plan. Other
organizations should strongly consider the completion of a system security plan for each of their systems
as well. The information system owner 25 is generally the party responsible for ensuring that the security
plan is developed and maintained and that the system is deployed and operated according to the agreed-
upon security requirements.

In general, an effective system security plan should include the following:

 System Identification. The first sections of the system security plan provide basic identifying
  information about the system. They contain general information such as the key points of contact for
  the system, the purpose of the system, the sensitivity level of the system, and the environment in
  which the system is deployed.
 Controls. This section of the plan describes the control measures (in place or planned) that are
  intended to meet the protection requirements of the information system. Controls fall into three
  general categories:

     –   Management controls, which focus on the management of the computer security system and the
         management of risk for a system. 26

     –   Operational controls, which are primarily implemented and executed by people (as opposed to
         systems). They often require technical or specialized expertise, and often rely upon management
         activities as well as technical controls.

     –   Technical controls, which are security mechanisms that the computer system employs. The
         controls can provide automated protection from unauthorized access or misuse, facilitate
         detection of security violations, and support security requirements for applications and data. The
         implementation of technical controls, however, always requires significant operational
         considerations and should be consistent with the management of security within the organization.

     The information system owner is responsible for defining the system’s operating parameters, authorized functions, and
     security requirements. The information owner for information stored within, processed by, or transmitted by a system may
     or may not be the same as the information system owner. In addition, a single system may utilize information from multiple
     information owners.
