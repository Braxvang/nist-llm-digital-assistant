CHAPTER 3                                                              System Development Life Cycle




Cost                    Determine how much of the product acquisition and integration cost can be attributed to
Considerations and       information security over the life cycle of the system. These costs include hardware,
Reporting 25             software, personnel, and training.

Security Planning 26    Fully document agreed-upon security controls, planned or in place.
                        Develop the system security plan.
                        Develop documents supporting the agency’s information security program (e.g., CM plan,
                         contingency plan, incident response plan, security awareness and training plan, rules of
                         behavior, risk assessment, security test and evaluation results, system interconnection
                         agreements, security authorizations/accreditations, and plans of action and milestones
                         [POA&M]).
                        Develop awareness and training requirements, including user manuals and
                         operations/administrative manuals.
Security Control        Develop, design, and implement security controls described in the respective security plans.
Development 27           For information systems currently in operation, the security plans for those systems that may
                         call for developing additional security controls to supplement the controls already in place or
                         for those that may call for modifying selected controls that are deemed to be less than
                         effective.
Developmental           Test security controls developed for a new information system or product for proper and
Security Test and        effective operation. Some types of security controls (primarily those controls of a
Evaluation               nontechnical nature) cannot be tested and evaluated until the information system is deployed;
                         these controls are typically management and operational controls.
                        Develop test plan/script/scenarios.
Other Planning          Ensure that all necessary components of the product acquisition and integration process are
Components               considered when incorporating security into the life cycle. These components include
                         selection of the appropriate contract type, participation by all necessary functional groups
                         within an organization, participation by the certifier and accreditor, and development and
                         execution of necessary contracting plans and processes.
C. Implementation Phase
Security Test and       Develop test data.
Evaluation              Test unit, subsystem, and entire system.
                        Ensure system undergoes technical evaluation (e.g., according to federal laws [Sec. 508],
                         regulations, policies, guidelines, and standards).
Inspection and          Verify and validate that the functionality described in the specification is included in the
Acceptance               deliverables.

System Integration/     Integrate the system at the operational site where it is to be deployed for operation. Enable
Installation             security control settings and switches in accordance with vendor instructions and proper
                         security implementation guidance.
Security                Ensure that the controls are effectively implemented through established verification
Certification 28         techniques and procedures and give organization officials confidence that the appropriate
                         safeguards and countermeasures are in place to protect the organization’s information.
                         Security certification also uncovers and describes the known vulnerabilities in the information
                         system. Existing security certification may need to be updated to include acquired products.
                         NIST SP 800-37 states that security certification determines the extent to which the security
                         controls in the information system are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and
                         producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting security requirements for the system.
