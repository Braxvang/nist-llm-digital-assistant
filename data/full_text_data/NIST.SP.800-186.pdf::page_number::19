   •   A polynomial basis is specified by an irreducible polynomial modulo 2 called the field
       polynomial. The bit string (am–1 … a2 a1 a0) is used to represent the polynomial

                                 am–1 t m–1 + …+ a2 t2 + a1 t + a0
       over GF(2). The field arithmetic is implemented as polynomial arithmetic modulo p(t),
       where p(t) is the field polynomial.
   •   A normal basis is specified by an element θ of a particular kind. The bit string (a0 a1 a2
       … am–1) is used to represent the element

                             a0θ + a1θ 2 + a2θ 2 + … + am–1θ 2
                                                2                 m–1
                                                                        .
       Normal basis field arithmetic is not easy to describe or efficient to implement in general
       except for a special class called Type T low-complexity normal bases. For a given field of
       degree m, the choice of T specifies the basis and the field arithmetic (see Appendix G.3).
There are many polynomial bases and normal bases from which to choose. The following
procedures are commonly used to select a basis representation:
   •   Polynomial Basis: If an irreducible trinomial tm + tk + 1 exists over GF(2), then the field
       polynomial p(t) is chosen to be the irreducible trinomial with the lowest-degree middle
       term tk. If no irreducible trinomial exists, then a pentanomial tm + ta + tb + tc + 1 is
       selected. The particular pentanomial chosen has the following properties: the second term
       ta has the lowest degree among all irreducible pentanomials of degree m; the third term tb
       has the lowest degree among all irreducible pentanomials of degree m with the second
       term ta; and the fourth term tc has the lowest degree among all irreducible pentanomials
       of degree m with the second term ta and third term tb.
   •   Normal Basis: Choose the Type T low-complexity normal basis with the smallest T.
For each binary field, the parameters are given for the above basis representations.

3.1.4. Choice of Curves
Two kinds of curves are given:
   •   Pseudorandom curves are those whose coefficients are generated from the output of a
       cryptographic hash function (with input from a random seed). If the domain parameter
       seed value is given along with the coefficients, it can be easily verified that the
       coefficients were generated by that method. The generation and verification procedures
       for the pseudorandom curves in this section are specified in Appendix C.3.
   •   Special curves are those whose coefficients and underlying fields have been selected to
       optimize the efficiency of the elliptic curve operations.
For each curve size range, the following curves are given in Sections 3.2 and 3.3:
   → A pseudorandom curve over GF(p)
   → A pseudorandom curve over GF(2m)
   → A special curve over GF(2m) called a Koblitz curve or anomalous binary curve
