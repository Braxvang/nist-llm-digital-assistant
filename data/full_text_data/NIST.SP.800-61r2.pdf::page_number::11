 Staffing and training the incident response team.
Organizations should reduce the frequency of incidents by effectively securing networks, systems,
and applications.

Preventing problems is often less costly and more effective than reacting to them after they occur. Thus,
incident prevention is an important complement to an incident response capability. If security controls are
insufficient, high volumes of incidents may occur. This could overwhelm the resources and capacity for
response, which would result in delayed or incomplete recovery and possibly more extensive damage and
longer periods of service and data unavailability. Incident handling can be performed more effectively if
organizations complement their incident response capability with adequate resources to actively maintain
the security of networks, systems, and applications. This includes training IT staff on complying with the
organization’s security standards and making users aware of policies and procedures regarding
appropriate use of networks, systems, and applications.

Organizations should document their guidelines for interactions with other organizations regarding
incidents.

During incident handling, the organization will need to communicate with outside parties, such as other
incident response teams, law enforcement, the media, vendors, and victim organizations. Because these
communications often need to occur quickly, organizations should predetermine communication
guidelines so that only the appropriate information is shared with the right parties.

Organizations should be generally prepared to handle any incident but should focus on being
prepared to handle incidents that use common attack vectors.

Incidents can occur in countless ways, so it is infeasible to develop step-by-step instructions for handling
every incident. This publication defines several types of incidents, based on common attack vectors; these
categories are not intended to provide definitive classification for incidents, but rather to be used as a
basis for defining more specific handling procedures. Different types of incidents merit different response
strategies. The attack vectors are:

 External/Removable Media: An attack executed from removable media (e.g., flash drive, CD) or a
  peripheral device.
 Attrition: An attack that employs brute force methods to compromise, degrade, or destroy systems,
  networks, or services.
 Web: An attack executed from a website or web-based application.
 Email: An attack executed via an email message or attachment.
 Improper Usage: Any incident resulting from violation of an organization’s acceptable usage
  policies by an authorized user, excluding the above categories.
 Loss or Theft of Equipment: The loss or theft of a computing device or media used by the
  organization, such as a laptop or smartphone.
 Other: An attack that does not fit into any of the other categories.
