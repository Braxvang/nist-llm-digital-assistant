AC-17     REMOTE ACCESS

          Control: The organization authorizes, monitors, and controls all methods of remote access to the
          information system.
          Supplemental Guidance:  Remote access is any access to an organizational information system by a
          user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled
          network (e.g., the Internet). Examples of remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and
          wireless. Remote access controls are applicable to information systems other than public web
          servers or systems specifically designed for public access. The organization restricts access
          achieved through dial-up connections (e.g., limiting dial-up access based upon source of request)
          or protects against unauthorized connections or subversion of authorized connections (e.g., using
          virtual private network technology). NIST Special Publication 800-63 provides guidance on
          remote electronic authentication. If the federal Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credential is
          used as an identification token where cryptographic token-based access control is employed, the
          access control system conforms to the requirements of FIPS 201 and NIST Special Publications
          800-73 and 800-78. NIST Special Publication 800-77 provides guidance on IPsec-based virtual
          private networks. Related security control: IA-2.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to facilitate the monitoring and control of
                remote access methods.
          (2)   The organization uses cryptography to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote access
                sessions.
          (3)   The organization controls all remote accesses through a limited number of managed access
                control points.
          (4)   The organization permits remote access for privileged functions only for compelling operational
                needs and documents the rationale for such access in the security plan for the information system.

AC-18     WIRELESS ACCESS RESTRICTIONS

          Control: The organization: (i) establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for
          wireless technologies; and (ii) authorizes, monitors, controls wireless access to the information
          system.
          Supplemental Guidance: NIST Special Publications 800-48 and 800-97 provide guidance on
          wireless network security. NIST Special Publication 800-94 provides guidance on wireless
          intrusion detection and prevention.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization uses authentication and encryption to protect wireless access to the information
                system.
          (2)   The organization scans for unauthorized wireless access points [Assignment: organization-defined
                frequency] and takes appropriate action if such an access points are discovered.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Organizations conduct a thorough scan for unauthorized
                wireless access points in facilities containing high-impact information systems. The scan is
                not limited to only those areas within the facility containing the high-impact information
                systems.
