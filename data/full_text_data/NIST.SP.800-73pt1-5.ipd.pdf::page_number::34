      NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1
      September 2023                                 PIV Card Application Namespace, Data Model, and Representation

815   The rest of the document uses “PIN” to mean either the PIV Card Application PIN or the Global
816   PIN.

817   5.1.1. OCC Data
818   This document does not specify how the biometric reference data and comparison parameters are
819   stored internally on the card. Moreover, the export of the biometric reference data SHALL NOT
820   be allowed. Configuration data related to the biometric reference data MAY be read from the tag
821   0x7F61 BIT Group template data object (see Section 3.3.6). Configuration data is defined in
822   Table 7 of [SP800-76]. The fingerprints used for OCC MAY be taken from the full set of
823   fingerprints collected for PIV background investigations and SHOULD be imaged from fingers
824   not imaged for off-card one-to-one comparison.

825   5.1.2. PIV Secure Messaging Key
826   If the PIV Card supports secure messaging, the PIV Secure Messaging key SHALL be generated
827   on the PIV Card, and the PIV Card SHALL NOT permit exportation of the PIV Secure
828   Messaging key. The cryptographic operations that use the PIV Secure Messaging key SHALL be
829   available through the contact and contactless interfaces of the PIV Card. The PKI cryptographic
830   function (see Table 5) is under an “Always” access rule, and thus private key operations (i.e.,
831   use of the key to establish session keys for secure messaging) CAN be performed without access
832   control restrictions.
833   The PIV Card SHALL store a corresponding secure messaging CVC to support validation of the
834   public key by the relying party. The format for the secure messaging CVC SHALL be as
835   specified in SP 800-73-5 Part 2, Section 4.1.5. The public key required to verify the digital
836   signature of the secure messaging CVC SHALL be provided in a certificate in the Secure
837   Messaging Certificate Signer data object, as specified in Section 3.3.7.

838   5.1.3. Pairing Code
839   If the PIV Card supports the virtual contact interface, then it SHALL implement support for the
840   pairing code. If implemented, the pairing code SHALL consist of eight decimal digits, and it
841   SHALL be generated at random by the PIV Card Issuer. The results of each random pairing code
842   generation SHALL be loaded onto — at most — one PIV Card and CANNOT be changed by the
843   cardholder. The pairing code value for a PIV Card SHALL be stored in the Pairing Code
844   Reference Data Container (see Section 3.3.8) on the card and MAY be printed on the back of the
845   card in an agency-specific text area (i.e., Zones 9B or 10B). PIV Card Issuers MAY choose to
846   provide the pairing code value to the cardholder in another manner, such as printing it on a slip
847   of paper rather than printing it on the back of the card. 13
848   Unlike the PIV Card Application PIN or the Global PIN, there are no restrictions on the caching
849   of the pairing code by client applications. It is recommended that a client application that needs
      13
         While printing the value of the pairing code on the back of the card provides maximum convenience for use by the cardholder and avoids any
      risk that the cardholder will forget the pairing code, it may create a risk that an attacker could obtain the value of the pairing code by
      surreptitiously reading it from the back of the card. Departments and agencies will need to make a risk-based decision when determining the
      method by which they provide cardholders with the values of their pairing codes.
