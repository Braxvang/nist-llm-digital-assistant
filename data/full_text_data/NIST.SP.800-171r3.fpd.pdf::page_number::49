1235   3.7.3. Withdrawn
1236           Incorporated into 03.08.03.


1237   3.7.4. Maintenance Tools
1238           REQUIREMENT: 03.07.04
1239           a. Approve, control, and monitor the use of system maintenance tools.
1240           b. Inspect the maintenance tools for improper or unauthorized modifications.
1241           c.   Check media containing diagnostic and test programs for malicious code before the media
1242                are used in the system.
1243           d. Prevent the removal of system maintenance equipment containing CUI by:
1244                1. Verifying that there is no CUI on the equipment;
1245                2. Sanitizing or destroying the equipment; or
1246                3. Retaining the equipment within the facility.

1247           DISCUSSION
1248           Approving, controlling, monitoring, and reviewing maintenance tools address security-related
1249           issues associated with the tools that are used for diagnostic and repair actions on the system.
1250           Maintenance tools can include hardware and software diagnostic and test equipment as well as
1251           packet sniffers. The tools may be pre-installed, brought in with maintenance personnel on media,
1252           cloud-based, or downloaded from a website. Diagnostic and test programs are potential vehicles
1253           for transporting malicious code into the system, either intentionally or unintentionally. Examples
1254           of media inspection include checking the cryptographic hash or digital signatures of diagnostic
1255           and test programs and/or media. If organizations inspect media that contain diagnostic and test
1256           programs and determine that the media also contains malicious code, the incident is handled
1257           consistent with incident handling policies and procedures. A periodic review of maintenance tools
1258           can result in the withdrawal of approval for outdated, unsupported, irrelevant, or no-longer-used
1259           tools. Maintenance tools do not address the hardware and software components that support
1260           maintenance and are considered a part of the system (including software implementing utilities
1261           such as “ping,” “ls,” “ipconfig,” or hardware and software that implement the monitoring port of
1262           an Ethernet switch).

1266   3.7.5. Nonlocal Maintenance
1267           REQUIREMENT: 03.07.05
1268           a. Approve and monitor nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities.
1269           b. Implement multi-factor authentication and replay resistance in the establishment of nonlocal
1270              maintenance and diagnostic sessions.
1271           c.   Terminate session and network connections when nonlocal maintenance is completed.
