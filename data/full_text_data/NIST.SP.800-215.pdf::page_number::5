Abstract
Access to multiple cloud services, the geographic spread of enterprise Information Technology
(IT) resources (including multiple data centers), and the emergence of microservices-based
applications (as opposed to monolithic ones) have significantly altered the enterprise network
landscape. This document is meant to provide guidance to this new enterprise network landscape
from a secure operations perspective. Hence, it starts by examining the security limitations of
current network access solutions to the enterprise network. It then considers security feature
enhancements to traditional network appliances in the form of point security solutions, network
configurations for various security functions (e.g., application/services security, cloud services
access security, device or endpoint security), security frameworks that integrate these individual
network configurations (e.g., zero trust network access [ZTNA]), and the evolving wide area
network (WAN) infrastructure to provide a comprehensive set of security services for the
modern enterprise network landscape (e.g., secure access service edge [SASE]).

Keywords
cloud access security broker (CASB); firewall; microsegmentation; secure access service edge
(SASE); secure web gateway (SWG); security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR);
software-defined perimeter (SDP); software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN); virtual
private network (VPN); zero trust network access (ZTNA).

Reports on Computer Systems Technology
The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
with industry, government, and academic organizations.
