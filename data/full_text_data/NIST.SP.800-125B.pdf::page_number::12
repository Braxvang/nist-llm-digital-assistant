                                                                                   FOR VM PROTECTION


control bridge between the virtual switches VS-1 and VS-2, while VM4 acts as the traffic control bridge
between the virtual switches VS-2 and VS-3. This configuration creates an isolated virtual network
segment based on the virtual switch VS-2 (DMZ of the virtual network), since VS-2 can only
communicate with the Internet using the firewall in VM1 and with the internal network using the firewall
in VM4. All VMs connected to the virtual switch VS-2 (VM2 and VM3) run in this isolated virtual
network segment as well. All traffic involving them and the external network is controlled by the firewall
in VM1, and all traffic involving them and the internal network is controlled by the firewall in VM4.




                    Figure 1: Segmentation Using Virtual Switches and Virtual Firewalls

Looking at the above virtual network configuration from a VM point of view (ignoring whether they run a
firewall or a business application), VM1 and VM4 are multi-homed VMs with at least one vNIC
connected to a virtual switch that has its uplink port connected to a physical NIC. By contrast, VM2 and
VM3 are connected only to an internal virtual switch, VS2, which is not connected to any physical NIC.
Such a virtual switch is called an internal-only switch. VMs connected only to internal-only switches
enjoy a degree of isolation because they run in an isolated virtual network segment.

2.3.1   Advantages

Virtual firewalls come packaged as virtual security appliances on purpose-built VMs, so they are easy to
deploy. Also, virtual firewalls can be easily integrated with virtualization management tools/servers, so
they can be easily configured (especially their security rules or access control lists (ACLs)) as well.

2.3.2   Disadvantages

The VMs hosting the virtual firewalls compete for the same hypervisor host resources (e.g., CPU,
memory) as VMs running business applications, since the former are co-hosted with the latter in the same
physical host.
