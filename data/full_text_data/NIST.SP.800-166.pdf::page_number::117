                                              Data field of the command containing the tag
                                              ('5FC105') of the X.509 Certificate for
                                              Derived PIV Authentication data object
                                     3. Extract the subjectPublicKeyInfo->subjectPublicKey
                                        from the certificate.
                                     4. Parse the exponent from the extracted public key.
 Expected Result(s)                  1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                                        template with the status word '90 00'.
                                     2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                                        along with the status word '90 00'.
                                     3. From Step 4, the exponent of the RSA asymmetric key for PIV
                                        Authentication is equal to 65 537.

 Test Assertion                      TA-09.03.02.01
 Purpose                             Verifies that the proper signature algorithm has been used to sign
                                     the digital signature certificate as specified in Table 3-3 of [SP800-
                                     78].
 DTR(s)                              • DTR-07.03.02.01

 Precondition(s)                     •   A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                                         appropriate token reader.
                                     •   Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                                         an instance of the reader.
                                     •   A digital signature certificate is present within the Derived PIV
                                         Application.
 Test Scenario                       1. Send the SELECT command with
                                           • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                                     2. Send the GET DATA command with
                                           • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                              ('5FC10A') of the X.509 Certificate for
                                              Digital Signature data object
                                     3. Extract signature->algorithm field value from the
                                        certificate.
 Expected Result(s)                  1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                                        template with the status word '90 00'.
                                     2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                                        along with the status word '90 00'.

  The digital signature key and certificate may be tested outside of the Derived PIV Application. Specific test
assertions can be developed by test entities to test this key and certificate based on the environment (e.g., email
application) in which the key pair is being used. See Appendix A for example testing approaches.
