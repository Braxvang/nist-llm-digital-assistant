The CIO put together a tiger team of top support professionals and a customer advocate who was very
familiar with the technical requirements and politics of each office in the bureau. The team began by
establishing a long-term vision for the BAR WLAN: an RSN using IEEE 802.1X port-based access
control and CCMP for data confidentiality and integrity. The team agreed that the need for immediate
security coupled with the diversity of equipment and configurations meant that an upgrade could not
happen in one step; it would be evolutionary. There would need to be an interim solution before they
could upgrade to the desired configuration.

The team drafted a WLAN use policy that was approved by the bureau’s Change Management Board
soon thereafter. The policy stated that WLAN communication within the bureau’s network would be
based on RSNAs only. Authentication would, at a minimum, be based on a user name and password,
although pre-shared key authentication would be permitted for an interim period of 120 days. Those
requiring WLAN support not based on RSNAs would be required to operate in a perimeter network
separated from the main network by a firewall. The WLAN would be limited to users who possessed
valid badges to the facility, including visiting scholars, interns, and contractors. Finally, the WLAN
could be used for any business activity also permitted on the wired network.

9.2.2   The Interim Solution: Acquisition/Development and Implementation

To plan the transition, the team decided to develop the interim strategy for each BSS or ESS in the current
infrastructure. Factors they considered included the functional capability of the current equipment, the
extent to which impacted users were familiar with WLAN key management, and the willingness of the
impacted users to accept change. They also consulted several NIST publications to guide them in their
planning effort, including NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information
Systems. The result of their strategy session was a matrix similar to Table 9-2.
