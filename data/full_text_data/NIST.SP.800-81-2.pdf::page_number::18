SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



domain names may even need to be replicated to provide fault tolerance. Second, there should be software
that manages this repository and provides the name resolution function. These two functions (managing
the domain names repository and providing name resolution service) are provided by the primary DNS
component, the name server. There are many categories of name servers, distinguished by type of data
served and functions performed. To access the services provided by a DNS name server on behalf of user
programs, there is another component of DNS called the resolver. There are two primary categories of
resolvers (caching/recursive/resolving name server and stub resolver),1 distinguished by functionality.
The communication protocol; the various DNS components; the policies governing the configuration of
these components; and procedures for creation, storage, and usage of domain names constitute the DNS
infrastructure.

2.2       DNS Infrastructure

The DNS infrastructure is made up of computing and communication entities that are geographically
distributed throughout the world. To understand this DNS infrastructure, it is necessary to examine first
the structure behind the organization of domain names. The domain name space (the universe of all
domain names) is organized in the form of a hierarchy. The topmost level in the hierarchy is the root
domain, which is represented as a dot (“.”). The next level in the hierarchy is called the top-level domain
(TLD). There is only one root domain, but there are many TLDs. Each TLD is called a child domain of
the root domain. In this context, the root domain is the parent domain because it is one level above a
TLD. Each TLD, in turn, can have many child domains. The children of TLDs are called second-level or
enterprise-level domains.

In a domain name representation, the symbol for the root domain usually is omitted. For example,
consider the domain name marketing.example.com. The rightmost label in this domain name (“com.”) is a
TLD. The next label to the left (“example”) is the second-level or enterprise-level domain. The leftmost
label (“marketing”) is the third-level domain. It also is possible to have a fourth-level domain, fifth-level
domain, and so forth. Because each of the labels in marketing.example.com is called a domain (TLD,
second-level domain, third-level domain, etc.), the concatenation of all these labels from the current level
to the TLD is a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). In this document, however, the FQDN is referred to
as simply a domain name, and the level name is used to identify individual labels.

There is only one root domain. There are several hundreds (possibly soon to be thousands) of TLD's,
categorized into the following three types:

      •    Country-code TLDs (ccTLDs)—domains associated with countries and territories. There are
           more than 240 ccTLDs. Examples include .uk, .in, and .jp.

      •    Sponsored generic TLDs (gTLDs)—specialized domains with a sponsor representing a
           community of interest. These TLDs include .edu, .gov, .int, .mil, .aero, .coop, and .museum.

      •    Unsponsored generic TLDs (gTLDs)—domains without a sponsoring organization. The list of
           unsponsored gTLDs includes .com, .net, .org, .biz, .info, .name, and .pro.
There are several million enterprise-level (second-level or lower) domains. In fact, as of December 2008
there were more than 77 million registered domain names in the .com gTLD alone. A partial DNS name
space hierarchy is shown in Figure 2-1.

      The caching/recursive/resolving name server is included under the category of resolver since it plays the dual role of being a
      resolver and a name server.
