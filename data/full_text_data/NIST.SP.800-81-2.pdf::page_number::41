for securing the DNS query/response transaction are data origin authentication and data integrity
verification.

These services could be provided by establishing trust in the source and verifying the signature of the data
sent by that source. The specification for a digital signature mechanism in the context of the DNS
infrastructure is in IETF’s DNSSEC standard. The objectives, additional RRs, and DNS message contents
involved in the DNSSEC are specified through RFCs 4033, 4034, and 4035 [RFC4033], [RFC4034],
[RFC4035]. In DNSSEC, trust in the public key (for signature verification) of the source is established
not by going to a third party or a chain of third parties (as in public key infrastructure [PKI] chaining), but
by starting from a trusted zone (such as the root zone) and establishing the chain of trust down to the
current source of response through successive verifications of signature of the public key of a child by its
parent. The public key of the trusted zone is called the trust anchor.

After authenticating the source, the next process DNSSEC calls for is to authenticate the response. This
requires that responses consist of not only the requested RRs but also an authenticator associated with
them. In DNSSEC, this authenticator is the digital signature of an RRSet. The digital signature of an
RRSet is encapsulated through a special RRType called RRSIG. The DNS client using the trusted public
key of the source (whose trust has just been established) then verifies the digital signature to detect if the
response is valid or bogus.

To ensure that RRs associated with a query are really missing in the zone file and have not been removed
in transit, the DNSSEC mechanism provides a means for authenticating the nonexistence of an RR. It
generates a special RR called an NSEC (or NSEC3) RR that lists the RRTypes associated with an owner
name as well as the next name in the zone file. It sends this special RR, along with its signature, to the
resolving name server. By verifying this signature, a DNSSEC-aware resolving name server can
determine which authoritative owner name exists in a zone and which authoritative RRTypes exist at
those owner names.

To protect against the threat of incorrect application of expansion rules for wildcard RRs, the DNSSEC
mechanism provides a means of comparing the validated wildcard RR against an NSEC (or NSEC3) RR
and thereby verifying that the name server applied the wildcard expansion rules correctly in generating an
answer.

DNSSEC can guarantee the integrity of name resolution responses to DNS clients acting on behalf of
Internet-based resources, provided the clients perform the DNSSEC signature verification. In many cases,
however, these DNS clients are stub resolvers that are not DNSSEC-aware. If signature verification is
performed by the resolving name server providing name resolution service for the clients that are stub
resolvers, the end-to-end integrity of the response data can be guaranteed only by protecting the
communication channel between the resolving name server and the stub resolver.

IETF’s design criteria consider DNS data to be public; hence, confidentiality is not one of the security
goals of DNSSEC. DNSSEC is not designed to directly protect against denial-of-service threats, although
it does so indirectly by providing message integrity and source authentication. DNSSEC also does not
provide communication channel security because name resolution queries and responses travel over
millions of nodes of the public Internet. DNSSEC also can lead to a new type of weakness that did not
exist in DNS before. An artifact of how DNSSEC performs negative responses allows a client to map all
the names in a zone. This is called Zone Walking. Zone Walking provides an attacker with a “map” of a
target zone with all domain names and IP addresses in the zone and enables him/her to determine the
configuration of the internal network and launch some targeted attacks on some key hosts. Therefore, it is
advisable that a zone only contains zone data that the administrator wants to be made public or use the
