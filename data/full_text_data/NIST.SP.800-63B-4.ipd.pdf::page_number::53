1555   6.   Authenticator Lifecycle Management
1556   This section is normative.
1557   A number of events can occur over the lifecycle of a subscriber’s authenticator that
1558   affect that authenticator’s use. These events include binding, loss, theft, unauthorized
1559   duplication, expiration, and revocation. This section describes the actions to be taken in
1560   response to those events.

1561   6.1. Authenticator Binding
1562   Authenticator binding refers to the establishment of an association between a specific
1563   authenticator and a subscriber account, enabling the authenticator to be used — possibly
1564   in conjunction with other authenticators — to authenticate for that subscriber account.
1565   Authenticators SHALL be bound to subscriber accounts either
1566        • by issuance by the CSP as part of enrollment or
1567        • by registration of a subscriber-provided authenticator that is acceptable to the CSP.
1568   These guidelines refer to the binding rather than the issuance of an authenticator to
1569   accommodate both options.
1570   Throughout the digital identity lifecycle, CSPs SHALL maintain a record of all
1571   authenticators that are or have been associated with each subscriber account. The CSP or
1572   verifier SHALL maintain the information required for throttling authentication attempts
1573   when required, as described in Sec. 5.2.2. The CSP SHALL also verify the type of
1574   user-provided authenticator (e.g., single-factor cryptographic device vs. multi-factor
1575   cryptographic device) so verifiers can determine compliance with requirements at each
1576   AAL.
1577   The record created by the CSP SHALL contain the date and time the authenticator was
1578   bound to the subscriber account. The record SHOULD include information about the
1579   source of the binding (e.g., IP address, device identifier) of any device associated with the
1580   enrollment. If available, the record SHOULD also contain information about the source of
1581   unsuccessful authentications attempted with the authenticator.
1582   When any new authenticator is bound to a subscriber account, the CSP SHALL ensure
1583   that the binding protocol and the protocol for provisioning the associated keys are done
1584   at a level of security commensurate with the AAL at which the authenticator will be used.
1585   For example, protocols for key provisioning SHALL use authenticated protected channels
1586   or be performed in person to protect against adversary-in-the-middle attacks. Binding of
1587   multi-factor authenticators SHALL require multi-factor authentication or equivalent (e.g.,
1588   association with the session in which identity proofing has been just completed) be used
1589   in order to bind the authenticator. The same conditions apply when a key pair is generated
1590   by the authenticator and the public key is sent to the CSP.
