      NIST SP 800-157r1 ipd                           Derived PIV Credentials (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


922       • References to “PIV authentication key” are replaced with “derived PIV
923         authentication key.”
924       • The derived PIV activation secret SHALL satisfy the criteria specified in Appendix
925         B.2.1 of this document rather than Sec. 2.4.3 of [SP800-73] Part 2.
926       • In Appendix A:
927           – References to “PIV Card application administrator” are replaced with “derived
928             PIV application administrator.”
929           – References to “card management key” are replaced with “derived PIV token
930             management key.”
931   The token platform SHALL support a default selected application, which is the selected
932   application that immediately following a cold or warm reset. This default application may
933   be the derived PIV application or another application.

934   B.2.1. Authentication of an Individual
935   Knowledge of a memorized secret (specifically the derived PIV activation secret) is the
936   means by which an individual can be authenticated to the derived PIV application.
937   The derived PIV activation secret SHALL be between 6 and 8 bytes in length. If the
938   actual length of the derived PIV activation secret is less than 8 bytes, it SHALL be
939   padded to 8 bytes with 0xFF when presented to the token command interface. The 0xFF
940   padding bytes SHALL be appended to the actual value of the secret. The bytes that
941   comprise the derived PIV activation secret SHALL be limited to values 0x30 – 0x39,
942   0x41 – 0x5A, and 0x61 – 0x7A: the ASCII values for the decimal digits ‘0’ – ‘9’; upper
943   case characters ‘A’ – ‘Z’; and lower case characters ‘a’ – ‘z’. For example,
944       • Actual derived PIV activation secret: “Part21” or (hexadecimal) 50 61 72 74 32
945         31
946       • Padded derived PIV activation secret presented to the card command interface
947         (hexadecimal): 50 61 72 74 32 31 FF FF
948 The derived PIV application SHALL enforce the minimum length requirement of 6 bytes
949 for the derived PIV activation secret (i.e., SHALL verify that at least the first 6 bytes of
950 the value presented to the card command interface are in the range 0x30 – 0x39, 0x41
951 – 0x5A, or 0x61 – 0x7A) as well as the other formatting requirements specified in this

952 section.
