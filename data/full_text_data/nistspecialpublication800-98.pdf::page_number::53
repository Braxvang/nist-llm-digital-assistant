                                                                                      SECTION 4: RFID RISKS



4.    RFID Risks

RFID technology enables an organization to significantly change its business processes to:

 Increase its efficiency, which results in lower costs,
 Increase its effectiveness, which improves mission performance and makes the implementing
  organization more resilient and better able to assign accountability, and
 Respond to customer requirements to use RFID technology to support supply chains and other
  applications.
The RFID technology itself is complex, combining a number of different computing and communications
technologies to achieve the desired objectives. Unfortunately, both change and complexity generate risk.
For RFID implementations to be successful, organizations need to effectively manage that risk, which
requires an understanding of its sources and its potential characteristics.

This section reviews the major high-level business risks associated with RFID systems so that
organizations planning or operating these systems can better identify, characterize, and manage the risk in
their environments. The risks are as follows:

 Business Process Risk. Direct attacks on RFID system components potentially could undermine the
  business processes the RFID system was designed to enable.
 Business Intelligence Risk. An adversary or competitor potentially could gain unauthorized access
  to RFID-generated information and use it to harm the interests of the organization implementing the
  RFID system.
 Privacy Risk. Personal privacy rights or expectations may be compromised if an RFID system uses
  what is considered personally identifiable information for a purpose other than originally intended or
  understood. The personal possession of functioning tags also is a privacy risk because it could enable
  tracking of those holding tagged items.
 Externality Risk. RFID technology potentially could represent a threat to non-RFID networked or
  collocated systems, assets, and people.
An important characteristic of RFID that impacts all of these risks is that RF communication is invisible
to operators and users. In other AIDC and IT systems, it often is easier to identify when unauthorized
behavior is occurring. This section characterizes the risks listed above in more detail. The security
controls that mitigate these risks are discussed in Section 5.

4.1   Business Process Risk

RFID systems typically are implemented to replace or enhance a paper or partially automated process.
Organizations implementing RFID systems could become reliant on those systems, which if not
implemented properly with business continuity planning might be less resilient to disruptions than the
systems they replace. For example, suppose that a warehouse replaces its paper-based inventory
management system with an RFID-enabled system. The paper system involves storing completed forms
at the warehouse and sending form duplicates to a central office, while the new RFID system locates its
backend database servers at a single computing center. In this environment, the paper system might be
more resilient to a local disaster than the RFID system, despite the increased efficiency, accuracy, or
effectiveness of the RFID-enabled business process.
