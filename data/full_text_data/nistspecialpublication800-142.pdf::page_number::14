2.1.2 Input Parameter Testing

        Even if an application has no configuration options, some form of input will be
processed. For example, a word processing application may allow the user to select 10
ways to modify some highlighted text: subscript, superscript, underline, bold, italic,
strikethrough, emboss, shadow, small caps, or all caps. The font-processing function
within the application that receives these settings as input must process the input and
modify the text on the screen correctly. Most options can be combined, such as bold and
small caps, but some are incompatible, such as subscript and superscript.

        Thorough testing requires that the font-processing function work correctly for all
valid combinations of these input settings. But with 10 binary inputs, there are 210 = 1,024
possible combinations. But the empirical analysis reported above shows that failures
appear to involve a small number of parameters, and that testing all 3-way combinations
may detect 90% or more of bugs. For a word processing application, testing that detects
better than 90% of bugs may be a cost-effective choice, but we need to ensure that all 3Â­
way combinations of values are tested. To do this, we create a test suite to cover all 3-way
combinations (known as a covering array) [12, 14, 23, 26, 30, 43, 63].

        An example is given in Figure 3, which shows a 3-way The key component
covering array for 10 variables with two values each. The
                                                                     is a covering array,
interesting property of this array is that any three columns
contain all eight possible values for three binary variables. which includes all t-
For example, taking columns F, G, and H, we can see that all way combinations.

101, 110, 111) occur somewhere in the three columns parameter. Each
together. In fact, any combination of three columns chosen in row is a test.
any order will also contain all eight possible values.
Collectively, therefore, this set of tests will exercise all 3-way combinations of input values
in only 13 tests, as compared with 1,024 for exhaustive coverage.
