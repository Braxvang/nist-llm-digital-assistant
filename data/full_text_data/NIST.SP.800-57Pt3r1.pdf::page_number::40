          Send and receive signed and encrypted messages,
          Request, send and process signed receipts, and
          Process messages from secure e-mail list clients (includes suppressing receipts, as
           required, and nondisclosure of list recipients, as required).

Furthermore, federal systems shall:
          Utilize cryptographic modules that are FIPS 140-1 or FIPS 140-2 validated [FIPS
           140-2],
          Support cryptographic Cipher Suite 1 (see Table 5-1 below), and
          Support X.509 certificates that conform to Federal PKI X.509 Certificates and the
           CRL Extensions Profile.

Federal clients should be capable of sending and processing e-mail with security labels
and securely binding senders’ certificates to their signatures through the signing
certificate attribute as described in [RFC 5035].22

The most widely accepted, standard S/MIME profile is [RFC 5751]. Not all
cryptographic algorithms available for use in support of the features in the profile are
appropriate for the protection of Federal Government information. The S/MIME
specifications allow the selection of individual algorithms. However, a number of cipher
suites have been specified to define a specific combination of algorithms. Federal
organizations shall use approved algorithms within S/MIME implementations for key
establishment and transmitting messages. Tables 5-1 through 5-3 specify a variety of
cipher suites that may be used to protect federal information and information systems
(based on [SP 800-49] and [RFC 6318]). Any of the algorithms listed in the following
tables may be used, in accordance with security strength time frame restrictions given in
Part 1 and [SP 800-131A] to protect federal information in combinations other than those
displayed.

     Both of these services are defined in S/MIME V3 standards [RFC 2634].
