EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Title III of the E-Government Act (Public Law 107-347), titled the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA), tasked the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to
develop:
   •   Standards to be used by all Federal agencies to categorize all information and information
       systems collected or maintained by or on behalf of each agency based on the objectives
       of providing appropriate levels of information security according to a range of risk levels;
   •   Guidelines recommending the types of information and information systems to be
       included in each such category; and
   •   Minimum information security requirements (i.e., management, operational, and
       technical security controls), for information and information systems in each such
       category.
In response to the second of these tasks, this guideline has been developed to assist Federal
government agencies to categorize information and information systems. The guideline’s
objective is to facilitate provision of appropriate levels of information security according to a
range of levels of impact or consequences that might result from the unauthorized disclosure,
modification, or loss of availability of the information or information system. This guideline
assumes that the user is familiar with Standards for Security Categorization of Federal
Information and Information Systems (FIPS 199). The guideline and its appendices:
   •   Review the security categorization terms and definitions established by FIPS 199;
   •   Recommend a security categorization process;
   •   Describe a methodology for identifying types of Federal information and information
       systems;
   •   Suggest provisional security impact levels for common information types;
   •   Discuss information attributes that may result in variances from the provisional security
       impact level assignment; and
   •   Describe how to establish a system security categorization based on the system’s use,
       connectivity, and aggregate information content.
This document is intended as a reference resource rather than as a tutorial. Not all of the
material will be relevant to all agencies. This document includes two volumes, a basic guideline
and a volume of appendices. Users should review the guidelines provided in Volume I, then
refer to only that specific material from the appendices that applies to their own systems and
applications.
The provisional security impact level assignments contained in appendices C and D are only the
first step in impact assignment and subsequent risk assessment processes. The impact
assignments are not intended to be used by auditors as a definitive checklist for information
types and impact assignments.
