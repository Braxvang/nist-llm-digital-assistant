       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                         Recommendation for RBG Constructions

2382   for input to the DRBG, even though full-entropy bits are required for input to the XOR operation
2383   (shown as “⊕” in the figure) from the entropy source via the conditioning function.

2386   As specified in Section 6.2, the DRBG must be instantiated (and reseeded) at 256 bits, which is
2387   possible for SHA-256.
2388   In this example, only a single instantiation is used, and a personalization string is provided during
2389   instantiation. The DRBG is not directly accessible.
2390   Calls are made to the RBG using the RBG3(XOR) calls specified in Section 6.2.
2391   The Hash_DRBG itself is not directly accessible.
2392   This example provides the following capabilities:
2393       •   Full-entropy output by the RBG,
2394       •   Fallback to the security strength provided by the Hash_DRBG (256 bits) if the entropy
2395           source has an undetected failure, and
2396       •   Access to an entropy source to instantiate and reseed the Hash_DRBG.

2397   B.5.1. Instantiation of an RBG3(XOR) Construction
2398   The Hash_DRBG is instantiated using:
2399                      status = RBG3(XOR)_DRBG_Instantiate(“RBG3(XOR)”),
