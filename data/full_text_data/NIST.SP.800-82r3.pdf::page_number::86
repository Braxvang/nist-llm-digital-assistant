       Defense-in-Depth Architecture Capabilities
Many organizations are embracing digital transformation initiatives that require altering their OT
environments and developing strategies that provide a multi-tiered information architecture by
supporting organization objectives, such as:
   •   Maintenance of field devices, telemetry collection, or industrial-level process systems
   •   Enhanced data collection and dissemination
   •   Remote access
Overall, integration between IT and OT is increasing as organizations adapt to changing local
and global needs and requirements. Utilizing the principles of a defense-in-depth architecture to
systematically layer security controls – including people, processes, and technology – can help
organizations strengthen their overall cybersecurity defenses. As a result, adversaries may find it
increasingly difficult to penetrate the environment without detection. The following sections
discuss specific defense-in-depth layers, including topics and ideas for organizations to consider
when developing and implementing their defense-in-depth cybersecurity architecture. The layers
are:
   •   Layer 1 – Security Management
   •   Layer 2 – Physical Security
   •   Layer 3 – Network Security
   •   Layer 4 – Hardware Security
   •   Layer 5 – Software Security

5.2.1. Layer 1 – Security Management
Security management or governance is the overarching cybersecurity program that supports the
OT environment. Sections 3 and 4 discuss the program and risk management considerations for
organizations to establish their cybersecurity programs. These programmatic and organizational
decisions will guide and impact the decisions made for the other defense-in-depth layers. As a
result, organizations should complete this layer before attempting to implement the other layers.

5.2.2. Layer 2 – Physical Security
Physical security measures are designed to reduce the risk of accidental or deliberate loss or
damage to assets and the surrounding environment. Safeguarded assets may include control
systems, tools, equipment, the environment, the surrounding community, and intellectual
property, including proprietary data (e.g., process settings and customer information).
Organizations may also need to consider additional environmental, safety, regulatory, legal, and
other requirements when implementing physical security.
