NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                               Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                      Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


   •   Document features supported by the implementation (e.g., prediction resistance,
       personalization string, additional input, etc.).
   •   If DRBG mechanism functions are distributed, specify the mechanisms that are used to
       protect the confidentiality and integrity of the internal state or parts of the internal state
       that are transferred between the distributed DRBG mechanism sub-boundaries (i.e.,
       provide documentation about the secure channel).
   •   In the case of the CTR_DRBG, indicate whether a derivation function is provided. If a
       derivation function is not used, document that the implementation can only be used when
       full entropy input is available.
   •   Document any support functions other than health testing.
   •   If periodic testing is performed for the generate function, document the intervals and
       provide a justification for the selected intervals (see Section 11.3.3).
   •   Document whether the DRBG functions can be tested on demand.
   •   Document how the integrity of the health tests will be determined subsequent to
       implementation validation testing.

11.2 Implementation Validation Testing

A DRBG mechanism shall be tested for conformance to this Recommendation. A DRBG
mechanism shall be designed to be tested to ensure that the product is correctly implemented. A
testing interface shall be available for this purpose in order to allow the insertion of input and the
extraction of output for testing.
Implementations to be validated shall include the following:
   •   The documentation specified in Section 11.1.
   •   Any documentation or results required in derived test requirements.
All DRBG functions included in an implementation shall be tested, including the health test
functionality. The error handling of all implemented DRBG functions will be tested. See Section
11.4 for expected error handling behavior.
Note that when the uninstantiate function is tested, testing shall demonstrate that the internal
state has been zeroized.

11.3 Health Testing

A DRBG implementation shall perform self-tests to obtain assurance that the DRBG continues
to operate as designed and implemented (health testing). The testing function(s) within a DRBG
mechanism boundary (or sub-boundary) shall test each DRBG mechanism function within that
boundary (or sub-boundary), with the possible exception of the health test function itself. A
DRBG implementation may optionally perform other self-tests for DRBG functionality in
addition to the tests specified in this Recommendation.
