may also need to demonstrate compliance with security requirements expressed in legislation,
regulation, and policy. All of these tasks are extremely time-consuming and error-prone because
there has been no standardized, automated way of performing them. Another problem for
organizations is the lack of interoperability across security tools; for example, the use of
proprietary names for vulnerabilities or platforms creates inconsistencies in reports from multiple
tools, which can cause delays in security assessment, decision making, and vulnerability
remediation. Organizations need standardized, automated approaches to overcoming these
challenges.

Automation is an efficient way to enable ISCM within and across domains to capture, correlate,
analyze, and report the overall security status of the organization. Automation specifications and
standardized formats enable the interoperability and flow of data between these domains. Just
about every security tool provides some sort of automated capability as part of its functionality,
including importing and exporting data and performing other pre-configured, unassisted
operations. Some of these automated capabilities rely on proprietary methods and protocols,
while others use standardized specifications and methods. When using a tool that automatically
configures devices or changes settings, the new configurations are first tested in a test
environment. Some examples of security automation activities include:

•    Scanning for vulnerabilities and automatically applying the appropriate patches;
•    Automatically enabling security configurations based on a checklist of security settings;
•    Scanning for compliance against a pre-configured checklist of security settings; and

•    Collecting security metrics from tools and reporting them to a management console in a
     standardized format.
These are just a few of the many security activities that can be automated. The tools and
technologies discussed in this publication leverage a variety of supporting protocols,
specifications, and resources to provide the standardization and interoperability necessary to
enable ISCM.

The automation specification movement is a community-driven effort to standardize the format
and nomenclature for communicating security and IT related information. These data exchange
standards create the foundation for automating activities across disparate vendor tool sets, as well
as interoperability across domain boundaries. The most mature and widely used set of
specifications is the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP), which is used to standardize
the communication of software flaws and security configurations. This section discusses how
SCAP, the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), and security configuration checklists are used
to represent and communicate data in a standardized format for performing security automation
capabilities and their roles in supporting an ISCM program.

D.3.1 SECURITY CONTENT AUTOMATION PROTOCOL (SCAP)
SCAP is a suite of specifications 50 that standardizes the format and nomenclature by which
security software products communicate security flaw and security configuration information.
SCAP is a multipurpose protocol that supports automated vulnerability and patch checking,
