                                                               GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


    -     SOCKS-based IPv6/IPv4 Gateway Mechanism (RFC 3089)
    -     Application Level Gateways.
  6.6.1    SIIT

SIIT stands for Stateless IP/ICMP Translation. It replaces headers, IPv4 for IPv6 and vice versa. It also
translates ICMP messages and adds the ICMP pseudo-header checksum. If necessary, it fragments and
reassembles IPv4 messages.

6.6.1.1      Using SIIT

SIIT uses IPv4-translated addresses to refer to IPv6-enabled nodes. When it needs to create an IPv6
address from an IPv4 address w.x.y.z, it uses 0:0:FFFF:0:0:0:w.x.y.z. SIIT uses IPv4 mapped addresses
to refer to IPv4-only nodes: 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF.w.x.y.z. SIIT thus requires IPv6 interfaces to obtain an IPv4
address and is not a convenient transition mechanism for an IPv6 dominant network.

SIIT also adjusts the payload length appropriately and equates the following fields:

         IPv4 traffic class and IPv6 TOS
         IPv4 protocol number and IPv6 next header number
         IPv4 TTL and IPv6 hop limit.


  6.6.2    NAT-PT

NAT-PT stands for Network Address Translation—Protocol Translation. It uses SIIT and performs NAT
traversal for IPv4. NAT-PT allows IPv6 systems and services to communicate with IPv4 systems and
vice versa. NAT-PT is the successor to IPv4 NAT, which is well understood and widely deployed.

6.6.2.1      Using NAT-PT

NAT-PT is controversial for may reasons, which are explained in detail in RFC 4966. The IETF
recommends that it no longer be used, and discussions of how it may be revised are ongoing. Its biggest
benefit is that IPv6 connectivity becomes possible for legacy applications that may never have IPv6
support. The main objections to NAT-PT are that it reintroduces the scaling and operational issues of
NAT into IPv6 and may make full migration to IPv6 more difficult. For example:

         It breaks end-to-end security: DNSSEC has to terminate on the NAT if it performs translation
          and IPsec cannot transit NAT-PT.

         It prevents full deployment of new applications.

         It may be a single point of failure and performance bottleneck.

         Protocols with embedded IP addresses do not work.

         Protocols like RSVP that do not use port numbers cannot be multiplexed.

In addition, translation is incompatible with multicast, mobility, and multihoming. Where possible, a
