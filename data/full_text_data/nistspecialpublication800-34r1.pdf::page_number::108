                                                CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



Recovery Phase – The Recovery phase details the activities and procedures for recovery of the affected
system. Activities and procedures are written at a level that an appropriately skilled technician can
recover the system without intimate system knowledge. This phase includes notification and awareness
escalation procedures for communication of recovery status to system owners and users.

Reconstitution – The Reconstitution phase defines the actions taken to test and validate system capability
and functionality at the original or new permanent location. This phase consists of two major activities:
validating successful reconstitution and deactivation of the plan.

During validation, the system is tested and validated as operational prior to returning operation to its
normal state. Validation procedures may include functionality or regression testing, concurrent
processing, and/or data validation. The system is declared recovered and operational by system owners
upon successful completion of validation testing.

Deactivation includes activities to notify users of system operational status. This phase also addresses
recovery effort documentation, activity log finalization, incorporation of lessons learned into plan
updates, and readying resources for any future events.

2.3       Roles and Responsibilities

The ISCP establishes several roles for {system name} recovery and reconstitution support. Persons or
teams assigned ISCP roles have been trained to respond to a contingency event affecting {system name}.

Describe each team and role responsible for executing or supporting system recovery and reconstitution.
Include responsibilities for each team/role, leadership roles, and coordination with other recovery and
reconstitution teams, as applicable. At a minimum, a role should be established for a system owner or
business unit point of contact, a recovery coordinator, and a technical recovery point of contact.

Leadership roles should include an ISCP Director, who has overall management responsibility for the
plan, and an ISCP Coordinator, who is responsible to oversee recovery and reconstitution progress,
initiate any needed escalations or awareness communications, and establish coordination with other
recovery and reconstitution teams as appropriate.

3.        Activation and Notification

The Activation and Notification Phase defines initial actions taken once a {system name} disruption has
been detected or appears to be imminent. This phase includes activities to notify recovery personnel,
conduct an outage assessment, and activate the ISCP. At the completion of the Activation and
Notification Phase, {system name} ISCP staff will be prepared to perform recovery measures.

3.1       Activation Criteria and Procedure

The {system name} ISCP may be activated if one or more of the following criteria are met:
      1. The type of outage indicates {system name} will be down for more than {RTO hours};
      2. The facility housing {system name} is damaged and may not be available within {RTO hours};
         and
      3. Other criteria, as appropriate.

The following persons or roles may activate the ISCP if one or more of these criteria are met:
