       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                                        Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

2802   Note: The entropy of a random variable X is a mathematical measure of the amount of information gained by an
2803   observation of X.
2804   Note: The most common concepts are Shannon entropy and min-entropy. Min-entropy is the measure used in SP 800-
2805   90.

2806   entropy rate
2807   The validated rate at which an entropy source provides entropy in terms of bits per entropy-source output (e.g., five
2808   bits of entropy per eight-bit output sample).

2809   entropy source
2810   The combination of a noise source, health tests, and optional conditioning component that produce bitstrings
2811   containing entropy. A distinction is made between entropy sources having physical noise sources and those having
2812   non-physical noise sources.
2813   Note: Health tests are comprised of continuous tests and startup tests.

2814   fresh entropy
2815   A bitstring that is output from a non-deterministic randomness source that has not been previously used to generate
2816   output or has otherwise been made externally available.
2817   Note: The randomness source should be an entropy source or RBG3 construction.

2818   full-entropy bitstring
2819   A bitstring with ideal randomness (i.e., the amount of entropy per bit is equal to 1). This Recommendation assumes
2820   that a bitstring has full entropy if the entropy rate is at least 1 − ε, where ε is at most 2−32.

2821   hash function
2822   A (mathematical) function that maps values from a large (possibly very large) domain into a smaller range. The
2823   function satisfies the following properties:
2824       1.   (One-way) It is computationally infeasible to find any input that maps to any pre-specified output.
2825       2.   (Collision-free) It is computationally infeasible to find any two distinct inputs that map to the same output.

2826   health testing
2827   Testing within an implementation immediately prior to or during normal operations to obtain assurance that the
2828   implementation continues to perform as implemented and validated.

2829   ideal randomness source
2830   The source of an ideal random sequence of bits. Each bit of an ideal random sequence is unpredictable and unbiased,
2831   with a value that is independent of the values of the other bits in the sequence. Prior to an observation of the sequence,
2832   the value of each bit is equally likely to be 0 or 1, and the probability that a particular bit will have a particular value
2833   is unaffected by knowledge of the values of any or all of the other bits. An ideal random sequence of n bits contains n
2834   bits of entropy.

2835   independent entropy sources
2836   Two entropy sources are independent if knowledge of the output of one entropy source provides no information about
2837   the output of the other entropy source.

2838   instantiate
2839   The process of initializing a DRBG with sufficient randomness to generate pseudorandom bits at the desired security
2840   strength.

2841   internal state (of a DRBG)
2842   The collection of all secret and non-secret information about an RBG or entropy source that is stored in memory at a
2843   given point in time.
