      NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                                Enrollment and Identity Proofing


138   Taking into account feedback provided in response to our June 2020 Pre-Draft Call
139   for Comments, as well as research conducted into real-world implementations of the
140   guidelines, market innovation, and the current threat environment, this draft seeks to:
141      1. Advance Equity: This draft seeks to expand upon the risk management content
142         of previous revisions and specifically mandates that agencies account for impacts
143         to individuals and communities in addition to impacts to the organization. It also
144         elevates risks to mission delivery – including challenges to providing services to
145         all people who are eligible for and entitled to them – within the risk management
146         process and when implementing digital identity systems. Additionally, the guidance
147         now mandates continuous evaluation of potential impacts across demographics,
148         provides biometric performance requirements, and additional parameters for the
149         responsible use of biometric-based technologies, such as those that utilize face
150         recognition.
151      2. Emphasize Optionality and Choice for Consumers: In the interest of promoting
152         and investigating additional scalable, equitable, and convenient identify verification
153         options, including those that do and do not leverage face recognition technologies,
154         this draft expands the list of acceptable identity proofing alternatives to provide
155         new mechanisms to securely deliver services to individuals with differing means,
156         motivations, and backgrounds. The revision also emphasizes the need for digital
157         identity services to support multiple authenticator options to address diverse
158         consumer needs and secure account recovery.
159      3. Deter Fraud and Advanced Threats: This draft enhances fraud prevention
160         measures from the third revision by updating risk and threat models to account
161         for new attacks, providing new options for phishing resistant authentication, and
162         introducing requirements to prevent automated attacks against enrollment processes.
163         It also opens the door to new technology such as mobile driver’s licenses and
164         verifiable credentials.
165      4. Address Implementation Lessons Learned: This draft addresses areas where
166         implementation experience has indicated that additional clarity or detail was
167         required to effectively operationalize the guidelines. This includes re-working
168         the federation assurance levels, providing greater detail on Trusted Referees,
169         clarifying guidelines on identity attribute validation sources, and improving address
170         confirmation requirements.
171   NIST is specifically interested in comments on and recommendations for the following
172   topics:
173   Identity Proofing and Enrollment
174       • NIST sees a need for inclusion of an unattended, fully remote Identity Assurance
175         Level (IAL) 2 identity proofing workflow that provides security and convenience,
176         but does not require face recognition. Accordingly, NIST seeks input on the
177         following questions:

                                                   ii
