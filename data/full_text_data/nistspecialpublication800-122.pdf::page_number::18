not limited to, the potential for blackmail, identity theft, physical harm, discrimination, or emotional
distress. Organizations may also experience harm as a result of a loss of confidentiality of PII maintained
by the organization, including but not limited to administrative burden, financial losses, loss of public
reputation and public confidence, and legal liability.

The following describe the three impact levels—low, moderate, and high—defined in FIPS 199, which
are based on the potential impact of a security breach involving a particular system: 31

          ―The potential impact is LOW if the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be
          expected to have a limited adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or
          individuals. A limited adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality,
          integrity, or availability might (i) cause a degradation in mission capability to an extent and
          duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the effectiveness of the
          functions is noticeably reduced; (ii) result in minor damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in
          minor financial loss; or (iv) result in minor harm to individuals.

          The potential impact is MODERATE if the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could
          be expected to have a serious adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets,
          or individuals. A serious adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality,
          integrity, or availability might (i) cause a significant degradation in mission capability to an
          extent and duration that the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the
          effectiveness of the functions is significantly reduced; (ii) result in significant damage to
          organizational assets; (iii) result in significant financial loss; or (iv) result in significant harm to
          individuals that does not involve loss of life or serious life threatening injuries.

          The potential impact is HIGH if the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be
          expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations,
          organizational assets, or individuals. A severe or catastrophic adverse effect means that, for
          example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability might (i) cause a severe degradation
          in or loss of mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is not able to
          perform one or more of its primary functions; (ii) result in major damage to organizational assets;
          (iii) result in major financial loss; or (iv) result in severe or catastrophic harm to individuals
          involving loss of life or serious life threatening injuries.‖

Harm to individuals as described in these impact levels is easier to understand with examples. A breach
of the confidentiality of PII at the low impact level would not cause harm greater than inconvenience,
such as changing a telephone number. The types of harm that could be caused by a breach involving PII
at the moderate impact level include financial loss due to identity theft or denial of benefits, public
humiliation, discrimination, and the potential for blackmail. Harm at the high impact level involves
serious physical, social, or financial harm, resulting in potential loss of life, loss of livelihood, or
inappropriate physical detention.

3.2     Factors for Determining PII Confidentiality Impact Levels 32

Determining the impact from a loss of confidentiality of PII should take into account relevant factors.
Several important factors that organizations should consider are described below. It is important to note
that relevant factors should be considered together; one factor by itself might indicate a low impact level,
but another factor might indicate a high impact level, and thus override the first factor. Also, the impact
