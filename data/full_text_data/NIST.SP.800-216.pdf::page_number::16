May 2023                                                                                                              Disclosure Guidelines

Each FCB member should, at a minimum, perform the three high-level functions shown in Fig.
2. Prior to operation, the FCB members should have developed the capability to receive source
vulnerability reports, determined the scope of their operations, and established federal and
industry contacts. Some additionally support a technical analysis capability.
The remainder of Fig. 2 addresses the operational aspects. In operation, the FCB receives the
source vulnerability reports and investigates them to determine validity and prioritize resource
allocations. Vulnerability reports that do not identify government-only systems may be routed to
an industry vulnerability coordination group and/or be delivered directly to the appropriate EC,
such as a software developer.
The FCB works with the VDPO closest to the affected system to identify the specific
vulnerability. If the vulnerable software or service is not government-owned, the FCB forwards
the report to the appropriate developer or to an industry vulnerability coordination group. The
FCB may then work with the relevant VDPO to produce an advisory about the impact of the
vulnerability on applicable government systems. If the software or service is government-
developed or supported, the FCB will submit a findings report to the applicable VDPO for
vulnerability verification and remediation. The FCB will aid the relevant VDPO if requested and
per resource availability. Finally, the FCB may publish an advisory on the vulnerability if the
agency – more specifically, the relevant system owner – determines that the vulnerability may
have a public impact.
It is not expected that there will be a large number of FCB members. Rather, the FCB may
include agency operational units with special mission expertise not aligned with existing FCB
members. Each FCB member supports a defined subset of the Government, minimizing the
overlap of scope as much as possible. In addition, the FCB members expend resources engaging
and coordinating with industry to fix vulnerabilities within industry products that are used by the
Government. Most agencies will leverage the services provided by an FCB member, will not
themselves be part of the FCB, and will instead establish their own VDPOs to handle the
vulnerabilities discovered within their own systems.

             Preparation
FCB members need to develop several foundational policies and capabilities, including the
ability to receive source vulnerability reports, coordinate securely with reporters, determine the
scope of services for federal systems, and – optionally – develop a technical vulnerability
analysis and mitigation team.

2.1.1. Create Source Vulnerability Report Receipt Capability
Each FCB member should develop the ability to receive source vulnerability reports from
reporters, maintain a database of received reports, and engage in secure communications (e.g.,
using a report tracking system). 2 The expectation for communication with the reporter should be
established, including the initial acknowledgment, status updates, and agreed-upon method of
communication. The actual receipt of a source vulnerability report may take multiple forms (e.g.,
email, web forms, or a phone hotline) and should be stated in a public policy. It is also
