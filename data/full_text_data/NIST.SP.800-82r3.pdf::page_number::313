 SI-22      Information Diversity

OT Discussion: Many OT systems use information diversity in their design to achieve reliability
requirements. Some examples of information diversity for an OT system include sensor voting
and state estimation.

OT Discussion: Supply chain policies and procedures for OT should consider both components
received and components produced. Many OT systems use legacy components that cannot meet
modern supply chain expectations. Appropriate compensating controls should be developed to
achieve organizational supply chain expectations for legacy systems.
