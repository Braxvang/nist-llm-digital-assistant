       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines

1133   5.1.4. Impact Analysis
1134   The impact analysis helps determine the extent to which risk must be mitigated by the
1135   identity proofing, authentication, and federation processes. These determinations drive
1136   the relevant choices of applicable technologies and mitigation strategies, rather than the
1137   desire for any given technology driving risk determinations.
1138   To determine the appropriate level of assurance of the user’s asserted identity,
1139   organizations SHALL assess the potential risks and identify measures to minimize
1140   their impact. Organizations SHALL assess the risk of identity proofing, authentication,
1141   and federation failures separately to determine the required assurance level for each
1142   transaction. This process SHALL include consideration of potentially varying impacts
1143   of harms to different entities impacted by the digital identity system, as described in
1144   Sec. 5.1.1. Business processes, policies, and technologies may help reduce risk. Entities
1145    SHOULD consider the impact of specific modes of failures related to identity proofing,
1146   authentication, and federation this includes, but may not be limited to:
1147   Identity Proofing:
1148       • The impact of providing a service to the wrong subject (e.g., an attacker
1149         successfully proofs as someone else).
1150       • The impact of not providing service to an eligible subject due to barriers, including
1151         biases, faced by the subject throughout the process of identity proofing.
1152       • The impact of excessive information collection and retention to support identity
1153         proofing processes.
1154   Authentication:
1155       • The impact of authenticating the wrong subject (e.g., an attacker who compromises
1156         or steals an authenticator).
1157       • The impact of failing to authenticate the correct subject due to barriers, including
1158         biases, faced by the subject in presenting their authenticator.
1159   Federation:
1160       • The impact of the wrong subject successfully accessing an application, system, or
1161         data (e.g., compromising or replaying an assertion).
1162       • The impact of releasing subscriber attributes to the wrong application or system.
1163   Using a worksheet similar to Table 1 can assist organizations with compiling the
1164   information gathered in order to complete the analysis. This kind of analysis would be
1165   done for each type of potential failure for identity proofing, authentication, and federation
1166   to determine the overall risks to entities interacting with the digital identity system.
