ensuring security of transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel
within the United States are also covered under the information types associated with the
transportation mission. In some cases the border control information may be classified. Any
classified information is treated under separate rules established for national security
information. The recommended categorization for unclassified border and transportation
security information follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of border control
information on the ability of responsible agencies to enforce laws regulating the admission of
foreign-born persons (i.e., aliens) to the United States. Generally, the effects of unauthorized
disclosure of border control information are usually confined to a single geographic region,
immigration case, or deportation case. Even so, unauthorized disclosure may have a serious
adverse effect on mission functions, cause significant degradation in mission capability, or place
the agency at a significant disadvantage with respect to its border control responsibilities.
Particularly in the case of immigration, naturalization, and deportation activities, unauthorized
disclosure of information can violate privacy policies. Such unauthorized disclosures can have a
serious effect on public confidence in the agency.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where border control information is
also associated with other mission information types (e.g., criminal apprehension, and criminal
investigation and surveillance information), the confidentiality impact level associated with the
information may be high. Where unauthorized disclosure of border control information may put
the physical safety of personnel into serious jeopardy, the confidentiality impact level associated
with the information may be high. Unauthorized disclosure of confidentiality of information
associated with ensuring security of transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities,
vehicles, and personnel within the United States can result in facilitation of terrorist activities
that endanger human life. In some cases, the consequent threat to critical infrastructures, key
national assets, and human life can be catastrophic. Consequently, the confidentiality impact
level associated with information associated with ensuring security of transportation and
infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United States is normally
high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most border control information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Unauthorized
modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages,
electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but the
damage to the mission would usually be limited. The consequences of unauthorized
modification or destruction of information can be very serious if the information is critical to
tactical operations.
