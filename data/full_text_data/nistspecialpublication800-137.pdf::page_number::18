The output of a strategically designed and well-managed organization-wide ISCM program can
be used to maintain a systemâ€™s authorization to operate and keep required system information and
data (i.e., System Security Plan together with Risk Assessment Report, Security Assessment
Report, and POA&M) up to date on an ongoing basis. Security management and reporting tools
may provide functionality to automate updates to key evidence needed for ongoing authorization
decisions. ISCM also facilitates risk-based decision making regarding the ongoing authorization
to operate information systems and security authorization for common controls by providing
evolving threat activity or vulnerability information on demand. A security control assessment
and risk determination process, otherwise static between authorizations, is thus transformed into a
dynamic process that supports timely risk response actions and cost-effective, ongoing
authorizations. Continuous monitoring of threats, vulnerabilities, and security control
effectiveness provides situational awareness for risk-based support of ongoing authorization
decisions. An appropriately designed ISCM strategy and program supports ongoing authorization
of type authorizations, as well as single, joint, and leveraged authorizations. 21

ISCM in support of ongoing assessment and authorization has the potential to be resource-
intensive and time-consuming. It is impractical to collect security-related information and assess
every aspect of every security control deployed across an organization at all times. A more
practical approach is to establish reasonable assessment frequencies for collecting security-related
information. The frequency of assessments should be sufficient to assure adequate security
commensurate with risk, as determined by system categorization and ISCM strategy
