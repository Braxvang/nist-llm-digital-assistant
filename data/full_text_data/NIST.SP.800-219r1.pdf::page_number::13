        Project Description
The mSCP is an open-source project that provides a programmatic approach to generating and
using macOS security configuration baselines. The project’s content can be used to create
customized security baselines of technical security controls by leveraging a library of rules, with
each rule mapped to requirements in one or more existing security standards, regulations, or
frameworks. This approach provides versioning and consistency of the content. Unifying and
standardizing macOS baseline efforts via the mSCP means that updating security guidance is
simplified and radically accelerated, even as new versions of macOS are introduced annually.
The mSCP started in August 2019 as a collaboration among operational IT security staff from
NIST, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Defense Information
Systems Agency (DISA), and the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Los Alamos National
Laboratory (LANL). 1 The mSCP sought to map macOS settings to NIST SP 800-53, Revision 4
[3] with an extensible, modern approach to security guidance that could be used by any
organization (e.g., government, enterprise, education) that needs to adhere to security compliance
frameworks and policy.
As of this writing, the configuration settings represent guidance and best practices from NIST SP
800-53, Revision 5 [4]; NIST SP 800-171, Revision 2 [5]; the macOS DISA Security Technical
Implementation Guide (STIG) [6]; the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS)
Instruction (CNSSI) Number 1253 [7]; the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Critical Security
Controls Version 8 [8]; and internal organizational security guidance from NIST, NASA, and
LANL.

             Project Goals
Apple releases a new macOS version every year, and generally, agencies and organizations must
wait for guidance or accept risk before deploying the new macOS version. Most agencies or
organizations must create their own internal security configuration, which delays the deployment
of the new macOS version or new hardware that only supports the new macOS version. The
mSCP assists organizations in upgrading sooner. Generally, the technical security settings in
macOS do not drastically change from release to release, with only a handful of new settings
being introduced. By pursuing a rules-based approach, mSCP rules that remain applicable can be
reused and incorporated into guidance for the latest macOS version. This enables quicker
adoption of new security features that are not offered in prior versions of macOS.
The goals of the mSCP are to:
        •    Develop recommended security baselines using a risk-based approach
        •    Normalize and accelerate annual adoption of the new operating system and hardware by
             providing guidance to meet the security needs of new operating systems at the earliest
             availability
        •    Reduce worldwide efforts in creating annual guidance by unifying and consolidating
             compliance efforts into a single project
