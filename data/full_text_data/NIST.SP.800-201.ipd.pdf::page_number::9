      NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                  Cloud Computing Forensic
      February 2023                                                                  Reference Architecture



194   Executive Summary
195   The rapid adoption of cloud computing technology has led to the need to apply digital forensics
196   to this domain. New methodologies are required for the identification, acquisition, preservation,
197   examination, and interpretation of digital evidence in multi-tenant cloud environments that offer
198   rapid provisioning, global elasticity, and broad network accessibility. This is necessary to
199   provide capabilities for incident response, secure internal enterprise operations, and support for
200   the U.S. criminal justice and civil litigation systems.
201   This document presents the NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Reference Architecture (CC FRA,
202   also referred to as FRA for the sake of brevity), whose goal is to provide support for a cloud
203   system’s forensic readiness. The CC FRA is meant to help users understand the cloud forensic
204   challenges that might exist for an organization’s cloud system. It identifies forensic challenges
205   that require mitigation strategies and how a forensic investigator would apply that to a particular
206   forensic investigation.
207   The CC FRA provides a useful starting point for all cloud forensic stakeholders to analyze the
208   impacts of cloud forensic challenges previously reported by NIST. It does so by considering each
209   cloud forensic challenge in the context of each functional capability presented in the Cloud
210   Security Alliance’s Enterprise Architecture.
211   While the CC FRA can be used by any cloud computing practitioner, it is specifically designed
212   to allow cloud system architects, cloud engineers, forensic practitioners, and cloud consumers to
213   ask specific questions related to their cloud computing architectures. The CC FRA is both a
214   methodology and an initial implementation, and users are encouraged to customize this initial
215   implementation for their specific situations and needs.
