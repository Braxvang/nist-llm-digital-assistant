  2.3.1   PIV Middleware Test Configuration
The middleware test configuration is used to test a vendor’s middleware software application
that implements the PIV client API and generates the appropriate commands in the PIV card
command interface (refer to Table A-1 for mapping between the client API and card
command interface). The middleware test configuration is depicted in Figure 3.
