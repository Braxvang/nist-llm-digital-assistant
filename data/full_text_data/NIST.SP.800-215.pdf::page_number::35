   4. Secure remote access functionalities provided by technologies such as VPN are combined
      into SD-WAN [45].

       Requirements for an Integrated Security Services Architecture for SD-WAN
An integrated security services architecture for SD-WAN has both networking and security
functions integrated within it. The network access and security function capabilities are offered
as a cloud service that enterprises can access through strategic network locations spread over a
wide area called point of presence (PoP). In 2019, Gartner coined the term “secure access service
edge” (SASE) to denote an architecture that converges networking and security functions and
delivers them at a global scale as a cloud service [46]. The networking and security services
delivered by an SASE are not new but simply delivered together as a single package rather than
through point security solutions (Section 3). The various points of connectivity from the
enterprise to SASE PoPs are called enterprise edges. The enterprise edges can be either:
   •   Clients – Users accessing through desktops, laptops, and mobile devices from either
       branch offices or remote locations, such as their homes or IoTs
   •   IT resources – Internal applications hosted in data centers, branch offices, or the cloud
       (e.g., SaaS, IaaS)
The SASE network infrastructure thus becomes an integral part of the enterprise network
whenever one or more of the enterprise edges are connected to various PoPs of SASE cloud
services.
The four primary functions delivered by SASE are [46]:
   1. Optimization of network traffic for different types of traffic – Reduce latency and
      improve availability
   2. Access control for different types of IT resources – Applications or databases under
      different administrative domains (e.g., subscribed SaaS, open web)
   3. Threat prevention – Monitoring, gathering threat and attack information, and performing
      remedial action
   4. Enables the application of uniform security policy across all users, regardless of location;
      centralizes visibility across virtually all users and devices into a single dashboard; scales
      security as the organization expands; and reduces the number of physical security
      appliances that they manage [12]
Some of the structural features of SASE offerings are:
   •   Globally distributed point of presence (PoP) – A global SD-WAN service with its own
       private backbone network consisting of worldwide points of presence (PoPs) intended to
       minimize latency problems. In some instances, major cloud vendors’ PoPs may also be
       leveraged.
   •   Security agent on devices – The security agent on the end user’s device undertakes
       networking decisions and directs traffic from different applications. Specific capabilities
       include dynamically allowing or denying connections to services and applications based
       on an organization’s defined business rules.
