A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



Entropy                      A measure of the disorder or randomness in a closed system. The entropy
                             of uncertainty of a random variable X with probabilities pi, …, pn is
                                                             n
                             defined to be H(X) = − ∑ pi log pi .
                                                         i =1
Entropy Source               A physical source of information whose output either appears to be
                             random in itself or by applying some filtering/distillation process. This
                             output is used as input to either a RNG or PRNG.
Erfc                         The complementary error function erfc(z) is defined in Section 5.5.3. This
                             function is related to the normal cdf.
Geometric Random             A random variable that takes the value k, a non-negative integer with
Variable                     probability pk(1-p). The random variable x is the number of successes
                             before a failure in an infinite series of Bernoulli trials.
Global Structure/Global      A structure/value that is available by all routines in the test code.
Value
igamc                        The incomplete gamma function Q(a,x) is defined in Section 5.5.3.
Incomplete Gamma             See the definition for igamc.
Function
Hypothesis (Alternative)     A statement Ha that an analyst will consider as true (e.g., Ha: the sequence
                             is non-random) if and when the null hypothesis is determined to be false.
Hypothesis (Null)            A statement H0 about the assumed default condition/property of the
                             observed sequence. For the purposes of this document, the null hypothesis
                             H0 is that the sequence is random. If H0 is in fact true, then the reference
                             distribution and critical values of the test statistic may be derived.
Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test      A statistical test that may be used to determine if a set of data comes from
                             a particular probability distribution.
Level of Significance (α)    The probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis, i.e., the probability
                             of concluding that the null hypothesis is false when the hypothesis is, in
                             fact, true. The tester usually chooses this value; typical values are 0.05,
                             0.01 or 0.001; occasionally, smaller values such as 0.0001 are used. The
                             level of significance is the probability of concluding that a sequence is
                             non-random when it is in fact random. Synonyms: Type I error, α error.
Linear Dependence            In the context of the binary rank matrix test, linear dependence refers to m-
                             bit vectors that may be expressed as a linear combination of the linearly
                             independent m-bit vectors.
Maple                        An interactive computer algebra system that provides a complete
                             mathematical environment for the manipulation and simplification of
                             symbolic algebraic expressions, arbitrary extended precision mathematics,
                             two- and three-dimensional graphics, and programming.
MATLAB                       An integrated, technical computer environment that combines numeric
                             computation, advanced graphics and visualization, and a high level
                             programming language. MATLAB includes functions for data analysis and
                             visualization; numeric and symbolic computation; engineering and
                             scientific graphics; modeling, simulation and prototyping; and
                             programming, application development and a GUI design.
Normal (Gaussian)            A continuous distribution whose density function is given by
Distribution                                                  1  x−µ 
