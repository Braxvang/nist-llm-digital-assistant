2.4 TIER TWO—MISSION/BUSINESS PROCESS VIEW
Tier 2 addresses risk from a mission/business process perspective by designing, developing, and
implementing mission/business processes that support the missions/business functions defined at
Tier 1. Organizational mission/business processes guide and inform the development of an
enterprise architecture that provides a disciplined and structured methodology for managing the
complexity of the organization’s information technology infrastructure. A key component of the
enterprise architecture is the embedded information security architecture that provides a roadmap
to ensure that mission/business process-driven information security requirements and protection
needs are defined and allocated to appropriate organizational information systems and the
environments in which those systems operate.

2.4.1 Risk-Aware Mission/Business Processes
The risk management activities at Tier 2 begin with the identification and establishment of risk-
aware mission/business processes to support the organizational missions and business functions.
A risk-aware mission/business process is one that explicitly takes into account the likely risk such
a process would cause if implemented. Risk aware processes are designed to manage risk in
accordance with the risk management strategy defined at Tier 1 and explicitly account for risk
when evaluating the mission/business activities and decisions at Tier 2.34 Implementing risk-
aware mission/business processes requires a thorough understanding of the organizational
missions and business functions and the relationships among missions/business functions and
supporting processes. This understanding is a prerequisite to building mission/business processes
sufficiently resilient to withstand a wide variety of threats including routine and sophisticated
cyber attacks, errors/accidents, and natural disasters. An important part of achieving risk-aware
processes is the understanding of senior leaders/executives of: (i) the types of threat sources and
threat events that can adversely affect the ability of organizations to successfully execute their
missions/business functions); (ii) the potential adverse impacts/consequences on organizational
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation if the confidentiality,
integrity, or availability of information or information systems used in a mission/business process
is compromised; and (iii) the likely resilience to such a compromise that can be achieved with a
given mission/business process definition, applying realistic expectations for the resilience of
information technology.

A key output from the Tier 2 definition of mission/business processes is the selected risk response
strategy35 for these processes within the constraints defined in the risk management strategy. The
risk response strategy includes identification of information protection needs and the allocation of
those needs across components of the process (e.g., allocation to protections within information
systems, protections in the operational environments of those systems, and allocation to alternate
mission/business execution paths based on the potential for compromise).

2.4.2 Enterprise Architecture
A significant risk-related issue regarding the ability of organizations to successfully carry out
missions and business functions is the complexity of the information technology being used in
information systems. To address this complexity and associated potential risk, organizations need
a disciplined and structured approach for managing information technology assets supporting

34
   The identification of organizational mission/business processes includes defining the types of information that the
organization needs to successfully execute those processes, the criticality and/or sensitivity of the information, and the
information flows both internal and external to the organization.

     Risk response strategies are described in Appendix H.
