       ➑ OT Discussion: The organization ensures that access enforcement mechanisms do not
       adversely impact the operational performance of the OT. Example compensating controls
       include encapsulation. The policy for logical access control to non-addressable and non-
       routable system resources and the associated information is made explicit. Access control
       mechanisms include hardware, firmware, and software that control the device or have
       device access, such as device drivers and communications controllers. Physical access
       control may serve as a compensating control for logical access control. However, it may
       not provide sufficient granularity when users require access to different functions.
       ➒ Control Enhancement: (11) OT Discussion: The organization identifies and restricts
       access to information that could impact the OT environment and accounts for
       information types that are sensitive, proprietary, contain trade secrets, or support safety
       functions.
       ➓ Rationale for adding AC-3 (11) to HIGH baseline: The loss of availability, integrity,
       and confidentiality of certain types of information that reside on a high-impact OT
       system may result in severe or catastrophic adverse effects on operations, assets, or
       individuals, including severe degradation or loss of mission capability, major damage to
       organizational assets, or harm to individuals involving the loss of life or life-threatening
       injuries.

F.7.1. ACCESS CONTROL – AC
Tailoring Considerations for the Access Control Family
Before implementing controls in the AC family, consider the trade-offs among security, privacy,
latency, performance, throughput, and reliability. For example, the organization considers
whether latency induced from the use of confidentiality and integrity mechanisms that employ
cryptographic mechanisms would adversely impact the operational performance of the OT.
When the OT cannot support the specific access control requirements of a control, the
organization employs compensating controls in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.
Examples of compensating controls are given with each control as appropriate.
