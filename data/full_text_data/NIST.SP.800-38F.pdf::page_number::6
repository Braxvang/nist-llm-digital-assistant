                                          Abstract
This publication describes cryptographic methods that are approved for “key wrapping,” i.e., the
protection of the confidentiality and integrity of cryptographic keys. In addition to describing
existing methods, this publication specifies two new, deterministic authenticated-encryption
modes of operation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm: the AES Key Wrap
(KW) mode and the AES Key Wrap With Padding (KWP) mode. An analogous mode with the
Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA) as the underlying block cipher, called TKW, is also
specified, to support legacy applications.


KEY WORDS: authenticated encryption; authentication; block cipher; computer security;
confidentiality; cryptography; encryption; information security; key wrapping; mode of
operation.
