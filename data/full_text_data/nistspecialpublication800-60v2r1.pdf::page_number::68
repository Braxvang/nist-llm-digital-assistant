central government management operations; most service delivery (mission-based) management
activities would not be included here. Unlike the other service support functions, some general
government information types are associated with specific organizations (e.g., Department of the
Treasury, Executive Office of the President, Internal Revenue Service).
C.2.8.1 Central Fiscal Operations Information Type

Central Fiscal Operations includes the fiscal operations that the Department of Treasury
performs on behalf of the Government. 14 [Note: Tax-related functions are associated with the
Taxation Management information type.] Impacts to some information and information systems
associated with central fiscal operations may affect the security of the critical banking and
finance infrastructure. In most cases, the effect on public welfare of a loss of central fiscal
operations functionality can be expected to be delayed rather than immediate. The potential for
consequent loss of human life or of major national assets is low. . The provisional security
categorization recommended for the central fiscal operations information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of central fiscal
operations information on the fiscal operations that the Department of Treasury performs on
behalf of the Government. The effects of loss of confidentiality can reasonably be expected to
jeopardize relationships and administrative actions necessary to mission fulfillment and/or to
seriously damage public confidence in the agency. For example, the unauthorized disclosure of
investigative and enforcement information can have serious economic impact on both individual
companies and the broader market place (e.g., short-term stock market perturbations). The
consequences of such unauthorized disclosures may have a serious adverse effect on public
confidence in the agency.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where the operations in question
involve liaison with law enforcement or homeland security organizations, the consequences of
unauthorized disclosure can imperil operations critical to the security of human life, critical
infrastructure protection, ore the protection of key national assets. For those operations, the
consequences to key financial infrastructure elements can be serious to severe. In such cases, the
associated confidentiality impact level will be high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The confidentiality impact level recommended for
most central fiscal operations information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications that
include central fiscal operations information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely
affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would
usually be limited.

14
     Central fiscal operations focus on central Federal government functions rather than on central agency functions.
