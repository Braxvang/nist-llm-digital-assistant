Table 6-2 lists the TCP and UDP port numbers and IP protocols associated with SSL VPNs and the
alternative VPN protocols described in Section 6. This information may be helpful in configuring other
network security devices, such as firewalls and routers, to permit VPN activity to pass through.

                       Table 6-2. IP Protocols and TCP/UDP Port Numbers for VPN Protocols
