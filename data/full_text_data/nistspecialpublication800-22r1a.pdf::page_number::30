A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



2.4.2 Function Call
LongestRunOfOnes(n), where:

        n        The length of the bit string.

Additional input for the function supplied by the testing code:

The sequence of bits as generated by the RNG or PRNG being tested; this exists as a global structure at
the time of the function call; ε = ε1, ε2, … , εn.

        M        The length of each block. The test code has been pre-set to accommodate three values for
                 M: M = 8, M = 128 and M = 104 in accordance with the following values of sequence
                 length, n:

                                               Minimum n         M
                                                  128            8
                                                  6272          128
                                                750,000         104

        N        The number of blocks; selected in accordance with the value of M.

2.4.3   Test Statistic and Reference Distribution
        χ2(obs):       A measure of how well the observed longest run length within M-bit blocks
                       matches the expected longest length within M-bit blocks.

The reference distribution for the test statistic is a χ2 distribution.

2.4.4   Test Description
(1)     Divide the sequence into M-bit blocks.

(2)     Tabulate the frequencies νi of the longest runs of ones in each block into categories, where each
        cell contains the number of runs of ones of a given length.

        For the values of M supported by the test code, the vi cells will hold the following counts:

                              vi     M=8            M = 128               M = 104

                              v5                      ≥9                    15
