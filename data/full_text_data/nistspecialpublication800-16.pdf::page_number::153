Information Technology Security Training Requirements




       INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING MATRIX                            — Cell 3.5C
 Training Area: System Life Cycle Security             — Operations
 Functional Specialty: Design & Develop

 Definition   —        The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an IT system
                       from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                       model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                       Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                       ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                       needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                       The operations phase includes the ongoing day-to-day use (production) and
                       maintenance or enhancement of the system without compromising the
                       integrity and effectiveness of the installed safeguards.


 Behiavioral Outcome       —   Individuals responsible for system development are able to make
                               procedural and operational changes necessary to maintain the
                               acceptable level of risk.
