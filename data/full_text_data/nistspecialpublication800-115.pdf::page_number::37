The discovery phase of penetration testing includes two parts. The first part is the start of actual testing,
and covers information gathering and scanning. Network port and service identification, described in
Section 4.2, is conducted to identify potential targets. In addition to port and service identification, other
techniques are used to gather information on the targeted network:

      Host name and IP address information can be gathered through many methods, including DNS
       interrogation, InterNIC (WHOIS) queries, and network sniffing (generally only during internal
       tests)
      Employee names and contact information can be obtained by searching the organization’s Web
       servers or directory servers
      System information, such as names and shares can be found through methods such as
       NetBIOS enumeration (generally only during internal tests) and Network Information System
       (NIS) (generally only during internal tests)
      Application and service information, such as version numbers, can be recorded through banner
       grabbing.
In some cases, techniques such as dumpster diving and physical walkthroughs of facilities may be used to
collect additional information on the targeted network, and may also uncover additional information to be
used during the penetration tests, such as passwords written on paper.

The second part of the discovery phase is vulnerability analysis, which involves comparing the services,
applications, and operating systems of scanned hosts against vulnerability databases (a process that is
automatic for vulnerability scanners) and the testers’ own knowledge of vulnerabilities. Human testers
can use their own databases—or public databases such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) —
to identify vulnerabilities manually. Appendix E has more information on these publicly available
vulnerability databases. Manual processes can identify new or obscure vulnerabilities that automated
scanners may miss, but are much slower than an automated scanner.

Executing an attack is at the heart of any penetration test. Figure 5-2 represents the individual steps of the
attack phase—the process of verifying previously identified potential vulnerabilities by attempting to
exploit them. If an attack is successful, the vulnerability is verified and safeguards are identified to
mitigate the associated security exposure. In many cases, exploits 19 that are executed do not grant the

     Exploit programs or scripts are specialized tools for exploiting specific vulnerabilities. The same cautions that apply to
     freeware tools apply to exploit programs and scripts. Some vulnerability databases, including Bugtraq (available at
     http://www.securityfocus.com/) provide exploit instructions or code for many identified vulnerabilities.
