3.6     Funding the Security Awareness and Training Program

Once an awareness and training strategy has been agreed upon and priorities established, funding
requirements must be added to the plan. A determination must be made regarding the extent of funding
support to be allocated based on the implementation models discussed in Section 3.1. The agency CIO
must send a clear message regarding expectations for compliance in this area. Approaches used to
determine funding sources must be addressed by agencies based on existing or anticipated budget and
other agency priorities. The security awareness and training plan must be viewed as a set of minimum
requirements to be met, and those requirements must be supportable from a budget or contractual
perspective. Contractual training requirements should be specified in binding documentation (e.g.,
memos of understanding (MOUs), contracts). Approaches used to express the funding requirement may
include:

     Percent of overall training budget;
     Allocation per user by role (e.g., training for key security personnel and system administrators will be
      more costly than general security training for those in the organization not performing security-
      specific functions);
     Percent of overall IT budget; or
     Explicit dollar allocations by component based on overall implementation costs.
Problems in implementation of the security awareness and training plan may occur when security
awareness and training initiatives are deemed to be lower in priority than other agency initiatives. It is the
responsibility of the CIO to assess competing priorities and develop a strategy to address any shortfall in
funding that may impact the agency’s ability to comply with existing security training requirements. This
may mean adjusting the awareness and training strategy to be more in line with available budget,
lobbying for additional funding, or directing a reallocation of current resources. It may also mean that the
implementation plan may be phased in over some predefined time period as funding becomes available.
