 Section 3 describes the most commonly used categories of storage encryption technologies for end
  user devices, and explains the types of protection they provide.

 Section 4 discusses the process of planning and implementing storage encryption technologies for end
  user devices. It includes a detailed discussion of the importance of cryptography and authentication
  to a storage encryption solution.

The document also contains several appendices with supporting material.

 Appendix A describes alternatives to encrypting storage on end user devices.

 Appendices B and C contain a glossary and acronym list, respectively.

 Appendix D lists online tools and resources that may be useful references for gaining a better
  understanding of storage encryption for end user devices.
