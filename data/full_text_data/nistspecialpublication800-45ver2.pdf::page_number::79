In addition, it is critical that network-based IDPSs and their underlying operating systems are hardened,
as network-based IDPSs are often a target of attackers. In particular, the network-based IDPSs should not
respond to any type of system interrogation through their monitoring interfaces. If remote management is
desired, it should be conducted through an out-of-band means (e.g., separate isolated network). Although
typically difficult to administer and interpret, IDPSs are a critical early warning system that can provide
the mail server administrator with the necessary information to defend the mail server from attack.

7.2.3    Network Switches

Network switches are devices that provide connectivity between two or more hosts located on the same
network segments. They are similar to hubs in that they allow communications between hosts, but unlike
hubs the switches have more “intelligence” and send communications to only those hosts to which the
communications are addressed. The benefit of this from a security standpoint is that when switches are
employed on a network, it is much more difficult to eavesdrop on communications between other hosts on
the network segment. This is extremely important when a mail server is on a network segment that is
used by other hosts. For example, if a hub is used and a host on the DMZ is compromised, an attacker
may be able to eavesdrop on the communications of other hosts on the DMZ, possibly leading to the
compromise of those hosts or the information they communicate across the network. A primary example
of this is public Web servers, which are often on the same subnet as mail servers and, if compromised,
would be able to sniff unencrypted email traffic and passwords within the DMZ.

Many switches include specific security settings that further enhance the security of the network by
making it difficult for a malicious entity to “defeat” the switch. Some examples include the ability to
minimize the risk of Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing and ARP poisoning attacks. 46 If a
switch has these security capabilities, they should be enabled (see appropriate manufacturer
documentation).

Switches can have a negative impact on network-based IDPSs (see Section 7.2.2). Most network
switches allow network administrators to configure a specific port on the switch, known as a span port, so
that it replicates all the switch’s traffic to the port used by the IDPS. This allows a network-based IDPS
to see all traffic on a particular network segment. However, under high loads, the switch might have to
stop sending traffic to the span port, causing the IDPS to be unable to monitor network activity. Also,
other devices also use span ports, and there are typically very few span ports on a switch, so it might not
be possible to connect an IDPS to a particular switch because its span ports are all being used.

     ARP poisoning occurs when an attacker successfully updates the ARP cache on a target host with a forged ARP entry. This
     is generally used to redirect network traffic for malicious purposes.
