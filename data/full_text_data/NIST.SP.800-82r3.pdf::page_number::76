4.3.2. Categorize
In the Categorize step, the potential adverse impacts of the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of the information and system are determined. For each information type and system
under consideration, the three security objectives – confidentiality, integrity, and availability –
are associated with one of three levels of potential impacts of a security breach. Of the three
security objectives, availability is generally the greatest concern for an OT. The standards and
guidance for this categorization process can be found in FIPS 199 [FIPS199] and NIST SP 800-
60 [SP800-60v1r1][SP800-60v2r1], respectively.
The following OT example is taken from FIPS 199:
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            A power plant contains a SCADA system controlling the distribution of
            electric power for a large military installation. The SCADA system
            contains both real-time sensor data and routine administrative
            information. The management at the power plant determines that: (i) for
            the sensor data being acquired by the SCADA system, there is no
            potential impact from a loss of confidentiality, a high potential impact
            from a loss of integrity, and a high potential impact from a loss of
            availability; and (ii) for the administrative information being processed
            by the system, there is a low potential impact from a loss of
            confidentiality, a low potential impact from a loss of integrity, and a low
            potential impact from a loss of availability. The resulting security
            categories, SC, of these information types are expressed as:
                   SC sensor data = {(confidentiality, NA), (integrity, HIGH),
                                   (availability, HIGH)}, and
              SC administrative information = {(confidentiality, LOW), (integrity,
                                 LOW), (availability, LOW)}.
            The resulting security category of the system is initially expressed as:
               SC SCADA system = {(confidentiality, LOW), (integrity, HIGH),
                                 (availability, HIGH)}
            representing the high-water mark or maximum potential impact values
            for each security objective from the information types resident on the
            SCADA system. The management at the power plant chooses to increase
            the potential impact from a loss of confidentiality from low to moderate,
            reflecting a more realistic view of the potential impact on the system
            should there be a security breach due to the unauthorized disclosure of
            system-level information or processing functions. The final security
            category of the system is expressed as:
               SC SCADA system = {(confidentiality, MODERATE), (integrity,
                             HIGH), (availability, HIGH)}
