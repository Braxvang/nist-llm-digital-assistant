transfer (i.e., the focus must be on mission/business success, not assigning blame). In addition,
risk sharing and risk transfer activities must be carried out in accordance with intra- and inter-
organizational dynamics and realities (e.g., organizational culture, governance, risk tolerance).
This explains why risk sharing/transfer strategies are particularly important for the sharing and/or
transfer to be a viable risk response option.

H.5 RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES
Organizational risk mitigation strategies reflect an organizational perspective on what mitigations
are to be employed and where the mitigations are to be applied, to reduce information security
risks to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.
Risk mitigation strategies are the primary link between organizational risk management programs
and information security programs—with the former covering all aspects of managing risk and
the latter being primarily a part of the risk response component of the risk management process.
Effective risk mitigation strategies consider the general placement and allocation of mitigations,
the degree of intended mitigation, and cover mitigations at Tier 1 (e.g., common controls), at Tier
2 (e.g., enterprise architecture including embedded information security architecture, and risk-
aware mission/business processes), and at Tier 3 (security controls in individual information
systems). Organizational risk mitigation strategies reflect the following:
•    Mission/business processes are designed with regard to information protection needs and
     information security requirements;80
•    Enterprise architectures (including embedded information security architectures) are designed
     with consideration for realistically achievable risk mitigations;
•    Risk mitigation measures are implemented within organizational information systems and
     environments of operation by safeguards/countermeasure (i.e., security controls) consistent
     with information security architectures; and
•    Information security programs, processes, and safeguards/countermeasures are highly flexible
     and agile with regard to implementation, recognizing the diversity in organizational missions
     and business functions and the dynamic environments in which the organizations operate.81

Organizations develop risk mitigation strategies based on strategic goals and objectives, mission
and business requirements, and organizational priorities. The strategies provide the basis for
making risk-based decisions on the information security solutions associated with and applied to
information systems within the organization. Risk mitigation strategies are necessary to ensure
that organizations are adequately protected against the growing threats to information processed,
stored, and transmitted by organizational information systems. The nature of the threats and the
dynamic environments in which organizations operate, demand flexible and scalable defenses as
well as solutions that can be tailored to meet rapidly changing conditions. These conditions
include, for example, the emergence of new threats and vulnerabilities, the development of new
technologies, changes in missions/business requirements, and/or changes to environments of
operation. Effective risk mitigation strategies support the goals and objectives of organizations
and established mission/business priorities, are tightly coupled to enterprise architectures and
information security architectures, and can operate throughout the system development life cycle.

80
   In addition to mission/business-driven information protection needs, information security requirements are obtained
from a variety of sources (e.g., federal legislation, policies, directives, regulations, and standards).
81
   Dynamic environments of operation are characterized, for example, by ongoing changes in people, processes,
technologies, physical infrastructure, and threats.
