Abstract
The macOS Security Compliance Project (mSCP) provides resources that system administrators,
security professionals, security policy authors, information security officers, and auditors can
leverage to secure and assess macOS desktop and laptop system security in an automated way.
This publication introduces the mSCP and gives an overview of the resources available from the
project’s GitHub site, which is continuously curated and updated to support each new release of
macOS. The GitHub site provides practical, actionable recommendations in the form of secure
baselines and associated rules. This publication also describes use cases for leveraging the mSCP
content. Updates from the previous version of this publication mainly involve the new mSCP
capability to create a custom benchmark by tailoring a baseline.

Reports on Computer Systems Technology
The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
with industry, government, and academic organizations.
