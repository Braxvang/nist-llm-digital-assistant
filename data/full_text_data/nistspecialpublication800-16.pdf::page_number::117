       INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING MATRIX                              ~ Cell 3.2A
 Training Area: System Life Cycle Security              — Development
 Functional Specialty: l\/lanage

 Definition    —        The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an IT system
                        from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                        model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                        Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                        ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                        needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                        The development phase is the series of steps followed to ensure that
                        security requirements are considered, resolved, and incorporated as
                        information systems and technologies are developed or changed.

 Behavioral Outcome         —   Individuals with management responsibilities cire able to ensure that
                                the formal developmental baseline includes approved security
                                requirements and that security-related features are installed, clearly
                                identified, and documented.


 Knowledge Levels         —

 2.Intermediate —        Review, Decide
                        Identify,
 3.Advanced — Evaluate, Analyze, Approve

 Sample Learning Objectives —

 At the conclusion of this module, individuals will be able to:

 1.     Beginning   — Understand     the relationship between planned security safeguards and the
        features being installed on the system under development. Provide input on security
        concerns during system development efforts.

 2.     Intermediate   — Review     the selected security safeguards to determine if security concerns
        identified in the approved plan have been fully addressed.

 3.     Advanced    — Evaluate and approve development       efforts to ensure that baseline security
        safeguards are appropriately installed for the system being developed or modified.
