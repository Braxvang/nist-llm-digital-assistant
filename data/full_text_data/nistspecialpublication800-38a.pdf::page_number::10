4.1   Definitions and Abbreviations

Bit                    A binary digit: 0 or 1.

Bit Error              The substitution of a ‘0’ bit for a ‘1’ bit, or vice versa.

Bit String             An ordered sequence of 0’s and 1’s.

Block Cipher           A family of functions and their inverse functions that is parameterized
                       by cryptographic keys; the functions map bit strings of a fixed length to
                       bit strings of the same length.

Block Size             The number of bits in an input (or output) block of the block cipher.

CBC                    Cipher Block Chaining.

CFB                    Cipher Feedback.

Ciphertext             Encrypted data.

Confidentiality Mode   A mode that is used to encipher plaintext and decipher ciphertext. The
                       confidentiality modes in this recommendation are the ECB, CBC, CFB,
                       OFB, and CTR modes.

CTR                    Counter.

Cryptographic Key      A parameter used in the block cipher algorithm that determines the
                       forward cipher operation and the inverse cipher operation.

Data Block (Block)     A sequence of bits whose length is the block size of the block cipher.

Data Segment           In the CFB mode, a sequence of bits whose length is a parameter that
(Segment)              does not exceed the block size.

Decryption             The process of a confidentiality mode that transforms encrypted data
(Deciphering)          into the original usable data.

ECB                    Electronic Codebook.

Encryption             The process of a confidentiality mode that transforms usable data into
(Enciphering)          an unreadable form.
