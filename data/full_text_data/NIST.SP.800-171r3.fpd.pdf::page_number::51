       NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                      Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
       November 2023

1309           DISCUSSION
1310           System media includes digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes diskettes, flash
1311           drives, magnetic tapes, external or removable solid state or magnetic drives, compact discs, and
1312           digital versatile discs. Non-digital media includes paper and microfilm. Physically controlling
1313           stored media includes conducting inventories, establishing procedures to allow individuals to
1314           check out and return media to libraries, and maintaining accountability for stored media. Secure
1315           storage includes a locked drawer, desk, or cabinet or a controlled media library. Controlled areas
1316           provide physical and procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting
1317           information and systems. Sanitization techniques (e.g., cryptographically erasing, destroying,
1318           clearing, and purging) prevent the disclosure of CUI to unauthorized individuals. The sanitization
1319           process removes CUI from media such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed.

1323   3.8.2. Media Access
1324           REQUIREMENT: 03.08.02
1325           Restrict access to CUI on system media.

1326           DISCUSSION
1327           System media includes digital and non-digital media. Access to CUI on system media can be
1328           restricted by physically controlling such media, which includes conducting inventories, ensuring
1329           that procedures are in place to allow individuals to check out and return media to the media
1330           library, and maintaining accountability for stored media.

1334   3.8.3. Media Sanitization
1335           REQUIREMENT: 03.08.03
1336           Sanitize system media containing CUI prior to disposal, release out of organizational control, or
1337           release for reuse.

1338           DISCUSSION
1339           Media sanitization applies to digital and non-digital media subject to disposal or reuse, whether or
1340           not the media is considered removable. Examples include digital media in scanners, copiers,
1341           printers, notebook computers, workstations, mobile devices, network components, and non-digital
1342           media. The sanitization process removes CUI from media such that the information cannot be
1343           retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques (e.g., cryptographically erasing, clearing,
1344           purging, and destroying) prevent the disclosure of CUI to unauthorized individuals when such
1345           media is reused or released for disposal. NARA policies control the sanitization process for media
1346           containing CUI and may require destruction when other methods cannot be applied to the media.
