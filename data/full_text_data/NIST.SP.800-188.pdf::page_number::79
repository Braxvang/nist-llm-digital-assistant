    • Users of the data may not realize that the data are synthetic. Simply providing doc-
      umentation that the data are fully synthetic may not be suffcient public notifcation
      since the dataset may be separated from the documentation. Instead, it is best to in-
      dicate in the data themselves that the values are synthetic. For example, names like
      “SYNTHETIC PERSON” or “FIRSTNAME1 LASTNAME1” may be placed in the
      data.
    • Releasing a synthetic dataset may not be regarded by the public as a legitimate act of
      transparency, or the public may question the validity of the synthetic dataset based
      on its perceived lack of relationship to the original dataset. These concerns can be
      addressed through public education and by documenting the accuracy of the synthetic
      dataset.
In addition, it can be extremely challenging to construct the high-fdelity models that enable
good synthetic datasets. The best known techniques for constructing these models are
designed around ensuring that specifc properties of the data (e.g., correlations between
certain data attributes) are preserved. Models constructed this way may not necessarily
refect other properties that were present in the original data.
It is often possible to construct very high-fdelity models when the desirable properties
of the synthetic data are known in advance (e.g., when it is known what questions future
analysts will want to answer using the synthetic data) or when using modern deep learn-
ing techniques. Constructing synthetic data that faithfully represent all properties of the
original data while enforcing strong privacy guarantees is impossible.

4.4.5.   Synthetic Data with Validation
Agencies that share or publish synthetic data can optionally provide a verifcation service
that takes queries or algorithms developed with synthetic data and applies them to actual
data. The results of these queries or algorithms can then be compared with the results of
running the same queries on the synthetic data, and the researchers can be warned if the
results are signifcantly different. Alternatively, results can be provided to the researchers
after the application of additional statistical disclosure limitation.

4.4.6.   Synthetic Data and Open Data Policy
Releases of synthetic data can be confusing to the lay public.
    • It may not be clear to data users that the synthetic data release is actually synthetic.
      Members of the public may assume that the synthetic data are simply an operational
      dataset that has had identifying columns suppressed.
    • Synthetic data may contain synthetic individuals who appear similar to actual indi-
      viduals in the population.
