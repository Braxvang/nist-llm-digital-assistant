Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1              Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________

CA-2      SECURITY ASSESSMENTS

          Control: The organization conducts an assessment of the security controls in the information
          system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least annually] to determine the extent to
          which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
          outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system.
          Supplemental Guidance: This control is intended to support the FISMA requirement that the
          management, operational, and technical controls in each information system contained in the
          inventory of major information systems be assessed with a frequency depending on risk, but no
          less than annually. The FISMA requirement for (at least) annual security control assessments
          should not be interpreted by organizations as adding additional assessment requirements to those
          requirements already in place in the security certification and accreditation process. To satisfy the
          annual FISMA assessment requirement, organizations can draw upon the security control
          assessment results from any of the following sources, including but not limited to: (i) security
          certifications conducted as part of an information system accreditation or reaccreditation process
          (see CA-4); (ii) continuous monitoring activities (see CA-7); or (iii) testing and evaluation of the
          information system as part of the ongoing system development life cycle process (provided that
          the testing and evaluation results are current and relevant to the determination of security control
          effectiveness). Existing security assessment results are reused to the extent that they are still valid
          and are supplemented with additional assessments as needed. Reuse of assessment information is
          critical in achieving a broad-based, cost-effective, and fully integrated security program capable of
          producing the needed evidence to determine the actual security status of the information system.
          OMB does not require an annual assessment of all security controls employed in an organizational
          information system. In accordance with OMB policy, organizations must annually assess a subset
          of the security controls based on: (i) the FIPS 199 security categorization of the information
          system; (ii) the specific security controls selected and employed by the organization to protect the
          information system; and (iii) the level of assurance (or confidence) that the organization must have
          in determining the effectiveness of the security controls in the information system. It is expected
          that the organization will assess all of the security controls in the information system during the
          three-year accreditation cycle. The organization can use the current yearâ€™s assessment results
          obtained during security certification to meet the annual FISMA assessment requirement (see CA-
          4). NIST Special Publication 800-53A provides guidance on security control assessments to
          include reuse of existing assessment results. Related security controls: CA-4, CA-6, CA-7, SA-
          11.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW CA-2                      MOD CA-2                  HIGH CA-2



CA-3      INFORMATION SYSTEM CONNECTIONS

          Control: The organization authorizes all connections from the information system to other
          information systems outside of the accreditation boundary through the use of system connection
          agreements and monitors/controls the system connections on an ongoing basis.
          Supplemental Guidance: Since FIPS 199 security categorizations apply to individual information
          systems, the organization carefully considers the risks that may be introduced when systems are
          connected to other information systems with different security requirements and security controls,
          both within the organization and external to the organization. Risk considerations also include
          information systems sharing the same networks. NIST Special Publication 800-47 provides
          guidance on connecting information systems. Related security controls: SC-7, SA-9.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW CA-3                      MOD CA-3                  HIGH CA-3
