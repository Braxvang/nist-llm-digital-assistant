EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

I
    n today’s environment where many, if not all, of an organization’s mission-critical functions
    are dependent upon information technology, the ability to manage this technology and to
    assure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information is now also mission-critical. In
designing the enterprise architecture and corresponding security architecture, an organization
seeks to securely meet the IT infrastructure needs of its governance structure, missions, and core
business processes. Information security is a dynamic process that must be effectively and
proactively managed for an organization to identify and respond to new vulnerabilities, evolving
threats, and an organization’s constantly changing enterprise architecture and operational
environment.

The Risk Management Framework (RMF) developed by NIST, 1 describes a disciplined and
structured process that integrates information security and risk management activities into the
system development life cycle. Ongoing monitoring is a critical part of that risk management
process. In addition, an organization’s overall security architecture and accompanying security
program are monitored to ensure that organization-wide operations remain within an acceptable
level of risk, despite any changes that occur. Timely, relevant, and accurate information is vital,
particularly when resources are limited and agencies must prioritize their efforts.

         Information security continuous monitoring (ISCM) is defined as maintaining
         ongoing awareness of information security, vulnerabilities, and threats to support
         organizational risk management decisions.

Any effort or process intended to support ongoing monitoring of information security across an
organization begins with leadership defining a comprehensive ISCM strategy encompassing
technology, processes, procedures, operating environments, and people. This strategy:

•   Is grounded in a clear understanding of organizational risk tolerance and helps officials set
    priorities and manage risk consistently throughout the organization;
•   Includes metrics that provide meaningful indications of security status at all organizational
    tiers;

•   Ensures continued effectiveness of all security controls;

•   Verifies compliance with information security requirements derived from organizational
    missions/business functions, federal legislation, directives, regulations, policies, and
    standards/guidelines;

•   Is informed by all organizational IT assets and helps to maintain visibility into the security of
    the assets;
•   Ensures knowledge and control of changes to organizational systems and environments of
    operation; and

•   Maintains awareness of threats and vulnerabilities.
