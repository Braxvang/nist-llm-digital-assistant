Special Publication 800-73-4      Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification – Part 1: PIV
                               Card Application Namespace, Data Model and Representation

2.        PIV Card Application Namespaces

2.1       Namespaces of the PIV Card Application

Names used on the PIV interfaces are drawn from three namespaces managed by NIST:

      +    Proprietary Identifier eXtension (PIX) of the NIST Registered Application Provider
           IDentifier (RID)
      +    ASN.1 object identifiers (OIDs) in the personal identity verification subset of the OIDs
           managed by NIST
      +    Basic Encoding Rules – Tag Length Value (BER-TLV) tags of the NIST PIV coexistent
           tag allocation scheme
All unspecified names in these managed namespaces are reserved for future use.

All interindustry tags defined in ISO/IEC 7816, Information Technology – Identification Cards –
Integrated Circuit(s) Card with Contacts [ISO7816], and used in the NIST coexistent tag
allocation scheme without redefinition have the same meaning as they have in [ISO7816].

All unspecified values in the following identifier and value namespaces are reserved for future
use:

      +    algorithm identifiers
      +    key reference values
      +    cryptographic mechanism identifiers

2.2       PIV Card Application AID

The Application IDentifier (AID) of the Personal Identity Verification Card Application (PIV
Card Application) shall be:

           'A0 00 00 03 08    00 00 10 00    01 00'

The AID of the PIV Card Application consists of the NIST RID ('A0 00 00 03 08') followed by
the application portion of the NIST PIX indicating the PIV Card Application ('00 00 10 00') and
then the version portion of the NIST PIX ('01 00') for the first version of the PIV Card
Application. All other PIX sequences on the NIST RID are reserved for future use.

The PIV Card Application can be selected as the current application by providing the full AID as
listed above or by providing the right-truncated version; that is, without the two-byte version, as
follows:

           'A0 00 00 03 08    00 00 10 00'
