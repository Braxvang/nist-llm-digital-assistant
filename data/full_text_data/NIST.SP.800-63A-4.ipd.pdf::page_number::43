       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                                 Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1153   5.5.2. Evidence and Core Attributes Collection Requirements
1154   5.5.2.1. Evidence Collection
1155   The CSP SHALL collect evidence from the applicant according to one of the following
1156   options:
1157      1. Two pieces of SUPERIOR evidence, or
1158      2. One piece of SUPERIOR evidence and one piece of STRONG evidence, or
1159      3. Two pieces of STRONG evidence and one piece of FAIR evidence

1160   5.5.2.2. Collection of Attributes
1161   Validated evidence is the preferred source of identity attributes. If the presented identity
1162   evidence does not provide all the attributes the CSP considers core attributes, it MAY
1163   collect attributes that are self-asserted by the applicant.

1164   5.5.3. Validation Requirements
1165   5.5.3.1. Evidence Validation Requirements
1166   The CSP SHALL validate the genuineness of each piece of SUPERIOR evidence by
1167   confirming the integrity of its cryptographic security features and validating any digital
1168   signatures.
1169   The CSP SHALL validate the genuineness of each piece of STRONG evidence by one of
1170   the following:
1171      1. Visual inspection by trained personnel
1172      2. The use of technologies that can confirm the integrity of physical security features
1173         and detect if the evidence is fraudulent or has been inappropriately modified
1174      3. If present, confirming the integrity of digital security features, including the validity
1175         of the issuerâ€™s digital signature

1176   5.5.3.2. Core Attribute Validation Requirements
1177   The CSP SHALL validate all core attributes by both:
1178      1. Validating the accuracy of attributes obtained from pieces of evidence or applicant
1179         self-assertion by comparison with authoritative or credible sources
1180      2. Validating the cryptographic features of any presented digital evidence, as described
1181         above
1182   For added assurance, the CSP SHALL evaluate the core attributes, as validated by various
1183   sources, for overall consistency.
