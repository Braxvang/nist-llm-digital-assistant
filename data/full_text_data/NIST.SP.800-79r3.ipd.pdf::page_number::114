      (NEW)        authenticator (e.g., mobile phone) is not considered                             Activation Data
                   activation of the authenticator. A separate entry of the
                   activation secret or presentation of a biometric factor is                       [SP800-157], Sec. 3.2.3 –
                   performed to use the authenticator.                                              Activation Data

                   Assessment
                   Determine that:
                      (i) A separate entry of the activation secret or
                           presentation of a biometric factor is performed to
                           use the authenticator (observe, test).
     AI(DC)-22     A derived PIV credential at AAL2 is issued after verifying        PKI- AAL2,     [SP800-157], Sec. 2.2 – Initial
      (NEW)        that the applicant is currently eligible to possess a PIV        Non-PKI-AAL2    Issuance
                   Card by performing the PKI-AUTH authentication
                   mechanism described in Sec. 6.2.3.1 of [FIPS201].

                   Assessment
                   Determine that:
                      (i) The issuer has a documented process in place to
                           verify the identity of the applicant (review).
                     (ii) Derived PIV credentials are issued in accordance
                           with [SP800-63B], Sec. 6.1.2.1 (review, interview,
                           observe).
     AI(DC)-23     Activation of the derived PIV authenticator using a               PKI-AAL2,      [SP800-157], Sec. 3.1.4 –
      (NEW)        memorized secret meets the requirements of [SP800-                PKI-AAL3       Activation Data
                   63B], Sec. 5.2.11.

                   Assessment
                   Determine that:
                       (i) Activation of the memorized secret meets the
                           requirements of [SP800-63B], Sec. 5.2.11
                           (review, interview).
                      (ii) The applicant is able to successfully activate the
                           derived PIV authenticator using the established
                           memorized secret (observe, test).
     AI(DC)-24     The applicant is prompted to establish a memorized              Non-PKI-AAL2,    [SP800-157], Sec. 2.2.2 – Non-
      (NEW)        secret or biometric activation factor (or both) for a multi-    Non-PKI-AAL3     PKI-Based Derived PIV
                   factor authenticator and successfully authenticate using                         Credential Issuance
                   the authenticator.

                   Assessment
                   Determine that:
                       (i) A process to authenticate to a multi-factor
                           authenticator is established (review, interview).
                      (ii) The applicant is able to establish a memorized
                           secret, a biometric activation factor, or both and
                           successfully authenticate to the authenticator
                           (observe, test).
     AI(DC)-25     The applicant is prompted to register a memorized               Non-PKI-AAL2,    [SP800-157], Sec. 2.2.2 – Non-
      (NEW)        secret that meets the requirements of [SP800-63B], Sec.         Non-PKI-AAL3     PKI-Based Derived PIV
                   5.1.1 for a single-factor authenticator that will be verified                    Credential Issuance
                   along with the physical authenticator during the
                   authentication process.
