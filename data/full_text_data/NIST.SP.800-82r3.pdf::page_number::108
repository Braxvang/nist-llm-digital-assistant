6.1.1. Asset Management (ID.AM)
The ability for organizations to properly and consistently identify and manage data, personnel,
devices, systems, and facilities based on their relative importance provides a foundational
capability to support an organizational cybersecurity program. Additionally, updating inventory
information when components are added, removed, or changed (e.g., patched, new firmware
installed, component swapped during maintenance) helps organizations accurately manage their
overall environmental risks. Organizations should consider including the following to support
their asset management capability:
   •   Unique identifiers to differentiate and track assets
   •   Hardware inventory management to track computing and network devices within the
       environment, including device details and location. Device details may include vendor,
       model, serial number, purchase information, and manufacturing/build information (e.g.,
       provenance information).
   •   Software and firmware inventory management to track the software and firmware
       installed with the OT components, including version numbers, location information, and
       software bill of materials (SBOM)
   •   Vendor information to establish a repository of vendor information, points of contact,
       warranty information, locations of recall, and update information
   •   Documented roles and responsibilities to identify specific individuals, teams, or
       organization groups who represent the asset owner and those with operation,
       maintenance, and cybersecurity roles and responsibilities
Supplemental guidance for ID.AM can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 1800-5, IT Asset Management
   •   NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and
       Organizations
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should consider the criticality of a complete and accurate
            asset inventory for managing risk within the OT environment. Accurate
            inventory information supports multiple risk management objectives,
            including risk assessment, vulnerability management, and obsolescence
            tracking.
            While automated tools for supporting asset management are generally
            preferable, organizations should consider how the tool collects
            information and whether the collection method (e.g., active scanning)
            may have a negative impact on their OT systems. Performing a test using
            the automated asset management tools on offline systems or components
            is recommended prior to deployment within the OT production
            environment. When automated tools are not feasible due to network
            architectures or other OT environment issues, the organization should
            consider manual processes for maintaining a current inventory.
