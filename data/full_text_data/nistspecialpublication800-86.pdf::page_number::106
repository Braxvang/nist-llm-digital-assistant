GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



Filename: A unique name used to reference a file.

Filesystem: A method for naming, storing, organizing, and accessing files on logical volumes.

Forensic Science: The application of science to the law.

Forensically Clean: Digital media that is completely wiped of all data, including nonessential and
residual data, scanned for malware, and verified before use.

Free Space: An area on media or within memory that is not allocated.

Logical Backup: A copy of the directories and files of a logical volume.

Logical Volume: A partition or a collection of partitions acting as a single entity that has been formatted
with a filesystem.

Message Digest: A hash that uniquely identifies data. Changing a single bit in the data stream used to
generate the message digest will yield a completely different message digest.

Metadata: Data about data. For filesystems, metadata is data that provides information about a fileâ€™s
contents.

Network Address Translation: The process of mapping addresses on one network to addresses on
another network.

Network Intrusion Detection System: Software that performs packet sniffing and network traffic
analysis to identify suspicious activity and record relevant information.

Network Traffic: Computer network communications that are carried over wired or wireless networks
between hosts.

Non-Volatile Data: Data that persists even after a computer is powered down.

Normalize: The process by which differently formatted data is converted into a standardized format and
labeled consistently.

Operating System: A program that runs on a computer and provides a software platform on which other
programs can run.

Packet: The logical unit of network communications produced by the transport layer.

Packet Sniffer: Software that monitors network traffic on wired or wireless networks and captures
packets.

Partition: A logical portion of a media that functions as though it were physically separate from other
logical portions of the media.

Process: An executing program.

Protocol Analyzer: Software that can reassemble streams from individual packets and decode
communications that use various protocols.
