                                            GUIDE TO STORAGE ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES FOR END USER DEVICES



 Management. Administrators should be able to configure and manage all components of the solution
  effectively and securely. It is particularly important to evaluate the ease of deployment and
  configuration, including how easily the solution can be managed as the solution is scaled to larger
  deployments. Another concern is the ability of administrators to disable configuration options so that
  users cannot circumvent the intended security. Management concerns should include the effects of
  patching/upgrading software, changing software settings (e.g., changing cryptographic algorithms or
  key sizes), uninstalling or disabling encryption software, changing encryption/decryption keys, and
  changing user or administrator passwords.

 Logging. The logging and data management functions should function properly in accordance with
  the organization’s policies and strategies.

 Performance. The solution should be able to provide adequate performance during normal and peak
  usage. Testing should incorporate a variety of devices, OSs, and applications, especially those that
  are most likely to be affected by performance issues, such as those that manipulate large files.

 Security of the Implementation. The storage encryption implementation itself may contain
  vulnerabilities and weaknesses that attackers could exploit. Organizations with high security needs
  may want to perform extensive vulnerability assessments against the storage encryption components.
  Another common security concern is the security of the authenticators and cryptographic keys.

 Recovery. The solution should be tested to determine how well it can recover from failures, such as
  lost or forgotten authenticators, lost keys, device hardware or software failure/damage, and power
  loss.

 Interoperability. For a solution that will protect removable media that will be used on multiple
  devices, the organization should ensure that information encrypted on the media by one device can be
  decrypted by another device after authenticating successfully.

 Operational Impacts. Organizations should determine how the solution might impact operations,
  such as impeding technical support and incident response actions involving end user devices.

Organizations should consider implementing the components in a test environment first, instead of a
production environment, to reduce the likelihood of implementation problems disrupting the production
environment. When the components are being deployed into production, organizations should initially
use encryption on a small number of hosts. Deploying it to many hosts at once might overwhelm the
management servers or identify other bottlenecks through loss of availability. Many of the problems that
occur are likely to occur on multiple hosts, so it is helpful to identify such problems either during the
testing process or when deploying the first hosts, so that those problems can be addressed before
widespread deployment. A phased deployment is also helpful in identifying potential problems with
scalability.

Actions that may be prudent to perform before installing storage encryption software on end user devices
include the following:

 Ensure that any files to be encrypted can be restored. Examples include backing up user files and
  having a disk image for the computer’s OS.

 Replace hardware components (e.g., replace an old hard drive) or the whole device if necessary (e.g.,
  equipment that is considered too slow or unreliable).
