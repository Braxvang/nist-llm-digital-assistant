NIST SP 800-166                                                    DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                   DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

 Precondition(s)          •   A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                              appropriate token reader.
                          •   Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                              an instance of the reader.
                          •   A Security Object is present within the Derived PIV
                              Application.
 Test Scenario            1. Send the SELECT command with
                                • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                          2. Send the GET DATA command with
                                • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                   ('5FC106') of the Security Object
                          3. Extract and parse the certificates field contents
                             from the Security Object.
                          4. Extract the value of the authorityInfoAccess
                             extension from the certificate.
 Expected Result(s)       1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                             template with the status word '90 00'.
                          2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                             along with the status word '90 00'.
                          3. From Step 4, the authorityInfoAccess extension contains an id-
                             ad-caIssuers (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2) accessMethod with an
                             accessLocation of type uniformResourceIdentifier where the
                             scheme is “http.”

9.3.4.8 cRLDistributionPoints Extension

 Test Assertion         TA-09.03.04.08
 Purpose                Verifies that cRLDistributionPoints extension in the Derived PIV
                        Credential Issuer’s (content signing) certificate contains at least one
                        URI, either LDAP or HTTP.
 DTR(s)                 • DTR-07.03.04.09
 Issuer Documentation   None.
 Precondition(s)        • A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                           appropriate token reader.
                        • Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and an
                           instance of the reader.
                        • A Security Object is present within the Derived PIV Application.
 Test Scenario          1. Send the SELECT command with
                              • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                        2. Send the GET DATA command with
                              • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                 ('5FC106') of the Security Object
                        3. Extract and parse the certificates field contents
                           from the Security Object
                        4. Extract the cRLDistributionPoints extension from the
                           certificate.
 Expected Result(s)     1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                           template with the status word '90 00'.
