                            CRYPTOGRAPHY

Cryptography is foundational to our security and data protection needs. The standards,
guidelines, recommendations, and tools provided by NIST’s Cryptography priority area
enable trustworthy assurance of integrity and confidentiality in all types of information
                       and technology – now and in the future.

Major Accomplishments in FY 2022:
• The Post-Quantum Cryptography team announced the third-round selection and the
  fourth-round candidates. The call for additional signatures was released. Standards
  development on the selected algorithms is underway.
• The Lightweight Cryptography Project continued to evaluate the finalist algorithms
  to prepare for the final selection. The fifth Lightweight Cryptography Workshop was
  held.
• NIST’s Crypto Publication Review Board completed two reviews, and seven reviews
  are in progress to update and modernize the portfolio of cryptographic standards.
• NIST continued to explore multi-party threshold cryptography through workshops,
  calls for feedback on criteria for threshold schemes, and other industry
  collaboration.
