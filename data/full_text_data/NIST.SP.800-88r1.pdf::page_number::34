NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                             Guidelines for Media Sanitization


Appendix A—Minimum Sanitization Recommendations

Once a decision is made based on factors such as those described in Section 4, and after applying
relevant organizational environmental factors, then the tables in this Appendix can be used to
determine recommended sanitization of specific media. That recommendation should reflect the
FIPS 199 security categorization of the system confidentiality to reduce the impact of harm of
unauthorized disclosure of information from the media.

Although use of the tables in this Appendix is recommended here, other methods exist to satisfy
the intent of Clear, Purge, and Destroy. Methods not specified in this table may be suitable as
long as they are verified and found satisfactory by the organization. Not all types of available
media are specified in this table. If your media are not included in this guide, organizations are
urged to identify and use processes that will fulfill the intent to Clear, Purge, or Destroy their
media.

When an organization or agency has a sanitization technology, method and/or tool that they trust
and have tested, they are strongly encouraged to share this information through public forums,
such as the Federal Agency Security Practices (FASP) website 19. The FASP effort was initiated
as a result of the success of the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council’s Federal Best
Security Practices (BSP) pilot effort to identify, evaluate, and disseminate best practices for
critical infrastructure protection (CIP) and security.

The proper initial configuration of each type of device helps ensure that the sanitization
operation is as effective as possible. While called out for some specific items below, users are
encouraged to check manufacturer recommendations and guides such as the DISA Security
Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) 20 for additional information about recommended
settings for any other items in this list as well.

If a mobile device has nonvolatile removable memory, it may contain additional information that
may or may not be addressed by the sanitization process identified in Table A-3. Contact the
manufacturer and/or cellular provider to determine what types of data are stored on the
removable memory and identify whether any additional sanitization is required for the removable
memory. Additional details about such removable memory and associated data recovery
capabilities are available in NIST SP 800-101 Revision 1 21. If a mobile device does not have
sufficient built-in sanitization appropriate for the sensitivity or impact level of the data it
contains, then rather than destroy the device (to protect the information) consider contacting
businesses providing sanitization services to determine if their services meet your needs.

Many internal storage devices (as opposed to removable media, such as an SD card) as well as
storage subsystems that incorporate installed media, support dedicated sanitize commands. The
