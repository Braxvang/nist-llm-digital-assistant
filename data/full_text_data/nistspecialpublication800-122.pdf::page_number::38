                           GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



The following are additional questions for this scenario:

    1. Which data elements contained in this data extract should be considered PII?

    2. What is the PII confidentiality impact level? What factors were taken into consideration when
       making this determination?

    3. What privacy-specific safeguards might help protect the PII contained in the data extract?

    4. What should the employee do if her purse (containing the USB drive) is stolen? What should the
       organization do? How could the employer have prevented this situation?

    5. What should the employee do with the copies of the extract when she finishes her work?

    6. Should the emailing of the extract to a personal email address be considered a breach? Should
       storing the data on the personal USB drive be considered a breach?

    7. What could the organization do to reduce the likelihood of similar events in the future?

    8. How should this scenario be handled if the information is a list of de-identified retirement income
       statistics? Would the previous questions be answered differently?

Scenario 4: Testing Systems

An organization needed to test an upgrade to its fingerprint matching system before the upgrade could be
introduced into the production environment. Because it is difficult to simulate fingerprint image and
template data, the organization used real biometric image and template data to test the system. In addition
to the fingerprint images and templates, the system also processed the demographic data associated with
each fingerprint image, including name, age, sex, race, date of birth, and nationality. After successful
completion of the testing, the organization upgraded its production system.

    1. Which data elements contained in this system test should be considered PII?

    2. What is the PII confidentiality impact level? What factors were taken into consideration when
       making this determination?

    3. What privacy-specific safeguards might help protect the PII used in this test?

    4. Is a PIA required to conduct this testing? Is a PIA required to complete the production system
       upgrade?

    5. What should the organization do with the data used for testing when it completes the upgrade?
