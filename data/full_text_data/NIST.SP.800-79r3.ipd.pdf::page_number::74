       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                       Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                                              and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

2287   Appendix G. Issuer Controls and Assessment Procedures
2288   Appendices G.1 and G.2 list issuer controls that are applicable to a PCI and DPCI, respectively.
2289   An issuer must comply with all applicable requirements, with applicability determined by
2290   whether the organization issues the mandatory PIV Cards, the optional derived PIV credentials
2291   (if implemented), or both.

2292   G.1.     Controls and Assessment Procedures for PCIs
2293   The following tables list the set of issuer controls applicable to PCIs. Control descriptions and
2294   assessment procedures have been updated in this revision of SP 800-79 based on updates to
2295   [FIPS201] and its supporting publications. Control identifiers have been labeled with “NEW” or
2296   “UPDATED” to clearly identify whether an existing issuer control has been added or updated,
2297   respectively. Additionally, controls that were either (i) withdrawn in the previous version of SP
2298   800-79 or (ii) moved to or combined with another control in the previous version of SP 800-79
2299   have been removed from this version for the sake of conciseness and brevity.
2300   A control labeled with “NEW” represents an issuer control that has been added to the issuer
2301   control catalog. This does not necessarily represent a new requirement added to [FIPS201]. A
2302   “NEW” control signifies that a requirement in [FIPS201] needs to be explicitly assessed to
2303   ensure that the PCI is compliant with the necessary requirements associated with PIV Card
2304   issuance and maintenance. Controls labeled with “UPDATED” represent an existing issuer
2305   control for which the control description and assessment procedures have been revised
2306   considerably, though the overall intent of the control has not changed from the prior version.

          Identifier                                  Issuer Control                                                    Source

            DO-1       The organization develops and implements an issuer operations plan                 SP 800-79, Sec. 2.12 –
                       according to the template in Appendix D.1. The operations plan references          Authorization Submission Package
                       other documents as needed.                                                         and Supporting Documentation

                       Determine that:
                          (i) The operations plan includes the relevant elements from the template
                              in Appendix D.1 (review).
                         (ii) The operations plan includes (i) the list of issuer controls from
                              Appendix G.1, (ii) the owner for each issuer control, (iii) a description
                              of how the control is implemented, and (iv) whether the control is
                              organization- or facility-specific (review).
                        (iii) Relevant operating procedures and associated documentation are
                              referenced accurately (review).
                        (iv) The operations plan has been reviewed and approved by the DAO
                              within the organization (review, interview).
            DO-2       The organization has a written policy and procedures for identity proofing         [FIPS201], Sec. 2.7 – PIV Identity
                       and registration that are approved by the head or deputy (or equivalent) of        Proofing and Registration
                       the federal department or agency.                                                  Requirements
