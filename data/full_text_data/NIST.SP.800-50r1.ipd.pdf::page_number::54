       NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                        Building a Cybersecurity and
       August 2023                                                                   Privacy Learning Program

1598          Development and Implementation of the CPLP
1599   Once the CPLP requirements have been established and documented in the design phase, the
1600   Learning Program Managers can proceed to develop the Program. This phase is where each
1601   audience’s requirements are evaluated, budgeted, and provided for separately. Typically, the
1602   requirement to develop an All User CPLP will be well-understood and may already exist.
1603   Determine whether that is true, whether the program requires significant investment to be
1604   updated, and whether the talent and expertise are available to support the needed work.
1605   The development process will involve various personnel, including:
1606      •   Management: All levels of management will be responsible for their staff learning
1607          needs, the prioritization of training resources, the identification of training gaps, and
1608          evaluation of the training’s effectiveness.
1609      •   Cybersecurity and privacy specialists and subject-matter experts: Specialists and
1610          subject-matter experts help determine the task, knowledge, and skill requirements of the
1611          roles or job functions, identify training gaps and needs within the organization, and guide
1612          the development and review of learning materials.
1613      •   Training professionals: Training professionals acquire, customize, develop, present, and
1614          evaluate the training content and training programs. Whether the training team and
1615          cybersecurity and privacy teams are in the same department or not, the groups will work
1616          closely together, along with other subject-matter experts to ensure the relevance and
1617          accuracy of the material and programs.
1618      •   Acquisitions and budget: These departments will be engaged when circumstances and
1619          needs require the development or acquisition of externally sourced services or content.
1620   Once the baseline requirements of the program have been solidified, a feedback strategy can be
1621   designed and implemented to ensure that materials continue to support the CPLP strategy and
1622   address identified training needs.

1623          Developing CPLP Material
1624   After the Learning Program Manager has completed their analysis and design reviews, they will
1625   have a comprehensive set of Design Documents to guide the development of new materials.
1626   These documents are useful when allocating budgets and personnel for the creation of new
1627   materials or program elements. However, additional information will be needed to guide the
1628   content creators in their work.

1629   4.1.1. Create a Requirements Document for Sourcing New Material
1630   If the Learning Program Manager determines that it is necessary to create or source new CPLP
1631   content, curricula, or other program elements, they will need to create a Requirements
1632   Document. The Requirements Document incorporates the information from the Design
1633   Document as well as any additional and necessary information to provide to the training and
1634   curricula developers, editors, and designers, whether they are in-house or vendors. The
1635   Requirements Document will also be useful for the organization’s acquisition and budget
1636   functions.
