devices. In particular, some of the readers did not work properly with the middleware because an
undocumented feature conflicted with the settings RTA selected for its equipment. The vendor issued a
patch to its software that solved the problem.

8.2.4   Phase 4: Operations/Maintenance

Once the system was fully operational, the RTA was able to obtain regulatory information more quickly
than before, which reduced the labor time required to support the program. Suppliers and consumers of
the regulated materials also decreased their paperwork. They also were able to better match supply of
materials with demand for them, since authorized organizations could retrieve information about the
quantities present at each site.

The operations phase also included security monitoring. All participating organizations signed a MOU
that covered sharing of information pertaining to possible intrusions or security exploits and proper
management of PII. The MOU also included a provision that prohibited participating organizations from
using PII for any purpose not explicitly stated in the MOU. This close cooperation enabled one of the
suppliers and a national laboratory to recognize a recurring attack pattern across facilities that might
otherwise have been ignored.

8.2.5   Phase 5: Disposition

As a new program, RTA has not actively confronted disposition issues. It plans to instruct participating
organizations to retire their RFID systems as they would any other system holding data that RTA deems
sensitive. In most cases this involves using disk wiping utilities to delete sensitive files. With regard to
tag disposition, RTA’s position is that organizations are free to recycle tags so long as they clear sensor
and manifest data before affixing a tag to a new item.

8.2.6   Summary and Evaluation

The RTA RFID initiative allowed the agency to exercise more effective oversight of the transportation of
radionuclide material while also reducing the regulatory compliance cost of impacted organizations.
Some important security concerns had been raised, particularly with regards to the possibility that an
adversary might use the RFID tags as targeting devices. Early identification of these risks allowed them
to be managed during each stage of the systems. A listing of the main risks and the corresponding
mitigation approach is presented in Table 8-2.
