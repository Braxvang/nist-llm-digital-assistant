SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



The name server performs these three functions with the same DNS database, which is called a zone file.
A class of information called delegation information contains the name server information for child zones
in a parent zone and is used in performing the referral function. The mapping function is performed by a
class of information in a zone file called authoritative information and is provided by a set of records that
list the resources in that zone, along with its domain name and its corresponding IP address. Because the
resources belong to that zone, the information provided is deemed authoritative. Thus, a zone file contains
two categories of information: authoritative information (information about all resources for all domains
in the zone) and delegation information (information about name servers for child zones). The locations in
the zone file where delegation information appears are called delegation points. The level of a zone file is
the level of the topmost domain for which it contains authoritative information. In the previous example,
the zone file in the name server of example.com is the enterprise-level zone file, and the corresponding
name server is called the enterprise-level name server.

2.3       DNS Components and Security Objectives

Before security objectives can be determined, the building blocks of the DNS need to be specified. DNS
includes the following entities:

      •    The platform (hardware and operating system) on which the name server and resolvers reside

      •    The name server and resolver software

      •    DNS transactions

      •    DNS database (zone files)

      •    Configuration files in the name server and resolver.
The media access-level network technology (i.e., Ethernet network connecting a stub resolver and the
local resolving name server) is not included in the definition of DNS.

Confidentiality, integrity, availability, and source authentication are security goals that are common to
any electronic system. However, the DNS is expected to provide name resolution information for any
publicly available Internet resource. Hence except for DNS data pertaining to internal resources (e.g.,
servers inside a firewall etc), that is provided by internal DNS name servers through secure channels, the
DNS data provided by public DNS name servers is not deemed confidential. Hence confidentiality is not
one of the security goals of DNS. Ensuring the authenticity of information and maintaining the integrity
of information in transit is critical for efficient functioning of the Internet, for which the DNS provides the
name resolution service. Hence, integrity and source authentication are the primary DNS security goals.

Because of the sheer diversity of name server platforms and the underlying networks in which DNS
components (such as name server software and resolver software) reside, preventing all types of denial-
of-service attacks is not feasible. Some baseline guidelines must be observed, however, to prevent denial-
of-service attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in the name server platform, zone file data content, and
access control configuration for certain DNS transactions.

2.4       Focus of the Document

There are three main levels of name servers: root name servers, TLD name servers, and enterprise-level
name servers. This document provides deployment guidelines for securing name servers for the .gov
domain (zone) at the TLD level and for all enterprise-level name servers below the .gov TLD. Thus, the
