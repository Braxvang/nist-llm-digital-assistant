NIST SP 800-82r3                                         Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

Some special considerations when securing OT include:
   •   Timeliness and performance requirements. OT systems are generally time-critical,
       with the criterion for acceptable levels of delay and jitter dictated by the individual
       installation. Some systems require reliable, deterministic responses. High throughput is
       typically not essential to OT. In contrast, IT systems typically require high throughput
       and can withstand some level of delay and jitter. For some OT, automated response times
       or system responses to human interaction is critical. Many OT systems utilize real-time
       OSs (RTOS), where real-time refers to timeliness requirements. The units of real time are
       highly application-dependent and must be explicitly stated.
   •   Availability requirements. Many OT processes are continuous in nature. Unexpected
       outages of systems that control industrial processes are unacceptable. Outages must often
       be planned and scheduled days or weeks in advance. Exhaustive pre-deployment testing
       is essential to ensuring high availability (i.e., reliability) for the OT. OT systems often
       cannot be stopped and started without affecting production. In some cases, the products
       produced or equipment being used are more important than the information being
       relayed. Therefore, typical IT strategies (e.g., rebooting a component) are usually not
       acceptable for OT due to adverse impacts on the requirements for high availability,
       reliability, and maintainability. Some OT employ redundant components – often running
       in parallel – to provide continuity when primary components are unavailable.
   •   Risk management requirements. In a typical IT system, primary concerns include data
       confidentiality and integrity. For OT, primary concerns include safety, fault tolerance to
       prevent the loss of life or endangerment of public health or confidence, regulatory
       compliance, loss of equipment, loss of intellectual property, or lost or damaged products.
       The personnel responsible for operating, securing, and maintaining OT must understand
       the important link between safety and security. Any security measure that impairs safety
       is unacceptable.
   •   Physical effects. Field devices (e.g., PLCs, operator stations, DCS controllers) are
       directly responsible for controlling physical processes. OT can have complex interactions
       with physical processes and consequences in the OT domain that can manifest in physical
       events. Understanding these potential physical effects often requires communication
       between experts in OT and experts in the particular physical domain.
   •   System operation. OT OSs and control networks are often quite different from their IT
       counterparts and require different skill sets, experience, and levels of expertise. Control
       networks are typically managed by control engineers rather than IT personnel. Assuming
       that differences are insignificant can have disastrous consequences on system operations.
   •   Resource constraints. OT and their real-time operating systems (RTOSs) are often
       resource-constrained systems that do not include typical contemporary IT security
       capabilities. Legacy systems often lack resources that are common on modern IT
       systems. Many systems may also lack desired features, including encryption capabilities,
       error logging, and password protection. Indiscriminate use of IT security practices in OT
       may cause availability and timing disruptions. There may not be computing resources
       available on OT components to retrofit these systems with current security capabilities.
       Adding resources or features may not be possible.
