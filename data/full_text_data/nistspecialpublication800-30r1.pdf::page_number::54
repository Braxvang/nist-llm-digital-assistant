 [CNSSI No. 4009]                     that seek to identify, manage, and reduce risk of
                                      exploitable vulnerabilities at every stage of the system,
                                      network, or subcomponent life cycle (system, network, or
                                      product design and development; manufacturing;
                                      packaging; assembly; system integration; distribution;
                                      operations; maintenance; and retirement).
 Defense-in-Depth                     Information security strategy integrating people,
 [CNSSI No. 4009]                     technology, and operations capabilities to establish
                                      variable barriers across multiple layers and missions of
                                      the organization.
 Enterprise                           An organization with a defined mission/goal and a
 [CNSSI No. 4009]                     defined boundary, using information systems to execute
                                      that mission, and with responsibility for managing its
                                      own risks and performance. An enterprise may consist of
                                      all or some of the following business aspects: acquisition,
                                      program management, financial management (e.g.,
                                      budgets), human resources, security, and information
                                      systems, information and mission management. See

 Enterprise Architecture              The description of an enterprise’s entire set of
 [CNSSI No. 4009]                     information systems: how they are configured, how they
                                      are integrated, how they interface to the external
                                      environment at the enterprise’s boundary, how they are
                                      operated to support the enterprise mission, and how they
                                      contribute to the enterprise’s overall security posture.

                                      which an information system operates, including but not
                                      limited to: missions/business functions; mission/business
                                      processes; threat space; vulnerabilities; enterprise and
                                      information security architectures; personnel; facilities;
                                      supply chain relationships; information technologies;
                                      organizational governance and culture; acquisition and
                                      procurement processes; organizational policies and
                                      procedures; organizational assumptions, constraints, risk
                                      tolerance, and priorities/trade-offs).
