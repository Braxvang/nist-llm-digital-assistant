       NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1
       September 2023                                 PIV Card Application Namespace, Data Model, and Representation

1245   B.1.7. Authentication Using Secure Messaging Key (SM-AUTH)
1246   If the PIV Card supports the secure messaging protocol, then the secure messaging key,
1247   corresponding CVC, and key establishment protocol (see Section 4 of SP 800-73-5 Part 2) CAN
1248   be used for authentication of the PIV Card and the cardholder (SM-AUTH). The secure
1249   messaging protocol authenticates the PIV Card via the secure messaging key. Any established
1250   session keys SHALL be zeroized after authentication if bits b3 and b4 of subsequent command
1251   CLA bytes are set to zero.
1252   Figure 8 shows the authentication mechanism using the secure messaging key.
