4.3.5. Assess
The Assess step of the RMF determines the extent to which the controls in the system are
effective in their application and producing the desired results. NIST SP 800-53A [SP800-
53Ar5] provides guidance for assessing selected controls from NIST SP 800-53 to ensure that
they are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with
respect to meeting the security requirements of the system.
Table 10 provides additional details on applying the Assess step to OT.
