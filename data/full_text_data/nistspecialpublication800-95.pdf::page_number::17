    1. The rate service’s WSDL is mapped into a UDDI registry entry

    2. The loan service queries the UDDI registry for a Web service capable of providing interest rate
       information

    3. The loan service receives the rate service’s entry and a URI to access the rate service

2.1.2   Web Service Messaging

Web service messages are sent across the network in an XML format defined by the W3C SOAP
specification. In most Web services, there are two types of SOAP messages: requests and responses. 7
When a SOAP request is received, the Web service performs an action based on the request and returns a
SOAP response. In many implementations, SOAP requests are similar to function calls with SOAP
responses returning the results of the function call.

In the bank loan example, the loan service sends SOAP requests to both the credit and rate services to
have them perform some calculations on data provided by the user. The loan service must have the credit
check results of the individual to receive the loan and information about the current rates provided by the
bank. Once both SOAP responses have been received, the loan service can determine whether or not to
grant the loan to the user. Figure 2-2 illustrates how the loan Web service functions. 8

    1. The loan service sends a SOAP message to the credit service requesting a credit check be
       performed on the user.
    2. The credit service sends a SOAP response back to the loan service with the results of the credit
       check.
    3. The loan service sends a SOAP message to the rate service requesting a compilation of the
       current rates provided by the bank.
    4. The rate service sends a SOAP response containing the current rates.

    SOAP was designed to support many message exchange patterns (MEPs) in addition to request/response, such as one-way
    and peer-to-peer.

    Figure 2-1 shows Web services communicating with each other serially. Services may communicate in parallel or
    asynchronously depending on the application or supported protocols.
