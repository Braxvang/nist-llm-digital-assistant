GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



configuration, the firewall bears the brunt of any DoS attack because it must examine any network traffic
before the traffic reaches the mail server (or any other DMZ or internal network resource) [Wack02a].
However, it is increasingly likely that a DoS attack will take the form of a distributed denial of service
(DDoS) attack and consume all of the incoming network bandwidth and related devices (e.g., Internet
border routers) before ever reaching a DMZ firewall.

The advantages of a DMZ from a security standpoint are as follows:

 The mail server may be better protected, and network traffic to and from the mail server can be
  monitored.
 Compromise of the mail server does not directly threaten the internal production network.
 Greater control can be provided over the security of the mail server since traffic to and from the mail
  server can be controlled.
 The DMZ network configuration can be optimized to support and protect the mail servers.
The disadvantages of a DMZ from a security standpoint are as follows:

 DoS attacks aimed at the mail server may have an effect on the internal network.
 Depending on the firewall configuration controlling traffic between the DMZ and internal network, it
  may be possible for the mail server to be used to attack or compromise hosts on the internal network.
  In other words, protection offered by the DMZ depends in large part on the firewall configuration.
7.1.3   Mail Gateways

Using a mail gateway in the DMZ adds further protection for a mail server. The additional layer makes
the mail server significantly more difficult to attack. When a mail server is located in the DMZ, it still
must communicate with untrusted third parties, which provides an avenue for attackers. A mail gateway
acts as a proxy between the real mail server and the Internet. All messages and communications must go
through the proxy before they are forwarded to the mail server. Breaking the direct line of
communication between the Internet and the mail server makes it much more difficult to attack the mail
server. Since the mail gateway generally requires only limited functionality, it is much easier to harden
and secure than a fully functional mail server. Figure 7.4 provides an example of using a mail gateway to
fortify a mail server on the internal network.
