     central and distributed CSIRTs, the coordinating team model is not addressed in detail in this

Incident response teams can also use any of three staffing models:

 Employees. The organization performs all of its incident response work, with limited technical and
  administrative support from contractors.
 Partially Outsourced. The organization outsources portions of its incident response work.
  Section 2.4.2 discusses the major factors that should be considered with outsourcing. Although
  incident response duties can be divided among the organization and one or more outsourcers in many
  ways, a few arrangements have become commonplace:

     – The most prevalent arrangement is for the organization to outsource 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-
         week (24/7) monitoring of intrusion detection sensors, firewalls, and other security devices to an
         offsite managed security services provider (MSSP). The MSSP identifies and analyzes suspicious
         activity and reports each detected incident to the organization’s incident response team.

     – Some organizations perform basic incident response work in-house and call on contractors to
         assist with handling incidents, particularly those that are more serious or widespread.
 Fully Outsourced. The organization completely outsources its incident response work, typically to
  an onsite contractor. This model is most likely to be used when the organization needs a full-time,
  onsite incident response team but does not have enough available, qualified employees. It is assumed
  that the organization will have employees supervising and overseeing the outsourcer’s work.
2.4.2    Team Model Selection

When selecting appropriate structure and staffing models for an incident response team, organizations
should consider the following factors:

 The Need for 24/7 Availability. Most organizations need incident response staff to be available 24/7.
  This typically means that incident handlers can be contacted by phone, but it can also mean that an
  onsite presence is required. Real-time availability is the best for incident response because the longer
  an incident lasts, the more potential there is for damage and loss. Real-time contact is often needed
  when working with other organizations—for example, tracing an attack back to its source.
 Full-Time Versus Part-Time Team Members. Organizations with limited funding, staffing, or
  incident response needs may have only part-time incident response team members, serving as more of
  a virtual incident response team. In this case, the incident response team can be thought of as a
  volunteer fire department. When an emergency occurs, the team members are contacted rapidly, and
  those who can assist do so. An existing group such as the IT help desk can act as a first POC for
  incident reporting. The help desk members can be trained to perform the initial investigation and data
  gathering and then alert the incident response team if it appears that a serious incident has occurred.
 Employee Morale. Incident response work is very stressful, as are the on-call responsibilities of most
  team members. This combination makes it easy for incident response team members to become
  overly stressed. Many organizations will also struggle to find willing, available, experienced, and
  properly skilled people to participate, particularly in 24-hour support. Segregating roles, particularly
