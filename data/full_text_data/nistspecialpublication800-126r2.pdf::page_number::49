                 The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



5.      Source Data Stream Content Requirements for Use Cases

This section discusses additional requirements for the following SCAP-conformant content use cases:
compliance checking, vulnerability scanning, and inventory scanning. Note that as stated in Table 3 in
Section 3.1, each data stream is required to have a @use-case attribute in its <ds:data-stream>
element with a value corresponding either to one of the content types defined in this section or to
“OTHER”, for data streams not corresponding to a defined use case. The required value for each content
type is specified below in the appropriate subsection.
Each use case is subject not only to the requirements presented in this section, but also to all applicable
requirements in Sections 3 and 4.

5.1     Compliance Checking
SCAP content can be used to compare system characteristics and settings against an SCAP-conformant
checklist in an automated fashion. This can verify that operating systems and applications comply with
security checklists and identify any deviations from those checklists.
The SCAP source data stream component that MUST be included for compliance checking is the XCCDF
benchmark, which expresses the checklist. Each rule in the XCCDF benchmark SHALL reference one of
the following:
     An OVAL compliance definition. This definition SHALL be contained in an OVAL component,
      which holds definitions of compliance checks used by the checklist. An XCCDF benchmark’s rules
      MAY reference one or more OVAL compliance class definitions in an OVAL component.
     An OCIL questionnaire. This questionnaire SHALL be contained in an OCIL component, which
      holds questionnaires that collect information that OVAL is not being used to collect, such as posing
      questions to users or harvesting configuration information from an existing database. An XCCDF
      benchmark’s rules MAY reference one or more OCIL questionnaires in an OCIL component.
     An OVAL patch definition. This definition SHALL be contained in an OVAL component, which
      holds definitions for patch compliance checks. These checks may be needed if an organization
      includes patch verification in its compliance activities. An XCCDF benchmark MAY reference an
      OVAL patch definition through a patches up-to-date rule in a manner consistent with Section 3.2.4.3.
Each XCCDF benchmark SHALL have at least one rule that references either an OVAL compliance class
definition in an OVAL component or an OCIL questionnaire in an OCIL component.
All OVAL components and OCIL components referenced by the XCCDF benchmark SHALL be
included in the SCAP source data stream.
If the XCCDF benchmark component references any CPE names, then the SCAP source data stream
MUST include a CPE component, which specifies the products or platforms of interest, and MUST
include one or more OVAL inventory class definitions in an OVAL component that contain the technical
procedures for determining whether or not a specific target asset has a product or platform of interest.
The @use-case attribute in the <ds:data-stream> element MUST be set to
“CONFIGURATION”.

5.2     Vulnerability Scanning
SCAP content can be used to scan operating systems and applications to look for known software flaws
that introduce security exposures. The content enables consistent detection and reporting of these flaws.
