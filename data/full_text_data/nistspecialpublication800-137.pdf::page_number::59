                                                Federal Information Systems and Organizations




 Specification                An assessment object that includes document-based artifacts (e.g.,
 [NISTIR 7298]                policies, procedures, plans, system security requirements,
                              functional specifications, and architectural designs) associated
                              with an information system.

 Status Monitoring            Monitoring the information security metrics defined by the
                              organization in the information security ISCM strategy.

 Subsystem                    A major subdivision of an information system consisting of
 [NISTIR 7298]                information, information technology, and personnel that performs
                              one or more specific functions.

 System                       See Information System.

 System Development Life      The scope of activities associated with a system, encompassing
 Cycle (SDLC)                 the system’s initiation, development and acquisition,
 [CNSSI 4009]                 implementation, operation and maintenance, and ultimately its
                              disposal.

 System Development Life      The scope of activities associated with a system, encompassing
 Cycle (SDLC)                 the system’s initiation, development and acquisition,
 [CNSSI 4009, Adapted]        implementation, operation and maintenance, and ultimately its
                              disposal that instigates another system initiation.

 System Security Plan         Formal document that provides an overview of the security
 [FIPS 200]                   requirements for an information system and describes the security
                              controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements.

 System-Specific Security     A security control for an information system that has not been
 Control                      designated as a common security control or the portion of a
 [CNSSI 4009]                 hybrid control that is to be implemented within an information
                              system.

 Tailoring                    The process by which a security control baseline is modified
 [CNSSI 4009]                 based on: (i) the application of scoping guidance; (ii) the
                              specification of compensating security controls, if needed; and
                              (iii) the specification of organization-defined parameters in the
                              security controls via explicit assignment and selection statements.

 Technical Controls           The security controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) for an
 [FIPS 200]                   information system that are primarily implemented and executed
                              by the information system through mechanisms contained in the
                              hardware, software, or firmware components of the system.

 Test                         A type of assessment method that is characterized by the process
 [NISTIR 7298]                of exercising one or more assessment objects under specified
                              conditions to compare actual with expected behavior, the results
                              of which are used to support the determination of security control
                              effectiveness over time.
