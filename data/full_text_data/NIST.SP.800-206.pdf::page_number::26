         CYBERSECURITY WORKFORCE RECOMMENDATIONS
         TO THE PRESIDENT
         •   The Nation should set an ambitious vision and action plan-of-attack to
             “prepare, grow, and sustain a national cybersecurity workforce that safeguards
             and promotes America’s national security and economic prosperity.”
         •   The Federal Government should lead in launching a high-profile national
             Call to Action to draw attention to and mobilize public and private sector
             resources to address cybersecurity workforce needs.
         •   The Administration should focus on and recommend long-term authorization
             and sufficient appropriations for high-quality, effective cybersecurity
             education and workforce development programs in its budget proposals in
             order to grow and sustain the cybersecurity workforce.
         •   Federal departments and agencies must move quickly to address major needs
             relating to recruiting, developing, and retaining cybersecurity employees and
             continue to implement the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Strategy43 and
             the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2015 (FCWAA).44
         •   The private and public sectors need to transform, elevate, and sustain the
             learning environment to grow a dynamic and diverse cybersecurity workforce.
         •   The private and public sectors need to align education and training with
             employers’ cybersecurity workforce needs, improve coordination, and prepare
             individuals for lifelong careers.
         •   The private and public sectors need to establish and leverage measures
             that demonstrate the effectiveness and impact of cybersecurity
             workforce investments.
