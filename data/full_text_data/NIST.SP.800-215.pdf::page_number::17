   Network Security Appliances in the Enterprise Network Landscape
This section considers some new network security appliances and enhanced features in
established appliances for meeting the security needs of the current network landscape. These
can simply be viewed as point security solutions, but evaluating their functions and features will
provide an understanding of the effectiveness of network configurations and technologies that
form part of the integrated solutions that will be discussed in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.

       Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)
Given the increasing subscription to multiple clouds in many enterprises, one of the most
important pieces of software is the cloud access security broker (CASB). It sits on the network
between the cloud service customers (CSC) and the cloud service providers (CSP). The evolution
of CASB functionality can be traced as follows [3]:
   •   The primary function of the first generation of CASBs was the discovery of resources.
       They provided visibility into all of the cloud resources that the enterprise users accessed,
       thus preventing or minimizing the chances of shadow IT. Shadow IT is the practice of
       some users using cloud applications that are not authorized by the enterprise IT
       management from home or the office using enterprise desktops. An example of this is the
       use of unapproved software as-a-service (SaaS) applications for file sharing, social
       media, collaboration, and web conferencing [4]. This generation of CASBs also provides
       some statistics, such as software-as-a-service (SaaS) utilization.
   •   The current generation of CASBs enforces security and governance policies for cloud
       applications, thus enabling enterprises to extend their on-premises policies to the cloud.
       Specific security services provided by CASBs include:
           o Protection of enterprise data that live in cloud service providers’ servers (due to
             SaaS or IaaS subscriptions), as well as data inflow and data outflow (i.e., Data
             Loss Prevention [DLP] capabilities) from those servers.
           o Tracking of threats, such as account hijacking and other malicious activities, some
             of which can detect anomalies in users’ cloud access behavior (through robust
             User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) functionality) and stop insider
             threats and advanced cyberattacks [5].
           o Detection of misconfigurations in the enterprise’s subscribed IaaS and cloud
             servers. These misconfigurations pose serious security risks, such as data
             breaches. Alerts generated by CASB due to misconfigurations in the enterprise’s
             IaaS deployments direct the enterprise to follow guidelines, such as the Center for
             Internet Security’s (CIS) benchmarks for public cloud services, thus improving
             the overall security profile of the enterprise for cloud access [4].

       Enhanced Firewall Capabilities
The security functions in firewalls have enlarged alongside the changing network landscape.
Firewalls started as hardware appliances that prevented network packets from a device with a
particular network location (e.g., combination of Internet Protocol (IP) address and port) in one
