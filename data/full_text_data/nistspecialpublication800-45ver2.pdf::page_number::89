9.        Administering the Mail Server

After initially deploying a mail server, administrators need to maintain its security continuously. This
section provides general recommendations for securely administering mail servers. Vital activities
include handling and analyzing log files; performing regular mail server backups; recovering from mail
server compromises; testing the mail server’s security regularly; and performing remote administration
securely.

9.1       Logging

Logging is a cornerstone of a sound security posture. Capturing the correct data in the logs and then
monitoring those logs closely is vital. 56 Network and system logs are important, especially system logs in
the case of S/MIME or OpenPGP (see Section 3) enabled mail servers, where network monitoring is less
effective. Mail server software can provide additional log data relevant to mail-specific events.

Reviewing logs is mundane and reactive, and many mail server administrators devote their time to
performing duties that they may consider more important or urgent. However, log files are often the only
record of suspicious behavior. Enabling the mechanisms to log information allows the logs to be used to
detect failed and successful intrusion attempts and to initiate alert notifications when further investigation
is needed. Procedures and tools need to be in place to process and analyze the log files and to review alert
notifications.

Mail server logs provide:

 Alerts to suspicious activities that require further investigation
 Tracking of an attacker’s activities
 Assistance in the recovery of the system
 Assistance in post-event investigation
 Required information for legal proceedings.
The selection and implementation of specific mail server software determine which set of detailed
instructions presented below the mail administrator should follow to establish logging configurations.
Some of the guidance contained in the steps below may not be fully applicable to all manufacturers’ mail
server software products.

9.1.1      Recommended Generic Logging Configuration

Although the logging capabilities of a mail server vary for each product, the following generic
configuration is recommended. Set logging on the mail server to the standard level used within the
organization. Once the overall logging detail level is set, ensure the following events are logged (if
supported by the mail server software):

 Local host related logging

      –    IP stack setup errors
