No OT Discussion for this control.
Rationale for adding SI-13 control to HIGH baseline: OT are designed and built with certain
boundary conditions, design parameters, and assumptions about their environment and mode of
operation. OT may run much longer than conventional systems, allowing latent flaws that are not
manifest in other environments to become effective. For example, integer overflow might never
occur in systems that are re-initialized more frequently than the occurrence of the overflow.
Experience and forensic studies of anomalies and incidents in OT can lead to the identification of
emergent properties that were previously unknown, unexpected, or unanticipated. Preventative
and restorative actions (e.g., restarting the system or application) are prudent but may not be
acceptable in OT for operational reasons.

OT Discussion: The selected failure conditions and corresponding procedures may vary among
baselines. The same failure event may trigger different responses, depending on the impact level.
Mechanical and analog systems can be used to provide mechanisms to ensure fail-safe
procedures. Fail-safe states should incorporate potential impacts to human safety, physical
systems, and the environment. A related controls is CP-6.
Rationale for adding SI-17 to LOW, MOD, and HIGH baselines: This control provides a
structure for the organization to identify its policy and procedures for dealing with failures and
other incidents. Creating a written record of the decision process for selecting incidents and
appropriate responses in light of a changing environment of operations is part of risk
management.
