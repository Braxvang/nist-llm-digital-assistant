       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                                Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1217      2. The CSP SHALL have a live operator participate remotely with the applicant for
1218         the entirety of the identity proofing session.
1219      3. The CSP SHALL require all actions taken by the applicant during the identity
1220         proofing session to be clearly visible to the remote operator.
1221      4. The CSP SHALL require that all digital verification of evidence (e.g., via chip
1222         or wireless technologies) be performed by integrated scanners and sensors (e.g.,
1223         embedded fingerprint reader).
1224      5. The CSP SHALL require operators to have undergone a training program to detect
1225         potential fraud and to properly perform a supervised remote proofing session.
1226      6. The CSP SHALL employ physical tamper detection and resistance features
1227         appropriate for the environment in which it is located. For example, a kiosk located
1228         in a restricted area or one where it is monitored by a trusted individual requires less
1229         tamper detection than one that is located in a semi-public area such as a shopping
1230         mall concourse.
1231      7. The CSP SHALL ensure that all communications occur over a mutually
1232         authenticated protected channel.

1233   5.6. Summary of Requirements
1234   Table 1 summarizes the requirements for each of the identity assurance levels:
