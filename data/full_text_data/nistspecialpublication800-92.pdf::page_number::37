          learning how to use the tool efficiently to reduce large datasets down to a few events of interest
          can take considerable effort.
       Log Rotation Utilities. Administrators can use specialized third-party utilities for rotating logs.
        These can be helpful for improving log management for log sources that do not offer sufficiently
        robust log rotation capabilities or any capability at all.
       Log Conversion Utilities. Many software vendors offer log conversion utilities that can be used
        to convert their proprietary format logs into standard formats. These utilities are helpful in
        incorporating data from less common log sources into a log management infrastructure, such as
        when an SIEM product does not offer support for a particular log format. Log conversion utilities
        are also helpful when a syslog-based log management infrastructure is being used and one or
        more log generators cannot log directly to syslog.
3.6     Summary

A log management infrastructure consists of the hardware, software, networks, and media used to
generate, transmit, store, analyze, and dispose of log data. Log management infrastructures typically
perform several functions that support the analysis of events, such as filtering, aggregation, normalization,
and correlation. The infrastructures also provide assistance in making log data accessible and maintaining
it through functions such as log parsing, viewing, analysis, rotation, and archival, as well as log file
integrity checking.

Log management infrastructures, which are typically based on either syslog-based centralized logging
software or security information and event management software, usually use a three-tiered design. The
first tier encompasses the hosts that generate the original log data. The second tier includes centralized
log servers, which perform consolidation and data storage. The third tier contains consoles that are used
to monitor and review log data, and optionally may also be used to manage the log servers and clients.
Communications between the tiers usually occur over the organizationâ€™s regular networks, but may be
routed over a separate logging network instead. Organizations may also have log-generating hosts that
cannot actively participate in the log management infrastructure, such as computers that are not network-
connected, legacy systems, and appliance-based devices; administrators can either transfer data manually
to the infrastructure from these hosts through removable media, or manage and analyze the data locally.

In a syslog-based centralized logging infrastructure, each log generator uses the same standard log format
and forwards its log entries to a centralized log server. Because syslog is a simple standard protocol, it
can be used by many OSs, security software programs, and applications. The original syslog standard
does not offer much granularity in handling different types of events. Also, because it has few data fields,
it can be very difficult to extract the meaning of the data logged for each event when multiple log sources
are generating events. Syslog was developed when log security was not a major concern; the original
syslog standard offers no features for preserving the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of logs.

To improve the security of syslog deployments, a new proposed standard has been created that offers
stronger security capabilities, and various syslog implementations have added features such as reliable log
delivery; transmission encryption, integrity protection, and authentication; robust filtering; automated
event responses; log file encryption; and event rate limiting. Organizations using syslog should consider
using secure syslog implementations, paying particular attention to interoperability because many syslog
clients and servers offer features not specified in current standards.

Unlike syslog-based infrastructures, which are based on a single standard, security information and event
management (SIEM) software primarily uses proprietary data formats. SIEM products have centralized
servers that perform log analysis and database servers for log storage. Most SIEM products require
