5.4.2   Modified Devices

        A number of considerations need to be made when handling a device. For example, pressing
        the power button, synchronization button, or the PIM-related contacts, calendar, to-do list, and
        tasks buttons on the device could potentially trigger an alteration of state. More interesting,
        however, are modifications to the software applications and operating system that may have
        been made to the device, which could be triggered from these actions. The following is a list
        of common classes of modifications that can occur:

                  Key Remapping – It is relatively straightforward to remap a hardware key to perform
                  a different function than the default. Overall, a key press or combination of key
                  presses can be made to launch an arbitrary program.

                  Malicious Programs – Common utilities or functions can be replaced with versions
                  that contain a Trojan horse designed to alter or damage data present on the device.
                  For example, tools exist that allow users to capture, update, and replace ROM images
                  with preferred applications, such as improved Web browsers. Trojan-bearing
                  programs could conditionally be activated or suppressed based on conditions such as
                  input parameters or hardware key interrupts. Watchdog applications could also be
                  written to listen for specific key chord events and carry out actions such as wiping the
                  device clean.

                  Security Enhancements – Many organizations and individuals enhance their
                  handheld devices with add-on security mechanisms. A variety of visual login,
                  biometric, and token-based authentication mechanisms are available for use as
                  replacements or supplements to password mechanisms. Improper interaction with a
                  mechanism could cause the device to lock down and even destroy its contents. This is
                  particularly a concern with security tokens whose presence is constantly monitored
                  and whose removal from a card slot or other device interface is immediately acted
                  upon.

5.4.3   Transport and Storage

        Once the device is ready to be seized, the forensic specialists should seal the device in a static
        proof bag and tag it. The individual who seizes the device must sign and date the tag to initiate
        a chain of custody. A hard case, in which the internal padding can conform to various device
        shapes, would be preferable to using an envelop within the evidence bag to prevent keys from
        being pressed accidentally. Radio frequency isolation bags exist for cutting off a device’s
