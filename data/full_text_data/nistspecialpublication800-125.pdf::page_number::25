                                                       GUIDE TO SECURITY FOR FULL VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGIES



Many hosted virtualization systems also allow guest OSs to share information with the host OS through
clipboard sharing. That is, copying information to the clipboard in the host OS allows that information to
be pasted in the guest OS, and vice versa. Similarly, putting information on the clipboard in one guest OS
makes the same information show up on the clipboard in other guest OSs running on the same hypervisor.
This is a handy feature for users, but it is also a vector for attacks between the guest OS and host OS.
Because of this, organizations should have policies regarding the use of shared clipboards.

The following are security recommendations for the guest OS itself:

 Follow the recommended practices for managing the physical OS, e.g., time synchronization, log
  management, authentication, remote access, etc.
 Install all updates to the guest OS promptly. All modern OSs have features that will automatically
  check for updates and install them.
 Back up the virtual drives used by the guest OS on a regular basis, using the same policy for backups
  as is used for non-virtualized computers in the organization.
 In each guest OS, disconnect unused virtual hardware. This is particularly important for virtual drives
  (usually virtual CDs and floppy drives), but is also important for virtual network adapters other than
  the primary network interface and serial and/or parallel ports.
 Use separate authentication solutions for each guest OS unless there is a particular reason for two
  guest OSs to share credentials.
 Ensure that virtual devices for the guest OS are associated only with the appropriate physical devices
  on the host system, such as the mappings between virtual and physical NICs.
If a guest OS on a hosted virtualization system is compromised, that guest OS can potentially infect other
systems on the same hypervisor. The most likely way this can happen is that both systems are sharing
disks or clipboards. If such sharing is turned on in two or more guest OSs, and one guest OS is
compromised, the administrator of the virtualization system needs to decide how to deal with the potential
compromise of other guest OSs. Two strategies for dealing with this situation are:

 Assume that all guest OSs on the same hardware have been compromised. Revert each guest OS to a
  known-good image that was saved before the compromise.
 Investigate each guest OS for compromise, just as one would during normal scanning for malware. If
  malware is found, follow the organization’s normal security policy.
The first method assumes that guest OSs are different than “regular” systems, while the second assumes
that the organization’s current security policy is sufficient and should be applied to all systems in the
same manner.

4.3   Virtualized Infrastructure Security

Virtualization provides simulation of hardware such as storage and network interfaces. This infrastructure
is as important to the security of a virtualized guest OS as real hardware infrastructure is to an operating
system running on a physical computer. Many virtualization systems have features to provide access
control to the virtual hardware, particularly storage and networking. Access to virtual hardware should be
strictly limited to the guest OSs that will use it. For example, if a virtual hard drive will be shared
between two guest OSs, only those two OSs should have access to the virtual hard drive. Some virtual
hardware is meant to be widely shared. For example, a disk image that represents an installation CD may
