Abstract
During Fiscal Year 2022 (FY 2022) – from October 1, 2021, through September 30, 2022 –
the NIST Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) Cybersecurity and Privacy Program
successfully responded to numerous challenges and opportunities in security and privacy.
This Annual Report highlights the FY 2022 research activities for the ITL Cybersecurity and
Privacy Program, including: the ongoing participation and development of international
standards; research and practical applications in several key priority areas (e.g., Post
Quantum Cryptography, updating the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0) and some
new CSF profiles); accomplishments in the area of improving software and supply chain
cybersecurity; IoT cybersecurity guidelines work; National Cybersecurity Center of
Excellence (NCCoE) projects, and setting up a new comment site for NIST’s Risk
Management Framework work. NIST also celebrated a 50th anniversary in cybersecurity
and the NCCoE celebrated a 10-year anniversary since inception.

Reports on Computer Systems Technology
The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests,
test methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to
advance the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s
responsibilities include the development of management, administrative, technical, and
physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of other than
national security-related information in federal information systems. The Special
Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in
information system security, and its collaborative activities with industry, government, and
academic organizations.
