      November 2023

792             A.03.01.18.a[01]: usage restrictions are established for mobile devices.
793             A.03.01.18.a[02]: configuration requirements are established for mobile devices.
794             A.03.01.18.a[03]: connection requirements are established for mobile devices.
795             A.03.01.18.b: the connection of mobile devices to the system is authorized.
796             A.03.01.18.c: full-device or container-based encryption is implemented to protect the

817   3.1.20. Use of External Systems
818             REQUIREMENT: 03.01.20

819             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
820             Determine if:
821             A.03.01.20.ODP[01]: terms and conditions to be satisfied on external systems prior to
822             allowing the use of or access to those systems by authorized individuals are defined.
823             A.03.01.20.ODP[02]: security requirements to be satisfied on external systems prior to
824             allowing the use of or access to those systems by authorized individuals are defined.
825             A.03.01.20.a: the use of external systems is prohibited unless the systems are specifically
826             authorized.
827             A.03.01.20.b[01]: the following terms and conditions to be satisfied on external systems prior to
828             allowing the use of or access to those systems by authorized individuals are established:
829             <A.03.01.20.ODP[01]: terms and conditions>.
