                                        GUIDE TO MALWARE INCIDENT PREVENTION AND HANDLING FOR DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS


Common malware prevention–related policy considerations include the following:6

       Requiring the scanning of media from outside of the organization for malware before they can be
        used
       Requiring that email file attachments be scanned before they are opened
       Prohibiting the sending or receipt of certain types of files (e.g., .exe files) via email
       Restricting or prohibiting the use of unnecessary software, such as user applications that are often
        used to transfer malware (e.g., personal use of external instant messaging and file sharing
        services)
       Restricting the use of removable media (e.g., flash drives), particularly on hosts that are at high
        risk of infection, such as publicly accessible kiosks
       Specifying which types of preventive software (e.g., antivirus software, content filtering
        software) are required for each type of host (e.g., email server, web server, laptop, smart phone)
        and application (e.g., email client, web browser), and listing the high-level requirements for
        configuring and maintaining the software (e.g., software update frequency, host scan scope and
        frequency)
       Restricting or prohibiting the use of organization-issued and/or personally-owned mobile devices
        on the organization’s networks and for telework/remote access.
3.2     Awareness

An effective awareness program explains proper rules of behavior for use of an organization’s IT hosts
and information. Accordingly, awareness programs should include guidance to users on malware incident
prevention, which can help reduce the frequency and severity of malware incidents. All users should be
made aware of the ways in which malware enters and infects hosts; the risks that malware poses; the
inability of technical controls to prevent all incidents; and the importance of users in preventing incidents,
with an emphasis on avoiding social engineering attacks (as discussed below). In addition, the
organization’s awareness program should cover the malware incident prevention considerations in the
organization’s policies and procedures, as described in Section 3.1, as well as generally recommended
practices for avoiding malware incidents. Examples of such practices are as follows:

       Not opening suspicious emails or email attachments, clicking on hyperlinks, etc. from unknown
        or known senders, or visiting websites that are likely to contain malicious content
       Not clicking on suspicious web browser popup windows
       Not opening files with file extensions that are likely to be associated with malware (e.g., .bat,
        .com, .exe, .pif, .vbs)
       Not disabling malware security control mechanisms (e.g., antivirus software, content filtering
        software, reputation software, personal firewall)
       Not using administrator-level accounts for regular host operation
       Not downloading or executing applications from untrusted sources.

      Although all of these considerations are intended to help organizations prevent malware incidents, many of them could also
      be helpful in detecting or containing incidents.
