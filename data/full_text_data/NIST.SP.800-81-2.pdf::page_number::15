                                                          SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



1.    Introduction

1.1   Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency
Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2   Purpose and Scope

This publication seeks to assist organizations in understanding the secure deployment of Domain Name
System (DNS) services in an enterprise. It provides practical, real-world guidance on securing each facet
of DNS within an organization based on an analysis of the operating environment and associated threats.

Currently, the DNS is not the target of most attacks, but as hosts become more security aware, and
applications begin to rely on the DNS infrastructure for network operations, the DNS infrastructure will
become a more tempting target. The ultimate goal for DNSSEC is full deployment across the entire
domain tree on the infrastructure side, and implementation in applications that can demand the services
provided by DNSSEC. At present there are no operational nodes in the DNS domain tree that provides
DNSSEC capabilities. Hence the first step towards fully deployment is to provide DNSSEC capability for
domain subtrees that have high security needs. Once DNSSEC capabilities become widely available in
the infrastructure, application developers will be able to develop DNSSEC-aware applications and thus
use DNSSEC as a means for network security.

In this guide, DNSSEC deployment is targeting the DNS infrastructure, not individual hosts. However, as
the infrastructure becomes more secure, DNSSEC will naturally push down to the individual clients that
make DNS queries. DNSSEC was designed with backward compatibility in mind, so that current
network applications can gain some security from DNSSEC, provided that servers upstream are using
DNSSEC, but in the future, it is hoped all systems (DNS name servers and clients) will be able to perform
at least some of the operations detailed in the DNSSEC specifications and this document.

1.3   Audience

This document has been created for the administrators of DNS deployments, as well as computer security
staff and system administrators who are responsible for performing duties related to DNS.
