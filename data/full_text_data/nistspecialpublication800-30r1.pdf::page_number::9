                                           CAUTIONARY NOTES
                                 SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY OF RISK ASSESSMENTS

  •   Risk assessments are a key part of effective risk management and facilitate decision making at all
      three tiers in the risk management hierarchy including the organization level, mission/business
      process level, and information system level.
  •   Because risk management is ongoing, risk assessments are conducted throughout the system
      development life cycle, from pre-system acquisition (i.e., material solution analysis and technology
      development), through system acquisition (i.e., engineering/manufacturing development and
      production/deployment), and on into sustainment (i.e., operations/support).
  •   There are no specific requirements with regard to: (i) the formality, rigor, or level of detail that
      characterizes any particular risk assessment; (ii) the methodologies, tools, and techniques used to
      conduct such risk assessments; or (iii) the format and content of assessment results and any
      associated reporting mechanisms. Organizations have maximum flexibility on how risk assessments
      are conducted and are encouraged to apply the guidance in this document so that the various needs
      of organizations can be addressed and the risk assessment activities can be integrated into broader
      organizational risk management processes.
  •   Organizations are also cautioned that risk assessments are often not precise instruments of
      measurement and reflect: (i) the limitations of the specific assessment methodologies, tools, and
      techniques employed; (ii) the subjectivity, quality, and trustworthiness of the data used; (iii) the
      interpretation of assessment results; and (iv) the skills and expertise of those individuals or groups
      conducting the assessments.
  •   Since cost, timeliness, and ease of use are a few of the many important factors in the application of
      risk assessments, organizations should attempt to reduce the level of effort for risk assessments by
      sharing risk-related information, whenever possible.
