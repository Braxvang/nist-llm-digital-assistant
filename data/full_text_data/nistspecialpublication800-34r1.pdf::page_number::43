                                                             CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS




Training               For the purposes of this publication and as documented in NIST SP 800-84, training
                       refers only to informing personnel of their roles and responsibilities within a
                       particular information system plan and teaching them skills related to those roles
                       and responsibilities, thereby preparing them for participation in exercises, tests,
                       and actual emergency situations related to the ISCP. Training personnel on their
                       roles and responsibilities before an exercise or test event is typically split between a
                       presentation on their roles and responsibilities and activities that allow personnel to
                       demonstrate their understanding of the subject matter.


3.5.3       Exercises

NIST SP 800-84 identifies the following types of exercises widely used in information system TT&E
programs by single organizations:
           Tabletop Exercises. Tabletop exercises are discussion-based exercises where personnel meet in
            a classroom setting or in breakout groups to discuss their roles during an emergency and their
            responses to a particular emergency situation. A facilitator presents a scenario and asks the
            exercise participants questions related to the scenario, which initiates a discussion among the
            participants of roles, responsibilities, coordination, and decision making. A tabletop exercise is
            discussion-based only and does not involve deploying equipment or other resources.
           Functional Exercises. Functional exercises allow personnel to validate their operational
            readiness for emergencies by performing their duties in a simulated operational environment.
            Functional exercises are designed to exercise the roles and responsibilities of specific team
            members, procedures, and assets involved in one or more functional aspects of a plan (e.g.,
            communications, emergency notifications, system equipment setup). Functional exercises vary in
            complexity and scope, from validating specific aspects of a plan to full-scale exercises that
            address all plan elements. 28 Functional exercises allow staff to execute their roles and
            responsibilities as they would in an actual emergency situation, but in a simulated manner.


Exercises              An exercise is a simulation of an emergency designed to validate the viability of one
                       or more aspects of an ISCP. In an exercise, personnel with roles and
                       responsibilities in a particular ISCP meet to validate the content of a plan through
                       discussion of their roles and their responses to emergency situations, execution of
                       responses in a simulated operational environment, or other means of validating
                       responses that do not involve using the actual operational environment. Exercises
                       are scenario-driven, such as a power failure in one of the organization’s data
                       centers or a fire causing certain systems to be damaged, with additional situations
                       often being presented during the course of an exercise.



3.5.4       TT&E Program Summary

A TT&E program provides an overall framework for determining, scheduling, and setting objectives for
TT&E activities. Guidance on establishing an effective ISCP TT&E program and the various methods
28
     Planned and unplanned maintenance activities may also present opportunities to execute and document a Functional Exercise.
     This is often applicable to operational systems (such as ICS) where it may be otherwise disruptive to test certain aspects of the
     system or contingency plan. NIST SP 800-53, Appendix I, contains supplemental guidance.
