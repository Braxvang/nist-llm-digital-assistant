Q. What is configuration management?
A. NIST SP 800-64, Security Considerations in the Information System Development
   Life Cycle, states, “Configuration management and control procedures are critical
   to establishing an initial baseline of hardware, software, and firmware
   components for the information system and subsequently to controlling and
   maintaining an accurate inventory of any changes to the system. Changes to the
   hardware, software, or firmware of a system can have a significant impact on the
   security of the system…changes should be documented, and their potential
   impact on security should be assessed regularly.”

Q. Why is configuration management important?
A. With the complexity and uniqueness of each information system (often due to
   various user accounts and privileges, department software, or a user’s personal
   preferences), it is difficult for each system to be identically configured to all
   others on any given network. CM needs to exist to minimize the effects on an
   information system or network due to these changes or differences in
   configurations. With multiple system platforms, each differing item (hardware or
   software) poses a potential vulnerability that can be compromised and
   significantly affect a network.

Q. What should be taken into account when developing a configuration
   management process?
A. Each organization must take into account the associated costs and expenses, the
   required planning and scheduling, and the necessary training associated with a
   thorough and effective CM process.

Q. What steps should be performed before implementing a change?
A. It is very important to test possible configuration changes before implementing
   them. The assigned changes should be tested in a controlled environment to
   ensure minimal risk of an adverse effect.

Q. Is configuration management required by all federal organizations?
A. Yes. CM requirements are set forth by OMB and NIST and must be addressed by
   all federal organizations. NIST SP 800-53, Revision 1, Recommended Security
   Controls for Federal Information Systems, defines seven CM controls that
