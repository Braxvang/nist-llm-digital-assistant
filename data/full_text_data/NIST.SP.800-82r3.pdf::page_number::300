OT Discussion: OT systems may contain system components that are no longer supported by the
developer, vendor, or manufacturer and have not been replaced due to various operational,
safety, availability, or lifetime constraints. Organizations identify alternative methods to continue
supported operation of such system components and consider additional compensating controls
to mitigate against known threats and vulnerabilities to unsupported system components.

F.7.17.        SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION â€“ SC
Tailoring Considerations for the System and Communications Protection Family
The use of cryptography is determined after careful consideration of the security needs and the
potential ramifications on system performance. For example, the organization considers whether
latency induced from the use of cryptography would adversely impact the operational
performance of the OT. While the legacy devices commonly found within OT often lack direct
support for cryptographic functions, compensating controls (e.g., encapsulations) may be used to
meet the intent of the control.
