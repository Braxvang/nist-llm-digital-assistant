                                                                                             GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



 A hardware appliance is a device running the SSL VPN software that has been hardened by the SSL
  VPN device vendor to make it more secure. For example, unnecessary services and programs have
  been removed from the operating system, and various default settings have been changed. The
  hardware appliance is the most common type of SSL VPN device on the market today. Some SSL
  VPN appliances have accelerator options that offload SSL processing so the appliance can process
  more user requests. These accelerators are either external devices or cards that are installed in the
  SSL VPN appliance. An organization with high performance requirements should consider these
  options.
 Some existing security products such as firewalls or IPsec VPN gateways can be upgraded to support
  SSL VPNs. This option is made available by the vendor as either a software upgrade or a hardware
  module that is installed into the existing security device.
 A software solution is software that is installed on standard hardware, such as a server built by the
  organization. The hardware can either be used to support a dedicated SSL VPN service or to support
  other services such as a firewall or IPsec VPN.
4.3.4.2 Device Placement and Firewall Configuration

Device placement of the SSL VPN hardware is often a challenging task because the placement has
security, functionality, and performance implications. It may also have an effect on other network
devices such as firewalls, routers, and switches. Incorporating an SSL VPN device into a network
architecture requires strong overall knowledge of network and security policy.

It is important to understand that the cryptographic protection of the SSL VPN only extends from client
machines to the SSL VPN device. After the device receives the traffic from users, it is decrypted and
forwarded in its original form to the destination. So if client traffic is originally sent in plaintext before it
is encrypted with SSL, it is sent in plaintext from the VPN device to its destination. The SSL VPN device
preserves most of the fields in the packet headers, with the exception of the source IP address and source
TCP or UDP port.

There are three main options for SSL VPN device placement: as part of the organization’s firewall, within
the internal network, or within a demilitarized zone (DMZ). Placing the SSL VPN device outside the
organization’s firewalls is not recommended because the device itself receives no protection from the
firewall.

Enabling VPN functionality on the firewall. This design integrates the firewall and SSL VPN device.
The most common scenario is for an existing firewall product to be upgraded so it supports SSL VPNs.
This option is made available by the vendor as either a software upgrade or hardware add-on. TCP port
443 for the firewall’s external address must be opened on the firewall to permit users to initiate SSL VPN
connections. The firewall/SSL VPN device then communicates directly with internal hosts. Figure 4-1
illustrates this design.
