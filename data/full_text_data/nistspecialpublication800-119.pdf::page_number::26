administrator primarily for reallocation of the subnet ID and the host ID. The subnet ID identifies a link
within a site, which can have multiple subnet IDs. The host ID within a network must be unique and
identifies an interface on a subnet for the organization, similar to an assigned IPv4 address. Figure 3-2
depicts an IPv6 address with 32 bits allocated to the network prefix.

Government, educational, commercial, and other networks typically receive address allocations from top-
tier providers (ISPs) with a network prefix of 48 bits (/48), leaving 80 bits for the subnet identifier and
host identifier. Figure 3-3 depicts an IPv6 address with 48 bits allocated to the network prefix.

Subnets within an organization often have network prefixes of 64 bits (/64), leaving 64 bits for allocation
to hostsâ€™ interfaces. The host ID should use a 64-bit interface identifier that follows EUI-64 (Extended
Unique Identifier) format when a global network prefix is used (001 to 111), except in the case when
multicast addresses (1111 1111) are used10. Figure 3-4 depicts an IPv6 address with 64 bits allocated to
the network prefix.
