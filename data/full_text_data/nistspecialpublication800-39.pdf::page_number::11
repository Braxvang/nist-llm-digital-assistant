Special Publication 800-39                                             Managing Information Security Risk
                                                                       Organization, Mission, and Information System View
________________________________________________________________________________________________

The complex relationships among missions, mission/business processes, and the information
systems supporting those missions/processes require an integrated, organization-wide view for
managing risk.7 Unless otherwise stated, references to risk in this publication refer to information
security risk from the operation and use of organizational information systems including the
processes, procedures, and structures within organizations that influence or affect the design,
development, implementation, and ongoing operation of those systems. The role of information
security in managing risk from the operation and use of information systems is also critical to the
success of organizations in achieving their strategic goals and objectives. Historically, senior
leaders/executives have had a very narrow view of information security either as a technical
matter or in a stovepipe that was independent of organizational risk and the traditional
management and life cycle processes. This extremely limited perspective often resulted in
inadequate consideration of how information security risk, like other organizational risks, affects
the likelihood of organizations successfully carrying out their missions and business functions.
This publication places information security into the broader organizational context of achieving
mission/business success. The objective is to:
•      Ensure that senior leaders/executives recognize the importance of managing information
       security risk and establish appropriate governance structures for managing such risk;
•      Ensure that the organization’s risk management process is being effectively conducted across
       the three tiers of organization, mission/business processes, and information systems;
•      Foster an organizational climate where information security risk is considered within the
       context of the design of mission/business processes, the definition of an overarching
       enterprise architecture, and system development life cycle processes; and
•      Help individuals with responsibilities for information system implementation or operation
       better understand how information security risk associated with their systems translates into
       organization-wide risk that may ultimately affect the mission/business success.

To successfully execute organizational missions and business functions with information system-
dependent processes, senior leaders/executives must be committed to making risk management a
fundamental mission/business requirement. This top-level, executive commitment ensures that
sufficient resources are available to develop and implement effective, organization-wide risk
management programs. Understanding and addressing risk is a strategic capability and an enabler
of missions and business functions across organizations. Effectively managing information
security risk organization-wide requires the following key elements:
•      Assignment of risk management responsibilities to senior leaders/executives;
•      Ongoing recognition and understanding by senior leaders/executives of the information
       security risks to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the
       Nation arising from the operation and use of information systems;
•      Establishing the organizational tolerance for risk and communicating the risk tolerance
       throughout the organization including guidance on how risk tolerance impacts ongoing
       decision-making activities;8 and
•      Accountability by senior leaders/executives for their risk management decisions and for the
       implementation of effective, organization-wide risk management programs.

    The aggregation of different types of risk across the organization is beyond the scope of this publication.

 The evaluation of residual risk (which changes over time) to determine acceptable risk is dependent on the threshold
set by organizational risk tolerance.
