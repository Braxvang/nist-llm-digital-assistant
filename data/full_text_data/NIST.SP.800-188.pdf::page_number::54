    • Whereas IRBs are required to have “at least one member whose primary concerns
      are in nonscientifc areas” and “at least one member who is not otherwise affliated
      with the institution and who is not part of the immediate family of a person who
      is affliated with the institution,” there are no such requirements for members on a
      DRB.
    • Whereas IRBs give approval for research and then typically receive reports only dur-
      ing an annual review or when a research project terminates, DRBs may be involved
      at multiple points during the process.
    • Whereas approval of an IRB is required before research with human subjects can
      commence, DRBs are typically involved after research has taken place and prior to
      the release of data or other research fndings.
    • Whereas service on an IRB requires knowledge of the Common Rule [165], service
      on a DRB requires knowledge of the Evidence Act [2] and agency-specifc privacy
      rules, as well as a working knowledge of statistics and computation techniques.

3.7.     De-Identifcation and Standards
Agencies can rely on de-identifcation standards to provide standardized terminology, pro-
cedures, and performance criteria for de-identifcation efforts. Agencies can adopt existing
de-identifcation standards or create their own. De-identifcation standards can be prescrip-
tive or risk-based.

3.7.1.    Benefts of Standards
De-identifcation standards assist agencies with the process of de-identifying data prior to
public release. Without standards, data owners may be unwilling to share data, as they may
be unable to assess whether a procedure for de-identifying is suffcient to minimize privacy
risk.
Standards can increase the availability of individuals with appropriate training by iden-
tifying a specifc body of knowledge and practice that training should address. Absent
standards, agencies may forego opportunities to share data. De-identifcation standards can
help practitioners develop a community, as well as certifcation and accreditation processes.
Standards decrease uncertainty and provide data owners and custodians with best practices
to follow. Courts can consider standards as acceptable practices that should generally be
followed. In the event of litigation, an agency can point to the standard and say that it
followed good data practice.

3.7.2.    Prescriptive De-Identifcation Standards
A prescriptive de-identifcation standard specifes an algorithmic procedure that – if fol-
lowed – results in data that are de-identifed to a previously established benchmark. This
