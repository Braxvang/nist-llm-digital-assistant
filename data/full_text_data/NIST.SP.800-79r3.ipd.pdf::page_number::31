      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                  Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                         and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

958   logical resources based on verification of that identity. The DAO’s signature on the authorization
959   letter thus signifies their acceptance of responsibility (i.e., accountability) for the operations of
960   the issuer for their organization as well as other organizations in the federated circle of trust.

961           Authorization Submission Package and Supporting Documentation
962   The authorization submission package documents the results of the assessment phase and
963   provides the DAO with the essential information needed to make a credible, risk-based decision
964   on whether to authorize operation of the issuer. Unless specifically designated otherwise by the
965   DAO, the EIMO SHALL be responsible for the assembly, compilation, and presentation of the
966   authorization submission package. The authorization submission package contains the following
967   documents:
968       •   Operations plan, including standard operating procedures (SOPs) and attachments for all
969           issuing facilities
970       •   [SP800-37] authorization letters
971       •   Assessment report
972       •   Corrective actions plan (CAP), if required
973   The operations plan contains the policies, procedures, and processes for all of the major PIV
974   functional areas. It gives the assessor and DAO a complete picture of the structure, management,
975   and operations of an issuer, including issuing facilities. Appendix D provides templates of what
976   to include in the operations plan. One of the most significant pieces of information contained in
977   the operations plan is the list of issuer controls, which enables the assessor to quickly ascertain
978   how they are implemented and by whom.
979   If certain functions described in the operations plan are outsourced, the operations plan
980   SHOULD reference or point to the external service provider’s operations plan and related
981   documentation, such as support agreements and any contracts. In this manner, the assessor has
982   access to information about the external service provider’s operations without requiring the
983   issuer to duplicate documentation. Upon receiving and reviewing the authorization package and
984   in consultation with the assessor, the DAO decides whether to authorize the operations of the
985   issuer. The authorization decision letter transmits the authorization decision from the DAO to the
986   EIMO and contains the following information:
987       •   Authorization decision
988       •   Supporting rationale for the decision
989       •   Terms and conditions for the authorization, including which issuing facilities are included
990           (i.e., authorization boundary)
