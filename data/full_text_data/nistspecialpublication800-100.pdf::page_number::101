CHAPTER 10                                                          Risk Management


10.2 Risk Mitigation
    The second phase of the risk management process is risk mitigation. Because it
is impractical, if not impossible, to eliminate all risk from a system, risk mitigation
strives to prioritize, evaluate, and implement the appropriate risk-reducing controls
recommended from the risk assessment process based on the guidance provided in
NIST SP 800-53.
    System and organizational managers may use several options to reduce the risk
to a system. These options are risk assumption; risk avoidance; risk limitation; risk
planning, research, and acknowledgement; and risk transference.
    Figure 10-4 illustrates a straightforward strategy that can be used to determine
whether risk mitigation actions are necessary. Working from each risk identified and
analyzed in the first process—risk assessment—managers must then decide whether
the risk is acceptable or unacceptable and, subsequently, whether to implement
additional controls or not to mitigate unacceptable risks. The first decision box in the
figure applies to those threats involving intentional attacks. Natural and
unintentional human errors are not considered in this decision-making scheme
because there are no associated costs to consider, and so the strategy progresses to
the next decision box.




                          Figure 10-4. Risk Mitigation Strategy

    Once the decision has been made on which risks are to be addressed in the risk
mitigation process, a seven-step approach is used to guide the selection of security
controls:
   1.   Prioritize actions;
   2.   Evaluate recommended control options;
   3.   Conduct cost-benefit analyses;
   4.   Select controls;
   5.   Assign responsibility;
   6.   Develop a safeguard implementation plan; and
   7.   Implement selected control(s).
    The process of selecting controls to mitigate identified risks to an acceptable level
is based on the security categorization of the system using the methodology
provided in FIPS 199. The security categorization is used in two ways: (1)
determines which minimum baseline security controls are selected from NIST SP
800-53, and (2) aids in estimating the level of risk posed by a threat/vulnerability
