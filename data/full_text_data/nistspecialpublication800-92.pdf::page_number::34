GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



         Because SHA is a FIPS-approved algorithm and MD5 is not, Federal agencies should use SHA
         instead of MD5 for message digests whenever feasible. 33
Some syslog implementations offer additional features that are not based on RFC 3195. The most
common extra features are as follows:

      Robust Filtering. Original syslog implementations allowed messages to be handled differently
       based on their facility and priority only; no finer-grained filtering was permitted. Some current
       syslog implementations offer more robust filtering capabilities, such as handling messages
       differently based on the host or program that generated a message, or a regular expression
       matching content in the body of a message. Some implementations also allow multiple filters to
       be applied to a single message, which provides more complex filtering capabilities.
      Log Analysis. Originally, syslog servers did not perform any analysis of log data; they simply
       provided a framework for log data to be recorded and transmitted. Administrators could use
       separate add-on programs for analyzing syslog data. Some syslog implementations now have
       limited log analysis capabilities built in, such as the ability to correlate multiple log entries.
      Event Response. Some syslog implementations can initiate actions when certain events are
       detected. Examples of actions include sending SNMP traps, alerting administrators through
       pages or e-mails, and launching a separate program or script. It is also possible to create a new
       syslog message that indicates a certain event was detected.
      Alternative Message Formats. Some syslog implementations can accept data in non-syslog
       formats, such as SNMP traps. This can be helpful for getting security event data from hosts that
       do not support syslog and cannot be modified to do so.
      Log File Encryption. Some syslog implementations can be configured to encrypt rotated log
       files automatically, protecting their confidentiality. This can also be accomplished through the
       use of OS or third-party encryption programs.
      Database Storage for Logs. Some implementations can store log entries in both traditional
       syslog files and a database. Having the log entries in a database format can be very helpful for
       subsequent log analysis.
      Rate Limiting. Some implementations can limit the number of syslog messages or TCP
       connections from a particular source during a certain period of time. This is useful in preventing
       a denial of service for the syslog server and the loss of syslog messages from other sources.
       Because this technique is designed to cause the loss of messages from a source that is
       overwhelming the syslog server, it can cause some log data to be lost during an adverse event that
       generates an unusually large number of messages.
Organizations using syslog implementations based on the original syslog message format and transfer
protocol should consider using syslog implementations that offer stronger protection for confidentiality,
integrity, and availability. Many of these implementations can directly replace existing syslog
implementations. When evaluating syslog replacements, organizations should pay particular attention to
interoperability, because many syslog clients and servers offer features not specified in RFC 3195 or other
standard-related efforts. Also, organizations that use security information and event management
software (as described in Section 3.4) to store or analyze syslog messages should ensure that their syslog
clients and servers are fully compatible and interoperable with the security information and event
management software.
