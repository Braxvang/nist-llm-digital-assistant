          overwhelmed. Therefore, the number of injects selected will vary based on the duration of the
          exercise.
       Message Inject Tracking Form. Message inject tracking forms contain the inject numbers,
        scheduled times for the messages to be injected into the exercise, actual times that the messages
        were injected, summaries of the message, and any comments for the individuals injecting the
        messages. 19
       Controller, Data Collector, and Simulator Books. These books contain all information
        relevant to the exercise staff. Each controller, data collector, and simulator typically receives a
        book the day of the exercise (or the day of the briefing, if deemed appropriate) containing
        information pertinent to their roles during the exercise. The books contain the exercise scenario,
        MSEL, and injects.
       After Action Report. An after action report is developed after the exercise event; it contains
        information based on pre-identified evaluation criteria. Another important aspect of the
        development phase is determining and documenting exercise evaluation criteria that will be used
        by data collectors during the conduct of the event. Evaluation criteria are closely tied to the
        exercise objectives to help data collectors know what type of information to capture during the
        exercise and ultimately document in an after action report. Once evaluation criteria have been
        developed, it is often helpful to create forms or other tools that will aid in the data collection
        process. Such forms instruct data collectors of specific player actions to look for and serve as a
        roadmap that is used in determining whether specific exercise objectives were met, how they
        were met, what improvements may need to be made to the plan that is being exercised, and where
        additional exercises might be necessary. After action reports are discussed in more detail in
        Section 5.5.
Sample functional exercise documentation is located in Appendix B.

In addition to the members of the design team discussed previously, functional exercise material
development might require assistance from other individuals. For example, a trusted agent who has
detailed knowledge of the IT plan and the associated procedures could aid in the development of the
scenario, MSEL, and message injects to ensure accuracy. As described in Section 4.3, it is often most
effective to have a short, concise scenario so that participants do not focus on critiquing the scenario
itself.

5.4     Conduct the Functional Exercise

Functional exercises are typically conducted in real or near-real time and prompt participants to carry out
their roles and responsibilities as realistically as possible. A functional exercise is often initiated by a
telephone call or other appropriate means, alerting selected personnel of the implementation or activation
of a specific IT plan. This alert prompts further notification of all personnel who would be notified via
the means identified in the plan. Once the notification process is completed, participants are expected to
carry out operational or decision-making activities documented in the plan. Depending on the scope of
the exercise, activities could range from implementing notification procedures to deploying to an alternate
site to mobilizing resources, including staff and equipment. The exercise scope dictates whether
deployments or mobilizations are simulated or if they actually occur. Regardless of location, the
participants should carry out the activities as they would according to the plan being exercised.
Participants should be informed of any exercise artificialities during the participant briefing.

      Message injects and message inject tracking forms are sometimes included within the MSEL documentation.
