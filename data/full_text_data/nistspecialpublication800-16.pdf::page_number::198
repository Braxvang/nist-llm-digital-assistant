Information Technology Security Training Requirements


IT System      —a   collection of computing and/or communications components and other
resources that support one or more functional objectives of an organization. IT system resources
include any FT component plus associated manual procedures and physical facilities that are used
in the acquisition, storage, manipulation, display, and/or movement of data or to direct or
monitor operating procedures.        An IT system may consist of one or more computers and their
related resources of any size.     The resources that comprise a system do not have to be physically
connected.


Job Function       —   the roles and responsibilities specific to an individual, not a job title.


Knowledge Levels           — verbs   that describe actions an individual should be capable of
performing on the job after completion of the training associated with the cell. The verbs are
identified for three training levels: Beginning, Intermediate, and Advanced.


Laws and Regulations           —   federal government-wide and organization-specific laws,
regulations, policies, guidelines, standards, and procedures mandating requirements for the
management and protection of information technology resources.

Learning      — knowledge gained by study       (in classes or through individual research and

investigation).


Learning Continuum           —a    representation in which a the common characteristic of learning is
presented as a series of variations from awareness through training to education.


Learning Objective         —   a link between the verbs from the "knowledge levels" section to the
"Behavioral Outcomes" by providing examples of the activities an individual should be capable
of doing after successful completion of training associated with the cell. Learning Objectives
recognize that training must be provided at Beginning, Intermediate, and Advanced levels.


Likert Scale      — an evaluation    tool that is usually from one to five (one being very good; five
being not good, or vice versa), designed to allow an evaluator to prioritize the results of the
evaluation.


Management Controls            — management      controls are actions taken to manage the
development, maintenance, and use of the system, including system-specific policies, procedures,
and rules of behavior, individual roles and responsibilities, individual accountability and
personnel security decisions.


Minimum Level of Protection             —   the reduction in the Total Risk that results from the impact
of in-place safeguards. (See Total Risk, Acceptable Risk, and Residual Risk.)


Operational Controls         —   the day-to-day procedures and mechanisms used to protect
operational systems and applications. Operational controls affect the system and application
environment.
