AC-20     USE OF EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS

          Control: The organization establishes terms and conditions for authorized individuals to: (i) access
          the information system from an external information system; and (ii) process, store, and/or
          transmit organization-controlled information using an external information system.
          Supplemental Guidance: External information systems are information systems or components of
          information systems that are outside of the accreditation boundary established by the organization
          and for which the organization typically has no direct control over the application of required
          security controls or the assessment of security control effectiveness. External information systems
          include, but are not limited to, personally owned information systems (e.g., computers, cellular
          telephones, or personal digital assistants); privately owned computing and communications
          devices resident in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, convention centers, or airports);
          information systems owned or controlled by nonfederal governmental organizations; and federal
          information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct control of the
          organization.
          Authorized individuals include organizational personnel, contractors, or any other individuals with
          authorized access to the organizational information system. This control does not apply to the use
          of external information systems to access organizational information systems and information that
          are intended for public access (e.g., individuals accessing federal information through public
          interfaces to organizational information systems). The organization establishes terms and
          conditions for the use of external information systems in accordance with organizational security
          policies and procedures. The terms and conditions address as a minimum; (i) the types of
          applications that can be accessed on the organizational information system from the external
          information system; and (ii) the maximum FIPS 199 security category of information that can be
          processed, stored, and transmitted on the external information system.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization prohibits authorized individuals from using an external information system to
                access the information system or to process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information
                except in situations where the organization: (i) can verify the employment of required security
                controls on the external system as specified in the organizationâ€™s information security policy and
                system security plan; or (ii) has approved information system connection or processing
                agreements with the organizational entity hosting the external information system.
