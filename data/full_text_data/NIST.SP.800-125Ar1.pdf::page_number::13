identifier to each VM. The nature of threats to the hypervisor from rogue or compromised VMs can manifest
in the following ways:

Note that each threat is identified by the symbol HYP-T#, where HYP stands for hypervisor, T stands for
threat, and # stands for the sequence number.

•   Breach of Process Isolation - VM Escape (HYP-T1): Major threats to any hypervisor come from rogue
    VMs. Rogue VMs manage to subvert the isolation function provided by the VMM/hypervisor to hardware
    resources such as memory pages and storage devices. In other words, the rogue or compromised VMs
    may access areas of memory belonging to the hypervisor or other VMs and storage devices they are not
    authorized to access. Possible reasons for this threat include (a) hypervisor design vulnerabilities or (b)
    malicious or vulnerable device drivers. Potential downstream impacts of a rogue VM taking control of the
    hypervisor include the installation of rootkits or attacks on other VMs on the same virtualized host.

•   Breach of Network Isolation (HYP-T2): Potential threats to isolation include attacks such as IP or MAC
    address spoofing by a rogue VM and Traffic Snooping, or the interception of virtual network traffic,
    intended for a VM on the same virtual network segment. The impact of the subversion of these network
    controls is loss of confidentiality. Some VMs will be viewing information for which they are not
    authorized.

•   Denial of Service (HYP-T3): Misconfigured or malicious VMs may be consuming a disproportionately
    high percentage of host resources, resulting in denial-of-service to other VMs on the hypervisor host.


2.2 Potential Threats to Hypervisor Baseline Functions

In this section, the tasks in each of the five hypervisor baseline functions (with the exception of HY-BF3) are
examined, and the threats to the secure execution of those tasks are analyzed by relating to the causes identified
in the previous section.

2.2.1   Potential Threats to HY-BF1

The primary threat to hypervisor’s HY-BF1 function (VM Process Isolation) is breach of process isolation
(HYP-T1). As mentioned in section 2.1, one of the causes for this threat is hypervisor design vulnerability.
Some potential design vulnerabilities that pertain to this threat are discussed here with an explanation of the
context under which they may manifest. Each vulnerability is identified by the symbol HYP-DV#, where
HYP stands for hypervisor, DV stands for design vulnerability, and # stands for the sequence number.

•   Virtual Machine Control Structure (HYP-DV1): To properly schedule an individual VM’s tasks (i.e.,
    since each guest VM is allocated a set of virtual CPUs(vCPUs) they are called vCPU tasks), the register
    states must be handled appropriately. To enable the saving and loading of the state of each vCPU, the
    hypervisor uses a data structure called Virtual Machine Control Structure (VMCS). Faulty implementation
    of this data structure has been known to cause hypervisor memory leaks.

•   Handling Sensitive Instructions (HY-DV2): On hardware platforms that do not provide assistance for
    virtualization, there should be a software mechanism to discover sensitive or critical instructions, send
    them to the VMM (hypervisor), and replace them with safer instructions using techniques such as binary
    translation before executing them on the hardware. Any error in not trapping the critical instructions or
    faulty translation may have security implications in the form of a guest OS being allowed to execute
    privileged instructions.
