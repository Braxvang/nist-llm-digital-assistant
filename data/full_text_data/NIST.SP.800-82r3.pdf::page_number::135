6.2.6. Protective Technology (PR.PT)
Technical mechanisms assist organizations with protecting the devices and information within
their environments. These technologies alone may not be sufficient to sustain security
capabilities as threats evolve and change. As such, organizations should manage the technical
solutions that secure the organizational assets in a manner consistent with policies, procedures,
and agreements.

6.2.6.1.       Logging (PR.PT-1)
Logging enables an organization to capture events that occur within its systems and networks.
Events can be generated by many different systems, including OSs, workstations, servers,
networking devices, cybersecurity software, and applications.
Supplemental guidance can be found in the following document:

            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Capturing log events is critical to maintaining situational awareness of
            the OT system. Typical events include maintenance functions (e.g.,
            access control, configuration changes, backup and restore), OS functions,
            and application (i.e., process) events. The specific types of events
            available for logging will vary between OT devices and should be
            chosen based on the capabilities of the device and the desired events to
            be captured.
            To support log correlation, each log entry should identify the device that
            generated the event, the timestamp of the event, and the user or system
            account that generated the event. In general, each log entry should also
            include where the event occurred, the type of event, when the event
            occurred, the source of the event, the identity of any users or system
            accounts related to the event, and the outcome of the event.
            Correlating events across multiple OT devices can be difficult if the
            event timestamps generated by the devices were not informed by a
            shared time source. The internal clocks of each device should be
            synchronized with a primary clock to support event correlation between
            devices. Log entries should also produce a consistent timestamp format
            (e.g., time zone format, string format, daylight saving).
            The collection and event forwarding functions may impact the
            performance of the OT device. Depending on the frequency of events
            being logged, the log size may grow quickly and result in increasing
            space utilization. Disk space and memory are limited on most OT
            devices, so adequate storage should be locally or remotely provided to
            reduce the likelihood of exceeding the device capacity, which could
            ultimately result in the loss of logging capability. Transferring logs from
            the OT devices to alternate storage should be considered.
