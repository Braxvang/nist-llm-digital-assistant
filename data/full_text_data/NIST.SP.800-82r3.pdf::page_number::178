configuration control
Process for controlling modifications to hardware, firmware, software, and documentation to ensure the information
system is protected against improper modifications before, during, and after system implementation. [CNSS4009]
(adapted)

control
The part of the OT system used to monitor and control the physical process. This includes all control servers, field
devices, actuators, sensors, and their supporting communication systems.

control algorithm
A mathematical representation of the control action to be performed. [ISADICT]

control center
An equipment structure or group of structures from which a process is measured, controlled, and/or monitored.
[ANSI-ISA-51-1]

control loop
A control loop consists of sensors for measurement, controller hardware (e.g., PLCs), actuators (e.g., control valves,
breakers, switches, and motors), and the communication of variables. Controlled variables are transmitted to the
controller from the sensors. The controller interprets the signals and generates corresponding manipulated variables
based on set points, which it transmits to the actuators. Process changes from disturbances result in new sensor
signals, identifying the state of the process, to again be transmitted to the controller.

control network
Those networks of an enterprise typically connected to equipment that controls physical processes and that is time or
safety critical. The control network can be subdivided into zones, and there can be multiple separate control
networks within one enterprise and site.

control server
A controller that also acts as a server that hosts the control software that communicates with lower-level control
devices, such as remote terminal units (RTUs) and programmable logic controllers (PLCs), over an OT network. In
a SCADA system, this is often called a SCADA server, MTU, or supervisory controller.

control system
A system in which deliberate guidance or manipulation is used to achieve a prescribed value for a variable. Control
systems include SCADA, DCS, PLCs, BAS, and other types of OT measurement and control systems.

controlled variable
The variable that the control system attempts to keep at the set point value. The set point may be constant or
variable. [ISADICT]

controller
A device or program that operates automatically to regulate a controlled variable. [ANSI-ISA-51-1]

cycle time
The time, usually expressed in seconds, for a controller to complete one control loop where sensor signals are read
into memory, control algorithms are executed, and corresponding control signals are transmitted to actuators that
create changes to the process resulting in new sensor signals. [ISADICT]

data diode
A network appliance or device that allows data to travel only in one direction. Also referred to as a unidirectional
gateway, deterministic one-way boundary device, or unidirectional network.

data historian
A centralized database that supports data analysis using statistical process control techniques.

database
A repository of information that usually holds plant-wide information including process data, recipes, personnel
data, and financial data. [IR6859] (adapted)
