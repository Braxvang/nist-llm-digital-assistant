threats, to sophisticated terrorist groups/organized criminal enterprises seeking to exfiltrate
sensitive information, to a nation state’s military attempting to destroy or disrupt critical missions
by attacking organizational information systems.31 The strategic investments required to address
the risk from more traditional adversaries (e.g., hackers conducting small-group activities with
limited capabilities) are considerably different than the investments required to address the risk
associated with advanced persistent threats consistent with more advanced adversaries (e.g.,
nation states or terrorist groups with highly sophisticated levels of expertise and resources that
seek to establish permanent footholds in organizations for purposes of impeding aspects of the
organizational missions). To address less sophisticated threats, organizations can focus their
efforts at Tier 3—investing to ensure that needed safeguards and countermeasures (e.g., security
controls, security services, and technologies) are obtained, implemented correctly, operating as
intended, and producing the desired effect with regard to meeting information security policies
and addressing known vulnerabilities. In addition to these basic investments, organizations can
also invest in continuous monitoring processes to ensure that the acquired security controls,
services, and technologies are operating effectively throughout the system development life cycle.

When organizations need to address advanced persistent threats, it is likely that adequately
addressing related risks at Tier 3 is not feasible because necessary security solutions are not
currently available in the commercial marketplace. In those instances, organizations must
purposefully invest beyond Tier 3 for significant response capabilities at Tier 2, and to some
extent at Tier 1. At Tier 3, the nature of investment is likely to change from implementation of
existing solutions to an added strategic focus on investing in leading-edge information security
technologies (essentially experimenting with innovative security solutions/technologies and being
an early adopter) or investing in information security research and development efforts to address
specific technology gaps.32 Information security investments to address advanced persistent
threats may require expenditures over the course of several years, as new security solutions and
technologies transition from research to development to full deployment. The long-term view of
strategic investing in the risk response needs for organizations can help to reduce the continuing
focus on near-term vulnerabilities discovered in information systems—vulnerabilities that exist
due to the complexity of the information technology products and systems and the inherent
weaknesses in those products and systems.

Limitations on Strategic Investments
The ability of organizations to provide strategic information security investments is limited.
Where the desired strategic investment funding or strategic resources33 are not available to
address specific needs, organizations may be forced to make compromises. For example,
organizations might extend the time frame required for strategic information security objectives
to be accomplished. Alternatively, organizations might prioritize risk management investments,
opting to provide resources (financial or otherwise) to address some critical strategic needs
sooner than other less critical needs. All investment decisions require organizations to prioritize
risks and to assess the potential impacts associated with alternative courses of action.


31
  The threats described above are a subset of the overarching threat space that also includes errors of omission and
commission, natural disasters, and accidents.
32
   This investment strategy is a change from vulnerability and patch management to a longer-term strategy addressing
information security gaps such as the lack of information technology products with the trustworthiness necessary to
achieve information system resilience in the face of advanced persistent threats.
33
   In some instances, the limitations may not be financial in nature, but limitations in the number of individuals with the
appropriate skills/expertise or limitations regarding the state of technology.
