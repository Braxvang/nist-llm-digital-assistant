4         Using Timestamps from a Trusted Timestamp Authority
One method of obtaining assurance of the time of digital signature generation is by the
use of a trusted timestamp authority (TTA) that is trusted by both the signatory and the
verifier. The discussions in this section are intended to assist the reader in determining
exactly what assurances are obtained using different digital signature-based timestamp
schemes.

4.1       Notation
A trusted timestamp authority (TTA) is an entity that is trusted to produce timestamp
packets. A timestamp packet (TSP) is transmitted by a TTA and contains:
      •   A digital signature (timestamp_signatureTTA) that is generated using the TTA’s
          private key, and
      •   The timestamped_data upon which the digital signature is generated.
The timestamped_data includes a timestamp — an accurate, unambiguous representation
of the time of generation of the accompanying timestamp_signatureTTA.
The following notation will be used in this discussion. Note that the commas are used to
indicate a list of data, not to indicate the order or format of that data.
      1. TSP = timestamp_packet = timestamped_data, timestamp_signatureTTA
          where the TSP contains both timestamped_data and a timestamp_signatureTTA.
      2. timestamp_signatureTTA = SIGTTA (timestamped_data)
          where “SIGTTA” is a digital signature operation on the timestamped_data using
          the TTA’s private digital signature key. This private key shall only be used for
          the generation of digital signatures on timestamped_data.
      3. timestamped_data = user_supplied_info, TTA_supplied_info, timestamp,
          where
             a. user_supplied_info is information that is provided by an entity when
                requesting a timestamp from the TTA; the user_supplied_info may, in
                fact, be Null. If provided, the information is used by the TTA during
                timestamp_signatureTTA generation, but need not be transmitted in the
                timestamp packet returned to the requestor. However, this information
                must be available to entities that will verify timestamp_signatureTTA.
             b. TTA_supplied_info is additional information that is used by the TTA
                during timestamp_signatureTTA generation; the TTA_supplied_info may, in
                fact, be Null. All or part of this information may be omitted from the
                timestamp packet transmitted by the TTA if the omitted portion(s) can be
                recreated and used by the entities that will verify timestamp_signatureTTA.
             c. timestamp contains the time and (possibly) other information.
