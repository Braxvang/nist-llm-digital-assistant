AC-19     ACCESS CONTROL FOR PORTABLE AND MOBILE DEVICES

          Control: The organization: (i) establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for
          organization-controlled portable and mobile devices; and (ii) authorizes, monitors, and controls
          device access to organizational information systems.
          Supplemental Guidance: Portable and mobile devices (e.g., notebook computers, personal digital
          assistants, cellular telephones, and other computing and communications devices with network
          connectivity and the capability of periodically operating in different physical locations) are only
          allowed access to organizational information systems in accordance with organizational security
          policies and procedures. Security policies and procedures include device identification and
          authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software (e.g., malicious code detection,
          firewall), configuration management, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus
          protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary
          operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling
          unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared). Protecting information residing on portable and
          mobile devices (e.g., employing cryptographic mechanisms to provide confidentiality and integrity
          protections during storage and while in transit when outside of controlled areas) is covered in the
          media protection family. Related security controls: MP-4, MP-5.
          Control Enhancements: None.
