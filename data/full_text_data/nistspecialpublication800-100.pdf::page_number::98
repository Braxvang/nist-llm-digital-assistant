CHAPTER 10                                                         Risk Management


10.1.4.2 Likelihood Determination
    Likelihood determination considers a threat source’s motivation and capability to
exploit a vulnerability, the nature of the vulnerability, the existence of security
controls, and the effectiveness of mitigating security controls. Likelihood ratings are
described in the qualitative terms of high, moderate, and low, and are used to
describe how likely is a successful exploitation of a vulnerability by a given threat.
For example, if a threat is highly motivated and sufficiently capable, and controls
implemented to protect the vulnerability are ineffective, then it is highly likely that
the attack would be successful. In this scenario, the appropriate likelihood rating
would be high. The likelihood ratings of moderate and low are similarly defined to
successively lesser degrees.

10.1.4.3 Impact Analysis
     The third factor used in determining the level of risk to a system is impact. A
proper overall impact analysis considers the following factors: impact to the systems,
data, and the organization’s mission. Additionally, this analysis should also consider
the criticality and sensitivity of the system and its data. FIPS 199 provides a
consistent, focused process for categorizing a system’s criticality and sensitivity for
the three security domains of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Using FIPS
199 to determine a security category and applying an assessment of the system’s
and organization’s mission using tools such as mission-impact reports, asset
criticality assessment reports, and business impact analyses results in a rating
describing the estimated impact to the system and organization should a threat
successfully exploit a vulnerability. While impact can be described using either a
quantitative or qualitative approach, in the context of IT systems and data, impact is
generally described in qualitative terms. As with the ratings used to describe
likelihood, impact levels are described using the terms of high, moderate, and low.
NIST SP 800-30 provides definitions for the impact ratings of low, medium, and high.

10.1.4.4 Risk Determination
    Once the ratings for likelihood and impact have been determined through
appropriate analyses, the level of risk to the system and the organization can be
derived by multiplying the ratings assigned for threat likelihood (e.g., probability)
and threat impact. Table 10-1 shows how to calculate an overall risk rating using
inputs from the threat likelihood and impact categories using a 3X3 matrix.
Depending on the requirements of the system and the granularity of risk assessment
desired, 4x4 and 5x5 matrices may be used instead. The latter can include a Very
Low/Very High threat likelihood and a Very Low/Very High threat impact to generate
a Very Low/Very High risk level. A Very High risk level may require possible system
shutdown or stopping all information system integration and testing effort.
