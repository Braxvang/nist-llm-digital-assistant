A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



D.9            Micali-Schnorr Generator (MSG)

The input parameters to the MSG are not fixed in code. They are variable parameters, which are time
dependent. The four required parameters are two primes, p and q, an integer e, and the seed x0.

Input Parameters:

Two primes p and q. A parameter e, selected such that 1 < e < φ = (p-1)(q-1), gcd(e, φ) = 1, and 80e < N
= floor(lg n + 1). A random sequence x0 (the seed) consisting of r (a function of e and n) bits is chosen.
The parameters e, p, q, and x0 are not fixed in code; thus, the user will not be able to reconstruct the
original sequence because these values will vary (i.e., they are dependent on the system time). The input
parameters have been fixed so the code will reproduce the same results.
