Malware, also known as malicious code, refers to a program that is covertly inserted into another program
with the intent to destroy data, run destructive or intrusive programs, or otherwise compromise the
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim’s data, applications, or operating system. Malware is
the most common external threat to most hosts, causing widespread damage and disruption and
necessitating extensive recovery efforts within most organizations. This publication provides
recommendations for improving an organization’s malware incident prevention measures. It also gives
extensive recommendations for enhancing an organization’s existing incident response capability so that
it is better prepared to handle malware incidents, particularly widespread ones.
