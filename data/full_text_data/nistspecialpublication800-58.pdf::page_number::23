NIST SP 800-58                                              Voice Over IP Security
_____________________________________________________________________________

      across the Internet is more significant. Packets sent from a user’s home computer
      to an online retailer may pass through 15-20 systems that are not under the control
      of the user’s ISP or the retailer. Because digits are transmitted using a standard
      for transmitting digits out of band as special messages, anyone with access to
      these systems could install software that scans packets for credit card information.
      For this reason, online retailers use encryption software to protect a user’s
      information and credit card number. So it stands to reason that if we are to
      transmit voice over the Internet Protocol, and specifically across the Internet,
      similar security measures must be applied.

      The current Internet architecture does not provide the same physical wire security
      as the phone lines. The key to securing VOIP is to use the security mechanisms
      like those deployed in data networks (firewalls, encryption, etc.) to emulate the
      security level currently enjoyed by PSTN network users. This publication
      investigates the attacks and defenses relevant to VOIP and explores ways to
      provide appropriate levels of security for VOIP networks at reasonable cost.
