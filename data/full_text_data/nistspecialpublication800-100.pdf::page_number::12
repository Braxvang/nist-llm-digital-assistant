those funds needed to secure them. Agencies must establish clear reporting
requirements that meet legislative requirements set by Congress and must also
provide Congress with the necessary information and estimates required for the
congressional budget process. OMB assists the President in overseeing the
preparation of the federal budget and supervises its administration by the executive
branch agencies. OMB provides further guidance to the agencies on implementing
legislative information requirements in the form of circulars and memoranda. GAO
also provides oversight of agency information security activities as a part of its
mission “to support the Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities and to
help improve the performance and ensure the accountability of the federal
government for the benefit of the American people.” 1 GAO reviews agency
implementation of legislative and regulatory requirements and reports to Congress
and the American public on its findings.
    At a minimum, information security governance in a federal department or
agency must meet the requirements as they are detailed in applicable legislation,
regulations, and directives. Furthermore, agencies can benefit from identifying
overall good governance practices for establishing strong management and
oversight. Agencies should tailor their information security governance practices to
their organization’s own missions, operations, and needs.
   The following are a few key legislative acts that define overall federal agency
governance requirements:
      • The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 establishes the
        foundation for budget decision making to achieve strategic goals in order to
        meet agency mission objectives.
      • The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995 requires agencies to perform their
        information resource management activities in an efficient, effective, and
        economical manner.
      • The Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) of 1996 requires
        accountability of financial and program managers for financial results of actions
        taken, control over the federal government's financial resources, and protection
        of federal assets.
      • The Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) of 1982 requires ongoing
        evaluations and reports from each executive on the adequacy of administrative
        control for internal accounting systems.
      • The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 requires agencies to use a disciplined capital
        planning and investment control (CPIC) process to acquire, use, maintain, and
        dispose of IT resources, and establishes a role of chief information officer (CIO)
        within each federal agency.
      • The E-Government Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-347) promotes better use of
        the Internet and other IT resources to improve government services for citizens
        and internal government operations, and provide opportunities for citizen
        participation in government. The Act also requires agencies to:
        – Comply with FISMA, included as Title III of the E-Government Act;
        – Support governmentwide e-government initiatives;
        – Leverage cross-agency opportunities to further e-government through the
          Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) initiative; and
