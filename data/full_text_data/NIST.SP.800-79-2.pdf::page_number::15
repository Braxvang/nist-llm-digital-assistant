Special Publication 800-79-2                                               Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                                            and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



2. PREPARATION FOR ASSESSMENT AND AUTHORIZATION

This chapter presents the fundamentals of an authorization of a PIV Card Issuer (PCI) and a
Derived PIV Credential Issuer (DPCI). It includes: (i) definitions of an issuer and issuing
facility; (ii) outsourcing issuer services or functions; (iii) the differences between an assessment
and authorization; (iv) authorization boundaries of an issuer; (v) roles and responsibilities; (vi)
the relationship between authorization under [SP 800-37-1] and SP 800-79-2; (vii) preparing for
the assessment; (viii) types of authorization decisions; (xi) use of risk in the authorization
decision; and (x) the contents of the authorization package.

2.1 Issuer

At the highest level, an issuer provides a full set of functions required to produce, issue, and
maintain PIV Cards or Derived PIV Credentials for an organization. A PCI or DPCI is
considered operational if all relevant roles and responsibilities have been defined and appointed;
suitable policies and compliant procedures have been implemented for all relevant PIV
processes,5 including sponsorship, identity proofing/registration, adjudication, card/token
production, activation/issuance, and maintenance; and information system components that are
utilized for performing the above-mentioned functions (processes) have been assessed and
shown to meet all technical and operational requirements prescribed in FIPS 201-2 and related
documents.

In order to comply with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 ([HSPD-12]), an
organization must first establish an issuer, to issue PIV Cards or Derived PIV Credentials, which
conforms to and satisfies the requirements of FIPS 201-2 and related documents. The issuer must
then be authorized (i.e., using the guidelines specified in this document). An organization has
certain flexibility in implementing its issuance functions. It may outsource some of the required
processes or establish multiple units for fulfilling these processes. Regardless of its structure, the
organization is responsible for the management and oversight and maintains full responsibility
for its functions as an issuer as required in [HSPD-12].

The organization must completely describe its PIV Card and/or Derived PIV Credential issuance
functions in an operations plan. This comprehensive document incorporates all the information
about the issuer that is needed for any independent party to review and assess the capability and
reliability of its operations. An operations plan includes a description of the structure of the
issuer, its facilities, any external service providers, the roles and responsibilities, policies and
procedures which govern its operations, and a description of how requirements of FIPS 201-2 are
being met. A template for an operations plan is provided in Appendix D.

2.2 Issuing Facilities

An issuing facility is a physical site or location–including all equipment, staff, and
documentation–that is responsible for carrying out one or more of the following PIV functions:
(i) identity proofing/registration; (ii) card/token6 production; (iii) activation/issuance; and (iv)
5
    Note: Some of the processes may not apply to Derived PIV Credentials Issuers.

    When the term token is used within this document it is used to refer to the various Derived PIV Credential tokens detailed in
    [SP800-157].
