       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                                  Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1809   Description: When employing physical facial image comparison performed by CSP
1810   operators, human biases and inconsistencies in making facial comparisons may
1811   result in false non-matches.
1812   Possible mitigations include:
1813      1. Defining policy and procedures aimed at reducing/eliminating the inequitable
1814         treatment of applicants by CSP operators/agents
1815      2. Rigorously training and certifying of operators
1816      3. Conducting ongoing quality monitoring and taking corrective actions when biases,
1817         or inequitable treatments or outcomes, are identified

1818   10.4. Equity and User Experience
1819   The Usability Considerations section of this document (Sec. 9) provides CSPs with
1820   guidance on how to provide applicants with a smooth, positive identity proofing
1821   experience. In addition to the specific considerations provided in Sec. 9, this section
1822   provides CSPs with additional considerations when considering the equity of their user
1823   experience.
1824   Description: Lack of access to needed technology (e.g. connected mobile device or
1825   computer), or difficulties in using required technologies, unduly burdens some user
1826   groups.
1827   Possible mitigations include:
1828      1. Allowing the use of helpers who assist applicants, who are otherwise able to meet
1829         the identity proofing requirements, in the use of the required technologies and
1830         activities
1831      2. Allowing the use of publicly-available devices (e.g., computers or tablets) and
1832         providing online help resources for completing the identity proofing process on a
1833         non-applicant-owned computer or device
1834      3. Providing in-person proofing options
1835   Description: The remote or in-person identity proofing process presents challenges
1836   for persons with disabilities.
1837   Possible mitigations for remote identity proofing include:
1838      1. Providing Trusted Referees (Sec. 5.1.9.1) who are trained to communicate and
1839         assist people with a variety of needs or disabilities (e.g., fluent in sign language)
1840      2. Allowing for the use of Applicant References (Sec. 5.1.9.2)
1841      3. Supporting the use of accessibility and other technologies, such as audible
1842         instructions, screen readers and voice recognition technologies
