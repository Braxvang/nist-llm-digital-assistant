beneficiary of the service being provided or supported. The BRM establishes 26 direct services
and delivery support lines of business with 98 associated information types (reference Table 4).
Two additional information types were included to address Executive Functions of the Executive
Office of the President and Trade Law Enforcement. These additions are identified by italics in
