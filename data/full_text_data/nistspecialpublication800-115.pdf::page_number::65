Appendix A—Live CD Distributions for Security Testing

Live distribution CDs focused on security testing are available to the public at no charge, and provide
security testers with a live distribution OS that contains tools for security testing. 39 The OS distribution is
loaded onto a CD-ROM, Universal Serial Bus (USB) drive, or other peripheral device. It is not installed
onto a system, but is run directly from the device on which it is loaded—hence its designation as a “live”
distribution. Two such distributions are BackTrack and Knoppix Security Tool Distribution (STD).

BackTrack 40 features a collection of over 300 security tools for network discovery, scanning and sniffing,
password cracking, remote access testing, Bluetooth testing, computer forensics, and penetration testing.
It offers user modularity, meaning that the user can customize distribution to include personal scripts or
additional tools. BackTrack also includes tools to analyze Voice over Internet (VoIP) protocols such as
the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP); tools such as Cisco Global Exploiter (CGE) and Cisco Torch that
specifically target Cisco systems; and Metasploit, a vulnerability assessment tool. Recognizing the
growing importance of application security testing, it also includes tools such as Peach, Fuzzer, and the
Java tool, Paros Proxy. Table A-1 provides a sample of the tools available in BackTrack. 41

       Such toolkits do not necessarily include all the tools that would be needed for a particular test—in many cases, toolkits will
       need to be supplemented with additional tools.

       BackTrack is derived from two separate Linux live security-based distributions, WHAX and the Auditor Security
       Collection. Both were popular for their abundance of security tools and ease of use. Shortly after the creators of
       each distribution began to collaborate, they released the first non-beta version, renamed BackTrack, in May 2006.
       BackTrack quickly became and remains a favorite toolset among security professionals. BackTrack 3.0 is the version
       referenced for this publication.

       Many of the tools listed in Tables A-1 and A-2 could be listed for additional techniques, but for brevity they are not.
