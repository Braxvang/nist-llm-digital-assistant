   limited to) ongoing security training, Denial of Service and Malicious Code
   protection activities, Intrusion Detection monitoring, Log File reviews, etc. Once
   this is completed agencies should look at the remaining controls that have not
   been tested for that year and make a decision on further annual testing based on
   risk, importance of control and date of last test.

Q. What factors should be considered when using an automated system
   assessment reporting tool?
A. Automated tools can be used to support the assessment process and provide for
   easier roll-up of data for internal or external reporting. Factors to consider in
   using automated tools include:
   • Ascertaining the completeness of tool functionality in terms of supporting all
     components listed in NIST SP 800-53A;
   • Determining who will have access to the tools, including specific roles and
     responsibilities;
   • Ensuring that the system processing the tool is secure and is certified and
     accredited;
   • Providing adequate training for those using the tool(s); and
   • Establishing technical support capability.

Q. What key security-related activities should be completed before a system
   is assessed?
A. Before a system is assessed, there are key security-related activities that should
   be completed. An inventory of all systems should be conducted, and then all
   systems should be categorized according to their impact on the agency’s mission.
   A determination must then be made as to the boundaries of the system, keeping
   in mind the impact of the information stored within, processed by, or transmitted
   by the system(s). A completed GSS or MA security plan, which is required under
   OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, should describe the boundaries of the system,
   the impact level of the data, and the security controls in place or planned for the
   system.
Q. Can the System Reporting Form be customized by the organization?
A. Yes. The System Reporting Form may be customized by the organization. An
   organization can add more security controls to those listed for each control
   family, require more descriptive information, and even pre-mark certain security
   controls if applicable. Additional columns may be added to reflect the status of
   the control, e.g., planned action date or location of documentation. The System
   Reporting Form should not have security controls removed or modified to reduce
   the effectiveness of the control.
