727   3.3.2. GENERATE ASYMMETRIC KEY PAIR Card Command
728   The GENERATE ASYMMETRIC KEY PAIR card command initiates the generation and
729   storage of the reference data of an asymmetric key pair (i.e., a public key and a private key) in
730   the card. The public key of the generated key pair is returned as the response to the command. If
731   there is reference data currently associated with the key reference, it is replaced in full by the
732   generated data.
