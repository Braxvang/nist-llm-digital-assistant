                       Measure 2: Vulnerability Management (program-level)
              Field                                                  Data
     Measure ID        Vulnerability Measure 1
     Goal              •   Strategic Goal: Ensure an environment of comprehensive security and accountability
                           for personnel, facilities, and products.
                       •   Information Security Goal: Ensure all vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated.
     Measure           Percentage (%) of high 13 vulnerabilities mitigated within organizationally defined time
                       periods after discovery
                       NIST SP 800-53 Controls: RA-5; Vulnerability Scanning
     Measure Type      Effectiveness/Efficiency
     Formula           (Number of high vulnerabilities identified and mitigated within targeted time frame
                       during the time period /number of high vulnerabilities identified within the time period)
                       *100
     Target            This should be a high percentage defined by the organization.
     Implementation    1. Number of high vulnerabilities identified across the enterprise during the time period
     Evidence          (RA-5)? _____


                       2. Number of high vulnerabilities mitigated across the enterprise during the time period
                       (RA-5)? _____

     Frequency         Collection Frequency: Organization-defined (example: quarterly)
