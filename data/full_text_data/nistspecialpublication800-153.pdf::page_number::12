that their traffic does not traverse the organization’s internal networks. For external WLANs that do need
internal network access, WLAN client devices should be allowed access only to the necessary hosts or
subnets using only the required protocols.

Another architectural issue mentioned in the WLAN reference architecture document and discussed in
more detail in [GAO-11-43] is dual connected client devices. The term “dual connected” generally refers
to a device that is connected to both a wired network and a WLAN at the same time. The primary concern
with dual connected configurations is that an attacker may be able to gain unauthorized wireless access to
the client device and then use it to attack resources on the wired network. Essentially this is allowing an
attacker to exploit a lower-security network in order to gain access to a higher-security network. One
possible scenario is an attacker tunneling traffic from the higher-security network to the lower-security
network through the client device instead of following the intended network architecture, and thus
avoiding network-based security controls intended for the higher-security network. Dual connected
configurations also generally violate the principle of disabling unneeded network services to reduce attack
surface; if the device is already connected to a wired network access, WLAN access is usually redundant.

Organizations should not only consider simultaneous wired network and WLAN use, but other forms of
dual connectedness involving their WLAN client devices. With the increasing variety and popularity of
wireless networking technologies, it is common today for devices to be connected to multiple wireless
networks simultaneously. For example, most smartphones can use cell phone networks, WLANs, and
Bluetooth networks simultaneously, while they are also connected to wired laptops/desktops (and
possibly their wired networks) through a cabled connection (e.g., USB). It is also increasingly common
for laptops to have multiple wireless interfaces, such as both WLAN and WiMAX interfaces, or to be
configured to accept removable media-based WLAN interfaces. A single laptop with multiple WLAN
interfaces could have simultaneous connections to multiple WLANs, such as an organization WLAN and
an external WLAN.

Organizations should assess the risk of the possible combinations of network technologies for their
WLAN client devices and determine how those risks should be mitigated. This does not mean that all
forms of dual connectedness should automatically be prohibited; examples of use cases that are often
permitted include a smartphone attaching to both a WLAN and a Bluetooth-networked earbud
simultaneously, and a laptop attaching to both a WLAN and a Bluetooth-networked keyboard and mouse
simultaneously. However, the security of such use cases is largely dependent on the security of all of the
networks. If one or more of the networks cannot have its risk mitigated to an acceptable level, then dual
connections involving that network may pose too much risk to the organization and may need to be
prohibited. The primary risk-related issue to be considered is the likelihood of an attacker accessing and
manipulating legitimate communications and the possible and typical impact of such an attack.

Organizations should have policies that clearly state which forms of dual connections are permitted or
prohibited for their WLAN client devices under various circumstances. Organizations should enforce
these policies through the appropriate security controls, including the actions listed below:

       For all their WLAN client devices: disable all network interfaces that are not authorized for any
        use (including during contingency plans for business continuity, disaster recovery, etc.), and
        configure the device so that the user cannot enable them or otherwise circumvent the restrictions.

       For all their WLAN client devices not authorized for dual connections:

        o   Implement the appropriate technical security controls (discussed below the bullets) so that all
            dual connected configurations are prohibited.
