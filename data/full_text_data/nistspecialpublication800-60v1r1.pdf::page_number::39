determine the overall impact level of the information system. The security impact level for an
information system will generally be the highest impact level for the security objectives
(confidentiality, integrity, and availability) associated with the aggregate of system information
types. Thus, a low-impact system is defined as an information system in which all three of the
security objectives are low. A moderate-impact system is an information system in which at least
one of the security objectives is moderate and no security objective is greater than moderate. And
finally, a high-impact system is an information system in which at least one security objective is
high.

4.5 Documenting the Security Categorization Process
Essential to the security categorization process is documenting the research, key decisions and
approvals, and supporting rationale driving the information system security categorization. This
information is key to supporting the security life cycle and will need to be included in the
information systemâ€™s security plan.
Figure 3 provides an example of information details that should be collected.

  The high water mark concept is employed because there are significant dependencies among the security
objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In most cases, a compromise in one security objective
ultimately affects the other security objectives as well.
