      NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1
      September 2023                                 PIV Card Application Namespace, Data Model, and Representation

909   protects PIN-based card activation from being blocked. While it is recommended that the default
910   configuration of CMSs remain unchanged, the configuration of a CMS MAY be changed to set
911   Bit 3 of the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy to one (i.e., to configure PIV Cards to establish
912   VCIs without the submission of a pairing code) if the configuration change is approved by the
913   designated approving authority (DAA) and if compensating controls are implemented to ensure
914   that personally identifiable information (e.g., name, email address, and organization) CANNOT
915   be skimmed from the PIV Card when in close proximity when the card is outside of its protective
916   sleeve.
917   A DAAâ€™s decision to approve the issuance of PIV Cards that implement the VCI without
918   requiring the pairing code SHALL be based on a risk assessment that weighs the perceived
919   benefit against the risk of unauthorized disclosure of cardholder data exposing previously
920   contact-restricted X.509 certificates to skimming. The previously contact-restricted X.509
921   certificates include information about the cardholder, such as name and email address.
922   Compensating controls SHALL be captured in the appropriate system security plan. 16 Systems
923   that accept externally issued PIV Cards SHALL be able to accept PIV Cards with either VCI
924   configuration.

925                Status Words
926   A status word (SW) is a 2-byte value returned by a card command at the card edge. The first byte
927   of a status word is referred to as SW1, and the second byte of a status word is referred to as
928   SW2.
929   Recognized values of all SW1-SW2 pairs used as return values on the card command interface
930   and their interpretation are given in Table 7. The descriptions of individual card commands
931   provide additional information for interpreting returned status words.
932                                                             Table 7. Status words
