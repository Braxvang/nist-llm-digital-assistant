If only one finger is available, the first view shall be populated and the second view shall be empty, as above.
Authentication systems encountering cards populated with empty minutia templates might use iris authentication, if
the data is present on card.
NOTE Minutia detection and matching algorithms continue to improve. Their accuracies have been measured on
reference data sets [MINEX04]. Some certified implementations are significantly more accurate than others,
affording lower false match rates for equal false rejection rates.

4.5       Performance specifications for PIV compliance
4.5.1         Background and scope
The intent of the [FIPS] specification of a government-wide interoperable biometric is to support cross-vendor and
cross-agency authentication of PIV Cards. These multi-party aspects cause fingerprint recognition accuracy to vary, as
documented in [MINEX04]. To mitigate against poor authentication performance this document requires template
generators (minutia detection algorithms) and template matchers to produce low verification error rates in
interoperability tests. These specifications apply to off-card comparison of templates - separate specifications are
advanced for on-card comparison in Section 5.7. For off-card comparison, these components shall perform according
to
―      interoperability specifications of sections 4.5.2, and
―      the accuracy specifications of Section 4.5.3.
The criteria implement the core government-wide interoperability objectives of HSPD-12 by populating PIV Cards with
interoperable enrollment templates. This is necessary to exclude systematically incorrect implementations of the
underlying [MINUSTD] from PIV. The effect of this is to give increased assurance of low operational error rates.

4.5.2         Minimum interoperability specification
The core cross-vendor interoperability specification is met by establishing requirements on template generators and
template matchers as described in the following two sub-sections.

4.5.2.1       Conformance of template generators
A template generator is certified on the basis of the conformance of its output, its speed of computation, and on the
error rates observed when its templates are matched. A template generator shall be certified only if
1.     it converts all input PIV representative enrollment images to Table 18 templates, and
2.     all templates are syntactically conformant to the Table 18 profile of [MINUSTD], and
3.     it converts 90% of PIV representative enrollment images to templates in fewer than 1.3 seconds 8 each, and
4.     all certified matchers verify their output templates with FNMR less than or equal to 0.01 at a FMR of 0.01 (where
       this is calculated from the sum of scores from two finger comparisons e.g., left and right index fingers), and
5.     the minutiae it reports have unique (x, y) values i.e., no two minutiae may share the same location. This
       requirement is additional to the minutia detection requirements of the [MINUSTD] and is instituted because non-
       uniqueness impedes some matching algorithms.

4.5.2.2       Conformance of template matchers
A template matcher is certified on the basis of its speed of computation, and on the error rates observed when it
matches templates in interoperability tests. A template matcher shall be certified only if
1.     it compares all pairs of Table 18 templates to scalar scores, and
2.     it executes 90% of the Annex A.4 template matches in fewer than 0.1 seconds8 each, and

    This specification applies to a commercial-off-the-shelf PC procured in 2005 and equipped with a 2GHz processor and 512 MB of
    main memory. This specification shall be adjusted by the testing organization to reflect significant changes of the computational
    platform.
