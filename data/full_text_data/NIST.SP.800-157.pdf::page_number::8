Special Publication 800-157                                                          Guidelines for Derived PIV Credentials


management functionalities of the PIV Card over a secure wireless channel using the virtual contact
interface.

1.2       Purpose and Scope

This document provides guidelines for cases in which the use of PIV Cards with mobile devices, using
either contact card readers or NFC, is deemed impractical. This guideline specifies the use of tokens with
alternative form factors to the PIV Card that may be inserted into mobile devices, such as Secure Digital
(SD) cards, USB tokens, Universal Integrated Circuit Cards (UICC, the new generation of SIM cards), or
that are embedded in the mobile device. The embedded tokens may be either hardware or software
cryptographic modules. The use of tokens with alternative form factors greatly improves the usability of
electronic authentication from mobile devices to remote IT resources, while at the same time maintaining
the goals of HSPD-12 for common identification that is secure, reliable and interoperable government-
wide.

The scope of the Derived PIV Credential is to provide PIV-enabled authentication services on the mobile
device to authenticate the credential holder to remote systems as illustrated in Figure 1-1. This publication
also includes an informative annex that provides recommendations for the inclusion of digital signature
and key management keys on mobile devices.

To achieve interoperability with the PIV infrastructure and its applications, public key infrastructure
(PKI) technology has been selected as the basis for the Derived PIV Credential. The PKI-based Derived
PIV Credentials specified in this document are issued at levels of assurance (LOA) 3 and 4.3

    [M0404] provides a foundation for four levels of assurance (LOA) for electronic authentication. [SP800-63] provides guidance
    and technical requirements for electronic authentication solutions at each of the four levels of assurance.
