K.1.3. Security Activities and Tasks
AQ-1     PREPARE FOR THE ACQUISITION
         AQ-1.1 Define the security aspects of the strategy for how the acquisition will be conducted.
         Note: This strategy describes or references the life cycle model, security risks and issues
         mitigation, a schedule of security-relevant milestones, the protection of acquirer and supplier
         assets, and security-relevant selection criteria if the supplier is external to the acquiring
         organization. It also includes key security drivers and security-relevant characteristics of the
         acquisition, such as responsibilities and liabilities; specific models, methods, or processes;
         formality; level of criticality; and the priority of security within relevant trade-off factors.
         AQ-1.2 Prepare a request for a product or service that includes the security requirements.
         Note: The request includes security criteria for the business practices with which the supplier is
         to comply, a list of bidders with adequate security qualifications, and the security criteria that
         will be used to select the supplier.
