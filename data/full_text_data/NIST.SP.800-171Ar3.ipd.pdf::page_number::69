2187   3.10.8. Access Control for Transmission and Output Devices
2188             REQUIREMENT: 03.10.08

2189             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
2190             Determine if:
2191             A.03.10.08.a: physical access to system distribution and transmission lines in organizational
2192             facilities is controlled.
2193             A.03.10.08.b: physical access to output devices is controlled to prevent unauthorized
2194             individuals from obtaining access to CUI.
