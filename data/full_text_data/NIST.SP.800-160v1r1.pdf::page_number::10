Preface
On May 12, 2021, the President signed an Executive Order (EO) on Improving the Nation’s
Cybersecurity [1]. The Executive Order stated,
            The United States faces persistent and increasingly sophisticated
            malicious cyber campaigns that threaten the public sector, the private
            sector, and ultimately the American people’s security and privacy. The
            Federal Government must improve its efforts to identify, deter, protect
            against, detect, and respond to these actions and actors.

The Executive Order further described the holistic nature of the cybersecurity challenges
confronting the Nation with computing technology embedded in every type of system from
general-purpose computing systems that support businesses to cyber-physical systems that
control the operations in power plants and provide electricity to the American people. The
Federal Government must bring the full scope of its authorities and resources to bear in order to
protect and secure its computer systems, whether the systems are cloud-based, on-premises, or
hybrid. The scope of protection and security must include systems that process data (i.e.,
information technology [IT]) and systems that run the machinery that ensure our safety (i.e.,
operational technology [OT]).

In response to the EO, there is a need to:
•   Identify stakeholder assets and protection needs
•   Provide protection commensurate with the significance of asset loss and correlated with
    threat and adversary capabilities
•   Develop scenarios and model the complexity of systems to provide a rigorous basis to reason
    about, manage, and address the uncertainty associated with that complexity
•   Adopt an engineering-based approach that addresses the principles of trustworthy secure
    design and apply those principles throughout the system life cycle

Building trustworthy, secure systems cannot occur in a vacuum with stovepipes for software,
hardware, information technology, and the human element (e.g., designers, operators, users,
attackers of these systems). Rather, it requires a transdisciplinary approach to protection, a
determination across all assets where loss could occur, and an understanding of adversity,
including how adversaries attack and compromise systems. As such, this publication addresses
considerations for the engineering-driven actions necessary to develop defensible and survivable
systems, including the components that compose and the services that depend on those systems.
The objective is to address security issues from the perspective of stakeholder requirements and
protection needs and to use established engineering processes to ensure that such requirements
and needs are addressed with appropriate fidelity and rigor across the entire life cycle of the
system.

Engineering trustworthy, secure systems is a significant undertaking that requires a substantial
investment in the requirements, architecture, and design of systems, components, applications,
and networks. A trustworthy system provides compelling evidence to support claims that it meets
its requirements to deliver the protection and performance needed by stakeholders. Introducing a
