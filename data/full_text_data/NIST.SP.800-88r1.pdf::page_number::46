NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                             Guidelines for Media Sanitization


                 command addresses these areas, their presence may affect the ability to reliably verify the
                 effectiveness of the sanitization procedure if left in place. Any configuration options limiting the
                 ability to access the entire addressable area of the storage media should be reset prior to
                 applying the sanitization technique.
                 When Cryptographic Erase is applied, verification must be performed prior to additional
                 sanitization techniques (if applicable), such as a Clear or Purge technique applied following
                 Cryptographic Erase, to ensure that the cryptographic operation completed successfully. A quick
                 sampling verification as described in the Verify Methods subsection should also be performed
                 after any additional techniques are applied following Cryptographic Erase.
                 Not all implementations of encryption are necessarily suitable for reliance upon Cryptographic
                 Erase as a Purge mechanism. The decision regarding whether to use Cryptographic Erase
                 depends upon verification of attributes previously identified in this guidance and in Appendix D.
                 Degaussing must not be performed as a sanitization technique on flash memory-based storage
                 devices.

   NVM Express SSDs

   Clear:        Overwrite media by using organizationally approved and tested overwriting
                 technologies/methods/tools. The Clear procedure should consist of at least one pass of writes
                 with a fixed data value, such as all zeros. Multiple passes or more complex values may
                 alternatively be used.

   Purge:        Two options are available:
                     1. Apply the NVM Express Format command, if supported. One or both of the following
                          options may be available:
                               a. The User Data Erase command.
                               b. If the device supports encryption, the Cryptographic Erase command.
                                    Optionally: After Cryptographic Erase is successfully applied to a device, use
                                    the User Data Erase command (if supported) to erase the media. If the User
                                    Data Erase command is not supported, the Clear procedure could
                                    alternatively be applied.
                     2. Cryptographic Erase through the TCG Opal SSC or Enterprise SSC interface by
                          issuing commands as necessary to cause all MEKs to be changed. Refer to the TCG
                          and vendors shipping TCG Opal or Enterprise storage devices for more information.
                          Optionally: After Cryptographic Erase is successfully applied to a device, use the User
                          Data Erase command (if supported) to erase the media. If the User Data Erase
                          command is not supported, the Clear procedure is an acceptable alternative.

   Destroy:      Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:        Verification must be performed for each technique within Clear and Purge.
                 When Cryptographic Erase is applied, verification must be performed prior to additional
                 sanitization techniques (if applicable), such as a Clear or Purge technique applied following
                 Cryptographic Erase, to ensure that the cryptographic operation completed successfully. A quick
                 sampling verification as described in the Verify Methods subsection should also be performed
                 after any additional techniques are applied following Cryptographic Erase.
                 Not all implementations of encryption are necessarily suitable for reliance upon Cryptographic
                 Erase as a Purge mechanism. The decision regarding whether to use Cryptographic Erase
                 depends upon verification of attributes previously identified in this guidance.
                 Degaussing must not be performed as a sanitization technique on flash memory-based storage
                 devices.
