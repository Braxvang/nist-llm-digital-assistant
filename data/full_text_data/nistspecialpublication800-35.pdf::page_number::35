                                                                                       NIST Special Publication 800-35




4.3.1      Develop the Business Case

During the assessment phase, the decision makers identified the current environment. To identify the
preferred desired future state in this solution phase, a business case needs to be developed. The business
case should provide the information necessary to identify the best solution among the alternatives. Each
organization will likely have a unique methodology for developing a business case, however there are five
components common to most business cases:

     Alternative Analysis 2 —the organization should look at all of the available options. The organization
      will finalize the options deemed viable enough to develop formal cost estimates, benefits analysis,
      and organizational risk analysis.
     Cost Estimate—the organization needs to develop TCO estimates for each alternative. Estimates of
      each alternative and the current environment must be consistent, have similar cost elements, and be
      based on the same assumptions.
     Benefits Analysis—the organization needs to formally identify the benefits of each alternative.
      These should be quantitative (i.e., cost savings, cost avoidance etc.), whenever possible. For
      example, if the organization estimates a new service implementation will lower security incident rates
      by 50% and each incident costs x dollars (based on metrics gathered during the assessment phase), the
      organization can identify the likely cost avoidance. It will also be important to look at qualitative
      benefits such as impact to mission, customers, etc.
     Project Risk Analysis—along with the benefits of each alternative, project risks must be identified.
      OMB has identified eight standard risk categories 3 : organizational and change management risk,
      business risk, data/information risk, technology risk, strategic risk, security risk, privacy risk, project
      resources risk. These risks might include cost overruns, schedule slippage, vendor uncertainties,
      privacy concerns, etc. The analysis of risks should evaluate all alternatives against the same risk
      factors and determine the probability of occurrence and the impact if it occurred. Then, the
      organization should determine the risk-adjusted cost of each alternative.
     Evaluation of Alternatives—finally, the organization should rank each alternative based on cost,
      benefit and risk. From this analysis, the organization should be able to identify the preferred
      alternative.
4.3.2      Develop the Service Arrangement

Developing the service arrangement could be a relatively short step as the hard work of data collection,
analysis, and comparison of options has already been completed. Although the business case may not
make the decision-making easy or obvious, it should provide the necessary data for decision makers to
weigh, consider, and select the service arrangement that best suits the organization’s needs. There will
likely be some discussion and disagreement among the decision makers, but ultimately the selection must
be a consensus. A service arrangement can succeed only if all business and IT security managers
sufficiently buy-in to the implementing solution.
