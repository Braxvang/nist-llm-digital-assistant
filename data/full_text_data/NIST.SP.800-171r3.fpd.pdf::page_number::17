     NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                                            Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
     November 2023

60        The Fundamentals
61   This section describes the basic assumptions and methodology used to develop the requirements
62   to protect the confidentiality of CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations. It also includes the
63   tailoring 10 criteria applied to the controls in NIST SP 800-53 [8].

64            Basic Assumptions
65   The security requirements in this publication are based on the following assumptions:
66        •     Federal information designated as CUI has the same value, whether such information
67              resides in a federal or a nonfederal system or organization.
68        •     Statutory and regulatory requirements for the protection of CUI are consistent in federal
69              and nonfederal systems and organizations.
70        •     Safeguards implemented to protect CUI are consistent in federal and nonfederal systems
71              and organizations.
72        •     The confidentiality impact value for CUI is no less than moderate. 11
73        •     Nonfederal organizations can directly implement a variety of potential security solutions
74              or use external service providers to satisfy security requirements.

75            Security Requirement Development Methodology
76   Starting with the NIST SP 800-53 controls in the NIST SP 800-53B [12] moderate baseline, the
77   controls are tailored to eliminate selected controls or parts of controls that are:
78        •     Primarily the responsibility of the Federal Government;
79        •     Not directly related to protecting the confidentiality of CUI;
80        •     Adequately addressed by other related controls; 12 or
81        •     Not applicable.

82   The NIST SP 800-171 security requirements represent a subset of the controls that are necessary
83   to protect the confidentiality of CUI. The security requirements are organized into 17 families, as
84   illustrated in Table 1. Each family contains the requirements related to the general security topic
85   of the family. Certain families from NIST SP 800-53 are not included due to the aforementioned
86   tailoring criteria. 13

     10
        Tailoring is the process by which control baselines are modified to achieve certain organizational goals and objectives [13].
     11
        FIPS 199 [6] defines three confidentiality impact values: low, moderate, and high. In accordance with 32 CFR 2002 [5], CUI is categorized at
     no less than the moderate confidentiality impact value. However, when federal law, regulation, or governmentwide policy establishing the control
     of CUI specifies controls that differ from those of the moderate confidentiality baseline, then the applicable law, regulation, or governmentwide
     policy is followed.
     12
        “Adequately addressed by other related controls” means that the protection capability offered by the control is provided by another control in
     the same or different control family. Using this tailoring option helps to eliminate potential redundancy in requirements without affecting the
     protection of CUI in nonfederal systems and organizations.
     13
        The PII Processing and Transparency (PT) family is not included because PII is a category of CUI, and therefore, no additional requirements
     are specified for confidentiality protection. The Program Management (PM) family is not included because it is not associated with any security
     control baseline.
