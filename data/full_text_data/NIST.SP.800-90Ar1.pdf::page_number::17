NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                        Recommendation for Random Number
                                                               Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


                         Also see reseed.

Seedlife                 The length of the seed period.
Seed Period              The period of time between instantiating or reseeding a DRBG
                         with one seed and reseeding that DRBG with another seed.
Sequence                 An ordered set of quantities.

Shall                    Used to indicate a requirement of this Recommendation.
                         "Shall" may be coupled with "not" to become "shall not."

Should                   Used to indicate a highly desirable feature for a DRBG
                         mechanism that is not necessarily required by this
                         Recommendation. "Should" may be coupled with "not" to
                         become "should not."

String                   See Bitstring.
Unbiased                 A value that is chosen from a sample space is said to be
                         unbiased if all potential values have the same probability of
                         being chosen. Contrast with biased.

Uninstantiate            The termination of a DRBG instantiation.
Unpredictable            In the context of random bit generation, an output bit is
                         unpredictable if an adversary has only a negligible advantage
                         (that is, essentially not much better than chance) in predicting
                         it correctly.
Working State            A subset of the internal state that is used by a DRBG
                         mechanism to produce pseudorandom bits at a given point in
                         time. The working state (and thus, the internal state) is
                         updated to the next state prior to producing another string of
                         pseudorandom bits.
