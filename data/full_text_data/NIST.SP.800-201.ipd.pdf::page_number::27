      NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                       Cloud Computing Forensic
      February 2023                                                                       Reference Architecture

813   questions identified in the CC FRA methodology. Each challenge is further categorized based on
814   its overall impact on cloud functional capabilities. This categorization is focused on the overall
815   number of affected capabilities, identifying if only a limited set of capabilities is impacted versus
816   most capabilities composing the cloud ecosystem being impacted. The term impact is used to
817   indicate how broadly or narrowly a challenge affects the set of functional capabilities. Therefore,
818   the impact of each challenge was categorized along a generic-to-specific scale as follows (see
819   NIST IR 8006 [1], Annex A, Table 2, column 4):
820       •   Generic (G) – A challenge is labeled generic if it affects most of the capabilities.
821       •   Specific (S) – A challenge is labeled specific if it affects a limited set of capabilities.
822       •   Quasi (Q) – A challenge is labeled quasi if it falls somewhere between generic and
823           specific.
824   A specific challenge applies narrowly and affects only a limited number of capabilities, while a
825   generic challenge affects a broad set of capabilities. The specific challenge affects a capability in
826   a direct manner that is determined by the particular issues addressed by the capability. This
827   results in the capability being affected in an important and profound way. On the other hand,
828   because the generic challenge affects most of the capabilities, the affect is not tied closely to the
829   issues addressed in each capability, and the capabilities are affected in a much less important and
830   profound way. (See Section 4 in which the “precise, limited mapping” is explained.) Thus, a
831   specific challenge is more impactful overall than a generic one when it comes to conducting a
832   cloud forensic investigation. The generic-to-specific label of each challenge is also part of the
833   Forensic Reference Architecture, as shown in Appendix D. The NCC FSWG developed
834   consensus labels for all of the challenges [1].
