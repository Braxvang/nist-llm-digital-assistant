Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
environmental remediation information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to environmental remediation
information. Except for cases of emergency bulletins necessary to correct existing threats to
public safety, environmental remediation processes are usually tolerant of reasonable delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
environmental remediation information is low.

D.8.3 Pollution Prevention and Control Information Type

Pollution prevention and control includes activities associated with the establishment of
environmental standards to control the levels of harmful substances emitted into the soil, water
and atmosphere. The following security categorization is recommended for the pollution
prevention and control information type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of pollution prevention
and control information on the abilities of responsible agencies to establish environmental
standards to control the levels of harmful substances emitted into the soil, water and atmosphere.
Unauthorized disclosure of pollution prevention and control information can result in incomplete
information being published as agency standards or policy, misunderstandings that prevent or
increase the difficulty of promulgating standards, or the discrediting of valid proposed standards
or policies by exposure of partial information out of context. The consequences of such
unauthorized disclosures may have an adverse effect on public confidence in the agency, or
agency operations and may place the agency at an operational disadvantage. Most unauthorized
disclosure of pollution prevention and control information will have only a limited adverse effect
on the affected agency.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for pollution prevention and control information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of pollution prevention and control
information may depend on the urgency with which the information is typically needed.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications
(e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations, public confidence in the
agency, and the agency mission.
