Appendix D—SAMPLE ACQUISITION LANGUAGE

D.1      Introduction
                                      14
This Appendix presents language that is appropriate for inclusion into information technology (IT)
security service Statements of Work (SOW) or other forms of service provider agreements and covers
some of the services presented in this document. Although the language is not a substitute for good IT
security management, organization staff and government service providers can use this appendix as a
basis for a common understanding of each described activity. The sample language can foster easier
access to more consistent, high-quality IT security services. The descriptions apply to contracting for
services or obtaining them from within the organization. It is worth reiterating that close consultation and
guidance with your acquisition officials and legal counsel is always prudent as they are the experts in
what is often a complicated and arcane area of expertise.

D.2      Sample Acquisition Language

The language presented here is a sample and is not intended as “boiler plate.” Each organization should
analyze its specific needs and determine its functional, resource, schedule requirements, and constraints.
The language may be used, with appropriate tailoring, by various organizational levels (e.g., department,
agency, bureau, region, branch, and field office). Additional acquisition language can be found in NIST
Special Publication (SP) 800-64, Security Considerations in the Information System Development Life
Cycle.

The document uses the greater-than lesser-than symbols <> to indicate information the organization will
complete. To help fill this area with appropriate information, a generic term or explanation is used (e.g.,
organization name). Instructions to those tailoring or refining the language are presented as notes,
indicated as [NOTE].

Those tailoring the language in this appendix may find other NIST publications valuable. Those
performing these tasks can also benefit from other NIST Special Publications.

Many but not all of the services discussed in this guide are presented in this appendix. In many cases, the
language provided in this appendix can be tailored to fit other security services. The deliverables
mentioned within the language are samples and need to be tailored to meet an organization’s specific
needs.

In addition to acquisition language for services discussed in this guide, acquisition language is provided
for services to evaluate IT security products and general IT security services contract management.

     This section is drawn from NISTIR 4749, Sample Statements of Work for Federal Computer Security Services: For use In
     House or Contracting Out, December 1991. The language in Appendix C was first developed as SOW language. It should
     be modified if it will be used in internal MOAs.
