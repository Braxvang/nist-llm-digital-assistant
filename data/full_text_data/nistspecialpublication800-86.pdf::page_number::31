                                             GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



      ! Audience Consideration. Knowing the audience to which the data or information will be shown
        is important. An incident requiring law enforcement involvement requires highly detailed reports
        of all information gathered, and may also require copies of all evidentiary data obtained. A
        system administrator might want to see network traffic and related statistics in great detail.
        Senior management might simply want a high-level overview of what happened, such as a
        simplified visual representation of how the attack occurred, and what should be done to prevent
        similar incidents.
      ! Actionable Information. Reporting also includes identifying actionable information gained
        from data that may allow an analyst to collect new sources of information. For example, a list of
        contacts may be developed from the data that might lead to additional information about an
        incident or crime. Also, information might be obtained that could prevent future events, such as a
        backdoor on a system that could be used for future attacks, a crime that is being planned, a worm
        scheduled to start spreading at a certain time, or a vulnerability that could be exploited.
As part of the reporting process, analysts should identify any problems that may need to be remedied,
such as policy shortcomings or procedural errors. Many forensic and incident response teams hold formal
reviews after each major event. Such reviews tend to include serious consideration of possible
improvements to guidelines and procedures, and typically at least some minor changes are approved and
implemented after each review. For example, one common problem is that many organizations find it
resource-intensive to maintain current lists of personnel to contact regarding each different type of
incident that may occur. Other common issues are what to do with the gigabytes or terabytes of data
collected during an investigation, and how security controls (e.g., auditing, logging, intrusion detection)
can be altered to record additional data that would be helpful for future investigations. Formal reviews
can help identify ways to improve these processes. Once changes to guidelines and procedures are
implemented, all team members should be informed of the changes and frequently reminded of the proper
procedures to follow. Teams typically have formal mechanisms for tracking changes and identifying the
current versions of each process and procedure document. In addition, many teams have posters or other
highly visible documents mounted on walls or doors that remind teams of the key steps to take, so that
everyone is constantly reminded of how things are supposed to be done.

In addition to addressing identified problems, analysts should take other steps to maintain and grow their
skills. As a matter of maintaining their certification or accreditation, some forensic examiners must
routinely refresh themselves with the latest tools and techniques that address the latest technologies
pertaining to computer storage media, data types and formats, and other relevant issues. Whether
required or not, periodic refreshing of skills through coursework, on-the-job experience, and academic
sources helps ensure that people performing forensic actions keep pace with rapidly changing
technologies and job responsibilities. Some organizations require all members of their forensic teams to
pass annual proficiency examinations. Periodic review of policies, guidelines, and procedures also helps
ensure that the organization stays current with trends in technology and changes in law.

3.5     Recommendations

The key recommendations presented in this section for the forensic process are as follows:

      ! Organizations should perform forensics using a consistent process. This guide presents a
        four-phase forensic process, with collection, examination, analysis, and reporting phases. The
        exact details of each phase may vary based on the need for forensics.
      ! Analysts should be aware of the range of possible data sources. Analysts should be able to
        survey a physical area and recognize possible sources of data. Analysts should also think of
        possible data sources located elsewhere within an organization and outside the organization.
