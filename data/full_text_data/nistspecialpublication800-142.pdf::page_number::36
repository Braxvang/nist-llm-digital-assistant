Practical Combinatorial Testing

is 100%, by definition, but many test sets not based on covering arrays may still provide
significant t-way coverage. If the test set is large, but not designed as a covering array, it is
very possible that it provides 2-way coverage or better. For example, random input
generation may have been used to produce the tests, and good branch or condition coverage
may have been achieved. In addition to the structural coverage figure, for software
assurance it would be helpful to know what percentage of 2-way, 3-way, etc. coverage has
been obtained.

Definition: For a given test set for n variables, simple t-way combination coverage is the
proportion of t-way combinations of n variables for which all variable-values
configurations are fully covered.

Example. Figure 15 shows an example with four binary variables, a, b, c, and d, where
each row represents a test. Of the six 2-way combinations, ab, ac, ad, bc, bd, cd, only bd
and cd have all four binary values covered, so simple 2-way coverage for the four tests in
Figure 15 is 1/3 = 33.3%. There are four 3-way combinations, abc, abd, acd, bcd, each
with eight possible configurations: 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111. Of the four
combinations, none has all eight configurations covered, so simple 3-way coverage for this
test set is 0%.

considered to provide more software testing assurance.

Definition. For a given test set for n variables, (t+k)-way combination coverage is the
proportion of (t+k)-way combinations of n variables for which all variable-values
configurations are fully covered. (Note that this measure would normally be applied only
to a t-way covering array, as a measure of coverage beyond t).

Example. If the test set in Figure 15 is extended as shown in Figure 16, we can extend 3­
way coverage. For this test set, bcd is covered, out of the four 3-way combinations, so 2­
way coverage is 100%, and (2+1)-way = 3-way coverage is 25%.
