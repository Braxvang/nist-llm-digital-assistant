SP 800-152                                                  A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


               SC-8        A Federal CKMS that protects Moderate or High impact-level
PR:6.15
               SC-11       information shall cryptographically protect sensitive metadata
               SC-12       from unauthorized disclosure and modification when outside
               SC-28       of a cryptographic module.
                           A Federal CKMS shall use the NIST time source when access
PR:6.16
                           to a time source is required.
                           A Federal CKMS that protects Moderate or High impact-level
PR:6.17
                           information shall support source authentication of the
                           metadata elements for all cryptographic keys.

                           A Federal CKMS should explicitly support one or more of
PA:6.3
                           the following list of metadata elements: key label, key
                           identifiers, key owner identifier(s), and the cryptographic
                           algorithm using the key.
                           A Federal CKMS that protects Low impact-level information
PA:6.4
                           should cryptographically protect sensitive metadata elements
                           against unauthorized disclosure and modification when
                           outside a cryptographic module.
                           A Federal CKMS that protects Low impact-level information
PA:6.5
                           should provide source authentication of the metadata
                           elements for all cryptographic keys.

6.2.2 Required Key and Metadata Information
Each key type requires certain metadata information to be available when a key is used,
whether the information is explicitly recorded as metadata or is otherwise known by the
FCKMS.

FR:6.13 For each key type, the CKMS design shall specify the following information
regarding keys and metadata elements:

   a) The key type.
   b) The crypto period (for static keys).
   c) The method of generation.
      i. The RNG used.
      ii. A key generation specification (e.g., [FIPS 186] for signature keys, [SP 800-56A]
           for Diffie-Hellman key establishment keys).
   d) For each metadata element, include
      i. The source of the metadata, and
      ii. How the metadata is vetted,
   e) The method of key establishment
      i. The key transport scheme (if used),
      ii. The key agreement scheme (if used), and
      iii. The protocol name (if a named protocol is used).
   f) The disclosure protections (e.g., key confidentiality, physical security).
