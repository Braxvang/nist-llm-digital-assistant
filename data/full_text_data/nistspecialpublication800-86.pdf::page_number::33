                                                      GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



4.      Using Data from Data Files

A data file (also called a file) is a collection of information logically grouped into a single entity and
referenced by a unique name, such as a filename. A file can be of many data types, including a document,
an image, a video, or an application. Successful forensic processing of computer media depends on the
ability to collect, examine, and analyze the files that reside on the media.

This section provides an overview of the most common media types and filesystemsâ€”methods for
naming, storing, organizing, and accessing files. It then discusses how files should be collected and how
the integrity of the files should be preserved. The section also discusses various technical issues related to
file recovery, such as recovering data from deleted files. The last portion of the section describes the
examination and analysis of files, providing guidance on tools and techniques that can assist analysts.15

4.1     File Basics

Before attempting to collect or examine files, analysts should have a reasonably comprehensive
understanding of files and filesystems. First, analysts should be aware of the variety of media that may
contain files; Section 4.1.1 provides several examples of the media used in personal computers and other
types of digital devices. Section 4.1.2 then explains how filesystems are used to organize files and
provides an overview of several common filesystems. Section 4.1.3 discusses how data from deleted files
can still exist within filesystems.

4.1.1     File Storage Media

The widespread use of computers and other digital devices has resulted in a significant increase in the
number of different media types that are used to store files. In addition to traditional media types such as
hard drives and floppy disks, files are often stored on consumer devices such as PDAs and cell phones, as
well as on newer media types, such as flash memory cards, which were made popular by digital cameras.
Table 4-1 lists media types that are commonly used on computers and digital devices. This list does not
include every media type available; rather, it is intended to show the variety of media types that an analyst
might come across.
