•   Checklist item 26: If the zone is signed using NSEC3 RRs, the salt value should be changed
    every time the zone is completely resigned. The value of the salt should be random, and the
    length should be short enough to prevent a FQDN to be too long for the DNS protocol (i.e. under
    256 octets).

•   Checklist item 27: If the zone is signed using NSEC3 RRs, the iterations value should be based
    on available computing power available to clients and attackers. The value should be reviewed
    annually and increased if the evaluation conditions change.

•   Checklist item 28: TTL values for DNS data should be set between 30 minutes (1800 seconds)
    and 24 hours (86400 seconds).

•   Checklist item 29: TTL values for RRsets should be set to be a fraction of the DNSSEC
    signature validity period of the RRSIG that covers the RRset.
