SP 800-130                                                             August 2013



                             The process by which a key (and perhaps its metadata) are
Key Output                   extracted from a cryptographic module (usually for external
                             storage).
                             An entity (e.g., person, group, organization, device, or module)
Key Owner
                             authorized to use a cryptographic key or key pair.
                             A parameter that, when properly combined with one or more
Key Split                    other key splits, forms a cryptographic key.

Key State Transition         The process of moving from one key lifecycle state to another.

                             A key establishment procedure whereby one entity (the sender)
                             selects and distributes the keying material to another entity (the
                             receiver). Typically, key transport involves the use of
Key Transport                cryptography to protect the keying material, but in some
                             applications a trusted courier may be used instead. (Sometimes
                             called key distribution.)

                             The process used to replace a previously active key with a new
Key Update
                             key that is related to the old key.
                             A method of encrypting keys (along with associated integrity
Key Wrapping                 information) that provides both confidentiality and integrity
                             protection using a symmetric key.
Keying Material              Key and/or metadata.
                             The principle that each entity has access only to the information
Least Privilege
                             and resources necessary for legitimate use.
                             Software designed and operated by an adversary to violate the
Malware                      security of a computer (includes spyware, virus programs, root
                             kits, and Trojan horses).
                             In the Framework, parameters used to describe properties
Metadata
                             associated with a cryptographic key that are explicitly recorded,
(also Associated Metadata)
                             managed, and protected by the CKMS.
                             One unit of metadata that is associated with a key and explicitly
Metadata Element
                             recorded and managed by the CKMS.
                             A set of rules for operating on data with a cryptographic
                             algorithm and a key; often includes feeding all or part of the
                             output of the algorithm back into the input of the next iteration of
Mode of Operation
                             the algorithm, either with or without additional data being
                             processed. Examples are: Cipher Feedback, Output Feedback,
                             and Cipher Block Chaining.
