                   The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



<cpe_dict:cpe-item> SHALL match the title of an affected platform bound to the referenced
definition.

3.6      Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE)

To maintain consistency and accuracy among SCAP content, SCAP content referencing a configuration
setting SHALL use the official CCE identifier if a CCE entry for a particular configuration setting exists
in the Official CCE Dictionary. If no CCE exists for the configuration setting of interest, the content
author SHOULD seek to have a CCE identifier issued for the configuration setting. See the OVAL
compliance class definition requirements in Section 3.3 and the <xccdf:ident> requirements in Section
3.2.6.1 for additional requirements involving CCE identifier references.

The MITRE Corporation maintains the current official CCE list at http://cce.mitre.org/lists/cce_list.html
and new CCEs can be requested from the CCE Content Team at
http://cce.mitre.org/lists/creation_process.html.

Use of an official, dynamic data feed is preferred to static coding of values in SCAP data sources. The
NVD provides a data feed20 that correlates CCE identifiers with the control identifiers described in NIST
SP 800-53. Embedding control identifiers within SCAP content is strongly discouraged due to the
maintenance burden that it imposes on content maintainers when the control identifiers are revised.

3.7      Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)

CVE references in SCAP content MAY include both ―candidate‖ and ―entry‖ status identifiers. The use of
deprecated CVE identifiers SHALL NOT be allowed.

If a CVE identifier exists for a particular vulnerability, the official CVE identifier SHALL be used. If no
CVE exists for the software flaw, an alternate identifier MAY be used, but the user SHOULD seek to
have a CVE identifier issued for the vulnerability. The process for submitting unpublished vulnerabilities
and obtaining CVE identifiers is available from The MITRE Corporation via
http://cve.mitre.org/cve/obtain_id.html.

NIST provides a CVE data feed to support dynamic and current vulnerability information and associated
metadata (e.g., CVSS values). The current schema is available at http://nvd.nist.gov/download.cfm.

3.8      Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

The NIST CVE data feed, discussed in Section 3.7, is one source of CVSS base score and vector data that
MAY be used by products to support additional use cases built on SCAP usage. In support of these
additional use cases, CVSS base scores and vectors from this data feed MAY be used by products along
with temporal, and environmental scores and vectors from other sources.

Additional information on CVSS use is available in NIST IR 7435, The Common Vulnerability Scoring
System (CVSS) and Its Applicability to Federal Agency Systems
(http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsNISTIRs.html#NIST-IR-7435).
