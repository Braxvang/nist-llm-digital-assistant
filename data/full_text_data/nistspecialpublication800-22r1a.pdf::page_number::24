A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS




                                                                                            ∑ ((o − e ) e ),
                                                                                                            2
frequencies of the hypothesized distribution. The test statistic is of the form χ 2 =              i    i        i

where oi and ei are the observed and expected frequencies of occurrence of the measure, respectively.

For many of the tests in this test suite, the assumption has been made that the size of the sequence length,
n, is large (of the order 103 to 107). For such large sample sizes of n, asymptotic reference distributions
have been derived and applied to carry out the tests. Most of the tests are applicable for smaller values of
n. However, if used for smaller values of n, the asymptotic reference distributions would be inappropriate
and would need to be replaced by exact distributions that would commonly be difficult to compute.

Note: For many of the examples throughout Section 2, small sample sizes are used for illustrative
purposes only, e.g., n = 10. The normal approximation is not really applicable for these examples.

2.1     Frequency (Monobit) Test

2.1.1 Test Purpose
The focus of the test is the proportion of zeroes and ones for the entire sequence. The purpose of this test
is to determine whether the number of ones and zeros in a sequence are approximately the same as would
be expected for a truly random sequence. The test assesses the closeness of the fraction of ones to ½, that
is, the number of ones and zeroes in a sequence should be about the same. All subsequent tests depend on
the passing of this test.


2.1.2 Function Call
Frequency(n), where:

            n       The length of the bit string.

Additional input used by the function, but supplied by the testing code:

            ε       The sequence of bits as generated by the RNG or PRNG being tested; this exists as a
                    global structure at the time of the function call; ε = ε1, ε2, … , εn.


2.1.3       Test Statistic and Reference Distribution
            sobs:  The absolute value of the sum of the Xi (where, Xi = 2ε - 1 = ±1) in the sequence divided
                   by the square root of the length of the sequence.

The reference distribution for the test statistic is half normal (for large n). (Note: If z (where
z = s obs       2 ; see Section 3.1) is distributed as normal, then |z| is distributed as half normal.) If the
sequence is random, then the plus and minus ones will tend to cancel one another out so that the test
statistic will be about 0. If there are too many ones or too many zeroes, then the test statistic will tend to
be larger than zero.


2.1.4       Test Description
(1)         Conversion to ±1: The zeros and ones of the input sequence (ε) are converted to values of –1 and
            +1 and are added together to produce Sn = X1 + X 2 ++X n , where Xi = 2εi – 1.
