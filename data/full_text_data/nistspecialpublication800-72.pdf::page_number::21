Distribution [Hon04].12 Familiar includes a packaging system called ipkg (Itsy package),
which installs, updates, removes, and manages packages similarly to the Redhat or Debian
package facility for desktop Linux.13 For current information about Linux-based handheld
devices, related Web sites should be monitored regularly.14

Figure 4 gives a conceptual architecture for the Linux operating system. The Linux operating
system is responsible for memory management, process and thread creation, interprocess
communication mechanisms, interrupt handling, execute-in-place (XIP) ROM filesystems,
RAM filesystems, flash management, and TCP/IP networking.




                                              Figure 4: Linux Architecture

The Linux kernel is composed of modular components and subsystems that include device
drivers, protocols, and other component types. The kernel also includes the scheduler, the
memory manager, the virtual filesystem, and the resource allocator. Programming interfaces
provide a standard method by which the Linux kernel can be expanded. Processing proceeds
from the system call interface to request service, for example, from the file or process control
subsystem, which in turn requests service(s) from the hardware. The hardware then provides
the service to the kernel, returning results through the kernel to the system call interface.

Linux offers comprehensive support for security that has been part of the operating system
from its onset. Features include user identification and authentication, access control on files
and directories based on owner (user/group/all), logging of security-relevant activities, and
various levels of network encryption (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), Internet
Protocol Security (IPsec), Secure Shell (SSH), etc.). Processes running under Linux on the
same machine are also protected from interfering with one another [Ket00]. Linux operating
systems tailored for PDAs have on occasion been found to contain security vulnerabilities in
design and implementation that affect system security. For example, the screen-locking
passcode on the Zaurus that provides user authentication, created the same random value (i.e.,
salt value15) every time the passcode was set. This oversight weakened security by allowing
