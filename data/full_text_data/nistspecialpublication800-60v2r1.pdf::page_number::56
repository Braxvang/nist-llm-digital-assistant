associated confidentiality impact assigned to debt collection information might be moderate (or
even high in the case of extremely high dollar value cases).

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for debt collection information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Therefore, the
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of debt collection information depend
on the type of property being managed and on the immediacy with which the information is
expected to be used.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: If the modified or destroyed information is
substantive financial data, there is a greater potential for harm to result from actions being taken
based on incomplete or false information. This can have serious adverse effects on individual
financial actions with consequent loss of revenue from, or other unanticipated consequences
regarding the personal property under disposition. The severity of the consequences depends on
the type of the debt and of the debtor but would be most likely be moderate.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for debt
collection information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the debt collection information.

Most Federal debt collection processes are tolerant of delays. Also, the consequences of
temporary inability to access information concerning foreign or domestic debt will be minimal.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
debt collection information is low.
C.2.5.2 User Fee Collection Information Type

User fee Collection involves the collection of fees assessed on individuals or organizations for
the provision of Government services and for the use of Government goods or resources (i.e.
National Parks). The recommended security categorization for the user fee collection
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of user fee collection
information on the ability of responsible agencies to correctly and efficiently enforce, regulate,
and effect the collection of fees assessed on individuals or organizations for the provision of
Government services and for the use of Government goods or resources. In general, particularly
in aggregate, this information is public record.
