Several strategies to gain efficiencies, provide better value, and meet future demands are
planned for the NVD in FY 2020. Improvements in tools and workflow for the analysts
are continuously being developed, and the team intends to implement the allowlisting
of CVE Naming Authorities (CNAs). This would allow some CNAs to provide their own
analyses of CVEs, and after internal review, their scores could automatically be accepted
into the NVD. This process will be further described in NISTIR 8246, National Vulnerability
Database (NVD) Metadata Submission Guidelines for Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures (CVE) Numbering Authorities (CNAs) and Authorized Data Publishers,
which is expected to be published in FY 2020. The team also plans to implement a
vulnerability ontology (commonly referred to as “vulntology”). This ontology approach
will be published for public comment in FY 2020 and used to determine whether natural
language processing (i.e., AI) will be useful in the future analyses of CVEs.


Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL)
Today, concepts like security controls and profiles are largely represented in proprietary
ways, making it more difficult for many organizations to move forward as quickly as
they need to in order to take advantage of these approaches. Organizations also often
struggle with information systems that have many different components. To help
                                                                                              39
