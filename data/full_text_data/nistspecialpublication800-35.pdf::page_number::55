                                                                                              NIST Special Publication 800-35



In addition to the three services mentioned above, a PKI can also provide two additional services: key
recovery and privilege/authorization.

  Key Recovery—organizations must be able to recover data that the employee has encrypted, which
                                                                                  11
   can only be done by recovering the encryption key when the key is unavailable.
  Privilege/Authorization—certificates can be used to vouch for a user’s identity and also specify
   privileges the user has been granted.
Functional elements of a public key infrastructure include certification authorities (CA), registration
authorities (RA), repositories, and archives. The nature of PKI is that it is a very technical security
control. Several detailed NIST publications exist that further describe PKI:

  NIST SP 800-32, Introduction to Public Key Technology and the Federal PKI
  NIST SP 800-25, Federal Agency Use of Public Key Technology for Digital Signatures and
   Authentication
PKI Services

Designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining a PKI is a complex technical challenge that is
                                    12
compounded by a number of factors:

  Interoperability
  Scalability
  High costs (deploying a PKI and enabling software applications)
  Complex policy development
  Training challenges for a technology that can be complex and difficult to understand.
PKI services can be packaged in numerous ways. The entire PKI process can be performed by a service
provider, a security provider can manage the PKI in house, or PKI elements may be performed by a
provider (hybrid). The following list provides examples of PKI elements 13 that could be performed by a
service provider:

      Reasons for key recovery are varied and may include an employee forgetting a password to unlock an encrypted file, the
      death of an employee who has encrypted some information, or someone attempting to hide criminal activity from law
      enforcement officials.
