NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                             Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                    Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


The reseed algorithm (CTR_DRBG_Reseed_algorithm) is the same as that provided in
Appendix B.3.3, except that steps 1 and 2 are replaced by:
   temp = len (additional_input).
   If (temp < 256), then additional_input = additional_input || 0256-temp.
   seed_material = entropy_input ⊕ additional_input.
B.4.4      Generating Pseudorandom Bits Using CTR_DRBG

The generate function (CTR_DRBG_Generate_function) is the same as that provided in
Appendix B.3.4, except that step 5 is replaced by:
   If (len (additional_input) > 256), then Return (“additional_input too long”, Null).
The generate algorithm (CTR_DRBG_Generate_algorithm) is the same as that provided in
Appendix B.3.4, except that step 2.1 is replaced by:
   temp = len (additional_input).
   If (temp < 256), then additional_input = additional_input || 0256-temp.
