Special Publication 800-85B                                    PIV Data Model Testing Specification


include purpose of the test, starting conditions and prerequisites, success criteria, and post-test
conditions, when applicable.
The following four sets of test assertions are included in this document â€”
BER-TLV (Section 8)
Biometric data object (Section 9)
Signed data element (Section 10)
PKI certificate profile (Section 11)
All the test assertions provided in this document come under PIV data model testing and are
based on DTRs in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7. Specifically, each test assertion makes specific
references to the related DTR sections. Overall there is a many-to-many relationship from the
test assertions to the DTRs (i.e., one test can map to many DTRs and one DTR can map to many
tests). To narrow the search space for cross references, Table 3-1 presents a cross-referencing
guide showing the relevant DTR sections and test assertion sections with respect to tests.
