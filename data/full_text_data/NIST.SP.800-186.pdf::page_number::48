special form to allow efficient modular reduction and finite field operations that try to minimize
the carry effects of operands. The curve parameters A and B are:
   1. The parameter B was set to B = 1.
   2. The parameter A was selected as the minimum value of |A| so that the following
      conditions were satisfied simultaneously:
           a. The group is cyclic, which implies that A2−4 is not a square in GF(p);
           b. The curve has cofactor h = 4, which implies that A+2 is not a square in GF(p);
           c. The quadratic twist has cofactor h1= 4;
           d. A has the form A ≡ 2 mod 4, which allows optimized implementations of the
              group law using the Montgomery ladder; and
           e. The curve and the quadratic twist both satisfy the cryptographic criteria in
              Appendix C.1.
   3. Select the base point G = (Gx, Gy) of order n, where |Gx| is minimal, and Gy is even.

C.2.3. Twisted Edwards Curves
The twisted Edwards curve Edwards25519 (Section 3.2.3.1) was obtained from the Montgomery
curve Curve25519 (Section 3.2.2.1) via a birational equivalence.
The Edwards curve E448 (Section 3.2.3.3) was obtained from the Montgomery curve Curve448
(Section 3.2.2.2) via a birational equivalence.
The Edwards curve Edwards448 (Section 3.2.3.2) was obtained from the curve E448 (Section
3.2.3.3) via a 4-isogenous mapping (see Appendix B.4).

C.2.4. Weierstrass Curves over Binary Fields

C.2.4.1.          Koblitz Curves K-233, K-283, K-409, and K-571
Each of the curves K-233 (Section 3.3.1.2), K-283 (Section 3.3.1.3), K-409 (Section 3.3.1.4),
and K-571 (Section 3.3.1.5) is a curve Ba,b in short-Weierstrass form with cofactor h = 2 or h = 4.
Each curve is defined over a binary field GF(2m), where m is a prime number. For Koblitz
curves, the curve parameters a and b are elements of GF(2) with b = 1. Hence, for each
parameter m, there are only two Koblitz curves with a = 0 and a = 1. Koblitz curves with a = 0
have order 0 modulo 4, while those with a = 1 have order 2 modulo 4.
The curve parameters a and m were chosen to satisfy the following:
   1. The parameter a was set to a = 0.
   2. The set of integers m in the interval [160,600] was determined so that the following
      conditions were satisfied simultaneously:
           a. m is a prime number;
