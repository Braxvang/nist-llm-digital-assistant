   6. The client sends authentication information and the Target Server Ticket to the
      TS.
   7. The TS checks the authentication information and the validity period of the Target
      Server Ticket; if the information is reasonable, the user is authenticated to the TS.

The protocol may be extended to authenticate the TS to the user, and a ticket may be re-
used within its validity period.

                           Figure 6-1: The Kerberos Protocol

Each TGS has its own “realm” of clients and TSs. However, different realms may be
linked by the sharing of inter-realm keys between TGS's (see Figure 6-2). A client in
Realm 1 wishing a service on a TS in Realm 2 may obtain a ticket from TGS1 that
introduces the client to TGS2. This ticket is encrypted with the inter-realm key shared
between TGS1 and TGS2. The client can then request a ticket from TGS2 for the desired
service on the TS in Realm 2. Thus, realms may be networked to provide clients with
inter-realm services.
