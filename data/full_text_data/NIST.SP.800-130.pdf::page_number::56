may be derived from information shared by the entities (key agreement). The method of
transporting keys or sharing information may be either manual (e.g., sent by courier) or
automated (e.g., sent over the Internet).

FR: 6.57 The CKMS design shall specify how, and the circumstances under which, keys
and their metadata are established.

6.4.19 Enter a Key and Associated Metadata into a Cryptographic Module
The key entry function is used to enter one or more keys and associated metadata into a
cryptographic module in preparation for active use. Keys and metadata may be entered in
plaintext form, in encrypted form, as key splits, in an integrity-protected form (e.g., in a
signed certificate) or any combination thereof.

FR: 6.58 The CKMS design shall specify how, and the circumstances under which, keys
and metadata are entered into a cryptographic module, the form in which they are
entered, and the method used for entry 14.

FR: 6.59 The CKMS design shall specify how the integrity and confidentiality (if
necessary) of the entered keys and metadata are protected and verified upon entry.

6.4.20 Output a Key and Associated Metadata from a Cryptographic Module
The key output function outputs one or more keys and associated metadata from a
cryptographic module for external use or storage. Output may be for archive, backup, or
normal, operational purposes. A module that serves as a key generation facility may
output keys for subsequent distribution. Keys and metadata may be output in plaintext
form, in encrypted form, as key splits, in integrity-protected form, or any combination
thereof.

FR: 6.60 The CKMS design shall specify how, and the circumstances under which, keys
and metadata are output from a cryptographic module and the form in which they are
output.

FR:6.61 The CKMS design shall specify how the confidentiality and integrity of the
output keys and metadata are protected while outside of a cryptographic module.

FR: 6.62 If a private key, symmetric key, or confidential metadata is output from the
cryptographic module in plaintext form, the CKMS design shall specify if and how the
calling entity is authenticated before the key and metadata are provided.

6.4.21 Validate Public Key Domain Parameters
This function performs certain validity checks on the public domain parameters of some
public key algorithms. Passing these tests provides assurance that the domain parameters
are arithmetically correct (see [SP 800-89] and [SP 800-56A]).
