GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



5.2.2     Appropriate Placement of Tags and Readers

Control: RFID system equipment can be placed to minimize unnecessary electromagnetic radiation.
Tags and readers can be kept away from:

 Fuel, ordnance, and other materials that could cause harm if exposed to electromagnetic radiation,
 Humans and sensitive products (e.g., blood, medicine) that might be harmed by sustained exposure to
  RF subsystem radiation,
 Metal and reflective objects that can modify and amplify signals in unintended and potentially
  harmful ways, and
 Legitimate radios with which the RF subsystem communication will cause interference.
Applicability: All environments in which the organization deploying RFID systems determines the
location of the RF equipment (which excludes many consumer and supply chain applications).

Benefits:

 Reduced risk of interference with legitimate radios
 Reduced risk of eavesdropping and unauthorized RF subsystem transactions
 Mitigation of HERF/HERO/HERP
Weaknesses:

 Tag location cannot always be controlled, such as when tags are used to track mobile items (e.g.,
  hospital cart) or items in transit (e.g., pallet on a truck).
 Radio interference may persist even if the tags or readers are placed in a new location that is still
  sufficiently close to other radios. 43
5.2.3     Secure Disposal of Tags

Control: Secure disposal involves physically or electronically destroying tags, as opposed to just
discarding them, when they are no longer needed to perform their intended function. Physical destruction
may involve manual tearing or shredding using a paper shredder. Electronic destruction can be
accomplished by using a tag’s kill feature or using a strong electromagnetic field to render a tag’s
circuitry permanently inoperable. When a tag supports an electronic disabling mechanism, it usually is the
preferred way to disable a tag before it is disposed because it can be accomplished without touching each
tag, thereby reducing the cost of the effort. The kill feature is also discussed in Section 5.3.3.3.

Applicability: RFID applications in which the continued operating presence of a tag after it has
performed its intended function poses a business intelligence or privacy risk (e.g., an adversary can
subsequently use the presence of the tag to track items or people).

Benefits: Destroying or disabling tags:

 Eliminates the possibility that they could be used later for tracking or targeting, and

     In this situation, a panel or wall of grounded wire fencing between the two RF sources is a possible alternative means to
     reduce interference.
