Education develops a common body of knowledge that reflects all of the various specialties and aspects of
PII protection. It is used to develop privacy professionals who are able to implement privacy programs
that enable their organizations to proactively respond to privacy challenges.

4.2      Privacy-Specific Safeguards46

Privacy-specific safeguards are controls for protecting the confidentiality of PII. These controls provide
types of protections not usually needed for other types of data. Privacy-specific safeguards help
organizations collect, maintain, use, and disseminate data in ways that protect the confidentiality of the
data.

4.2.1      Minimizing the Use, Collection, and Retention of PII

The practice of minimizing the use, collection, and retention of PII is a basic privacy principle. 47 By
limiting PII collections to the least amount necessary to conduct its mission, the organization may limit
potential negative consequences in the event of a data breach involving PII. Organizations should
consider the total amount of PII used, collected, and maintained, as well as the types and categories of PII
used, collected, and maintained. This general concept is often abbreviated as the ―minimum necessary‖
principle. PII collections should only be made where such collections are essential to meet the authorized
business purpose and mission of the organization. If the PII serves no current business purpose, then the
PII should no longer be used or collected.

Also, an organization should regularly review 48 its holdings of previously collected PII to determine
whether the PII is still relevant and necessary for meeting the organization‘s business purpose and
mission.49 If PII is no longer relevant and necessary, then PII should be properly destroyed. The
destruction or disposal of PII must be conducted in accordance with any litigation holds and the Federal
Records Act and records control schedules approved by the National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA). 50 Organizations should also ensure that retired hardware has been properly

      The frequency of reviews should be done in accordance with laws, regulations, mandates, and organizational policies that
      apply to the collection of PII.

      The Privacy Act requires that Federal agencies only maintain records relevant and necessary to their mission. 5 U.S.C. §
      552a(e)(1). Also, OMB directed Federal agencies to review their PII holdings annually and to reduce their holdings to the
      minimum necessary for proper performance of their missions. OMB M-07-16.
