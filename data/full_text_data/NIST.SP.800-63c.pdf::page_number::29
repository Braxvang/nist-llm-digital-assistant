                                                                                             generally through the front channel. The assertion reference itself contains no information about
                                                                                             the subscriber and SHALL be resistant to tampering and fabrication by an attacker. The RP

                                                                                             As shown in Figure 7-1, the back-channel presentation model consists of three steps:

                                                                                                        1. The IdP sends an assertion reference to the subscriber through the front channel.
