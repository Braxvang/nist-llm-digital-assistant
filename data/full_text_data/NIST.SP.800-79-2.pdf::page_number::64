Control Description— Before the PIV Card is provided to the applicant, the issuer performs a 1:1
biometric match of the applicant against biometrics available on the PIV Card or in the chain-of-
trust. The 1:1 biometric match requires either a match of fingerprint(s) or, if unavailable, other
optional biometric data that are available. If the match is unsuccessful, or if no biometric data is
available, the cardholder provides two identity source documents (as specified in [FIPS 201-2],
Section 2.7), and an attending operator inspects these and compares the cardholder with the
facial image printed on the PIV Card.
