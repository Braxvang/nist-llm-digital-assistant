Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific use of the general information and not on
the time required to re-establish access to the general information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
general information is low.

C.3 Rationale and Factors for Government Resource Management
   Information
Resource management functions are the back office support activities that enable the government
to operate effectively. Security objectives and impacts for resource management functions are
determined by the direct service missions and constituencies ultimately being supported. It is
likely that all Federal government information systems store, process, and operate under the
control of IT infrastructure maintenance information (e.g., password files and file and network
access settings). A basic set of security controls will apply to this information and processes to
combat potential corruption, misuse, or abuse of system information and processes.

C.3.1 Administrative Management

Administrative Management involves the day-to-day management and maintenance of the
internal infrastructure. Administrative information is usually routine and is relatively low
impact. However, some administrative management information is either very sensitive (e.g.,
logistics management for nuclear or other hazardous materials, security management
information, and security clearance management information) or critical (e.g., inventory control
and logistics management information needed to support time-critical operations). National
security information is outside the scope of this guideline. [See Appendix A, Glossary of Terms,
for a definition of national security information/systems.] Routine administrative management
information systems that do not process classified information are not usually designated
national security systems, even if they are critical to the direct fulfillment of military or
intelligence missions.
C.3.1.1 Facilities, Fleet, and Equipment Management Information Type

Facilities, Fleet, and Equipment management involves the maintenance, administration,
certification, and operation of office buildings, fleets, machinery, and other capital assets
considered as possessions of the Federal government. Impacts to some information and
information systems associated with facilities, fleet, and equipment management may affect the
security of some key national assets (e.g., nuclear power plants, dams, and other government
facilities). The following recommended provisional categorization of the facilities, fleet, and
equipment management information type is particularly subject to change where critical
infrastructure elements or key national assets are involved:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low 19 ), (integrity, Low20), (availability, Low 20 )}



19
     Impact level is usually high where safety of major critical infrastructure components or key national assets is at
     stake.
