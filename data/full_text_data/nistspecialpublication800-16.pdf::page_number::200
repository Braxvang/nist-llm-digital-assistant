Information Technology Security Training Requirements


Total Risk    —   the potential for the occurrence of an adverse event if no mitigating action is
taken (i.e., the potential for any applicable threat to exploit a system vulnerability). (See
Acceptable Risk, Residual Risk, and Minimum Level of Protection.)


Training    —teaching people the knowledge and skills that will enable them to perform their
jobs more effectively.


Training Assessment  — an evaluation of            the training efforts.


Training Effectiveness — measurement of what a given
                                   a                                 student has learned from a specific
course or training event, i.e., learning effectiveness; a pattern of student outcomes following a
specific course or training event; i.e., teaching effectiveness; and the value of the specific class or
training event, compared to other options in the context of an agency's overall IT security
training program; i.e., program effectiveness.


Training Effectiveness Evaluation            — information    collected to assist employees and their
supervisors in assessing individual students' subsequent on-the-job performance, to provide trend
data to assist trainers in improving both learning and teaching, and to be used in retum-on-
investment statistics to enable responsible officials to allocate limited resources in a thoughtful,
strategic manner among the spectrum of IT security awareness, security literacy, training, and
education options for optimal results among the workforce as a whole.
