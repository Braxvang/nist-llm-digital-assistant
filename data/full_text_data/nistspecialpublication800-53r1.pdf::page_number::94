IA-3      DEVICE IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

          Control: The information system identifies and authenticates specific devices before establishing a
          connection.
          Supplemental Guidance: The information system typically uses either shared known information
          (e.g., Media Access Control (MAC) or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
          addresses) or an organizational authentication solution (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible
          Authentication Protocol (EAP) or a Radius server with EAP-Transport Layer Security (TLS)
          authentication) to identify and authenticate devices on local and/or wide area networks. The
          required strength of the device authentication mechanism is determined by the FIPS 199 security
          categorization of the information system with higher impact levels requiring stronger
          authentication.
          Control Enhancements: None.

IA-4      IDENTIFIER MANAGEMENT

          Control: The organization manages user identifiers by: (i) uniquely identifying each user; (ii)
          verifying the identity of each user; (iii) receiving authorization to issue a user identifier from an
          appropriate organization official; (iv) issuing the user identifier to the intended party; (v) disabling
          the user identifier after [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of inactivity; and (vi)
          archiving user identifiers.
          Supplemental Guidance: Identifier management is not applicable to shared information system
          accounts (e.g., guest and anonymous accounts). FIPS 201 and Special Publications 800-73, 800-
          76, and 800-78 specify a personal identity verification (PIV) credential for use in the unique
          identification and authentication of federal employees and contractors.
          Control Enhancements: None.
