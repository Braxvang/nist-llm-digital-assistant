       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                         Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

2253   B.3.1.2.         Instantiating Sub-DRBG2
2254   Sub-DRBG2 is instantiated using the following Instantiate_function call (see Section 2.8.1.1):
2255    (status, sub-DRBG2_state_handle) = Instantiate_function (256, prediction_resistance_flag =
2256                                 FALSE, “Sub-DRBG App 2”).
2257       •     A security strength of 256 bits is requested from the randomness source (the DRBG
2258             construction indicated by RBG1_state_handle).
2259       •     Setting “prediction_resistance_flag = FALSE” indicates that a consuming application will
2260             not be allowed to request prediction resistance. Optionally, the parameter can be omitted.
2261       •     The personalization string to be used for sub-DRBG2 is “Sub-DRBG App 2.”
2262       •     The returned state handle will be sub-DRBG2_state_handle.
2263   The randomness input for establishing the 256-bit security strength of sub-DRBG2 is requested
2264   using the following Generate_function call to the RBG1 construction):
2265           (status, randomness-source_input) = Generate_function(RBG1_state_handle, 384, 256,
2266                         prediction_resistance_request = FALSE, additional_input).
2267       •     384 bits are requested from the source RBG (indicated by RBG1_state_handle) at a security
2268             strength of 256 bits (384 = 256 + 128 = 3s/2).
2269       •     Setting “prediction_resistance_flag = FALSE” indicates that the source RBG (the RBG1
2270             construction) will not need to reseed itself before generating the requested output.
2271             Alternatively, the parameter can be omitted.
2272       •     Additional input is optional.
2273   If status = SUCCESS is returned from the Generate_function, the HMAC_DRBG in sub-DRBG2
2274   is seeded using the randomness-source_input obtained from the RBG1 construction and the
2275   personalization_string provided in the Instantiate_function call (i.e., “Sub-DRBG App 2”). The
2276   internal state is recorded for Sub-DRBG2 (including the 256-bit security strength), and status =
2277   SUCCESS is returned from the Instantiate_function along with a state handle of sub-
2278   DRBG2_state_handle.
2279   If status = FAILURE is returned from the Generate_function call, then the internal state is not
2280   created, status = FAILURE and a Null state handle are returned from the Instantiate_function,
2281   and the sub-DRBG2 cannot be used to generate bits.

2282   B.3.2. Pseudorandom Bit Generation by Sub-DRBGs
2283   Assuming that the sub-DRBG has been successfully instantiated (see Appendix B.3.1),
2284   pseudorandom bits are requested from the sub-DRBG by a consuming application using the
2285   Generate_function call as specified in Section 2.8.1.2:
2286           (status, returned_bits) = Generate_function(state_handle, requested_number_of_bits,
2287                      security_strength, prediction_resistance_request, additional input),
2288   where:
2289       •     For sub_DRBG1, state_handle = sub-DRBG1_state_handle;

                                                         67
