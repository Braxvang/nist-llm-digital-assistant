Appendix F. Trustworthiness and Assurance
The trustworthiness of a system is based on the concept of assurance. Assurance is the grounds
for justified confidence that a claim or set of claims has been or will be achieved [61]. Justified
confidence is derived from objective evidence that reduces uncertainty to an acceptable level
and, in doing so, reduces the associated risk (Section F.2). 85 Evidence is produced by
engineering verification and validation methods. 86 The evidence must be relevant, accurate,
credible, and of sufficient quantity to enable reasoned conclusions and consensus among subject-
matter experts that the claims are satisfied. The relationship between evidence and claims can be
represented in many ways. Section F.2 discusses these approaches.


                     “The trust we place in our digital infrastructure should be proportional to how
                     trustworthy and transparent that infrastructure is and to the consequences
                     we will incur if that trust is misplaced.”

F.1.         Trust and Trustworthiness
As discussed in Section 2.3, trust and trustworthiness are foundational concepts to engineering
trustworthy secure systems, to the decisions made to grant trust, and to the extent to which trust
is granted based on demonstrated trustworthiness. Trust is a belief that an entity meets certain
expectations and can, therefore, be relied upon. A trustworthy entity requires sufficient evidence
to support its trustworthiness claims. Trustworthiness is demonstrated based on evidence that
supports a stated claim or judgment of being worthy to be trusted [2] [20] [21].

Trust in an entity can occur without a basis for or knowledge of the entity’s trustworthiness. This
may occur because (1) there is no alternative (e.g., an individual trusts the components involved
in an Internet transaction without knowing anything about the components), (2) the need for
trustworthiness is not realized and occurs de facto, or (3) other reasons (e.g., miscommunication
or misrepresentation of evidence) [58]. Since the decision to trust an entity is not necessarily
based on a judgment of trustworthiness, the decision to trust an entity should consider the
significance (i.e., consequences, effects, and impacts) of trust expectations not being fulfilled.
The criteria to grant trust are used to determine the trustworthiness of an entity. Trust granted
without establishing the required trustworthiness is a significant contributor to risk.

F.1.1. Roles of Requirements in Trustworthiness
Trustworthiness judgments are based on expectations to be fulfilled by the entity to be trusted.
The expectations of trustworthiness of the system, inclusive of its elements, are found in the
system capability, performance, security, and other requirements. These judgments are
