2.8 Differences between a Framework and a Profile
A Framework requires that specific topics be addressed in the design of a CKMS, but it is
not judgmental on the design itself. Any CKMS could be designed and specified in
accordance with this Framework. On the other hand, a Profile states what requirements
must be met in order to have a satisfactory CKMS for the designated using sector. A
CKMS Profile makes judgments (i.e., specifies what is necessary to be implemented and
used to be compliant with the Profile). CKMS that comply with this Framework may not
comply with a particular profile. For example, FR:2.1 in Section 2.1 requires that the
CKMS design specify all cryptographic algorithms that are used by the CKMS. A U.S.
Federal CKMS Profile might require that only NIST-approved cryptographic algorithms
be used.

2.9 Example of a Distributed CKMS Supporting a Secure E-Mail Application
Figure 5 depicts a distributed CKMS that communicates among systems (shown in the
figure as System A, System B, and System C) via the Internet. The CKMS consists of the
union of all the CKMS modules (shown in the figure as CKMS Module A, CKMS
Module B, and CKMS Module C). Each CKMS module is considered a logical entity
within its system. Any parts of the system that perform CKMS functions are parts of the
logical CKMS module at the time those functions are performed. In addition, parts of the
CKMS module (e.g., an encryption algorithm) may be used by other applications (e.g.,
encrypting general data).

The actual communication mechanisms that interact with the other systems containing
CKMS modules via the Internet are not part of the CKMS. However, the parts of
