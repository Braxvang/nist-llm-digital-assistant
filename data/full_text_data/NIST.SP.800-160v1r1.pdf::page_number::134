NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                  Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

       Note 1: All stakeholders have security concerns. Some concerns are explicitly known and can be
       stated; others are initially implicit, not necessarily known, and must be made explicit through
       discourse.
       Note 2: This includes stakeholders who represent milestone decision authority, regulatory,
       certification, authorization, acceptance, and similar organizations with specific security-relevant
       decision-making authority and responsibilities.
       SN-1.2 Define the stakeholder protection needs and requirements definition strategy.
       Note: The strategy includes addressing how consensus about protection needs and
       requirements is to be achieved among stakeholders with opposing interests.
       SN-1.3 Identify the security aspects for enabling systems or services needed to support
              stakeholder needs and requirements definition.
       SN-1.4 Identify and plan for enabling systems or services needed to support the security
              aspects of stakeholder needs and requirements definition.
       SN-1.5 Obtain or acquire access to the security aspects of enabling systems or services to be
              used in stakeholder needs and requirements definition.

SN-2   DEVELOP THE OPERATIONAL AND OTHER LIFE CYCLE CONCEPTS
       SN-2.1 Define a representative set of scenarios to identify required protection capabilities and
              security measures that correspond to anticipated operational and other life cycle
              concepts.
       Note: The scenarios reflect how the system is intended to behave in the intended operational
       environments. Scenarios also help to identify security-driven changes to life cycle concepts.
       SN-2.2 Characterize the security aspects of the operational environments and the intended
              users.
       Note 1: This includes distinguishing what is and is not known about adversity within the
       operational environments.
       Note 2: This includes the trust expectations for users to address insider threat concerns. If a user
       security aspect cannot be obtained or there is uncertainty about the trust of users, it will
       significantly drive design and the operational procedure to complement the design.
       SN-2.3 Identify the interactions among entities and the system and security-relevant factors
              affecting the interactions.
       Note: The interactions among entities (e.g., personnel, enabling systems, and interfacing
       systems) and the system and the factors affecting the interactions need to be understood to
       inform engineering efforts. Factors influencing the interactions include the environment of the
       system of interest and any system of systems to which the system of interest belongs, as well as
       the characterization of the entities with which the system interacts.
       SN-2.4 Identify the security-relevant constraints on a system solution.
