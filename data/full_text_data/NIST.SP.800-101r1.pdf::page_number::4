The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the
development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
Federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,

Mobile device forensics is the science of recovering digital evidence from a mobile device under
forensically sound conditions using accepted methods. Mobile device forensics is an evolving
specialty in the field of digital forensics. This guide attempts to bridge the gap by providing an in-
depth look into mobile devices and explaining technologies involved and their relationship to
forensic procedures. This document covers mobile devices with features beyond simple voice
communication and text messaging capabilities. This guide also discusses procedures for the
validation, preservation, acquisition, examination, analysis, and reporting of digital information.
