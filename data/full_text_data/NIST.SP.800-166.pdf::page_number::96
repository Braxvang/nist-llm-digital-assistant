                                                                      DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

9.1.1 X.509 Certificate for Derived PIV Authentication

9.1.1.1 BER-TLV of X.509 Certificate for Derived PIV Authentication

 Test Assertion            TA-09.01.01.01
 Purpose                   Verifies that the X.509 Certificate for Derived PIV Authentication
                           conforms to the Derived PIV data model requirements.
 DTR(s)                    • DTR-07.01.02.01
 Issuer Documentation      None.
 Precondition(s)           • A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                              appropriate token reader.
                           • Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                              an instance of the reader.
 Test Scenario             1. Send the SELECT command with
                                 • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                           2. Send the GET DATA command with
                                 • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                    ('5FC105') of the X.509 Certificate for
                                    Derived PIV Authentication data object
                           3. Read and parse the byte array in accordance with
                              BER-TLV format.
 Expected Result(s)        1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                              template with the status word '90 00'.
                           2. From Step 2, the command returns status word '90 00' along
                              with the X.509 Certificate for Derived PIV Authentication data
                              object.
                           3. From Step 3, all mandatory tags for the X.509 Certificate for
                              Derived PIV Authentication data object are present in the order
                              indicated in Table 10 of [SP800-73], Part 1.

9.1.2 X.509 Certificate for Digital Signature

9.1.2.1 BER-TLV of X.509 Certificate for Digital Signature

 Test Assertion             TA-09.01.02.01
 Purpose                    Verifies that the X.509 Certificate for Digital Signature (if present)
                            conforms to the Derived PIV data model requirements.
 DTR(s)                     • DTR-07.01.01.01

 Issuer Documentation       None.

 Precondition(s)            •   A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                                appropriate token reader.
                            •   Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                                an instance of the reader.
