•      Translating the information security requirements from the segment architecture into specific
       security controls for information systems/environments of operation as part of the solution
       architecture;
•      Allocating management, operational, and technical security controls to information systems
       and environments of operation as defined by the information security architecture; and
•      Documenting risk management decisions at all levels of the enterprise architecture.40

Enterprise architecture provides a disciplined and structured approach to achieving consolidation,
standardization, and optimization of information technology assets that are employed within
organizations. Risk reduction can be achieved through the full integration of management
processes41 organization-wide, thereby providing greater degrees of security, privacy, reliability,
and cost-effectiveness for the missions and business functions being carried out by organizations.
This integrated approach of incorporating the organization’s risk management strategy into
enterprise architecture gives senior leaders/executives the opportunity to make more informed
risk-based decisions in dynamic operating environments—decisions based on trade-offs between
fulfilling and improving organizational missions and business functions and managing the many
types and sources of risk that must be considered in their risk management responsibilities.


     The use of enterprise architecture can greatly enhance an organization’s risk posture by providing
     greater transparency and clarity in design and development activities—enabling a more consistent
     application of the principle of ‘wise use’ of technologies across the organization; optimizing the
     trade‐offs between value gained from and the risk being incurred through the information systems
     supporting organizational missions/business functions.




2.5 TIER THREE—INFORMATION SYSTEMS VIEW
All information systems, including operational systems, systems under development, and systems
undergoing modification, are in some phase of the system development life cycle.42 In addition to
the risk management activities carried out at Tier 1 and Tier 2 (e.g., reflecting the organization’s
risk management strategy within the enterprise architecture and embedded information security
architecture), risk management activities are also integrated into the system development life
cycle of organizational information systems at Tier 3. The risk management activities at Tier 3
reflect the organization’s risk management strategy and any risk related to the cost, schedule, and
performance requirements for individual information systems supporting the mission/business
functions of organizations. Risk management activities take place at every phase in the system
development life cycle with the outputs at each phase having an effect on subsequent phases.


40
  The activities required to effectively incorporate information security into enterprise architecture are carried out by
key stakeholders within organizations including mission/business owners, chief information officers, chief information
security officers, authorizing officials, and the risk executive (function).
41
   A management process is a process for planning and controlling the performance or execution of organizational
activities (e.g., programs, projects, tasks, processes). Management processes are often referred to as performance
measurement and management systems.
42
   There are typically five phases in system development life cycles: (i) initiation; (ii) development/ acquisition; (iii)
implementation; (iv) operation/maintenance; and (v) disposal. Organizations may use a variety of system development
life cycle processes including, for example, waterfall, spiral, or agile development.
