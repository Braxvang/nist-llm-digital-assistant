1390   3.4.11. Information Location
1391             REQUIREMENT: 03.04.11

1392             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
1393             Determine if:
1394             A.03.04.11.a[01]: the location of CUI is identified and documented.
1395             A.03.04.11.a[02]: the system components on which CUI is processed are identified and
1396             documented.
1397             A.03.04.11.a[03]: the system components on which CUI is stored are identified and
1398             documented.
1399             A.03.04.11.b[01]: users who have access to the system and system components where CUI is
1400             processed are identified and documented.
1401             A.03.04.11.b[02]: users who have access to the system and system components where CUI is
1402             stored are identified and documented.
1403             A.03.04.11.c[01]: changes to the location (i.e., system or system components) where CUI is
1404             processed are documented.
1405             A.03.04.11.c[02]: changes to the location (i.e., system or system components) where CUI is
1406             stored are documented.
