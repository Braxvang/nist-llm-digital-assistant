       NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                      Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
       November 2023

1571             DISCUSSION
1572             Safeguarding measures applied to system distribution and transmission lines prevent accidental
1573             damage, disruption, and physical tampering. Such measures may also be necessary to prevent
1574             eavesdropping or the modification of unencrypted transmissions. Safeguarding measures used
1575             to control physical access to system distribution and transmission lines include disconnected or
1576             locked spare jacks, locked wiring closets, protecting cabling with conduit or cable trays, and
1577             wiretapping sensors. Controlling physical access to output devices includes placing output
1578             devices in locked rooms or other secured areas with keypad or card reader access controls and
1579             allowing access to authorized individuals only, placing output devices in locations that can be
1580             monitored by personnel, installing monitor or screen filters, and using headphones. Examples of
1581             output devices include monitors, printers, scanners, audio devices, facsimile machines, and
1582             copiers.

1586           Risk Assessment

1587   3.11.1. Risk Assessment
1588             REQUIREMENT: 03.11.01
1589             a. Assess the risk (including supply chain risk) of unauthorized disclosure resulting from the
1590                processing, storage, or transmission of CUI.
1591             b. Update risk assessments periodically.

1592             DISCUSSION
1593             Establishing the system boundary is a prerequisite to assessing the risk of unauthorized
1594             disclosure of CUI. Risk assessments consider threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and adverse
1595             impacts to organizational operations and assets based on the operation and use of the system
1596             and the unauthorized disclosure of CUI. Risk assessments also consider risks from external
1597             parties (e.g., service providers, contractors operating systems on behalf of the organization,
1598             individuals accessing systems, outsourcing entities). Risk assessments can be conducted at the
1599             organization level, the mission or business process level, or the system level and at any phase in
1600             the system development life cycle. Risk assessments include supply chain-related risks
1601             associated with suppliers or contractors and the system, system component, or system service
1602             that they provide.

1606   3.11.2. Vulnerability Monitoring and Scanning
1607             REQUIREMENT: 03.11.02
1608             a. Monitor and scan for vulnerabilities in the system periodically and when new vulnerabilities
1609                affecting the system are identified.
