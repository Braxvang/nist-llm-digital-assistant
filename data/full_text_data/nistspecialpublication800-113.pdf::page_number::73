 Data link layer VPNs can protect various network protocols, so they are often used for non-IP
  protocols. Data link layer VPNs are most commonly used on top of PPP to secure modem-based
  connections, although PPP actually encrypts the traffic.

         –   PPTP protects communications between a PPTP-enabled client and a PPTP-enabled server,
             and uses GRE to transport data between them.

         –   L2TP protects communications between an L2TP-enabled client and an L2TP-enabled server
             and uses its own tunneling protocol over UDP port 1701 to transport data.

         –   L2F protects communications between two network devices, such as ISP network access
             servers and VPN gateways. It is transparent to users, but it does not protect communications
             between users’ systems and ISPs.
 Network layer VPNs provide secure communication between two hosts or networks without
  modifying any applications. IPsec is the most common network layer VPN; it is used to secure some
  or all communications between two endpoints. In addition to protecting the data in the packet, IPsec
  also protects the IP information, such as IP addresses. IPsec VPNs only support IP and provide less
  flexibility and control for protecting specific applications.
 So-called application layer “VPNs” are protocols that allow encryption to be added to application
  data. These are not really VPNs because there is no network involved.
