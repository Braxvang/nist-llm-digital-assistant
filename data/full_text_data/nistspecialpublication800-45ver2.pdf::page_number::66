GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



after a period of inactivity. Appliances are available that support the most commonly used Web-based
mail systems.

Client security issues exist that also need to be considered before an organization approves the
deployment of Web access to email. These issues are discussed in Section 8.4.

6.7   Checklist for Securing Mail Servers and Content

          Completed                                              Action
                          Harden the mail server application
                          Install the mail server software on a dedicated host (if Web-based mail access is
                          desired, install the mail server software on a different host from the Web server)
                          Apply any patches or upgrades to correct for known vulnerabilities
                          Create a dedicated physical disk or logical partition (separate from operating
                          system and mail server application) for mailboxes, or host the mailboxes on a
                          separate server
                          Remove or disable all services installed by the mail server application but not
                          required (e.g., Web-based mail, FTP, remote administration)
                          Remove or disable all unneeded default login accounts created by the mail
                          server installation
                          Remove all manufacturer documentation from server
                          Remove any example or test files from server
                          Apply appropriate security template or hardening script to the server
                          Reconfigure SMTP, POP and IMAP service banners (and others as required)
                          NOT to report mail server and operating system type and version
                          Disable dangerous or unnecessary mail commands (e.g., VRFY and EXPN)
                          Configure operating system and mail server access controls
                          Limit the access of the mail server application to a subset of computational
                          resources
                          Limit the access of users through additional access controls enforced by the mail
                          server, where more detailed levels of access control are required
                          Configure the mail server application to execute only under a unique individual
                          user and group identity with restrictive access controls
                          Ensure the mail server is not running with root or system/administrator privileges
                          Configure the host operating system so that the mail server can write log files but
                          not read them
                          Configure the host operating system so that temporary files created by the mail
                          server application are restricted to a specified and appropriately protected
                          subdirectory
                          Configure the host operating system so that access to any temporary files
                          created by the mail server application is limited to the mail server processes that
                          created these files
                          Ensure that the mail server cannot save files outside of the specified files
                          structure dedicated to the mail server
                          Configure the mail server to run in a chroot jail on Linux and Unix hosts
                          Install usersâ€™ mailboxes on a different server (preferred), hard drive, or logical
                          partition than the operating system and mail server application
