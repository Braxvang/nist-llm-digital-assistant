interest. In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of state loan information will have only a
limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for state loan information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Loan assistance
activities are not generally time-critical. In most cases, the adverse effects of unauthorized
modification or destruction of state loan information on agency mission functions and public
confidence in the agency will be limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: There are significant differences between
the ability to modify a document authorizing a payment and the modification of the payment
itself. The unauthorized modification of a document authorizing a payment is less time critical
than the modification of the payment itself while the payment is in transit. Modifications to
payments in transit will result in immediate inaccurate payments. This can result in assignment
of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
state loan information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to state loan information. Loan assistance
processes are generally tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of access to state loan
information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
state loan information is low.
