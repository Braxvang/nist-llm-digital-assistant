3.    WLAN Security Monitoring

This section discusses two types of security monitoring: assessments [SP800-115, SP800-53A] and
continuous monitoring. Security assessment is “the process of determining how effectively an entity
being assessed meets specific security objectives.” Security assessments are typically performed
periodically, such as annually or quarterly, and are often called periodic assessments. Continuous
monitoring is defined in [SP800-137] as “maintaining ongoing awareness of information security,
vulnerabilities, and threats to support organizational risk management decisions. The objective is to
conduct ongoing monitoring of the security of an organization’s networks, information, and systems, and
respond by accepting, avoiding/rejecting, transferring/sharing, or mitigating risk as situations change.”
Think of continuous monitoring as doing assessments in near real-time, so that the organization can react
to problems in minutes instead of months or years.

For WLAN security, the same tools are often useful for both periodic assessments and continuous
monitoring. These forms of monitoring are used to ensure that each WLAN component’s security
configuration meets the organization’s requirements (and to report all deviations from these
requirements), as well as to monitor WLAN activity to identify attacks, improperly secured
communications, and other WLAN security issues. This section provides recommendations for WLAN
security monitoring (both periodic assessments and continuous monitoring).

As explained in Section 1.2, the recommendations presented in this section supplement those provided for
specific WLAN technologies by other NIST publications [SP800-48, SP800-97], as well as NIST
publications on general security assessment [SP800-115, SP800-53A] and continuous monitoring [SP800-
137].

3.1   WLAN Security Monitoring Basics

Security monitoring is important for all systems and networks, but it is generally even more important for
WLANs. WLANs and wired networks have the same security objectives and face the same general types
of threats, but WLAN security is typically harder to achieve for several reasons.

First, WLANs tend to be easier for attackers to access than wired networks. The most significant
difference between protecting WLANs and wired networks is the relative ease of intercepting wireless
network transmissions and inserting new or altered transmissions from what is presumed to be the
authentic source. To monitor traffic on a wired network, an attacker would have to gain physical access to
the network or remotely compromise systems on the network; for a WLAN, an attacker simply needs to
be within range of the wireless transmissions. (Some attackers use highly sensitive directional antennas,
which can greatly extend the effective range of attack beyond the standard WLAN range.)

Second, WLANs are often poorly secured. For example, many WLANs are configured so that they do not
require strong authentication; this makes it much easier, sometimes trivial, for attackers within range of
the WLAN to successfully gain access to it. These configurations are often used because they are more
convenient for users and administrators, but they often put the transmitted information and WLAN
devices at serious risk of compromise.

Third, WLANs are usually connected to an organization’s wired networks. This means that the WLANs
and WLAN devices are not only subject to WLAN-specific attacks, but also nearly all the attacks that
wired networks and devices on those networks face.

To support WLAN security, organizations should perform both attack monitoring and vulnerability
monitoring. Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 provide more information on these, respectively.
