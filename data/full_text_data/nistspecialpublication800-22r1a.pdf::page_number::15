A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



sequence can be characterized and described in terms of probability. The likely outcome of statistical
tests, when applied to a truly random sequence, is known a priori and can be described in probabilistic
terms. There are an infinite number of possible statistical tests, each assessing the presence or absence of
a “pattern” which, if detected, would indicate that the sequence is nonrandom. Because there are so many
tests for judging whether a sequence is random or not, no specific finite set of tests is deemed “complete.”
In addition, the results of statistical testing must be interpreted with some care and caution to avoid
incorrect conclusions about a specific generator (see Section 4).

A statistical test is formulated to test a specific null hypothesis (H0). For the purpose of this document,
the null hypothesis under test is that the sequence being tested is random. Associated with this null
hypothesis is the alternative hypothesis (Ha), which, for this document, is that the sequence is not
random. For each applied test, a decision or conclusion is derived that accepts or rejects the null
hypothesis, i.e., whether the generator is (or is not) producing random values, based on the sequence that
was produced.

For each test, a relevant randomness statistic must be chosen and used to determine the acceptance or
rejection of the null hypothesis. Under an assumption of randomness, such a statistic has a distribution of
possible values. A theoretical reference distribution of this statistic under the null hypothesis is
determined by mathematical methods. From this reference distribution, a critical value is determined
(typically, this value is "far out" in the tails of the distribution, say out at the 99 % point). During a test, a
test statistic value is computed on the data (the sequence being tested). This test statistic value is
compared to the critical value. If the test statistic value exceeds the critical value, the null hypothesis for
randomness is rejected. Otherwise, the null hypothesis (the randomness hypothesis) is not rejected (i.e.,
the hypothesis is accepted).

In practice, the reason that statistical hypothesis testing works is that the reference distribution and the
critical value are dependent on and generated under a tentative assumption of randomness. If the
randomness assumption is, in fact, true for the data at hand, then the resulting calculated test statistic
value on the data will have a very low probability (e.g., 0.01 %) of exceeding the critical value.
On the other hand, if the calculated test statistic value does exceed the critical value (i.e., if the low
probability event does in fact occur), then from a statistical hypothesis testing point of view, the low
probability event should not occur naturally. Therefore, when the calculated test statistic value exceeds
the critical value, the conclusion is made that the original assumption of randomness is suspect or faulty.
In this case, statistical hypothesis testing yields the following conclusions: reject H0 (randomness) and
accept Ha (non-randomness).

Statistical hypothesis testing is a conclusion-generation procedure that has two possible outcomes, either
accept H0 (the data is random) or accept Ha (the data is non-random). The following 2 by 2 table relates
the true (unknown) status of the data at hand to the conclusion arrived at using the testing procedure.

                                                                   CONCLUSION
                 TRUE SITUATION                          Accept H0       Accept Ha (reject H0)
             Data is random (H0 is true)                  No error           Type I error
            Data is not random (Ha is true)             Type II error         No error

If the data is, in truth, random, then a conclusion to reject the null hypothesis (i.e., conclude that the data
is non-random) will occur a small percentage of the time. This conclusion is called a Type I error. If the
data is, in truth, non-random, then a conclusion to accept the null hypothesis (i.e., conclude that the data is
actually random) is called a Type II error. The conclusions to accept H0 when the data is really random,
and to reject H0 when the data is non-random, are correct.
