its business functions. Tier 1 metrics may be calculated based on security-related information from
common, hybrid, and system-specific security controls. The metrics and the frequency with which
they are monitored15 and reported are determined by requirements to maintain operations within
organizational risk tolerances. As part of the overall governance structure established by the
organization, the Tier 1 risk management strategy and the associated monitoring requirements are
communicated throughout Tiers 2 and 3.

2.1.2 TIER 2 - MISSION/BUSINESS PROCESSES
Organizational officials that are accountable for one or more missions or business processes are
also responsible for overseeing the associated risk management activities for those processes. The
Tier 2 criteria for continuous monitoring of information security are defined by how core
mission/business processes are prioritized with respect to the overall goals and objectives of the
organization, the types of information needed to successfully execute the stated mission/business
processes, and the organization-wide information security program strategy. Controls in the
Program Management (PM) family are an example of Tier 2 security controls. These controls
address the establishment and management of the organization’s information security program.
Tier 2 controls are deployed organization-wide and support all information systems. They may be
tracked at Tier 2 or Tier 1. The frequencies with which Tier 2 security controls are assessed and
security status and other metrics are monitored are determined in part by the objectives and
priorities of the mission or business process and measurement capabilities inherent in the
infrastructure. 16 Security-related information may come from common, hybrid, and system-specific
controls. Metrics and dashboards can be useful at Tiers 1 and 2 in assessing, normalizing,
communicating, and correlating monitoring activities below the mission/business processes tier in a
meaningful manner.

2.1.3 TIER 3 - INFORMATION SYSTEMS
ISCM activities at Tier 3 address risk management from an information system perspective. These
activities include ensuring that all system-level security controls (technical, operational, and
management controls) are implemented correctly, operate as intended, produce the desired
outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system, and continue to be
effective over time. ISCM activities at Tier 3 also include assessing and monitoring hybrid and
common controls implemented at the system level. Security status reporting at this tier often
includes but is not limited to security alerts, security incidents, and identified threat activities. 17
The ISCM strategy for Tier 3 also ensures that security-related information supports the
monitoring requirements of other organizational tiers. Data feeds/assessment results from system-
level controls (system-specific, hybrid, or common), along with associated security status
reporting, support risk-based decisions at the organization and mission/business processes tiers.
Information is tailored for each tier and delivered in ways that inform risk-based decision making
at all tiers. Those resulting decisions impact the ISCM strategy applied at the information systems
tier. 18 ISCM metrics originating at the information systems tier can be used to assess, respond,

     Monitoring organizationally defined metrics is referred to as security status monitoring throughout this document.

     As an organization’s technical and human capital capabilities mature, monitoring capabilities increase.

     Threat activities include malicious activities observed on organizational networks or other anomalous activities
     that are indicators of inappropriate actions. See NIST SP 800-30, as amended, for more information on threats.

     A continuous monitoring strategy for an individual system may also include metrics related to its potential impact
     on other systems.
