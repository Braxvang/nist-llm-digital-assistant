          Heat-resistant and waterproof containers for backup media and vital non electronic records;
          Emergency master system shutdown switch;
          Offsite storage of backup media, non electronic records, and system documentation;
          Technical security controls, such as cryptographic key management; and
          Frequent scheduled backups including where the backups are stored (onsite or offsite) and how
           often they are recirculated and moved to storage.

3.4        Create Contingency Strategies

Organizations are required to adequately mitigate the risk arising from use of information and information
systems in the execution of mission/business processes. The challenge for organizations is in
implementing the right set of security controls. Guided by the RMF and in accordance with FIPS 199 and
NIST SP 800-53, security controls are selected and implemented. Contingency strategies are created to
mitigate the risks for the contingency planning family of controls and cover the full range of backup,
recovery, contingency planning, testing, and ongoing maintenance.

3.4.1      Backup and Recovery

Backup and recovery methods and strategies are a means to restore system operations quickly and
effectively following a service disruption. The methods and strategies should address disruption impacts
and allowable downtimes identified in the BIA and should be integrated into the system architecture
during the Development/Acquisition phase of the SDLC. A wide variety of recovery approaches may be
considered, with the appropriate choice being highly dependent upon the incident, type of system,
BIA/FIPS 199 impact level, and the system’s operational requirements. 22 Specific recovery methods
further described in Section 3.4.2 should be considered and may include commercial contracts with
alternate site vendors, reciprocal agreements with internal or external organizations, and service-level
agreements (SLAs) with equipment vendors. In addition, technologies such as redundant arrays of
independent disks (RAID), automatic failover, UPS, server clustering, and mirrored systems should be
considered when developing a system recovery strategy.

Several alternative approaches should be considered when developing and comparing strategies, including
cost, maximum downtimes, security, recovery priorities, and integration with larger, organization-level
contingency plans. Table is an example that can assist in identifying the linkage of FIPS 199 impact
level for the availability security objective, recovery priority, backup, and recovery strategy.

      Availability                   Recovery
     Impact Level
 Low                 Low priority - any outage with little impact,        Backup: Tape backup
                     damage, or disruption to the organization.           Strategy: Relocate or Cold site
 Moderate            Important or moderate priority - any                 Backup: Optical backup,
                     system that, if disrupted, would cause a             WAN/VLAN replication
                     moderate problem to the organization and             Strategy: Cold or Warm site
                     possibly other networks or systems.
