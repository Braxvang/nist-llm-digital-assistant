747   3.3.8. Protection of Audit Information
748           REQUIREMENT: 03.03.08
749           a. Protect audit information and audit logging tools from unauthorized access, modification, and
750              deletion.
751           b. Authorize access to management of audit logging functionality to only a subset of privileged
752              users or roles.

753           DISCUSSION
754           Audit information includes the information needed to successfully audit system activity, such as
755           audit records, audit log settings, audit reports, and personally identifiable information. Audit
756           logging tools are programs and devices used to conduct audit and logging activities. The
757           protection of audit information focuses on technical protection and limits the ability to access and
758           execute audit logging tools to authorized individuals. The physical protection of audit information
759           is addressed by media and physical protection requirements.
760           Individuals or roles with privileged access to a system and who are also the subject of an audit by
761           that system may affect the reliability of the audit information by inhibiting audit activities or
762           modifying audit records. Requiring privileged access to be further defined between audit-related
763           privileges and other privileges limits the number of users or roles with audit-related privileges.

769         Configuration Management

770   3.4.1. Baseline Configuration
771           REQUIREMENT: 03.04.01
772           a. Develop and maintain under configuration control, a current baseline configuration of the
773              system.
774           b. Review and update the baseline configuration of the system periodically and when system
775              components are installed or modified.

776           DISCUSSION
777           Baseline configurations for the system and system components include aspects of connectivity,
778           operation, and communications. Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed, and
779           agreed-upon specifications for the system or configuration items within the system. Baseline
