Sample Authorization Decision Letter (Interim Authorization to Operate)

From: Designated Authorizing Official                                           Date:

To: Organization Identity Management Official

Subject: Authorization Decision for [PCI / DPCI]

After reviewing the results of the assessment of the [PCI / DPCI], I have determined that the
requirements identified in [FIPS 201-2] and the organization’s policies, regulations, and
standards have not been implemented satisfactorily. However, I have determined that there is an
overarching need for the issuance services to continue due to mission necessity and other
considerations. Accordingly, I am issuing an interim authorization to operate (IATO). Operation
of the [PCI /DPCI] shall be performed in accordance with the enclosed terms and conditions
during the IATO period. The [PCI / DPCI] is not considered authorized during the IATO period.

This IATO also applies to facilities under the [PCI / DPCI]. Included is a list of facilities
authorized to operate during this interim period, along with specific limitations or restrictions
that apply.

This interim authorization to operate is valid for a maximum till close of business on <date [not
to exceed three months]. This interim authorization will remain in effect as long as— (i) the
required status reports for the [PCI / DPCI] are submitted to this office every month; (ii) the
problems or deficiencies reported from the authorization do not result in additional risk that is
deemed unacceptable; and (iii) continued progress is being made in reducing or eliminating the
deficiencies in accordance with the corrective actions plan (CAP). At the end of IATO period,
the [PCI / DPCI] must be ready to receive an authorization to operate. A second IATO will be
granted only in extenuating circumstances. This office will review the CAP submitted with the
authorization package during the IATO period and monitor progress on removal or reduction of
concerns and discrepancies before re-authorization is initiated.

A copy of this letter and all supporting authorization documentation shall be retained in
accordance with the organization’s record retention schedule.
