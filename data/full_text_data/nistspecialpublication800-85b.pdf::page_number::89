10.1.2.2 Verify signer public key size

Purpose                 Confirms that the size of the public key for digital signature used to sign
                        the CHUID is based on the expiration of the PIV card and is in
                        accordance with Table 3-3 of SP80078.
Reference(s)            1.    SP80078, Section 3.1
                        2.    AS06.01.17
Precondition            1.    A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                        2.    A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and
                              the contact reader.
                        3.    The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                        4.    A valid CHUID is present on the PIV card.
Test Steps              1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                        2. Set OID := <<CHUID (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.48.0)>>
                        3. Call pivGetData w/
                           • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                        4. Extract the expiration date from the CHUID (i.e. Tag
                           0x35)
                        5. Extract the certificates field contents from the
                           asymmetric signature of the CHUID.
                        6. Extract subjectPublicKeyInfo->algorithm->algorithm
                           field value
                        7. From the obtained certificate, extract the
                           subjectPublicKeyInfo->subjectPublicKey

                        Note: - Since the ECDSA keys do not have any size
                        restrictions based on dates, this test case does not apply
                        to these types of keys

Expected Result(s)      Verify that the size of the key from Step 7, algorithm from Step 6 and
                        expiration date from Step 4 are consistent with entries in Table 3-3 of
                        SP80078.
