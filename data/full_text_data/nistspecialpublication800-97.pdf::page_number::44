4.3.1      Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)

TKIP is a cipher suite for enhancing the WEP protocol on pre-RSN hardware without causing significant
performance degradation. TKIP works within the processing constraints of first-generation STAs and
APs, and therefore enables increased security without requiring hardware replacement. This section
provides an overview of TKIP, lists TKIP security features, and briefly describes the TKIP encapsulation
and decapsulation procedures, as well as the additional countermeasures that are available.

TKIP provides the following fundamental security features for IEEE 802.11 WLANs:

       Confidentiality protection using the RC4 algorithm 38
       Integrity protection against several types of attacks 39 using the Michael message digest algorithm
        (through generation of a message integrity code [MIC]) 40


38
      RC4 does not meet FIPS requirements for cryptographic algorithms. Accordingly, Federal agencies and others requiring
      FIPS-validated solutions cannot use WLAN security solutions based on RC4, including both TKIP and WEP.
39
      These attacks include modifying the destination address in bit flipping attacks, fragmentation attacks, and iterative key
      guessing attacks; and modifying the source address in impersonation attacks.
