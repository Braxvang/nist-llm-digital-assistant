July 2023                                                       Generation and Establishment Methods



Abstract
The approved sensitive security parameter generation and establishment methods listed in this
publication replace the ones listed in International Organization for Standardization/International
Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 19790 Annex D and ISO/IEC 24759 paragraph 6.16,
within the context of the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP). As a validation
authority, the CMVP may supersede Annex D in its entirety. This document also supersedes SP
800-140Dr1.

Reports on Computer Systems Technology
The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
with industry, government, and academic organizations.
