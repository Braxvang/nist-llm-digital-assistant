During FY 2021, NIST staff contributed to and held leadership positions in various standards
developing organizations (SDOs), including the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC),
the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
(IEEE), the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the 3rd Generation Partnership Project
(3GPP), and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). NIST also supports ANSI
(American National Standards Institute) X9, a non-profit standards development organization
chartered to develop voluntary open consensus standards for the financial services industry in
the US. The staff actively participated in standards bodies to raise awareness and influence the
development of privacy and cybersecurity standards, including efforts within the ISO/IEC (Joint
Technical Committee - JTC1).
NIST uses collaborative opportunities to highlight the role that standards play in enabling
technological innovation and interoperability among products and systems. International
collaboration and alignment on standards-based approaches to cybersecurity and privacy risk
management lead to greater innovation and a more effective and efficient utilization of resources.
NIST also shares information on standards processes, the importance of standards on the
economy and facilitating international trade, and the ability of standards to help secure systems
and infrastructure. NIST coordinates with interagency partners on strategic approaches and
communication on standards for the Federal Government.
The standards community is built upon international collaboration, and NIST leverages
its foundational and applied research efforts and experience in leadership to contribute to
the development of national and international standards. These standards activities span
cybersecurity, privacy, cryptography, Identity Management, and critical fields, such as 5G mobile
and cellular technologies, quantum technologies, cloud infrastructure management, blockchain
and distributed ledger technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), vehicle automation, and artificial
intelligence (AI).
