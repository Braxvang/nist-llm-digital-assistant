                   IT Security ABC's         — Terms and Concepts              (Continued)


   •    Firewalls and Separation of Duties    — Firewalls and   separation of duties have similar structures
        and complementary objectives: a firewall is a technical safeguard that provides separation
        between activities, systems, or system components so that a security failure or weakness in one
        is contained and has   no impact on other activities or systems (e.g., enforcing separation of the
        Internet from a Local Area Network). Separation of duties similarly provides separation, but
        its objective is to ensure that no single individual (acting alone) can compromise an application.

        In both cases, procedural and technical safeguards are used to enforce a basic security policy
        that high risk activities should be segregated from low risk activities and that one person should
        not be able to compromise a system.

   •    Goals   — The    goals of an IT security program can be summarized in three words:
        confidentiality - data must be protected against unauthorized disclosure; integrity - IT systems
        must not permit processes or data to be changed without authorization; and availability -
        authorized access to IT systems must be assured.

   •    Hackers/Crackers     — The term "hacker" was    originally coined to apply to individuals who
        focused on learning all they could about IT, often to the exclusion of many other facets of life
        (including sleeping and eating).    A "cracker" is any individual who uses advanced knowledge
        of networks or the Internet to compromise network security. Typically, when the traditional
        hacker compromised the security of an IT system, the objective was academic (i.e., a learning
        exercise), and any resulting damage or destruction was unintentional. Currently, the term
        hacker is being more widely used to describe any individual who attempts to compromise the
        security of an IT system, especially those whose intention is to cause disruption or obtain
        unauthorized access to data. Hacker/cracker activity generally gets high press coverage even
        though more mundane security incidents caused by unintentional actions of authorized users
        tend to cause greater disruption and loss.

   •    Individual Accountability/Responsibility     —A    basic tenet of IT security is that individuals must
        be accountable for their actions.   If this is not followed and enforced, it is not possible to

        successfully prosecute those who intentionally damage or disrupt systems, or to train those
        whose actions have unintended adverse effects. The concept of individual accountability drives
        the need for many security safeguards such as user identifiers, audit trails, and access
        authorization rules.

    •   Job Description/Job Function    —  To provide individuals with the training necessary to do their
        job, and to establish appropriate safeguards to enforce individual accountability, it is necessary
        to know what functions an individual is authorized to perform (i.e., their role(s) within the
        organization).    Some times this is accomplished using formalized/written job descriptions. In
        other situations, such assessments are based on analysis of the functions performed.
