          Figure 3-1. Information Security Program Maturity and Types of Measurement

A mature program normally uses multiple tracking mechanisms to document and quantify
various aspects of its performance. As more data becomes available, the difficulty of
measurement decreases and the ability to automate data collection increases. Data collection
automation depends on the availability of data from automated sources versus the availability of
data input by personnel. Manual data collection involves developing questionnaires and
conducting interviews and surveys with the organization’s staff. More usable data is available
from semi automated and automated data sources—such as self-assessment tools, certification
and accreditation (C&A) databases, and incident reporting/response databases—as an
information security program matures. Measures data collection is considered to be fully
automated when all data is gathered by automated data sources without human involvement or
intervention.

Types of measures (implementation, effectiveness/efficiency, and impact) that can realistically
be obtained and are useful for performance improvement depend on the maturity of the security
control implementation. Although different types of measures can be used simultaneously, the
primary focus of information security measures shifts as implementation of the information
security program matures. As information security program goals and strategic plans are
