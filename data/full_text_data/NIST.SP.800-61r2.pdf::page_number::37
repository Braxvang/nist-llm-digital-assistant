 Network flows      A network flow is a particular communication session occurring between hosts. Routers and
                    other networking devices can provide network flow information, which can be used to find
                    anomalous network activity caused by malware, data exfiltration, and other malicious acts. There
                    are many standards for flow data formats, including NetFlow, sFlow, and IPFIX.

                                                         People
 People from        Users, system administrators, network administrators, security staff, and others from within the
 within the         organization may report signs of incidents. It is important to validate all such reports. One
 organization       approach is to ask people who provide such information how confident they are of the accuracy
                    of the information. Recording this estimate along with the information provided can help
                    considerably during incident analysis, particularly when conflicting data is discovered.
 People from        Reports of incidents that originate externally should be taken seriously. For example, the
 other              organization might be contacted by a party claiming a system at the organization is attacking its
 organizations      systems. External users may also report other indicators, such as a defaced web page or an
                    unavailable service. Other incident response teams also may report incidents. It is important to
                    have mechanisms in place for external parties to report indicators and for trained staff to monitor
                    those mechanisms carefully; this may be as simple as setting up a phone number and email
                    address, configured to forward messages to the help desk.


3.2.4    Incident Analysis

Incident detection and analysis would be easy if every precursor or indicator were guaranteed to be
accurate; unfortunately, this is not the case. For example, user-provided indicators such as a complaint of
a server being unavailable are often incorrect. Intrusion detection systems may produce false positives—
incorrect indicators. These examples demonstrate what makes incident detection and analysis so difficult:
each indicator ideally should be evaluated to determine if it is legitimate. Making matters worse, the total
number of indicators may be thousands or millions a day. Finding the real security incidents that occurred
out of all the indicators can be a daunting task.

Even if an indicator is accurate, it does not necessarily mean that an incident has occurred. Some
indicators, such as a server crash or modification of critical files, could happen for several reasons other
than a security incident, including human error. Given the occurrence of indicators, however, it is
reasonable to suspect that an incident might be occurring and to act accordingly. Determining whether a
particular event is actually an incident is sometimes a matter of judgment. It may be necessary to
collaborate with other technical and information security personnel to make a decision. In many instances,
a situation should be handled the same way regardless of whether it is security related. For example, if an
organization is losing Internet connectivity every 12 hours and no one knows the cause, the staff would
want to resolve the problem just as quickly and would use the same resources to diagnose the problem,
regardless of its cause.

Some incidents are easy to detect, such as an obviously defaced web page. However, many incidents are
not associated with such clear symptoms. Small signs such as one change in one system configuration file
may be the only indicators that an incident has occurred. In incident handling, detection may be the most
difficult task. Incident handlers are responsible for analyzing ambiguous, contradictory, and incomplete
symptoms to determine what has happened. Although technical solutions exist that can make detection
