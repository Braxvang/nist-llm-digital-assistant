                                                                                      SECTION 4: RFID RISKS



    information from the RFID system in a number of ways, including eavesdropping on RFID
    transactions, reading tags, and gaining access to RFID-related databases. The risk of unauthorized
    access is realized when the entity engaging in the unauthorized behavior does something harmful with
    that information. In some cases, the information may trigger an immediate response, such as
    breaking into a container holding valuable goods. In other cases, data may also be aggregated over
    time to provide intelligence related to an organizationâ€™s customers, operations, business strategy, or
    proprietary methods.
 Privacy Risk. Privacy rights or expectations may be compromised if an RFID system uses what is
  considered personal information for a purpose other than originally intended or if a third party uses
  the presence of tagged items to profile individuals. In the case of the latter, the primary privacy risk
  is likely borne by the consumer, not the organization that implemented the RFID system.
  Nevertheless, the RFID implementing organization still has privacy-related risks, including penalties
  from non-compliance with existing privacy regulations, legal liability, and the reaction of consumers,
  employees, public interest groups, and other stakeholders.
 Externality Risk. Every connection point between an RFID system and other systems represents a
  potential vulnerability. One externality risk for an RF subsystem is hazards resulting from
  electromagnetic radiation, which could possible range from adverse human health effects to ignition
  of combustible material, such as fuel or ordnance. The main externality risk for an enterprise
  subsystem is successful attacks on networked hosts and applications. Computer network attacks can
  involve malware or attack tools that exploit software vulnerabilities and configuration weaknesses to
  gain access to systems, perform a denial of service, or cause other damage. The impact of computer
  network attacks can range from performance degradation to complete compromise of a mission-
  critical application.
