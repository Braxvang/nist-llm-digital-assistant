            of the normal state of the OT network can help distinguish transient
            conditions from legitimate attacks and provide insight into events that
            are outside of the normal state.
            Gaining access to network traffic is typically performed with network
            test access points (TAPs) and switched port analyzer (SPAN) ports,
            though performance impacts to the OT system may result from their use,
            especially with SPAN ports.
            Network sensors should be placed to effectively monitor the OT
            network. Typical installations locate the network sensors between the
            control network and corporate network, but other locations can include
            network perimeters, key network segments (e.g., DMZ), and critical OT
            devices.
            All sensors should be subjected to extensive testing and be implemented
            in a test environment before being deployed into the OT network.
            Configuring the sensor into a test or learning mode after it is installed on
            the network provides an opportunity to tune the device with real OT
            network traffic. Tuning can help reduce false positive alerts, reduce the
            alert “noise” from typical network traffic, and help identify
            implementation and configuration problems.
            Failure modes of network sensors in the event of a sensor failure should
            be considered (e.g., does the sensor fail-safe or fail-open if the device
            fails).

6.3.2.2.       System Use Monitoring (DE.CM-1 and DE-CM-3)
System use monitoring solutions enable an organization to monitor, store, and audit system
events (e.g., system logs, running processes, file access and modification, system and application
configuration changes) that occur within a system. Monitoring users and systems helps to ensure
that they are behaving as expected and can aid in troubleshooting when events occur by
providing information about which users were working within the system during the event.
System and device misconfigurations can also be identified.
Compared to network monitoring, system use monitoring solutions can analyze activity that does
not traverse the network. In host-based solutions, this can be achieved with real-time monitoring
of inter-process communications and other internal OS data, while active scanning solutions
gather information by querying the OS or application programming interfaces (APIs).

            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Situational awareness of the OT system is imperative to understanding
            the current state of the system, validating that it is operating as intended,
