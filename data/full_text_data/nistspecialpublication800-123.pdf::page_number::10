                                                                          GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



1.    Introduction

1.1   Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency
Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2   Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this document is to assist organizations in understanding the fundamental activities
performed as part of securing and maintaining the security of servers that provide services over network
communications as a main function. Hosts that incidentally provide one or a few services for
maintenance or accessibility purposes, such as a remote access service for remote troubleshooting, are not
considered servers in this document. The types of servers this publication addresses include outward-
facing publicly accessible servers, such as web and email services, and a wide range of inward-facing
servers. This document discusses the need to secure servers and provides recommendations for selecting,
implementing, and maintaining the necessary security controls.

This document addresses common servers that use general operating systems (OS) such as Unix, Linux,
and Windows. Many of the recommendations in this document may also be applicable to servers that use
specialized OSs or run on proprietary appliances, but other recommendations will not be implementable
or may have unintended consequences, so such servers are considered outside the scope of this document.
Other types of servers outside the scope of this document are virtual servers and highly specialized
servers, particularly security infrastructure devices (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems), which
have unusual configurations and security needs.

Other NIST documents, such as Special Publication (SP) 800-45 Version 2, Guidelines on Electronic
Mail Security and SP 800-44 Version 2, Guidelines on Securing Public Web Servers, provide
recommendations for particular types of servers. The recommendations in this document are intended as
a foundation for other server-related documents and do not override more specific recommendations
made in such documents.
