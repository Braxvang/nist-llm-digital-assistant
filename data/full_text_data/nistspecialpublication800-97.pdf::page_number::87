certificates, but is also not secure. Currently, Cisco is the only vendor supporting EAP-FAST, but it might
gain wider appeal if it becomes an official IETF standard.

6.1.4     Summary of EAP Methods and Security Claims

Table 6-2 reviews the security claims of each of the EAP methods discussed in Sections 6.1.2 and 6.1.3.
None of the RFC 3748 EAP methods can make any of the relevant security claims, but these methods can
serve as an inner EAP method when tunneled inside one of the TLS methods.

As Table 6-2 shows, the TLS methods provide similar security claims, primarily because TLS protections
offer the basis for most of these claims. The main difference between them is the level of PKI support
required, which is summarized in Table 6-3. Also, EAP-FAST can be configured to use non-certificate-
based shared secrets such as pre-shared keys. Another difference between the methods is the level of

80
     This claim is not defined in RFC 3748, Section 7.2.1, but appears as a mandatory requirement in [STANLEY].
81
     Man-in-the-middle attack resistance is a combination of several RFC 3748 security claims. Table 6-1 has a footnote that
     contains a more detailed discussion of the various security claims behind man-in-the-middle attack resistance.
82
     EAP-OTP offers replay protection only.
83
     EAP-TTLSv1 is resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks, but it is currently not widely implemented.
84
     PEAPv2 is resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks and includes channel binding, but it is currently not widely implemented.
85
     RFC 3748 notes that to make the claim of confidentiality, a method must support identity protection. The Internet-Draft
     RFC EAP Method Requirements for Wireless LANs refers to this concept as “end user identity hiding”.
86
     EAP-TLS does not require channel binding, since it performs authentication as part of the TLS channel.
