Appendix B                                             Frequently Asked Questions


Q. What is role-based training?
A. Individuals need security training based on their particular job functions. Over
   time, individuals acquire different roles relative to the use of IT within an
   organization or as they make a career move to a different organization.
   Sometimes they will be users of applications, in other instances they may be
   involved in developing a new system, and in some situations, they may serve on
   a source selection board to evaluate vendor proposals for IT systems. An
   individual’s security knowledge and skills, and therefore training needs, change
   as their role changes.
   To address this reality, knowledge and skill needs have been categorized by job
   functions into six role-based specialties, which represent categories of generic
   organizational roles: Manage, Acquire, Design and Develop, Implement and
   Operate, and Review and Evaluate. Actual positions within your agency are then
   assigned to a role to determine the actual training requirements for that position.
   For example, personnel in positions with duties and tasks for contracting officer,
   contracting officer’s technical representative, and source selection board member
   would be aligned with the “acquire” role. The authorizing official, information
   security officer, and inspector general auditor are aligned with the “review and
   evaluate” role, as they deal primarily with compliance activities.

Q. How can the support for an awareness and training program be gauged?
A. The support for an awareness and training program can be shown through many
   indicators. A few examples are:
   • Key stakeholder demonstrates commitment and support.
   • Sufficient funding is budgeted and available to implement the agreed-upon
     awareness and training strategy.
   • Infrastructure to support broad distribution (e.g., Web, e-mail, learning
     management systems) and posting of security awareness and training materials
     is funded and implemented.
   • Executive/senior-level officials deliver messages to staff about security (e.g.,
     staff meetings, broadcasts to all users by agency head), champion the
     program, and demonstrate support for training by committing financial
     resources to the program.
   • Executives and managers do not use their status in the organization to avoid
     security controls that are consistently adhered to by the rank and file.
   • Level of attendance at voluntary security forums/briefings/training is
     consistently high.

Q. How can the effectiveness of an awareness and training program be
   measured?
A. The effectiveness of an awareness and training program can be shown through
   many indicators. A few examples are:
   • Rampant Internet virus attacks no longer plague an organization.
   • Users can identify “spam” e-mail traffic and reduce it.
   • FISMA scores improve.
