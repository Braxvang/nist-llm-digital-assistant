Executive Summary

NIST Special Publication 800-50, Building An Information Technology Security Awareness and Training
Program, provides guidance for building an effective information technology (IT) security program and
supports requirements specified in the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002
and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix III. A strong IT security
program cannot be put in place without significant attention given to training agency IT users on security
policy, procedures, and techniques, as well as the various management, operational, and technical controls
necessary and available to secure IT resources. In addition, those in the agency who manage the IT
infrastructure need to have the necessary skills to carry out their assigned duties effectively. Failure to
give attention to the area of security training puts an enterprise at great risk because security of agency
resources is as much a human issue as it is a technology issue.

Everyone has a role to play in the success of a security awareness and training program but agency heads,
Chief Information Officers (CIOs), program officials, and IT security program managers have key
responsibilities to ensure that an effective program is established agency wide. The scope and content of
the program must be tied to existing security program directives and established agency security policy.
Within agency IT security program policy, there must exist clear requirements for the awareness and
training program.

The document identifies the four critical steps in the life cycle of an IT security awareness and training
program:

   Awareness and Training Program Design (Section 3): In this step, an agency wide needs
    assessment is conducted and a training strategy is developed and approved. This strategic planning
    document identifies implementation tasks to be performed in support of established agency security
    training goals.
   Awareness and Training Material Development (Section 4): This step focuses on available
    training sources, scope, content, and development of training material, including solicitation of
    contractor assistance if needed.
   Program Implementation (Section 5): This step addresses effective communication and roll out of
    the awareness and training program. It also addresses options for delivery of awareness and training
    material (web-based, distance learning, video, on-site, etc.).
   Post-Implementation (Section 6): This step gives guidance on keeping the program current and
    monitoring its effectiveness. Effective feedback methods are described (surveys, focus groups,
    benchmarking, etc.).
The document also discusses three common models used in managing a security training function.

   Centralized: All responsibility resides with a central authority (e.g., CIO and IT security program
    manager).
   Partially Decentralized: Training policy and strategy lie with a central authority, but implementation
    responsibilities are distributed.
   Fully Decentralized: Only policy development resides with a central authority, and all other
    responsibilities are delegated to individual agency components.
