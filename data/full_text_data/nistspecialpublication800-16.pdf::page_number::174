Information Technology Security Training Requirements



  Behavior objective testing is possibly the most difficult measurement area to address.    It is

  relatively easy to test the knowledge level of the attendees after completing a course or block
  of instruction but it is not easy to determine when that learning took place.   An attendee may
  have had knowledge of the subject area before receiving the instruction so that the course had
          no impact. Thus, information collected solely at the conclusion of a
  little or

  course/instructional block must be examined relative to the attendee's background and
  education.


  To better determine the learning impact of a specific course or instructional block, an
  approach is to use pre/post testing in which testing is performed at the outset, and the results
  are compared to testing conducted at the conclusion of instruction.


  Testing of an attendee's knowledge of a particular subject area by including questions or tasks
  where there is a single right answer or approach is appropriate for almost all testing situations,
  especially at the beginning and intermediate levels. Questions regarding selection of the
  "best" answer among possible options should be reserved for those trjiining environments
  where there is opportunity for analysis regarding why a particular answer is better than other
  answers.


Level 3: Job Transfer Skills (Student Performance Effectiveness)


  This evaluation is the first level which asks for more than student input. At this level, the
  evaluator, through a structured questionnaire usually administered 30 to 60 days following the
  training activity, asks the supervisor about the performance of the employee(s) relative to the
  behavioral objectives of the course. This is a "before" and "after" job skills comparison. In
   some cases this information is difficult to obtain, especially when employees' job functions
   and grade levels permit them considerable autonomy, without direct supervision. When
   supervisors observe only the final output of employee actions, developing a valid
   questionnaire can present a particular challenge.   When accomplished successfully, a Level 3
   evaluation should begin to show the extent to which the learning activity benefits the
   organization as well as the employee.


   Questions appropriate for the learner's supervisor might include:


     •   Has the learner used the knowledge obtained in the course to accomplish job tasks?

     •   Has the learner's performance improved since taking the course?

Level 4: Organizational Benefit (Training Program Effectiveness)


   Level 4 evaluations can be difficult to undertake and hard to quantify. They can involve
   structured, follow-up interviews with students, their supervisors, and colleagues. They can
