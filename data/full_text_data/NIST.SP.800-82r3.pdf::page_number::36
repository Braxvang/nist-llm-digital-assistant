2.3.3. Distributed Control Systems
A distributed control system (DCS) is used to control production systems within the same
geographic location for industries such as oil refineries, water and wastewater treatment, electric
power generation, chemical manufacturing, automotive production, and pharmaceutical
processing. These systems are usually process control or discrete part control systems.
A DCS is integrated as a control architecture that contains a supervisory level of control to
oversee multiple integrated sub-systems that are responsible for controlling the details of a
localized process. A DCS uses a centralized supervisory control loop to mediate a group of
localized controllers that share the overall tasks of carrying out an entire production process
[Erickson]. Product and process control are usually achieved by deploying feedback or
feedforward control loops, whereby key product and/or process conditions are automatically
maintained around a desired set point. Specific process controllers or more capable PLCs are
employed in the field and tuned to provide the desired tolerance and the rate of self-correction
during process upsets. By modularizing the production system, a DCS reduces the impact of a
single fault on the overall system. In many modern systems, the DCS is interfaced with the
corporate enterprise network to give business operations a view of production.
Figure 7 shows an example implementation of the components and general configuration of a
DCS. This DCS encompasses an entire facility, from the bottom-level production processes up to
the corporate enterprise layer. In this example, a supervisory controller (control server)
communicates to its subordinates via a control network. The supervisor sends set points to and
requests data from the distributed field controllers. The distributed controllers control their
process actuators based on control server commands and sensor feedback from process sensors.
Figure 7 also gives examples of low-level controllers found on a DCS system. The field control
devices shown include a machine controller, a PLC, and a process controller. The machine
controller interfaces with sensors and actuators using point-to-point wiring, while the other three
field devices incorporate fieldbus networks to interface with process sensors and actuators.
Fieldbus networks eliminate the need for point-to-point wiring between a controller and
individual field sensors and actuators. Additionally, a fieldbus allows for greater functionality
beyond control, including field device diagnostics, and can accomplish control algorithms within
the fieldbus, thereby avoiding signal routing back to the PLC for every control operation.
Standard industrial communication protocols designed by industry groups such as Modbus and
Fieldbus [Berge] are often used on control networks and fieldbus networks.
In addition to the supervisory-level and field-level control loops, intermediate levels of control
may also exist. For example, in the case of a DCS controlling a discrete part manufacturing
facility, there could be an intermediate level supervisor for each cell within the plant. This
supervisor encompasses a manufacturing cell containing a machine controller that processes a
part and a robot controller that handles raw stock and final products. There could be several of
these cells that manage field-level controllers under the main DCS supervisory control loop.
