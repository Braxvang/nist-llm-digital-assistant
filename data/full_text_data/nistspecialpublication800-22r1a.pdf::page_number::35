A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



2.6.3   Test Statistic and Reference Distribution
        d:     The normalized difference between the observed and the expected number of frequency
               components that are beyond the 95 % threshold.

The reference distribution for the test statistic is the normal distribution.

2.6.4   Test Description
(1)     The zeros and ones of the input sequence (ε) are converted to values of –1 and +1 to create the
        sequence X = x1, x2, …, xn, where xi = 2εi – 1.

        For example, if n = 10 and ε = 1001010011, then X = 1, -1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, -1, 1, 1.

(2)     Apply a Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) on X to produce: S = DFT(X). A sequence of
        complex variables is produced which represents periodic components of the sequence of bits at
        different frequencies (see Section 3.6 for a sample diagram of a DFT result).

(3)     Calculate M = modulus(S´) ≡ |S'|, where S´ is the substring consisting of the first n/2 elements in
        S, and the modulus function produces a sequence of peak heights.

                             1 
(4)     Compute T =      log    n = the 95 % peak height threshold value. Under an assumption of
                          0.05 
        randomness, 95 % of the values obtained from the test should not exceed T.

(5)     Compute N0 = .95n/2. N0 is the expected theoretical (95 %) number of peaks (under the
        assumption
           €       of randomness) that are less than T.

        For the example in this section, N0 = 4.75.

(6)     Compute N1 = the actual observed number of peaks in M that are less than T.

        For the example in this section, N1 = 4.

                           (N1 − N 0 )
(7)     Compute d =                      .
                          n(.95)(.05) /4


        For the example in this section, d =
                                                  ( 4 − 4.75) = -2.176429.

(8)     Compute P-value = erfc      
                                  2 .

        For the example in this section, P-value = erfc               = 0.029523.
                                                                2 
