The key statistic calculated in re-identifcation studies is the conditional re-identifcation
rate. This statistic is a proxy for disclosure risk. The rate is the number of confrmed links
between the dataset and another dataset divided by the number of putative (suspected) links
expressed as a percentage. If the conditional re-identifcation rate falls above an agreed
upon threshold for any publication strata, it suggests that the data should not be released
outside of a controlled environment.
Re-identifcation studies are often an iterative process. If a re-identifcation study uncovers
problems with the de-identifed data, the data curator can engage with subject-matter ex-
perts, make changes to the dataset, and perform another re-identifcation study. Changes to
the dataset might involve coarsening linking variables, eliminating highly disclosive link-
ing variables from the microdata to be released, or coarsening strata. This continues until
the study concludes that the de-identifed data can be disseminated.
There are broadly two types of re-identifcation studies:
   1. Micro (or targeted) re-identifcation studies, where one looks for a specifc person.
      A well-known example is that of former Governor William Weld of Massachusetts,
      whose medical records in a hospital discharge summary record were linked to voter
      records [18]. As noted earlier, some individual targets are supremely hard to protect
      as there is often extensive publicly available information about them.
   2. Macro (or wholesale) re-identifcation studies, where one seeks to re-identify a
      large number of individuals. Such studies can be used to understand the overall risk
      or identify specifc potential vulnerabilities, especially in datasets with structures on
      multiple scales or that are highly heterogeneous, such as the U.S. Census Bureau’s
      simulated reconstruction-abetted re-identifcation attack on the 2010 Census [75] and
      the study of re-identifcation risk of a clinical study report anonymized under Euro-
      pean Medicines Agency (EMA) Policy 0070 and Health Canada Regulations [21].
      Alternatively, such studies can be performed to embarrass or discredit the organiza-
      tion releasing the data. Such studies rely on linking easily procurable external data
      to the protected microdata that are being released. A variety of metrics can be calcu-
      lated to uncover putative links, and several methods can be used to confrm putative
      links.
Formal privacy parameters often appear opaque and elusive to non-theoreticians. Subject-
matter experts and decision-makers more clearly understand disclosure risk after reviewing
the results of re-identifcation studies.
External intruders may attempt to calculate for themselves re-identifcation rates as part of
an academic review of the agency’s work. They may even purport to have successfully
linked their external data to a de-identifed dataset. However, external intruders do not
have access to the confdential data on which the de-identifed data were based, so there
is no way for the external intruders to validate their work: the calculations may be low
or high, and the linkages may be correct or incorrect. By conducting a re-identifcation
