                                                 Federal Information Systems and Organizations




 Malware                      A program that is inserted into a system, usually covertly, with
 [NISTIR 7298]                the intent of compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or
                              availability of the victim’s data, applications, or operating system
                              or of otherwise annoying or disrupting the victim.

 Management Controls          The security controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) for an
 [FIPS 200]                   information system that focus on the management of risk and the
                              management of information system security.

 Mechanisms                   An assessment object that includes specific protection-related
 [NISTIR 7298]                items (e.g., hardware, software, or firmware) employed within or
                              at the boundary of an information system.

 Metrics                      Tools designed to facilitate decision making and improve
 [NISTIR 7298]                performance and accountability through collection, analysis, and
                              reporting of relevant performance-related data.

 National Security System     Any information system (including any telecommunications
 [44 U.S.C., Sec. 3542]       system) used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an
                              agency, or other organization on behalf of an agency—(i) the
                              function, operation, or use of which involves intelligence
                              activities; involves cryptologic activities related to national
                              security; involves command and control of military forces;
                              involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or
                              weapons system; or is critical to the direct fulfillment of military
                              or intelligence missions (excluding a system that is to be used for
                              routine administrative and business applications, for example,
                              payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management
                              applications); or (ii) is protected at all times by procedures
                              established for information that have been specifically authorized
                              under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of
                              Congress to be kept classified in the interest of national defense
                              or foreign policy.

 Operational Controls         The security controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) for an
 [FIPS 200]                   information system that are primarily implemented and executed
                              by people (as opposed to systems).

 Organization                 An entity of any size, complexity, or positioning within an
 [FIPS 200, Adapted]          organizational structure (e.g., a federal agency, or, as appropriate,
                              any of its operational elements).

 Organizational               Ongoing monitoring sufficient to ensure and assure effectiveness
 Information Security         of security controls related to systems, networks, and cyberspace,
 Continuous Monitoring        by assessing security control implementation and organizational
                              security status in accordance with organizational risk tolerance –
                              and within a reporting structure designed to make real-time, data-
                              driven risk management decisions.
