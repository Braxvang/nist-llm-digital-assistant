    Over the past 30 years, NIST has been at the forefront
of recommending best practices for authentication.
Recommendations have included the usage of passwords in
enterprises, biometrics, and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
solutions. In FY 2015, CSD researched the classification of
general authentication features. This investigation was
prompted by the general call to move away from passwords
towards the growing number of alternative authentication
methods (e.g. biometrics, smart cards, etc.). In the early part
of this investigation, it became clear that an ontology of
authentication was needed.
    A draft taxonomy (see Figure 19) was developed
to better describe current and emerging authentication
mechanisms. This taxonomy covers a wide assortment                     Figure 20: Suitability Framework for Authentication
of commonly used methods to cover human-machine,
machine-machine, and attribute attestation. It does not           metrics include authentication strength and the suitability of
address identity management - which typically happens             the method to the environment. The strength measurements
before authentication occurs, or access control - which           should include security and usability. This provides a way
typically happens after.                                          to monitor a common complaint of designers â€“ usability
