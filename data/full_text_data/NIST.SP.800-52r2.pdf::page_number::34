NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                            GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


recommended elliptic curves are listed in SP 800-56A, Appendix D [6]. Finite field groups that
are approved for TLS in SP 800-56A, Appendix D may be supported.

3.4.2.3 Key Share

Applies to TLS version 1.3

The Key Share extension is used in TLS 1.3 to send cryptographic parameters. Servers that
support TLS 1.3 shall support this extension as described in Section 4.2.7 of RFC 8446 [57].

3.4.2.4 Supported Point Formats

Applies to TLS versions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2

Servers that support EC cipher suites with TLS 1.2 and below shall be able to process the
supported point format received in the ClientHello message by the client. The servers shall
process this extension in accordance with Section 5.1 of RFC 8422 [52].

Servers that support EC cipher suites shall also be able to send the supported EC point format in
the ServerHello message as described in Section 5.2 of RFC 8422 [52].

3.4.2.5 Multiple Certificate Status

Applies to TLS versions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2

The multiple certificate status extension improves on the Certificate Status Request extension
described in Section 3.4.1.5 by allowing the client to request the status of all certificates provided
by the server in the TLS handshake. When the server returns the revocation status of all the
certificates in the server certificate chain, the client does not need to query any revocation service
providers, such as OCSP responders. This extension is documented in RFC 6961 [54]. Servers
that have this capability and have certificates issued by CAs that support OCSP should be
configured to support this extension.

3.4.2.6 Trusted CA Indication

Applies to TLS versions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2

The trusted CA indication (trusted_ca_keys) extension allows a client to specify which CA root
keys it possesses. This is useful for sessions where the client is memory-constrained and
possesses a small number of root CA keys. Servers that communicate with memory-constrained
clients and that have been issued certificates by multiple CAs shall be able to process and
respond to the trusted CA indication extension received in a ClientHello message as described in
[29].
