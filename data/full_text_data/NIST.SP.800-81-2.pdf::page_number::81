9.5   Publishing the Public Key (DNSSEC-OP3) and Setting Up Trust Anchors (DNSSEC-
      OP7)

The operation of verifying the zone data of a particular zone by a DNSSEC-aware resolver begins with
that resolver knowing and trusting the public key of that zone (the one whose data is to be verified) or any
of its ancestors (parent and zones above the parent in the DNS tree). If the zone to be verified (e.g.,
example.com) is secure and its parent (.com) is not, the point of trust begins with the zone itself. If the
parent (i.e., the .com zone) is secure (i.e., DNSSEC-aware) and the parent of the parent (i.e., a root zone)
is not secure, the starting point of trust is the parent (i.e., .com zone). If a root zone is secure, of course
that becomes the origin of trust.

Whatever the starting point of the chain of trust (enterprise level, TLD, or root zone), the public key of
that starting point should be made known by the associated name server to the DNSSEC-aware resolvers
of interest. These public keys known to DNSSEC-aware resolvers are called trust anchors. Because there
is no feature within DNS for third-party authentication of public keys (like X.509 Public Key
Infrastructure), the public key has to be distributed through an out-of-band (relative to DNS) process. This
distribution may be accomplished through channels such as Web sites or e-mails.

The entries in the trust anchor list of a DNSSEC-aware resolver determine whether a signed response
from a zone will be categorized as secure or insecure. As mentioned in section 9.2.2, the resolver has to
establish trust in the public key of the zone that has sent the response before it performs signature
verification. If that trust cannot be established due to not being able to build a trusted chain using any of
the entries in trust anchor list, the response will be tagged as insecure. The reason for not being able to
build a trusted chain may be one of several potential reasons: There maybe an intermediate zone signed
using an algorithm the end validators does not understand or it may be due to the fact that the DNS
namespace contains islands of signed zones as opposed to unbroken hierarchical sequence of signed
zones. The effect of each trust anchor in labeling responses for a given mapping of islands of signed
zones (Figure 9-2) is given in Table 9-2.
