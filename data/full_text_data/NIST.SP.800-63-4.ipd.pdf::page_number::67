       December 2022


1989   Online Attack
1990   An attack against an authentication protocol where the attacker either assumes the role of
1991   a claimant with a genuine verifier or actively alters the authentication channel.

1992   Online Guessing Attack
1993   An attack in which an attacker performs repeated logon trials by guessing possible values
1994   of the authenticator output.

1995   Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier
1996   An opaque unguessable subscriber identifier generated by a CSP for use at a specific
1997   individual RP. This identifier is only known to and only used by one CSP-RP pair.

1998   Passive Attack
1999   An attack against an authentication protocol where the attacker intercepts data traveling
2000   along the network between the claimant and verifier, but does not alter the data (i.e.,
2001   eavesdropping).

2002   Passphrase
2003   A passphrase is a memorized secret consisting of a sequence of words or other text that a
2004   claimant uses to authenticate their identity. A passphrase is similar to a password in usage,
2005   but is generally longer for added security.

2006   Password
2007   See memorized secret.

2008   Personal Data
2009   See Personally Identifiable Information.

2010   Personal Identification Number (PIN)
2011   A memorized secret typically consisting of only decimal digits.

2012   Personal Information
2013   See Personally Identifiable Information.

2014   Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
2015   As defined by OMB Circular A-130, PII is information that can be used to distinguish or
2016   trace an individualâ€™s identity, either alone or when combined with other information that
2017   is linked or linkable to a specific individual.

2018   Personally Identifiable Information Processing
2019   An operation or set of operations performed upon personally identifiable information
2020   that can include, but is not limited to, the collection, retention, logging, generation,

                                                    55
