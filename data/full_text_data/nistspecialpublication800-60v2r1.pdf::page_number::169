Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: There are legislative mandates
prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets. Trade secrets will generally be assigned a
moderate confidentiality impact level. In the case of patent activities, technical details of
applications involving inventions with military applications and with deliberations concerning
withholding patents as a result of national security considerations may be sensitive. (In some
cases, the patent application information may be classified or to contain information concerning
weapons or weapons systems. In such cases, the information would be national security
information, and outside the scope of this guideline.)

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for intellectual property protection information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of intellectual property protection
information depends on the criticality of the information with respect to agency mission
capability, protection of agency assets, and safety of individuals. The effects of modification or
deletion of this information are generally limited with respect to agency mission capabilities or
assets.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
intellectual property protection information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to intellectual property protection
information. The nature of intellectual property protection processes is tolerant of reasonable
delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
intellectual property protection information is low.

D.9.3 Financial Sector Oversight Information Type

Financial Sector Oversight involves the regulation of private sector firms and markets (stock
exchanges, corporations, etc.) to protect investors from fraud, monopolies, and illegal behavior.
This also includes deposit protection. The recommended provisional categorization of the
financial sector oversight information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of financial sector
oversight information on the ability of responsible agencies to regulate private sector firms and
