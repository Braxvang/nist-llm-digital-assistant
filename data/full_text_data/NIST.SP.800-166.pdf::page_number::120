                                                                        DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

                             2. Send the GET DATA command with
                                   • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                      ('5FC10A') of the X.509 Certificate for
                                      Digital Signature data object
                             3. Extract the value of the keyUsage extension from
                                the certificate.
 Expected Result(s)          1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                                template with the status word '90 00'.
                             2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                                along with the status word '90 00'.
                             3. From Step 3, the digitalSignature and nonRepudiation bits have
                                been set. No other bits have been set.

9.3.2.5 Certificate Policy

 Test Assertion              TA-09.03.02.05
 Purpose                     Verifies that the digital signature certificate asserts the appropriate
                             certificate policy OID.
 DTR(s)                      • DTR-07.03.02.06
 Issuer Documentation        None.
 Precondition(s)             • A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                                appropriate token reader.
                             • Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                                an instance of the reader.
                             • A digital signature certificate is present within the Derived PIV
                                Application.
 Test Scenario               1. Send the SELECT command with
                                   • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                             2. Send the GET DATA command with
                                   • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                      ('5FC10A') of the X.509 Certificate for
                                      Digital Signature data object.
                             3. Extract the value of the certificatePolicies
                                extension from the certificate.
 Expected Result(s)          1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                                template with the status word '90 00'.
                             2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                                along with the status word '90 00'.
                             3. From Step 3, the certificatePolicies extension asserts one of the
                                following: id-fpki-common-policy, id-fpki-common-hardware
                                or id-fpki-common-High.

9.3.2.6 Authority Information Access Extension

 Test Assertion              TA-09.03.02.06
 Purpose                     Verifies that the authority information access extension in the
                             digital signature certificate is populated appropriately and contains
