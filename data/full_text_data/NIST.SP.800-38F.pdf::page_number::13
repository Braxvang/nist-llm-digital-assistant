prerequisite          A required input to an algorithm that has been established prior
                      to the invocation of the algorithm.

semiblock             Given a block cipher, a bit string whose length is half of the
                      block size.

semiblock string      For a given block size, a string that can be represented as the
                      concatenation of semiblocks.

shall                 Is required to.      Requirements       apply   to   conforming
                      implementations.

should                Is recommended to.

unwrapping function   The inverse of the wrapping function.

valid length          A length for a plaintext or ciphertext input that is allowed for
                      an implementation of the authenticated-encryption function or
                      the authenticated-decryption function.

wrapping function     The keyed, length-preserving permutation that is applied to an
                      enlarged form of the plaintext within the authenticated-
                      encryption function to produce the ciphertext.
