                                                                           CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



hardware refresh, migration of customer workloads (data storage and processing) from one physical
computer to another physical computer [Chr05, Shr10, VMw11, Mic10, Red99] is a key strategy that
allows a provider to refresh hardware or consolidate workloads without inconveniencing consumers.

From Figure 1, a small number of general statements about cloud computing (e.g., strengths and
limitations, performance characteristics) can be inferred; organizations considering the use of cloud
computing should consider these general statements (listed below). Many statements commonly made
about clouds (e.g., that clouds scale for very large workloads or that clouds replace capital expenses with
operational expenses), however, are true only for certain types of clouds. To avoid confusion, this
document explicitly qualifies each such statement with the type of cloud to which it applies; i.e., each
statement has a "scope." The scopes used in this document are listed in Table 1.

                             Table 1: Scope Modifiers for Statements Asserted About Clouds

                   Scope Name                                                Applicability
    general                                         Applies to all cloud deployment models.
    on-site-private                                 Applies to private clouds implemented at a customer's
                                                    premises.
    outsourced-private                              Applies to private clouds where the server side is outsourced to
                                                    a hosting company.
    on-site-community                               Applies to community clouds implemented on the premises of
                                                    the customers composing a community cloud.
    outsourced-community                            Applies to community clouds where the server side is
                                                    outsourced to a hosting company.
    public                                          Applies to public clouds.


Each of the scopes is explained below. The following statements are general in their scope, i.e., they
apply regardless of the deployment model or service model:

 Network dependency (general). The consumers, being clients, need a working and secure network
  to access a cloud. If the network is not reliable, the cloud will not be reliable from the consumer's
  point of view.
 Consumers still need IT skills (general). By operating the server computers, a provider may reduce
  the need for IT staff in consumer organizations, but consumers will still access the cloud from on-site
  consumer-managed client systems that must be maintained, secure, etc.
 Workload locations are dynamically assigned and are thus hidden from clients (general). To
  manage a cloud's hardware resources efficiently, providers must be able to migrate consumer
  workloads between machines without inconveniencing the clients, i.e., without the clients being
  required to track and adapt to changes and therefore without the clients being aware. 6
 Risks from multi-tenancy (general). The workloads of different clients may reside concurrently on
  the same system and local network, separated only by access policies implemented by a provider's
  software. A flaw in the implementation or in the provider’s management and operational policies and
  procedures could compromise the security of consumers.

6
    In some cases (e.g., the IaaS service model described in Section 7 below) a workload may exist in a particular location for a
        specific time before it migrates; in other cases (e.g., for the PaaS service model described in Section 6 below) a workload
        may exist as a fundamentally distributed entity with sequential operations performed for a consumer potentially executing in
        different servers, and data existing in a geographically distributed data store.
