       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                                 Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1682            – Clearly label sequential steps.
1683            – Make the starting point clear.
1684            – Design to support multiple platforms and device sizes.
1685            – Make the navigation consistent, easy to find, and easy to follow.

1686   9.4. Post-Enrollment
1687   Post-enrollment refers to the step immediately after enrollment but prior to typical usage
1688   of an authenticator (for usability considerations for typical authenticator usage and
1689   intermittent events, see [SP800-63B], Sec. 10. As described above, users have already
1690   been informed at the end of their enrollment session regarding the expected delivery (or
1691   pick-up) mechanism by which they will receive their authenticator.
1692   Usability considerations for post-enrollment include:
1693       • Minimize the amount of time that users wait for their authenticator to arrive.
1694         Shorter wait times will allow users to access information systems and services
1695         more quickly.
1696       • Inform users whether they need to go to a physical location to pick up their
1697         authenticators. The previously identified usability considerations for appointments
1698         and reminders still apply.
1699       • Along with the authenticator, give users information relevant to the use and
1700         maintenance of the authenticator; this may include instructions for use, especially
1701         if there are different requirements for first-time use or initialization, information on
1702         authenticator expiration, and what to do if the authenticator is lost or stolen.
