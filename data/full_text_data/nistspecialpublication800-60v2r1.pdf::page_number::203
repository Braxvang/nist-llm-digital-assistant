information. The effects of disruption of access to most food and nutrition assistance information
or information systems would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets,
or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
food and nutrition assistance information is low.

D.15.5 Survivor Compensation Information Type

Survivor Compensation provides compensation to the survivors of individuals currently
receiving or eligible to receive benefits from the Federal Government. This includes survivors
such as spouses or children of veterans or wage earners eligible for social security payments.
The recommended provisional categorization of the survivor compensation information type
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of survivor
compensation information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide compensation to the
survivors of individuals currently receiving or eligible to receive benefits from the Federal
Government. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most survivor compensation
information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Exceptions that might have a
potential for more serious consequences are based on privacy information (e.g., information
required by the Privacy Act of 1974 or other statutes and executive orders to receive special
handling to protect the privacy of individuals). The Privacy Act Information provisional impact
levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. This can
result in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for survivor compensation information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of survivor compensation information
would have, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.
Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications
(e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the
agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
survivor compensation information is low.
