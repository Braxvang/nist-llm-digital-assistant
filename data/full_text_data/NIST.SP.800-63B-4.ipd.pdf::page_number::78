       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines

2228            – Consider the prompts’ complexity and size. The larger the subset of secrets
2229              a user is prompted to look up, the greater the usability implications. Both
2230              the cognitive workload and physical difficulty for entry should be taken into
2231              account when selecting the quantity and complexity of look-up secrets for
2232              authentication.

2233   10.2.3. Out-of-Band
2234   Typical Usage
2235   Out-of-band authentication requires users have access to a primary and secondary
2236   communication channel.
2237   Usability considerations for typical usage:
2238       • Notify users of the receipt of a secret on a locked device. However, if the out-of-
2239         band device is locked, authentication to the device should be required to access the
2240         secret.
2241       • Depending on the implementation, consider form-factor constraints as they are
2242         particularly problematic when users must enter text on mobile devices. Providing
2243         larger touch areas will improve usability for entering secrets on mobile devices.
2244       • A better usability option is to offer features that do not require text entry on mobile
2245         devices (e.g., a single tap on the screen, or a copy feature so users can copy and
2246         paste out-of-band secrets). Providing users such features is particularly helpful
2247         when the primary and secondary channels are on the same device. For example, it
2248         is difficult for users to transfer the authentication secret on a smartphone because
2249         they must switch back and forth — potentially multiple times — between the out-
2250         of-band application and the primary channel.

2251   10.2.4. Single-Factor OTP Device
2252   Typical Usage
2253   Users access the OTP generated by the single-factor OTP device. The authenticator
2254   output is typically displayed on the device and the user enters it for the verifier.
2255   Usability considerations for typical usage include:
2256       • Authenticator output allows at least one minute between changes, but ideally allows
2257         users the full two minutes as specified in Sec. 5.1.4.1. Users need adequate time
2258         to enter the authenticator output (including looking back and forth between the
2259         single-factor OTP device and the entry screen).
2260       • Depending on the implementation, the following are additional usability
2261         considerations for implementers:
