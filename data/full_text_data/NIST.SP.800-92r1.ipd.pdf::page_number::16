      NIST SP 800-92r1 ipd                                                  Cybersecurity Log Management
      October 2023                                                                         Planning Guide

364   Summary: Update the organization’s inventory of logging use cases and the desired outcomes
365   of each use case. This information is valuable when developing or updating logging policies.
366   One desired outcome is that all logging is done for a purpose and not just for the sake of
367   collecting log data. Another desired outcome is that all logging use cases are taken into
368   consideration when defining the target state for cybersecurity log management.
369   Tasks to perform include the following:
370      1. INV-3.1: Document summaries of the known logging use cases and the desired outcome
371         of each.
372      2. INV-3.2: Share the use cases with stakeholders, solicit their feedback, and make
373         revisions if needed.
374   Examples of possible use cases include:
375      •   Continuous monitoring
376      •   Early detection of malicious behavior, potentially malicious behavior, and advanced
377          threats that involve all user and non-user accounts
378      •   Evidence of compliance with a standard/compliance reporting
379      •   Evidence of verification of the functional and security operations of the components
380      •   Incident response
381      •   Passive DNS request analysis
382      •   Security operations
383      •   SIEM tools
384      •   Software development artifact capture, for continuous integration/continuous delivery
385          (CI/CD)
386      •   Threat detection and investigation, including threat hunting
387      •   Zero trust implementation

388          INV-4, Update the Requirements Inventory

390   Summary: Update the inventory of existing requirements that are applicable to your
391   organization’s cybersecurity logging. Requirements may come from applicable laws, regulations,
392   standards, and internal policies. The desired outcome is a reasonably comprehensive set of
393   current requirements for your organization’s cybersecurity logging.
394   Tasks to perform include the following (not necessarily in order):
395      1. INV-4.1: Confirm that all requirements already in the inventory are still applicable, and
396         remove outdated requirements.
397      2. INV-4.2: Identify all new requirements applicable to existing log source types or logging
398         use cases.
