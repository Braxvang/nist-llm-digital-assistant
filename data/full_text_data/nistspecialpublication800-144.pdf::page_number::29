    information. Incidents may also be caused unintentionally—for instance, a bank
    employee reportedly sent out sensitive customer information to the wrong Google mail
    account [Zet09b].

    Moving data and applications to a cloud computing environment operated by a cloud
    provider expands the circle of insiders not only to the cloud provider’s staff and
    subcontractors, but also potentially to other customers using the service, thereby
    increasing risk. For example, a denial of service attack launched by a malicious insider
    was demonstrated against a well-known IaaS cloud [Mee09, Sla09]. The attack involved
    a cloud consumer creating an initial 20 accounts and launching virtual machine instances
    for each, then using those accounts to create an additional 20 accounts and machine
    instances in an iterative fashion, exponentially growing and consuming resources beyond
    set limits.

   Data Ownership. The organization’s ownership rights over the data must be firmly
    established in the service contract to enable a basis for trust and privacy of data. The
    continuing controversy over privacy and data ownership rights for social networking
    users illustrates the impact that ambiguous terms can have on the parties involved (e.g.,
    [Goo10, Rap09]). Ideally, the contract should state clearly that the organization retains
    exclusive ownership over all its data; that the cloud provider acquires no rights or
    licenses through the agreement, including intellectual property rights or licenses, to use
    the organization’s data for its own purposes; and that the cloud provider does not acquire
    and may not claim any interest in the data due to security [Mcd10]. For these provisions
    to work as intended, the terms of data ownership must not be subject to unilateral
    amendment by the cloud provider.

   Composite Services. Cloud services themselves can be composed through nesting and
    layering with other cloud services. For example, a public SaaS provider could build its
    services upon those of a PaaS or IaaS cloud. The level of availability of the SaaS cloud
    would then depend on the availability of those services. If the percent availability of a
    support service drops, the overall availability suffers proportionally.

    Cloud services that use third-party cloud providers to outsource or subcontract some of
    their services should raise concerns, including the scope of control over the third party,
    the responsibilities involved (e.g., policy and licensing arrangements), and the remedies
    and recourse available should problems occur. Public cloud providers that host
    applications or services of other parties may involve other domains of control, but
    through transparent authentication mechanisms, appear to a consumer to be that of the
    cloud provider. Trust is often not transitive, requiring that third-party arrangements are
    disclosed in advance of reaching an agreement with the cloud provider, and that the terms
    of these arrangements are maintained throughout the agreement or until sufficient
    notification can be given of any anticipated changes.

    Liability and performance guarantees can become a serious issue with composite cloud
    services. For example, a consumer storage-based social networking service closed down
    after losing access to a significant amount of data from 20,000 of its clients. Because it
