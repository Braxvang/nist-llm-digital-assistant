masking The process of systematically removing a feld or replacing it with a value in a
     way that does not preserve the analytic utility of the value, such as replacing a phone
     number with asterisks or a randomly generated pseudonym. [59]
motivated intruder test The ‘motivated intruder’ is taken to be a person who starts with-
     out any prior knowledge but who wishes to identify the individual from whose per-
     sonal data the anonymised data have been derived. This test is meant to assess
     whether the motivated intruder would be successful. [81]
(n,k) rule A cell is regarded as confdential, if the n largest units contribute more than k %
      to the cell total, e.g., n=2 and k=85 means that a cell is defned as risky if the two
      largest units contribute more than 85 % to the cell total. The n and k are given by the
      statistical authority. In some NSOs [national statistical offce] the values of n and k
      are confdential. (OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms)
noise A convenient term for a series of random disturbances borrowed through communi-
      cation engineering, from the theory of sound. In communication theory, noise results
      in the possibility of a signal sent, x, being different from the signal received, y, and
      the latter has a probability distribution conditional upon x. If the disturbances con-
      sist of impulses at random intervals, it is sometimes known as “shot noise.” (OECD
      Glossary of Statistical Terms)
noise addition A de-identifcation technique that modifes a dataset by adding random
      values to the values of a selected attribute. (ISO/TS 20889:2018)
noise infusion See noise addition.
noise injection See noise addition.
non-deterministic noise A random value that cannot be predicted.
non-ignorable bias In the context of de-identifcation, a bias that results from the suppres-
     sion or redaction of data based on the value of the suppressed data.
non-public personal information Information about a person that is not publicly known;
     called “private information” in some other publications.
p,q rule It is assumed that out of publicly available information the contribution of one
      individual to the cell total can be estimated to within q per cent (q=error before
      publication); after the publication of the statistic the value can be estimated to within
      p percent (p=error after publication). In the (p,q) rule the ratio p/q represents the
      information gain through publication. If the information gain is unacceptable, the
      cell is declared as confdential. The parameter values p and q are determined by
      the statistical authority and, thus, defne the acceptable level of information gain.
      In some [National Statistical Organizations] the values of p and q are confdential.
