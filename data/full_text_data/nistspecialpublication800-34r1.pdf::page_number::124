   criticality. COOP MEFs are a set of prioritized mission/business processes that support the
   organization’s mission and must be sustained within 12 hours and for up to 30 days following a
   disruption. Federal Continuity Directive-2, Federal Executive Branch Mission Essential Function
   and Primary Mission Essential Function Identification and Submission Process, provides detailed
   guidance on how to determine if a mission/business process meets the requirements of a MEF.
   Because COOP MEFs may also be supported by information systems, ISCPs must be developed for
   those systems as well.

4. What is the connection between the risk management framework and information system
   contingency planning?

   The risk management framework (RMF) encompasses a broad range of activities to identify, control,
   and mitigate risks to an information system during the system development life cycle. One of the
   activities is the development of an ISCP. Implementing the risk management framework can prevent
   or reduce the likelihood of natural, human, and environmental threats and limit the consequences of
   risks in the event of a system disruption.

5. How do risk management and information system contingency planning fit into a resilience
   program?

   The goal of a resilient organization is to continue functions at all times during any type of disruption.
   Resilient organizations continually work to adapt to changes and risks that can affect their ability to
   sustain operations. Risk management, contingency, and continuity planning are individual security
   and emergency management activities that can be implemented in a holistic manner across an
   organization as components of a resiliency program.

6. Into what phase of the system development life cycle (SDLC) should contingency planning and
   related security controls be incorporated?

   Although contingency planning is associated with activities occurring in the Operation/Maintenance
   phase, contingency measures should be identified and integrated into ALL phases of the SDLC.
   Incorporating contingency planning into the SDLC reduces overall contingency planning costs,
   enhances contingency capabilities, and reduces impacts to system operations when the contingency
   plan is implemented.

7. What is the first step I need to take before writing an ISCP?

   The first step in the contingency planning process is to develop a contingency planning policy
   statement supported by senior leadership (typically the Chief Information Officer). This policy
   should define the agency’s overall contingency objectives and should establish the organizational
   framework and responsibilities for information system contingency planning. The policy statement
   should also address roles and responsibilities. The policy should be supported with procedures
   covering training requirements, frequency of backups, offsite storage shipments, plan exercises,
   testing, and maintenance.

8. The BIA guidance in this guide is a different process than the one required by Federal
   Continuity Directive-2, Federal Executive Branch Mission Essential Function and Primary
   Mission Essential Function Identification and Submission Process. Which is the correct process
   for my organization to use?
