                                     c) A scan of newly installed software and data files,
                                     d) A weekly update of the malware protection software,

                    RA-5           When a Federal CKMS is allowed to receive untrusted
PR:8.12
                    SI-3           software, software updates or software support, then the
                    SI-4           Federal CKMS shall support time-initiated and event-
                                   initiated malware scanning.

                     SI-4          A Federal CKMS should support configurable, dynamic

                                   network malware monitoring.

                     SI-4          A Federal CKMS could support dynamic network malware
PF:8.3
                                   monitoring and report any identified real or potential
                                   problems to the FCKMS management personnel.

8.2.4 Auditing and Remote Monitoring
An FCKMS should monitor security-relevant events by detecting and recording these events
in an audit log. The audit capability should also have the ability to detect any unusual events
that should be investigated and report them to the audit administrator role as soon as possible.
The audit capability and audit log must be protected from modification so that the integrity of
the audit system can be assured.

Automated assessment tools, such as those specified in the Security Content Automation
Protocol (SCAP) (see [SP 800-126]), should be considered for assessing the current security
status and integrity of an FCKMS. Such monitoring tools could execute on the platform
being monitored or on a platform dedicated to monitoring other computers.

FR:8.10 The CKMS design shall specify the auditable events supported and indicate
whether each event is fixed or selectable.

FR:8.11 For each selectable, auditable event, the CKMS design shall specify the role(s) that
has the capability to select the event.

FR:8.12 For each auditable event, the CKMS design shall specify the data to be recorded12.

FR:8.13 The CKMS design shall specify what automated tools are provided to assess the
correct operation and security of the CKMS.

FR:8.14 The CKMS design shall specify system-monitoring requirements for sensitive
system files to detect and/or prevent their modification or any modification to their security
attributes, such as their access control lists.

  Examples of recorded data include a unique event identifier, the date and time of the event, the subject (e.g.,
user, role or software process) causing the event, the success or failure of the event, and the event-specific data.
