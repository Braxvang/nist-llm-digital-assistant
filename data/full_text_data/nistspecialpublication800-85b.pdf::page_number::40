Special Publication 800-85B                                PIV Data Model Testing Specification


AS07.01.09 The piv-interim extension (OID = 2.16.840.1.101.3.6.9.1) shall be present and
contain an interim_indicator field which is populated with a Boolean value. This extension
is not critical.
VE07.01.09.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the use of this extension as part
of the PIV authentication certificate profile.
TE07.01.09.01: The tester shall validate that the piv-interim extension is present in the PIV
authentication certificate issued by the vendor.

7.1.2   Key Pair and Certificate Conformance


AS07.01.10: The size of the public key for PIV authentication shall be determined by the
expiration of the certificate in accordance with Table 3-1 of SP 800-78.
VE07.01.10.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the allowable public key size to
be used while generating PIV authentication keys.
TE07.01.10.01: The tester shall validate that the public key size is in accordance with Table 3-1
of SP80078.

AS07.01.11: The public key present in the PIV authentication certificate correspond to the
PIV authentication private key.
No requirement for vendor.
TE07.01.11.01: The tester shall validate that the public key present in the PIV authentication
certificate is part of the key pair corresponding to the private key on the PIV card.

AS07.01.12: The FASC-N in the subjectAltName field in the PIV authentication certificate
is the same as the FASC-N present in the CHUID.
No requirement for vendor.
TE07.01.12.01: The tester shall validate that the FASC-N in the subjectAltName field in the PIV
authentication certificate is the same as the FASC-N present in the CHUID in the PIV card.

AS07.01.13: The expiration of the PIV authentication certificate is not beyond the
expiration of the CHUID.
No requirement for vendor.
TE07.01.13.01: The tester shall validate that the expiration of the PIV authentication certificate
is not beyond the expiration of the CHUID in the PIV card.

AS07.01.14: If the public key algorithm is RSA, the exponent shall be greater than or equal
to 65,537.
VE07.01.14.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the size of the exponent permitted
while generating an RSA key pair for PIV authentication.
