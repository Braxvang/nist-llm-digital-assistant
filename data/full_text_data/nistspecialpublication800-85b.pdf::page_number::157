                    key usage extension              used to sign the fingerprint biometric data asserts the
                                                     id-PIV-content-signing OID in the extended key
                                                     usage extension.
TE06.02.18.01       10.2.2.2: Verify signer public   The tester shall validate that the public key size is in
                    key size                         accordance with Table 3-3 of SP 800-78.

Section 6           Section 10
TE06.03.01.01       10.3.1.1: Verify presence of     The tester shall validate that the digital signature in
                    CMS SignedData                   the CBEFF_SIGNATURE_BLOCK has been
                                                     formatted correctly as a CMS external signature as
                                                     defined in RFC 3852.
TE06.03.02.01       10.3.1.1: Verify presence of     The tester shall validate that the CMS external digital
