applications running on guest OSs: if the organization has a security policy for an application, it should
apply the same regardless of whether the application is running on an OS within a hypervisor or on an OS
running on hardware.

Restrict and protect administrator access to the virtualization solution.

The security of the entire virtual infrastructure relies on the security of the virtualization management
system that controls the hypervisor and allows the operator to start guest OSs, create new guest OS
images, and perform other administrative actions. Because of the security implications of these actions,
access to the virtualization management system should be restricted to authorized administrators only.
Some virtualization products offer multiple ways to manage hypervisors, so organizations should secure
each management interface, whether locally or remotely accessible. For remote administration, the
confidentiality of communications should be protected, such as through use of FIPS-approved
cryptographic algorithms and modules.

Ensure that the hypervisor is properly secured.

Securing a hypervisor involves actions that are standard for any type of software, such as installing
updates as they become available. Other recommended actions that are specific to hypervisors include
disabling unused virtual hardware; disabling unneeded hypervisor services such as clipboard- or file-
sharing; and considering using the hypervisorâ€™s capabilities to monitor the security of each guest OS
running within it, as well as the security of activity occurring between guest OSs. The hypervisor itself
also needs to be carefully monitored for signs of compromise. It is also important to provide physical
access controls for the hardware on which the hypervisor runs. For example, hosted hypervisors are
typically controlled by management software that can be used by anyone with access to the keyboard and
mouse. Even bare metal hypervisors require physical security: someone who can reboot the host computer
that the hypervisor is running on might be able to alter some of the security settings for the hypervisor.

Carefully plan the security for a full virtualization solution before installing, configuring, and
deploying it.

Planning helps ensure that the virtual environment is as secure as possible and in compliance with all
relevant organizational policies. Security should be considered from the initial planning stage at the
beginning of the systems development life cycle to maximize security and minimize costs. It is much
more difficult and expensive to address security after deployment and implementation.
