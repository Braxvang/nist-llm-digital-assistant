                                                       GUIDE TO SECURITY FOR FULL VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGIES



2.4.1.1 Single Server Virtualization

A common use case for single server virtualization is supporting a service that only runs on a legacy OS
that cannot be properly secured on its own. For example, common security controls may not be available
for the legacy OS. If the service and legacy OS are run as a guest OS, the hypervisor or host OS may be
able to monitor the guest OS’s actions using various security controls that the legacy OS itself cannot.
Also, an additional layer of authentication and auditing could be added, such as at the host OS level. Such
monitoring can be built into the organization’s security policies.

2.4.1.2 Multiple Server Virtualization

For many years, organizations have typically deployed each important service to its own dedicated host so
as to better isolate each server from the others and prevent a compromise of one server or host from
granting control to other servers. However, having many hosts is costly (space, power consumption,
maintenance, hardware, etc.), so organizations have been adopting server virtualization so that they can
host multiple services on a single host, with each service in a separate guest OS to enforce security
requirements. When a service experiences higher-than-normal use, the hypervisor can coordinate requests
among guest OSs and other hypervisors to ensure that resources are properly distributed. Services that are
rarely used can be kept in a saved state by the guest OS and loaded by the guest OS on demand. This frees
up resources for other guest OSs. Also, new servers can be deployed without the need to configure and
deploy as much new dedicated hardware.

Another benefit for data centers is that a hypervisor can present resources to the guest OSs as a single
entity, such as showing multiple hard drives as a single storage entity. This allows individual resources to
be added or removed from the system transparently, without modifying individual guest OSs. A single
read-only image can be shared among many servers. Additionally, there are benefits for configuration
management, because each guest OS can be derived from a parent guest OS, providing a consistent
security baseline and reducing the time and effort required to configure and patch individual servers.
Organizations taking advantage of virtualization may benefit from improved incident handling; servers
can be reverted to an uninfected state quickly, while the complete state (including RAM) of the
compromised guest OS can be saved in a snapshot for later examination.

However, there can be substantial security risks in consolidating multiple services within a single
hypervisor. For example, a critical service is usually placed on its own dedicated host so that the host can
be secured specifically for that service and so that a compromise of any other service would not impact
the critical service. By placing a critical service on a host with other services, both of those goals are
impacted. It is particularly risky to place multiple services on a host if they have significantly different
security needs. For example, suppose that one service is considered critical and is secured very strongly,
while another service on the same host is considered low-impact and is secured relatively weakly. An
attacker wanting to compromise the critical service could compromise the low-impact service and use the
fact that it is local on the virtual network to attempt to access the critical service or to compromise the
hypervisor and thus gain access to the critical service. Organizations that have policies relating to
allocation of computer resources should consider virtualization in such policies.

When multiple server virtualization is used for running servers on many hosts and for moving servers
from host to host based on changing resource needs, it can be called cloud computing. Cloud computing is
“a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing
resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and
