     B   Appendix: VOIP Frequently Asked Questions


     1. What is VOIP?

           Voice Over Internet Protocol is a set of software, hardware, and standards
           designed to make it possible to transmit voice over packet switched networks,
           either an internal Local Area Network, or across the Internet.

     2. What are some of the advantages of VOIP?

           a. Cost – a VOIP system is usually cheaper to operate than an equivalent
              office telephone system with a Private Branch Exchange and conventional
              telephone service.

           b. Integration with other services – Innovative services are emerging that
              allow customers to combine web access with telephone features through a
              single PC or terminal. For example, a sales representative could discuss
              products with a customer using the company’s web site. In addition, the
              VOIP system may be integrated with video across the Internet, providing a
              teleconferencing facility.

     3. What are some of the disadvantages of VOIP?

           a. Startup cost – although VOIP can be expected to save money in the long
              run, the initial installation can be complex and expensive. In addition, a
              single standard has not yet emerged for many aspects of VOIP, so an
              organization must plan to support more than one standard, or expect to
              make relatively frequent changes as the VOIP field develops.

           b. Security – the flexibility of VOIP comes at a price: added complexity in
              securing voice and data. Because VOIP systems are connected to the data
              network, and share many of the same hardware and software components,
              there are more ways for intruders to attack a VOIP system than a
              conventional voice telephone system or PBX.

     4. Can small organizations or home users use VOIP systems?

           Yes. Vendors have made VOIP solutions attractive to organizations of all
           sizes, and are now expanding into the home market. Most of the security
           problems discussed in this publication have also extended into the home
           market.
