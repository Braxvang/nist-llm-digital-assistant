SP 800-152                                                     A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


FR:6.111 The CKMS design shall describe what non-invasive attacks are mitigated by the
cryptographic modules used by the system and provide a description of how the mitigation is
performed.

FR:6.112 The CKMS design shall identify any cryptographic modules that are vulnerable to
non-invasive attacks.

FR:6.113 The CKMS design shall provide the rationale for accepting the vulnerabilities
caused by possible non-invasive attacks.

An FCKMS must use cryptographic modules that protect against unauthorized access to their
contents (see Section 2.10 for requirements).

                            A Federal CKMS shall repair or replace a compromised
PR:6.82
                            cryptographic module and then verify its correct operation
                            and security before being used operationally.

6.8.5 Computer System Compromise Recovery
The security of an FCKMS often depends on the security and integrity of its own computer
systems, including its hardware, software, and data.              Unauthorized access to, or
modifications of, any of these could corrupt secure computer operation. Unauthorized
modification of FCKMS software or of a computer’s operating system could be detected
using tools that run on a separate secure platform and by monitoring any unauthorized
modification to a file, changes to the hash value of a file’s contents, or changes to a file’s
attributes. Alternatively, a layered system of protections could be built into the system; in this
case, the mechanisms would need to be protected from the same threats as the system itself.
When critical files undergo unauthorized modifications that are detected by the monitor or
are indicated in the event log, then these files should be replaced with known valid and
secure copies of those files obtained from secure backup storage.

An FCKMS could incorporate automated monitoring devices and software that detect certain
threats or compromises. For example, some communication networks monitor for and detect
errors that accidentally occur or have been induced in the network. If a network uses error-
detection codes for communications, the monitor could detect error propagation
characteristics that are outside the norm and initiate some compensating action to minimize
the result of this type of compromise. If cryptographic-based Message Authentication Codes
(MACs) are used in communications, certain deliberate and accidental modifications to the
data (e.g., keys and metadata) can be detected. Non-cryptographic error-detection codes are
not intended to detect deliberate modifications.

FR:6.114 The CKMS design shall specify the mechanisms used to detect unauthorized
modifications to the CKMS system hardware, software and data.

FR:6.115 The CKMS design shall specify how the CKMS recovers from unauthorized
modifications to the CKMS system hardware, software and data.
