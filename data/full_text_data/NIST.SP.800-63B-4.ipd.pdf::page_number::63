1898   7.2.1. Reauthentication from a Federation or Assertion
1899   When using a federation protocol and Identity Provider (IdP) to authenticate at the RP
1900   as described in [SP800-63C], special considerations apply to session management and
1901   reauthentication. The federation protocol communicates an authentication event at the IdP
1902   to the RP using an assertion, and the RP then begins an authenticated session based on the
1903   successful validation of this assertion. Since the IdP and RP manage sessions separately
1904   from each other and the federation protocol does not connect the session management
1905   between the IdP and RP, the termination of the subscriber’s sessions at an IdP and at an
1906   RP are independent of each other. Likewise, the subscriber’s sessions at multiple different
1907   RPs are established and terminated independently of each other.
1908   Consequently, when an RP session expires and the RP requires reauthentication, it is
1909   entirely possible that the session at the IdP has not expired and that a new assertion could
1910   be generated from this session at the IdP without explicitly reauthenticating the subscriber.
1911   The IdP can communicate the time and details of the authentication event to the RP, but
1912   it is up to the RP to determine if reauthentication requirements have been met. Section
1913   5.3 of [SP800-63C] provides additional details and requirements for session management
1914   within a federation context.
