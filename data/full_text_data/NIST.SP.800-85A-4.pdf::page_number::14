NIST SP 800-85A-4                                             PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                       INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

The following list shows the test system components included in this configuration:
   +      Test toolkit application software.
   +      Vendor provided PIV Middleware, which is the subject of this test (also called the
          implementation under test or IUT) and
   One of the following combinations:
   +      Contact and contactless smart card readers or a dual interface reader together with
   +      A PIN input mechanism together with
   +      A dual interface FIPS 201 conformant PIV Card loaded with “SP 800-73-4 Part 2
          conformant PIV Card Application” (Refer to Section 7.2 for definition).
   or
   +      A PIV card emulator that emulates the behavior of a PIV Card Application.
The test toolkit application software resides on the test computer and facilitates the execution
and management of both test suites explained in Section 3. For the PIV Middleware Test, the
test system (Figure 2) will be configured so that the vendor provided PIV Middleware under
test is also installed on the test computer and interacts with the SP 800-73-4 conformant test
cards via the card reader(s).

  2.3.2    PIV Card Application Test Configuration
The card application test configuration is used to test any PIV Card Application through
commands of the PIV card command interface defined in SP 800-73-4 Part 2. The following
list shows the test system components included in this configuration:
   +      Test toolkit application software.
   +      Contact and contactless smart card readers or a dual interface reader.
   +      A PIN input mechanism.
   +      A PIV Card loaded with a PIV Card Application that supports contact and contactless
          interfaces and is the subject of this test (also called implementation under test or
          IUT).
For the PIV Card Application Test, the test system shown in Figure 2 will be configured such
that the test toolkit application software directly interacts with the PIV Card under test via the
card reader(s). The PIV Card Application Test configuration is depicted in Figure 4.
