                                                                  GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



          vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, or routine actions (e.g., logging onto a system
          remotely), and then ensure that the log data those activities should generate exists and is handled
          according to the organization’s policies and procedures.
Most testing and validation efforts use primarily passive methods. Active methods are often more
effective than passive methods because active methods perform actual testing of the logging processes,
but active methods are also more resource-intensive. Also, some active methods such as penetration
testing could inadvertently disrupt system functionality or create the appearance that a serious computer
security incident has occurred, so they should only be used with proper approval from management and
with coordination with operational and security staff. In some cases, active methods are used not only to
test and validate logging, but also to audit other functions. For example, by using active methods without
notifying the log management staff and others involved in daily operations, an auditor could evaluate how
effectively the organization performs incident handling in response to suspicious activity (the auditors’
active methods) recorded in logs.

Organizations should conduct periodic audits of the security of the log management infrastructure itself
and a representative sampling of the log generators. This should be performed as a risk assessment,
taking into account the threats that the hosts at each tier of the log management infrastructure face and the
security controls in place to stop those threats. Specific security objectives include the following:

       The infrastructure log servers are fully hardened and can perform functions in support of log
        management only
       The systems generating logs are secured appropriately (e.g., fully patched, unneeded services
        disabled)
       Access to both system-level and infrastructure logs and logging software (both on the hosts and
        on media) is strictly limited, and the integrity of the logs and software is protected and verified
       All network communications involving log data are protected appropriately as needed.
Organizations should also review the design of the log management infrastructure periodically, and
implement changes as needed. Possible reasons for altering the design include taking advantage of
improvements and enhancements to log management software, handling larger volumes of log data, and
addressing a need for stronger security controls. Periodic reviews of log management processes and
procedures should also be conducted so that log management continues to be effective at detecting the
latest threats in changing environments.

5.7     Summary

System-level and infrastructure administrators should follow standard processes for managing the logs for
which they are responsible. The major operational processes for log management are configuring log
sources, performing log analysis, initiating responses to identified events, and managing long-term data
storage.

System-level administrators need to configure log sources so that they capture the needed information in
the desired format and locations, as well as retain the information for the appropriate period of time.
When planning logging configurations, system-level administrators should consider the effect of the
configuration not only on the logging host, but also on other log management infrastructure components.
System-level administrators also need to configure log sources to perform log rotation, preferably both at
a regular time and when a maximum log size is reached. System-level administrators also need to
configure systems to act appropriately when a log that cannot be rotated automatically becomes full.
