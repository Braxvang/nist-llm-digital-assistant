2021   transformation, use, disclosure, transfer, and disposal of personally identifiable
2022   information.

2023   Pharming
2024   An attack in which an attacker corrupts an infrastructure service such as DNS (Domain
2025   Name System) causing the subscriber to be misdirected to a forged verifier/RP, which
2026   could cause the subscriber to reveal sensitive information, download harmful software, or
2027   contribute to a fraudulent act.

2028   Phishing
2029   An attack in which the subscriber is lured (usually through an email) to interact with
2030   a counterfeit verifier/RP and tricked into revealing information that can be used to
2031   masquerade as that subscriber to the real verifier/RP.

2032   Possession and Control of an Authenticator
2033   The ability to activate and use the authenticator in an authentication protocol.

2034   Practice Statement
2035   A formal statement of the practices followed by the parties to an authentication process
2036   (e.g., CSP or verifier). It usually describes the partiesâ€™ policies and practices and can
2037   become legally binding.

2038   Predictability
2039   Per [NISTIR8062]: Enabling reliable assumptions by individuals, owners, and operators
2040   about PII and its processing by an information system.

2041   Private Key
2042   The secret part of an asymmetric key pair that is used to digitally sign or decrypt data.

2043   Processing
2044   Per [NISTIR8062]: Operation or set of operations performed upon PII that can include,
2045   but is not limited to, the collection, retention, logging, generation, transformation, use,
2046   disclosure, transfer, and disposal of PII.

2047   Presentation Attack
2048   Presentation to the biometric data capture subsystem with the goal of interfering with the
2049   operation of the biometric system.

2050   Presentation Attack Detection (PAD)
2051   Automated determination of a presentation attack. A subset of presentation attack
2052   determination methods, referred to as liveness detection, involves measurement and
2053   analysis of anatomical characteristics or involuntary or voluntary reactions, in order to
