        SC contract information = {(confidentiality, MODERATE), (integrity, MODERATE), (availability, LOW)}, and
        SC administrative information = {(confidentiality, LOW), (integrity, LOW), (availability, LOW)}.
The resulting security category of the information system is expressed as:
        SC acquisition system = {(confidentiality, MODERATE), (integrity, MODERATE), (availability, LOW)},
representing the high water mark or maximum potential impact values for each security objective
from the information types resident on the acquisition system.
SYSTEM EXAMPLE 2: A power plant contains a SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition)
system controlling the distribution f electric power for a large military installation. The SCADA
system contains both real-time sensor data and routine administrative information. The
management at the power plant determines that: (i) for the sensor data being acquired by the
SCADA system, there is no potential impact from a loss of confidentiality, a high potential
impact from a loss of integrity, and a high potential impact from a loss of availability; and (ii) for
the administrative information being processed by the system, there is a low potential impact
from a loss of confidentiality, a low potential impact from a loss of integrity, and a low potential
impact from a loss of availability. The resulting security categories, or SC, of these information
types are expressed as:
        SC sensor data = {(confidentiality, NA), (integrity, HIGH), (availability, HIGH)}, and
        SC administrative information = {(confidentiality, LOW), (integrity, LOW), (availability, LOW)}.

The resulting security category of the information system is initially expressed as:
        SC SCADA system = {(confidentiality, LOW), (integrity, HIGH), (availability, HIGH)},

representing the high water mark or maximum potential impact values for each security objective
from the information types resident on the SCADA system. The management at the power plant
chooses to increase the potential impact from a loss of confidentiality from low to moderate
reflecting a more realistic view of the potential impact on the information system should there be
a security breach due to the unauthorized disclosure of system-level information or processing
functions. The final security category of the information system is expressed as:
        SC SCADA system = {(confidentiality, MODERATE), (integrity, HIGH), (availability, HIGH)}.

4.4.2   Guidelines for System Categorization

In some cases, the impact level for a system security category will be higher than any security
objective impact level for any information type processed by the system.
The primary factors that most commonly raise the impact levels of the system security category
above that of its constituent information types are aggregation and critical system functionality.
Additionally, variations in sensitivity/criticality with respect to time may need to be factored into
the impact assignment process. Some information loses its sensitivity in time (e.g.,
economic/commodity projections after theyâ€™ve been published). Other information is
particularly critical at some point in time (e.g., weather data in the terminal approach area during
aircraft landing operations). This section provides some general guidelines regarding how
aggregation, critical functionality, and other system factors may affect system security
categorization.
