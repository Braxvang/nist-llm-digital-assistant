       that does not take into account future data releases of a new related dataset by the
       agency or others.
    • Agencies should clearly explain how they continue to monitor and improve to protect
      privacy.
    • Agencies should aim to make an informed decision about the fdelity of the data
      that they release by systematically evaluating the risks and benefts and choosing de-
      identifcation techniques and data-sharing models that are tailored to their require-
      ments.
    • When telling individuals that their de-identifed information will be released, agen-
      cies should disclose that privacy risks may remain despite de-identifcation.
Planning is essential for successful de-identifcation and data release. In a research envi-
ronment, this planning should include the research design, data collection, protection of
identifers, disclosure analysis, and data-sharing strategy. In an operational environment,
this planning includes a comprehensive analysis of the purpose of the data release, the
expected use of the released data, the privacy-related risks, and the privacy-protecting con-
trols. Both cases should review the appropriateness of various privacy controls given the
risks, intended uses, and the ways that those controls could fail. See Sec. 3.6, “Disclosure
Review Boards” for a discussion of how a Disclosure Review Board (DRB) or an Insti-
tutional Review Board (IRB) can be used to make this process orderly, predictable, and
repeatable.
De-identifcation can have signifcant time, labor, and data processing costs. However,
when properly executed, this effort can result in data that have high value for a research
community and the general public while still adequately protecting individual privacy.

1.1.   Document Purpose and Scope
This document provides guidance on the selection, use, and evaluation of de-identifcation
techniques for U.S. Government datasets. It also provides a framework that can be adapted
by federal agencies to shape the governance of de-identifcation processes. The ultimate
goal of this document is to reduce disclosure risks that might result from an intentional data
release. However, this document does not provide step-by-step guidance for de-identifying
the vast range of possible datasets held by U.S. Government agencies. For each dataset
that is to be de-identifed, agencies must rely on experts and have their proposed efforts
reviewed by an appropriate governance procedure.

1.2.   Intended Audience
This document is intended for use by government system engineers, security offcers, data
scientists, privacy offcers, disclosure review boards, and other offcials. It is also designed
to be generally informative to researchers and academics involved in the technical aspects
