NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                              Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                     Generation Using Deterministic RBGs

8.4 Security Strengths Supported by an Instantiation

The DRBG mechanisms specified in this Recommendation support four security strengths: 112,
128, 192 or 256 bits. The security strength for the instantiation is requested during DRBG
instantiation, and the instantiate function obtains the appropriate amount of entropy for the
requested security strength. Each DRBG mechanism has restrictions on the security strength it
can support, based on its design (see Section 10).
The actual security strength supported by a given instantiation depends on the DRBG
implementation and on the amount of entropy provided to the instantiate function. Note that the
security strength actually supported by a particular instantiation could be less than the maximum
security strength possible for that DRBG implementation (see Table 1). For example, a DRBG
that is designed to support a maximum security strength of 256 bits could, instead, be
instantiated to support only a 128-bit security strength if the additional security provided by the
256-bit security strength is not required (e.g., by requesting only 128 bits of entropy during
instantiation, rather than 256 bits of entropy).

Following instantiation, a request can be made to the generate function for pseudorandom bits
(see Section 9.3). The pseudorandom bits returned from a DRBG shall not be used for any
application that requires a higher security strength than the DRBG is instantiated to support. The
security strength provided in these returned bits is the minimum of the security strength
supported by the DRBG and the length of the bit string returned, i.e.:
          Security_strength_of_output = min(output_length, DRBG_security_strength).
A concatenation of bit strings resulting from multiple calls to a DRBG will not provide a security
strength for the concatenated string that is greater than the instantiated security strength of the
DRBG. For example, two 128-bit output strings requested from a DRBG that supports a128-bit
security strength cannot be concatenated to form a 256-bit string with a security strength of 256
bits. A more complete discussion of this issue is provided in [SP 800-90C].
For each generate request, the security strength to be provided for the bits is requested. Any
security strength can be requested during a call to the generate function, up to the security
strength of the instantiation, e.g., an instantiation could be instantiated at the 128-bit security
strength, but a request for pseudorandom bits could indicate that a lesser security strength is
actually required for the bits to be generated. Assuming that the request is valid, the requested
number of bits is returned.
When an instantiation is used for multiple purposes, the minimum security strength requirement
for each purpose must be considered. The DRBG needs to be instantiated for the highest security
strength required. For example, if one purpose requires a security strength of 112 bits, and
