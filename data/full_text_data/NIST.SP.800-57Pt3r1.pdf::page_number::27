   a) CAs should be configured to authenticate and process revocation requests
      electronically.
   b) Where the CA can authenticate a digitally signed request submitted by the user of
      the associated key pair or an RA, the request should be handled without manual
      intervention.

2. RAs should be configured to submit digitally signed revocation requests on behalf of
   users or the organization.


2.4.3 Certificate Revocation List Generation
1. To maximize interoperability, all CAs should be configured to generate full CRLs. A
   full CRL is a single CRL that lists all revoked and unexpired certificates issued by a
   particular CA.

2. CAs that serve a large community should generate CRL distribution points in
   addition to full CRLs. Each CRL distribution point lists a subset of the revoked
   certificates for a given CA. The number of certificates covered by a CRL distribution
   point should be limited to a maximum of 250 000 to ensure that the distribution point
   CRLs do not grow to an unmanageable size.


2.4.4 PKI Repositories for the Distribution of Certificates and CRLs
1. PKIs should be configured to provide certificates and CRLs to requesters without
   authentication of the requester.

2. PKI repositories shall be configured to require authenticated access to modify the set
   of certificates and CRLs distributed by the repository.

3. At a minimum, repositories shall support either HTTP version 1.1 or LDAP version 3
   interface.

4. For maximum interoperability, both HTTP and LDAP should be supported.

5. Replication of repositories (e.g., through directory shadowing or web server
   replication) to maximize availability should be considered.

6. PKI repositories should contain all CA certificates issued by or to the corresponding
   PKI.

7. PKI repositories shall contain all current CRLs.
