OT Discussion: Fire suppression mechanisms should take the OT environment into account (e.g.,
water sprinkler systems could be hazardous in specific environments).
Control Enhancement: (1) (2) No OT Discussion for this control.
PE-14 ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS

                                                                              CONTROL BASELINES

 PE-14        Environmental Controls                                       Select    Select      Select

OT Discussion: Temperature and humidity controls are typically components of other OT
systems (e.g., HVAC, process, or lighting systems) or can be a stand-alone and unique OT
system. OT can operate in extreme environments and both interior and exterior locations. For a
specific OT, the temperature and humidity design and operational parameters dictate the
performance specifications. Power circuits, distribution closets, routers, and switches that
support fire protection and life safety systems must be maintained at the proper temperature and
humidity. When environmental controls cannot be implemented, use hardware that is engineered
to withstand the OT’s unique environmental hazards.
PE-15 WATER DAMAGE PROTECTION

                                                                                CONTROL BASELINES

  PE-15 (1)    WATER DAMAGE PROTECTION | AUTOMATION SUPPORT                                       Select

OT Discussion: Water damage protection and the use of shutoff and isolation valves are
procedural actions and specific types of OT. OT used in the manufacturing, hydropower,
transportation/navigation, water, and wastewater industries rely on the movement of water and
are specifically designed to manage the quantity, flow, and pressure of water. Power circuits,
distribution closets, routers, and switches that support fire protection and life safety systems
should ensure that water will not disable the system (e.g., a fire that activates the sprinkler
system does not spray onto the fire control servers, routers, or switches or short out the alarms,
egress systems, emergency lighting, or suppression systems).
Control Enhancement: (1) No OT Discussion for this control.
