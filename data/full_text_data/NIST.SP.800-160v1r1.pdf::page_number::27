failure. Trust that is granted without establishing the required trustworthiness is a significant
contributor to risk. The concepts of trust and trustworthiness are discussed in Appendix F.


                                        ENGINEERING FOR TRUST
        In January 2022, INCOSE released the Systems Engineering Vision 2035 [16]. It is intended
        to inspire, guide, and inform the strategic direction for the global systems engineering
        community. A core element identified for the future state of systems engineering is
        increased confidence in systems to improve the practice of engineering trusted systems.
        As noted in [7], a key problem to address in realizing Vision 2035 is that “systems security
        has moved from its traditional focus on trust to a more singular focus on risk.” The need
        is to prove a level of system security through evidence-based assurance.
