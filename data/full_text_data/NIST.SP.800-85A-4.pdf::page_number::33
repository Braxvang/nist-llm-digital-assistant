NIST SP 800-85A-4                                               PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                         INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

AS01.18D-R4: If the Global PIN is used by the PIV Card Application, then the above
encoding, length, padding, and enforcement of minimum PIN length requirements for the PIV
Card Application PIN shall apply to the Global PIN.

Note: This assertion is tested as part of AS05.22A.


A.1.4      Status of PIV Card Application

AS01.19: The state of the PIV Card Application shall be as follows, when the PIV Card
Application is the currently selected application:

           1. The “global security status” indicator shall always be defined. It can be used by
              all applications on the card platform and is maintained by PIV Platform.
           2. The “currently selected application” shall always be defined. The platform shall
              support the selection of a card application using the full application identifier or
              by providing the right truncated version and there shall always be a currently
              selected application. The “currently selected application” is maintained by the
              PIV Platform.
           3. The “application security status” indicator shall always be defined. These
              indicators are local to the PIV Card Application and are maintained by the PIV
              Card Application.

Note: This assertion is not separately tested.

A.1.5      Card Platform Configuration

AS01.20: Both single-chip/dual-interface and dual-chip implementations are acceptable.

Note: This assertion is not separately tested.

AS01.21: In the single-chip/dual-interface configuration, the PIV Card Application shall be
provided the information regarding which interface is in use.

Required Vendor Information

VE01.21.01: The card operating system should inform the PIV Card Application the communication
interface in use.

Required Test Procedures

TE01.21.01: The tester shall validate that the card platform informs the PIV Card Application of the
interface being used.

Note: This assertion is not separately tested. This assertion is indirectly tested by verifying whether
the card application returns an appropriate error response code for those commands that cannot be
