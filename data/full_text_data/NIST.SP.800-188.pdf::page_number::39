NIST SP 800-188
September 2023



    • Increased availability of an individual’s non-public personal information that causes
      psychological harm by exposing potentially embarrassing information or information
      that the individual may not otherwise choose to reveal to the public or to family
      members and that potential affects opportunities in the economic marketplace (e.g.,
      employment, housing, college admission)
Potential adverse impacts on agencies include:
    • Mandatory reporting under breach reporting laws, regulations, or policies
    • Embarrassment or reputational damage
    • Respondents who provide data may lose faith in the data, may hesitate to provide
      data, or may feel compelled to provide inaccurate information in future data collec-
      tions
    • Harm to agency operations if some aspect of those operations required that the de-
      identifed data remain confdential (e.g., an agency that is forced to discontinue a
      scientifc experiment because the data release may have biased the study participants)
    • Financial impacts that result from the harm to individuals (e.g., lawsuits)
    • Civil or criminal sanctions against employees or contractors that result from a data
      release contrary to U.S. law
The cascading impacts of re-identifcation and other breaches threaten all agencies, not just
the agency that owns the re-identifed data. Potential adverse impacts include:
    • Undermining the reputation of researchers in general and the willingness of the pub-
      lic to support or tolerate research and provide accurate information to government
      agencies and researchers
    • Engendering a lack of trust in government – individuals may stop consenting to the
      use of their data, may stop providing data, or may provide false data
    • Damaging the practice of using de-identifed information – de-identifcation is an
      important tool for promoting research and accountability, and poorly executed de-
      identifcation efforts may negatively impact the public’s view of this technique and
      limit its use
Please see the NIST PRAM [20]
One way to calculate the upper bound on an impact to an individual or agency is to es-
timate the impact that would result from the inadvertent release of the original dataset.
This approach will not calculate the upper bound on the societal impact, however, since
that impact includes reputational damage to the practice of de-identifcation itself. That is,
every time data are compromised because of a poorly executed de-identifcation effort, it
becomes harder to justify the use of de-identifcation in future data releases.
