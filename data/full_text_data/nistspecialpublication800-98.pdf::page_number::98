GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



6.4.3    Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)

Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002 provides for FISMA provisions. The purpose of FISMA is to
provide a comprehensive framework for the management of federal information security, including the
establishment of a minimum level of controls to protect information and information systems, the
improved oversight of agency information security programs, and the use of commercially developed
information security products. For the past two years, OMB has required that in addition to the quarterly
reporting on compliance with FISMA security requirements, agencies must now report on their privacy
compliance posture with federal laws (for instance, the Privacy Act of 1974 and Section 208 of the E-
Government Act of 2002). In Fiscal Year (FY) 2006, OMB’s Instructions for Preparing the FISMA and
Privacy Management Report 74 prescribed that information and information systems must be categorized
and have an appropriate number of security controls and privacy considerations given to each. In
addition, OMB stated that there must be a mechanism in place to monitor the security controls and
privacy risks, as well as to determine the security and privacy deficiencies of the system.

6.4.4    Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005

Section 522 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act (“Section 522”) prescribes privacy rules for the
Departments of Treasury and Transportation, as well as Independent Agencies, but does not currently
apply to agencies outside this group. Section 522 extends the mandates in Section 208 of the
E-Government Act of 2002 to include requirements that agencies:

 Assure that the use of technologies sustain and do not erode privacy protections relating to the use,
  collection, and disclosure of information in an identifiable form,
 Assure that technologies used to collect, use, store, and disclose information in identifiable form
  allow for continuous auditing of compliance with stated privacy policies and practices governing the
  collection, use and distribution of information in the operation of the program,
 Assure that personal information contained in Privacy Act systems of records is handled in full
  compliance with fair information practices as defined in the Privacy Act of 1974,
 Evaluate legislative and regulatory proposals involving collection, use, and disclosure of personal
  information by the Federal Government,
 Conduct privacy impact assessment of proposed department rules on the privacy of information in an
  identifiable form, including the type of personally identifiable information collected and the number
  of people affected,
 Prepare a report to Congress on an annual basis on activities of the department that affect privacy,
 Ensure that the Department protects information in an identifiable form and information systems from
  unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction,
 Train and educate employees on privacy and data protection policies to promote awareness of and
  compliance with established privacy and data protection policies,
 Establish privacy and data protection procedures and policies,
 Ensure compliance with the departments’ established privacy and data protection policies,
