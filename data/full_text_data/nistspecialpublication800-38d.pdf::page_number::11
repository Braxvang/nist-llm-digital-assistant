AAD                  Additional Authenticated Data

Additional           The input data to the authenticated encryption function that is
Authenticated Data   authenticated but not encrypted.

AES                  Advanced Encryption Standard.

Approved             FIPS approved or NIST recommended: an algorithm or technique that
                     is either 1) specified in a FIPS or a NIST Recommendation, or 2)
                     adopted in a FIPS or a NIST Recommendation.

Authenticated        The function of GCM in which the ciphertext is decrypted into the
Decryption           plaintext, and the authenticity of the ciphertext and the AAD is
                     verified.

Authenticated        The function of GCM in which the plaintext is encrypted into the
Encryption           ciphertext, and an authentication tag is generated on the AAD and the
                     ciphertext.

Authentication Tag   A cryptographic checksum on data that is designed to reveal both
(Tag)                accidental errors and the intentional modification of the data.

Authenticity         The property that data originated from its purported source.

Bit                  A binary digit: 0 or 1.

Bit String           A finite, ordered sequence of bits.

Block                For a given block cipher, a bit string whose length is the block size of
                     the block cipher.

Block Cipher         A parameterized family of permutations on bit strings of a fixed
                     length; the parameter that determines the permutation is a bit string
                     called the key.

Block Size           For a given block cipher and key, the fixed length of the input (or
                     output) bit strings.

Byte                 A sequence of 8 bits.

Byte String          A finite, ordered sequence of bytes.

Ciphertext           The encrypted form of the plaintext.
