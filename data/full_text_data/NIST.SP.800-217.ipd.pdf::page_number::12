      NIST SP 800-217 ipd                         Guidelines for PIV Federation (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


267   1.2. Purpose and Scope
268   This document focuses on the use of federation technologies with PIV identity accounts
269   for federal employees and contractors. This document does not discuss citizen-facing use
270   cases covered in [SP800-63C]. This document does not address creation or lifecycle of
271   PIV identity accounts as covered in [FIPS201], nor does this document account for the
272   issuance and management of derived PIV credentials in PIV identity accounts as covered
273   in [SP800-157]. While the guidelines within this document could be generally useful in
274   other circumstances, application to any additional use cases are outside the scope of this
275   document.

276   1.3. Federation Use Cases
277   In a direct authentication, the claimant presents their authenticator to a verifier, which is
278   tightly coupled with the RP and often the Credential Service Provider (CSP). The verifier
279   conducts an authentication process. This process sometimes uses an external service, such
280   as when public key infrastructure is used to validate a certificate.
281   PIV credentials are intended for use with direct authentication via the mechanisms listed
282   in [FIPS201] and [SP800-157]. However, there are many situations in which direct
283   authentication is not viable or desirable.
284   For example, non-PKI-based derived PIV credentials are bound and validated at the home
285   agency. Federation allows these credentials to be used for accessing systems outside of
286   the home agency by having the subscriber present the derived credential to the IdP, which
287   can validate the credential and assert to the RP that the validation has taken place.
288   In a federated authentication, the verifier is not tightly associated with RP and is instead
289   operated by a separate but trusted entity, the IdP. The PIV Card or derived PIV credential
290   is used to authenticate the PIV cardholder to the IdP of a federation system. The IdP
291   creates an assertion that represents the authentication event of the subscriber. The IdP
292   sends this assertion to the RP using a federation protocol, and the RP verifies the assertion
293   upon receipt.
294   Since the IdP needs to perform the role of verifier, usually the IdP is a service directly
295   provided by the CSP. This tight coupling allows the IdP a direct view of the status of
296   the PIV identity account and all associated PIV credentials. However, there are several
297   mechanisms for an IdP to be run by a party other than the CSP. For example, the CSP
298   could outsource the IdP functionality and synchronize the state of its PIV identity
299   accounts using a provisioning protocol or similar system. Alternatively, the use of PKI-
300   based PIV credentials allows an IdP to be run by a party other than the CSP. In this
301   scenario, the validity of the PIV identity account is inferred from the validity of the
302   credential presented to the third-party IdP.
