key validation for RSA; however, a method for partial public key validation is specified
in Section 5.3.3 that is to be used until an Approved method for full validation is
available.

5.3.1 (Explicit) Full Public Key Validation for DSA
The following process or its equivalent shall be used to validate a DSA signature
verification public key when public key validation is performed.
   Input:
       1. p, q         The primes.
       2. g            The generator.
       3. y            The public key to be validated with respect to p, q and g.
       Output:
       1. status       The status returned from the validation routine, where status is
                       either VALID or INVALID.
   Process:
       1. Verify that 2 ≤ y ≤ p-2.      Comment: Ensure that the key has the unique
                                        correct representation and range in the field.
       2. Verify that yq ≡ 1 mod p. Comment: Ensure that the key has the correct order
                                    in the subgroup.
       3. If either of the above checks fail, then return INVALID. Otherwise, return
          VALID.

5.3.2 (Explicit) Full Public Key Validation for ECDSA
The method for full public key validation is specified in ANS X9.62.

5.3.3 (Explicit) Partial Public Key Validation for RSA
Partial public key validation for RSA consists of conducting plausibility tests. These tests
determine whether the public modulus and public exponent are plausible, not necessarily
whether they are completely valid, i.e., that they conform to all RSA key generation
requirements as specified in FIPS 186-3. Plausibility tests can detect unintentional errors
with a reasonable probability. Note that full RSA public key validation is not specified in
this Recommendation, as it is an area of research. Therefore, if an application’s
requirements require assurance of full public key validation, then either DSA or ECDSA
shall be used.
Plausibility testing shall include the following tests, at a minimum:
   1. The length of the modulus is one of the specified values in FIPS 186-3.
   2. The value of the public exponent is in the valid range, as specified in FIPS 186-3.
   3. The modulus and the public exponent are odd numbers.
