            security risks, including coordination of information security efforts throughout the
            civilian, national security, and law enforcement communities;
       •    Provide for the development and maintenance of minimum security controls required to
            protect federal information and information systems;
       •    Provide a mechanism for improved oversight of federal agency information security
            programs;
       •    Acknowledge that commercially developed information security products offer advanced,
            dynamic, robust, and effective information security solutions for the protection of critical
            information infrastructures important to national defense and economic security that are
            designed, built, and operated by the private sector; and
       •    Recognize that the selection of specific technical hardware and software information
            security solutions should be made by individual agencies from among commercially
            developed products. 6

FISMA also mandated NIST to develop and promulgate standards and guidelines pertaining to
federal information systems.

FISMA requires agencies to identify and assess risks to their information systems and define and
implement appropriate security controls to protect their information resources. It also requires
agencies to report quarterly and annually on the status of their information security programs.
An institutionalized information security performance measurement program enables agencies to
collect and report on relevant FISMA performance indicators. For example, information security
performance measures enable agencies to quickly determine the percentage of their systems that
are certified and accredited, the percentage of their personnel that have taken required
information security training, and their compliance with other FISMA reporting requirements. A
mature information security measurement program also enables agencies to satisfy any new
information security performance measures reporting requirements required internally or
externally by providing a basis for information security data collection, analysis, quantification,
and reporting.

OMB publishes annual guidelines on the process and elements of annual and quarterly FISMA
reporting.

4.2         Federal Enterprise Architecture

In addition to legislative information security performance measurement requirements, the
Executive Branch periodically implements initiatives designed to monitor and improve the
effectiveness of federal organizations. One such Executive Branch initiative that relies on
information security measures is the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA). One of FEA’s
reference models is the Performance Reference Model (PRM). The PRM is a standardized
