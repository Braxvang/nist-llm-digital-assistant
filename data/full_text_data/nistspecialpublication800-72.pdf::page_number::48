                                                                         Guidelines on PDA Forensics


                via the serial port, the bootloader returns the contents of memory or copies it to a
                memory card. Similarly, the penguin bootloader for Linux handheld devices allows
                memory to be copied to a memory card.

                Exploit known system vulnerabilities – Mobile systems may possess system
                vulnerabilities within a standard interface protocol that an examiner can exploit to
                bypass authentication and gain access to information. For example, access to the
                device may be possible via a misconfigured network service [Cha02], a flaw in a
                standard networking protocol supported by the device, or an error in the protocol’s
                implementation making it susceptible to an attack method such as buffer overflow.
                Possible communications interfaces for exploitation include the serial, USB, IrDA,
                Bluetooth, WiFi, and GSM/GPRS facilities.

6.2.3   Hardware-based Methods

        Hardware-based methods involve a combination of software and hardware to break or bypass
        authentication mechanisms. Few general-purpose hardware-based methods apply to a general
        class of PDA devices. Most of the techniques are specialized for a specific model within a
        class. As with software-based methods, when a specialized technique is developed, it is
        normally developed using a test device identical to the one under examination. The device
        manufacturer may also provide useful information and tools for extracting data. Hardware-
        based methods include the following:

                Gain access through a hardware backdoor – Hardware backdoors, such as
                interfaces for debugging, production testing, or maintenance, may be used to gain
                access to memory. For example, some devices have active hardware test points on the
                circuit board that can be used to probe the device. Many manufacturers now support
                the JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) standard, which defines a common test interface
                for processor, memory, and other semiconductor chips, on their devices [Int96].
                Forensic examiners can communicate with a JTAG-compliant component by utilizing
                software and an add-in hardware controller in a personal computer card slot or a
                special purpose stand-alone programmer device to probe defined test points. The
                JTAG testing unit can send commands and data to the JTAG-compliant component
                and return the results to the unit for storage and rendition [Xjt03]. JTAG gives
                specialists another avenue for imaging devices that are locked or devices that may
                have minor damage and cannot be properly interfaced otherwise.

                Examine memory independently of the device – An experienced examiner may be
                able to examine memory chips directly on the device and extract information from
                them. For example, the Netherlands Forensic Institute has developed a general-
                purpose tool for examining a wide range of memory chips. Once physically
                connected via a memory clip, the tool is able not only to read and store memory
                contents, but also to overwrite them [Kni02].

                Reverse engineer the device to find and exploit a vulnerability – Reverse
                engineering involves retrieving the operating system code from the ROM of a PDA
                identical to the one under examination and analyzing the code to understand its use of
                the device hardware. With the understanding gained, any plausible vulnerabilities
                noted can be systematically tested to determine a useful exploit technique. For
                example, for a password authentication mechanism, it may be possible using memory
