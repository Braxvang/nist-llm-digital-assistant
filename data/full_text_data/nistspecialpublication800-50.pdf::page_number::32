      occurs within the stipulated timeframe necessary to address these dependencies.
3.5      Setting the Bar

“Setting the bar” means that a decision must be made as to the complexity of the material that will be
developed. The complexity must be commensurate with the role of the person who will undergo the
learning effort. Material should be developed based on two important criteria: 1) the target attendee’s
position within the organization, and 2) knowledge of the security skills required for that position. The
complexity of the material must be determined before development begins. Setting the bar applies to all
three types of learning – awareness, training, and education.

When setting the bar for an awareness effort, the focus
should be on the expected rules of behavior for using          Setting the bar means that a decision

agency’s awareness program matures, and most users
have been exposed to the initial material, the bar can be
raised. There are a number of ways to do this, including
developing a basics and literacy course, following the guidance in Chapter 3 of NIST Special Publication
800-16. Raising the bar is discussed further in Section 6.

Setting the bar correctly is even more critical when developing training material. Because the goal of
training is to produce relevant and needed skills and competencies, it is crucial that the needs assessment
identify those individuals with significant IT security responsibilities, assess their functions, and identify
their training needs. Training material should be developed that provides the skill set(s) necessary for
attendees to accomplish the security responsibilities associated with their jobs. IT security training
material can be developed at a beginning level for a person who is just learning a discipline (e.g., system
administrator, web or e-mail server administrator, auditor). Material can be developed at an intermediate
level for someone who has more experience, and therefore more responsibility, in a discipline. Advanced
material can be developed for those “centers of excellence” or agency subject matter experts whose jobs
incorporate the highest level of trust and an accompanying high level of IT security responsibility.
Chapter 4 of NIST Special Publication 800-16 provides guidance on developing training material for
these three levels of complexity, including learning objectives at each of the three levels to aid the
training course developer14.

Setting the bar for the education level of learning can be more difficult because curricula are developed
by colleges and universities, and is impacted less in the short term by agency-specific needs. Once
education needs have been identified within an organization, usually within the IT security office, a
school that provides the needed learning can be found. An agency can “shop” for a local college or
university whose certificate or degree program meets its needs or for a school that offers such a program
through distance learning. As was the case with training material, a college or university should be
selected because its curriculum meets the security needs of the agency personnel.

      Agencies may find commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) training material that can be used to meet the more advanced or
      complex training needs of their staff. Agencies will still have to define learning objectives for each role or group of people,
      and will have to do so for each level of complexity. The available COTS training can then be compared to what is required
      for each role to determine if the COTS training meets the agency’s needs. The subject of vendor-provided training is further
      addressed in Section 4.
