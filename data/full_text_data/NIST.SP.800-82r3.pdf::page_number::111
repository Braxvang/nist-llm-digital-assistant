6.1.3. Risk Assessment (ID.RA)
A cybersecurity risk assessment is performed to identify risks and estimate the magnitude of
harm to operations, assets, or individuals that might result from cyber incidents, such as
unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of an information
system or data. Organizations should consider the frequency with which to update risk
assessments and test system cybersecurity controls.
Supplemental guidance for ID.RA can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-30, Rev. 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments
   •   NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 2, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and
       Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy
   •   NIST SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and
       Information System View
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            In OT environments, risks and impacts may be related to safety, health,
            and the environment, in addition to business and financial impacts. As a
            result, organizations may find that conducting a cost-benefit analysis for
            some types of risks is not possible. In these cases, organizations should
            consider reviewing past cyber and non-cyber incidents that have resulted
            in the loss of power, control, upstream feed, or downstream capacity, as
            well as major equipment failures. A PHA, FMEA, or analysis of past
            events can be used to understand the potential impact of a cyber incident.
            ISA 62443-3-2 provides guidance on how to assess cyber risk in an
            environment with these potential consequences.
            Risk assessments also require the identification of both vulnerabilities
            and threats to the OT environment. Maintaining an accurate inventory of
            the IT and OT assets within the environment of operation – including the
            product vendor, model numbers, firmware, OSs, and software versions
            installed on the assets – facilitates the identification, tracking, and
            remediation of vulnerabilities. OT-specific vulnerability information is
            available through multiple methods, including:
                   •   Using OT-specific tools to automate asset inventory creation,
                       cross-correlation of the inventory with known vulnerabilities and
                       threats, and regular updates
                   •   Monitoring security groups, associations, and vendors for
                       security alerts and advisories
                   •   Reviewing the NVD database for detailed information on known
                       vulnerabilities for hardware and software assets
            Threat information that is relevant to the environment can be obtained
            from both internal resources and external threat intelligence information-
            sharing forums. Organizations should consider participating in cyber
            threat information sharing [SP800-150].
