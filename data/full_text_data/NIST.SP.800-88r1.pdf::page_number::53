NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                        Guidelines for Media Sanitization


                        sectors that are no longer in use due to reallocation‚Äù and the
                        contents of the media following Sanitization are vendor unique. The
                        actual action performed by an enhanced erase varies by vendor and
                        model, and could include a variety of actions that have varying
                        levels of effectiveness. The secure erase command is not defined in
                        the SCSI standard, so it does not apply to media with a SCSI
                        interface.

Shred                   A method of sanitizing media; the act of cutting or tearing into small
                        particles.

SSD                     A Solid State Drive (SSD) is a storage device that uses solid state
                        memory to store persistent data.

Storage                 Retrievable retention of data. Electronic, electrostatic, or electrical
                        hardware or other elements (media) into which data may be entered,
                        and from which data may be retrieved.

Target Data             The information subject to a given process, typically including most
                        or all information on a piece of storage media.

Validate                The step in the media sanitization process flowchart which involves
                        testing the media to ensure the information cannot be read.

Verification            The process of testing the media to ensure the information cannot be
                        read.

WORM                    Write-Once Read Many.

                        Also see CD-R.

Write                   Fundamental operations of an information system that results only in
                        the flow of information from an actor to storage media.
