      NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                       Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
      November 2023

433             components represent a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries.
434             Disabling wireless capabilities when not needed for essential missions or business functions can
435             help reduce susceptibility to threats by adversaries involving wireless technologies.

442             REQUIREMENT: 03.01.18
443             a. Establish usage restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection requirements for
444                mobile devices.
445             b. Authorize the connection of mobile devices to the system.
446             c.   Implement full-device or container-based encryption to protect the confidentiality of CUI on
447                  mobile devices.

448             DISCUSSION
449             A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can easily be
450             carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses
451             local, non-removable, or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source.
452             Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board
453             sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing
454             local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones, smart watches, and tablets.
455             Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and
456             transmission capability of mobile devices may be comparable to or a subset of notebook or
457             desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. The protection
458             and control of mobile devices is behavior- or policy-based and requires users to take physical
459             action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are
460             spaces for which the organization provides physical or procedural controls to meet the
461             requirements established for protecting CUI.
462             Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities,
463             organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage
464             restrictions, configuration requirements, and connection requirements for mobile devices
465             include configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementing
466             mandatory protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection
467             software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating
468             system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary
469             hardware. Organizations can employ full-device encryption or container-based encryption to
470             protect the confidentiality of CUI on mobile devices. Container-based encryption provides a
471             fine-grained approach to the encryption of data and information, including encrypting selected
472             data structures (e.g., files, records, or fields).
