3.4 MONITORING RISK
Risk monitoring provides organizations with the means to: (i) verify compliance;64 (ii) determine
the ongoing effectiveness of risk response measures; and (iii) identify risk-impacting changes to
organizational information systems and environments of operation. Analyzing monitoring results
gives organizations the capability to maintain awareness of the risk being incurred, highlight the
need to revisit other steps in the risk management process, and initiate process improvement
activities as needed.65 Organizations employ risk monitoring tools, techniques, and procedures to
increase risk awareness, helping senior leaders/executives develop a better understanding of the
ongoing risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the
Nation. Organizations can implement risk monitoring at any of the risk management tiers with
different objectives and utility of information produced. For example, Tier 1 monitoring activities
might include ongoing threat assessments and how changes in the threat space may affect Tier 2
and Tier 3 activities, including enterprise architectures (with embedded information security
architectures) and organizational information systems. Tier 2 monitoring activities might include,
for example, analyses of new or current technologies either in use or considered for future use by
organizations to identify exploitable weaknesses and/or deficiencies in those technologies that
may affect mission/business success. Tier 3 monitoring activities focus on information systems
and might include, for example, automated monitoring of standard configuration settings for
information technology products, vulnerability scanning, and ongoing assessments of security
controls. In addition to deciding on appropriate monitoring activities across the risk management
tiers, organizations also decide how monitoring is to be conducted (e.g., automated or manual
approaches) and the frequency of monitoring activities based on, for example, the frequency with
which deployed security controls change, critical items on plans of action and milestones, and
risk tolerance.

STEP 4: RISK MONITORING

Inputs and Preconditions
Inputs to this step include implementation strategies for selected courses of action for risk responses and the actual
implementation of selected courses of action. In addition to the risk response step, the risk monitoring step can receive
inputs from the risk framing step (e.g., when organizations become aware of an advanced persistent threat reflecting a
change in threat assumptions, this may result in a change in the frequency of follow on monitoring activities). The risk
framing step also directly shapes the resource constraints associated with establishing and implementing an
organization-wide monitoring strategy. In some instances, outputs from the risk assessment step may be useful inputs to
the risk monitoring step. For example, risk assessment threshold conditions (e.g., likelihood of threats exploiting
vulnerabilities) could be input to the risk monitoring step. In turn, organizations could monitor to determine if such
threshold conditions are met. If threshold conditions are met, such information could be used in the risk assessment
step, where it could serve as the basis for an incremental, differential risk assessment or an overall reassessment of risk
to the organization.

Activities
RISK MONITORING STRATEGY
TASK 4-1: Develop a risk monitoring strategy for the organization that includes the purpose, type, and
frequency of monitoring activities.

   Compliance verification ensures that organizations have implemented required risk response measures and that
information security requirements derived from and traceable to organizational missions/business functions, federal
legislation, directives, regulations, policies, and standards/guidelines are satisfied.
