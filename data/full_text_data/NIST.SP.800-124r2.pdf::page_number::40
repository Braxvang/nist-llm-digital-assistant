4.3.8. Mobile Application Vetting
MAV tools can be employed to identify vulnerabilities and malicious code in mobile
applications. Some mobile platforms have built-in MAV capabilities. This commits the
ecosystem of mobile OS vendors to providing a layered security model. MAV tools can also
integrate with many EMM and MTD systems. When an issue is discovered, an administrator can
be properly informed and automatically deploy various EMM-provided remediation actions
available via the EMM. These include notifying administrators, affected users, and departments;
automatically removing affected apps; and disallowing access to enterprise resources. To achieve
this automated operation, the EMM is integrated with MAV tools via APIs that coordinate the
submission of mobile apps – one-off or in bulk – to the MAV service via the EMM dashboard.
These APIs are often implemented using web services. For MAV services, EMM integration can
enable a flexible conduit through which results from multiple MAV vendors can be received and
aggregated at the EMM dashboard or portal without requiring all app vetting reports to conform
to a single format.
Threats Addressed: Installation of malicious developer MDM profiles, mobile malware, user
privacy violations, exploitation of underlying vulnerabilities in devices

4.3.9. Mobile Threat Defense
MTD, also known as, Mobile Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), can be built into the OS
or operate as a stand-alone and isolated system that detects malicious applications and other
threats. The capabilities built into the OS may not be manageable by the device user or an
organization. MTD systems can detect network-based attacks (e.g., MitM that could intercept
and redirect or eavesdrop on communications), app-based attacks (e.g., information leakage or
malicious, sideloaded apps), platform-based attacks (e.g., rootkits that undermine basic OS
functions), phishing attacks (e.g., to steal credentials), and others. When coupled with an
integrated EMM, these systems offer multiple remediation approaches after an attack attempt,
detected data breach, or compromised device. Remediations for network-based attacks include
disconnecting the device from the enterprise network, reestablishing a trustworthy connection, or
blocking attempts to connect to blocklisted networks. Whenever possible, threat remediation
should be accomplished on-device to rapidly mitigate the threat and eliminate dependence on
network/cloud connectivity to access remediation policy actions.
For app-based attacks, an integrated EMM and MTD system can remove malicious apps or
modify app permissions to limit access to sensitive enterprise resources. In cases where an
integrated EMM and MTD system detects a potential attack against the mobile platform, it might
notify the user to apply an OS patch or – in the extreme – remotely wipe (i.e., factory reset) the
device. Integrated EMM and MTD systems are typically configured to alert the system
administrator and potentially the mobile device user to the detected problem and the remediation
approach initiated.
Threats Addressed: Credential theft via phishing, installation of unauthorized certificates, mobile
malware, exploitation of underlying vulnerabilities in devices, installation of malicious developer
and EMM profiles, wireless eavesdropping, use of untrusted mobile devices
