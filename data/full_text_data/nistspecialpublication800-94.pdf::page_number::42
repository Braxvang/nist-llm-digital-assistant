GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



 Identifying Hosts. An IDPS sensor might be able to create a list of hosts on the organization’s
  network arranged by IP address or MAC address. The list can be used as a profile to identify new
  hosts on the network.
 Identifying Operating Systems. An IDPS sensor might be able to identify the OSs and OS versions
  used by the organization’s hosts through various techniques. For example, the sensor could track
  which ports are used on each host, which could indicate a particular OS or OS family (e.g., Windows,
  Unix). Another technique is to analyze packet headers for certain unusual characteristics or
  combinations of characteristics that are exhibited by particular OSs; this is known as passive
  fingerprinting. Some sensors can also identify application versions (as described below), which in
  some cases implies which OS is in use. Knowing which OS versions are in use can be helpful in
  identifying potentially vulnerable hosts.
 Identifying Applications. For some applications, an IDPS sensor can identify the application
  versions in use by keeping track of which ports are used and monitoring certain characteristics of
  application communications. For example, when a client establishes a connection with a server, the
  server might tell the client what application server software version it is running, and vice versa.
  Information on application versions can be used to identify potentially vulnerable applications, as
  well as unauthorized use of some applications.
 Identifying Network Characteristics. Some IDPS sensors collect general information about
  network traffic related to the configuration of network devices and hosts, such as the number of hops
  between two devices. This information can be used to detect changes to the network configuration.
4.3.2     Logging Capabilities

Network-based IDPSs typically perform extensive logging of data related to detected events. This data
can be used to confirm the validity of alerts, to investigate incidents, and to correlate events between the
IDPS and other logging sources. Data fields commonly logged by network-based IDPSs include the
following:

 Timestamp (usually date and time)
 Connection or session ID (typically a consecutive or unique number assigned to each TCP connection
  or to like groups of packets for connectionless protocols)
 Event or alert type 21
 Rating (e.g., priority, severity, impact, confidence)
 Network, transport, and application layer protocols
 Source and destination IP addresses
 Source and destination TCP or UDP ports, or ICMP types and codes
 Number of bytes transmitted over the connection
 Decoded payload data, such as application requests and responses
 State-related information (e.g., authenticated username)


21
     In the console, the event or alert type often links to supporting information for the specific vulnerability or exploit, such as
     references for additional information and associated Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) numbers.
