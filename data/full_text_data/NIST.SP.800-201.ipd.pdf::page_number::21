      NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                      Cloud Computing Forensic
      February 2023                                                                      Reference Architecture

610   considered technical. This grouping provides a simple and straightforward method for analyzing
611   the high-level characteristics of each challenge.
612   Similarly, the NCC FSWG placed each of the cloud functional capabilities into one of two
613   groups: 1) primarily technical or 2) primarily non-technical in nature. If a capability deals
614   primarily with standards, legal issues, contracts, service-level agreements, jurisdiction issues,
615   privacy, ethical issues, training, qualification, or certification, then the capability is considered
616   non-technical. Otherwise, it is considered technical. This led to the creation of questions Q3-a
617   and Q3-b.
618   The flowchart attempts to map challenges that are primarily technical only to capabilities that are
619   primarily technical and challenges that are primarily non-technical only to capabilities that are
620   primarily non-technical. This results in a precise and limited mapping. If a challenge and a
621   capability pair are assigned to the same group, the questioned is asked whether overcoming the
622   challenge makes it easier to conduct forensics on the capability. The answer determines whether
623   the capability is affected by the challenge. In summary, if the appropriate grouping is done and
624   overcoming the challenge makes it easier to conduct forensics, then the challenge is considered
625   to affect the capability (i.e., the mapping is YES; otherwise, the mapping is NO).
626   There can, of course, be challenges in one group that affect capabilities in another group, but that
627   does not provide the precise, limited mapping. In such cases, the mapping is considered to be
628   NO.
629   The following is an example of what is meant by a precise, limited mapping. Suppose the
630   challenge deals with training (e.g., Challenge FC-65: There is a lack of training materials that
631   educate investigators on cloud computing technology and cloud forensic operating policies and
632   procedures; see [1], page 52). This is a non-technical challenge. In addition, suppose the
633   capability under consideration is technical. Enhanced training would clearly provide significant
634   benefit to forensic investigators and cloud providers because training is so broadly applicable
635   and would help to perform forensics more easily on most capabilities. However, a cloud forensic
636   architecture in which training affects almost every capability is undesirable because then the
637   architecture applies too broadly; most of the capabilities are not affected by this challenge in an
638   important way. This makes the architecture less useful because the architecture will have many
639   challenges that affect too many capabilities. Rather than this broad mapping of challenges to
640   capabilities, a narrower mapping is preferred. Narrowing the number of capabilities affected by
641   the challenge allows the mapping to be more powerful because the challenge can be used as an
642   effective tool of identifying the capabilities that are more likely to be affected by the challenge in
643   an important way. The architecture with a narrower mapping is also more practical because the
644   fewer YESs in the mappings, the easier for an investigator to apply the mappings in real-world
645   scenarios.
646   As described above and shown in Figure 2, if both the challenge and the capability being
647   evaluated deal with the same type of issue (i.e., technical or non-technical), then the following
648   question is asked: “If the challenge were overcome, would that make it easier to conduct a cloud
649   forensic investigation on the functional capability?” If the answer is “yes,” then the mapping is
650   YES.
651   However, if the challenge is primarily technical in nature and the capability is non-technical in
652   nature (or vice versa), then an analysis is conducted to determine whether the use of technical or
653   non-technical solutions to implement the capability would significantly enhance the ability of a
