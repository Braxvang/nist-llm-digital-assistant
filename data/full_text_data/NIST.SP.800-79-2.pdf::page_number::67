Sample Authorization Decision Letter (Authorization to Operate)

Subject: Authorization Decision for [PCI / DPCI]


After reviewing the results of the authorization package of the [PCI / DPCI], I have determined
that its policies, procedures, and processes are in compliance both with [FIPS 201-2] and our
organization’s own policies, regulations and standards. Accordingly, I am issuing an
authorization to operate (ATO). [PIV Card and/or Derived PIV Credential] issuance services are
authorized without any restrictions or limitations. This authorization is my formal declaration
that the requirements of [HSPD-12] are being satisfied.

This ATO also applies to issuing facilities under this [PCI / DPCI]. Included is a list of facilities
authorized to operate under this authorization decision.

This authorization and ATO will remain in effect for 3 years from the date of this letter if— (i)
all required documentation is updated annually; (ii) a lifecycle walkthrough is completed
annually and the results sent to me within thirty (30) days of completion; and (iii) no deficiencies
are identified during the walkthrough that would increase the risk to the organization’s mission.

A copy of this letter and all supporting authorization documentation shall be retained in
accordance with the organization’s record retention schedule.
