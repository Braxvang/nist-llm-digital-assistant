                                                                                                  NIST Special Publication 800-35



     Analyze the extent of integration of an organization’s IT Security Program with its Critical
      Infrastructure Protection or CIP responsibilities.
5.1.2      IT Security Policy

In the context of this guide, IT security policy is defined as the “documentation of IT security decisions.”
IT Security Policy is fully discussed in NIST SP 800-12, An Introduction to Computer Security: The
NIST Handbook. NIST SP 800-12 categorizes IT Security Policy into three basic types:

     Program Policy—high-level policy used to create an organization's IT security program, define its’
      scope within the organization, assign implementation responsibilities, establish strategic direction,
      and assign resources for implementation.
     Issue-Specific Policies—address specific issues of concern to the organization, such as contingency
      planning, the use of a particular methodology for systems risk management, and implementation of
      new regulations or law. These policies are likely to require more frequent revision as changes in
      technology and related factors take place.
     System-Specific Policies—address individual systems, such as establishing an access control list or
      in training users as to what system actions are permitted. These policies may vary from system to
      system within the same organization. In addition, policy may refer to entirely different matters, such
      as the specific managerial decisions setting an organization's electronic mail (e-mail) policy or fax
      security policy.
IT Security Policy Services

Service providers can assist organizations in analyzing existing and developing new security policies,
standards, guidelines, and procedures. The authority for approving policy is inherently a core function of
an organization and therefore final approval of policies should be performed by the organization. Given
this constraint, organizations should limit service providers, either internal or external, to assistance and
support. A comprehensive IT security policy service can consist of many elements that will depend on the
specific needs of the organization and the relative maturity of its IT security program.

IT security policy elements may include the following:

     High-level analysis of an organization’s operational environment
     Emerging Technologies
     Governance processes 5
     Procedures
     Determination of compliance to applicable guidance and regulations
     Gap analysis for the organization or program that assesses the differences between the current policy
      and the desired future policy
     Development of a unified set of security program policies and detailed issue- and system-specific
      policies

       Governance is about how strategy and policy decisions are made, distributed, and enforced. Governance represents the top-
       level of management; it defines the operating envelope for the agency or program, which is carried out by the various
       managers of the IT security program. Governance is composed of people (i.e., roles), organizational structures, processes,
       and decision support tools, many of which should be defined in policy (not necessarily the IT Security Policy).
