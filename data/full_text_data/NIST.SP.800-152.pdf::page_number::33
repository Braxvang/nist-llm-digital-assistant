automatically support and enforce parts of the policy. Automated security policy support
systems could be programmed to detect security problems and resolve them in accordance
with the policy.

A Security policy can be described in a formal language that can be used to explicitly define
the syntax (i.e., acceptable sentences) of a policy such that a computer program can
recognize and follow the rules of the policy. These rules could be called the semantics (i.e.,
acceptable meaning) of each sentence of the language. If a security policy is encoded
correctly, a Federal CKMS could support and enforce it.

                           A Federal CKMS could support its administrators in
PF:4.1
                           assessing a security policy for completeness and
                           enforceability.

4.4   FCKMS Module Security Policy

As shown in Figure 1 of Section 2.10, an FCKMS consists of one or more computers
containing an FCKMS module, with an associated cryptographic module. The computer
could, in fact, have more than one FCKMS module and more than one cryptographic module.
Each FCKMS module is designed to support one or more FCKMSs, along with their FCKMS
Security Policies.

Each FCKMS module must have its own FCKMS Module Security Policy, which supports
one or more FCKMS Security Policies. However, the security policy for an FCKMS module
may not be a full FCKMS Security Policy. The FCKMS Module Security Policy need only
deal with the subset of the FCKMS Security Policy that applies to the module itself.

Figure 3 depicts an example of a network consisting of three Federal Entities and three
FCKMSs, each with its own FCKMS Security Policy as indicated by the colors red, blue, and
green. The arrowed lines between FCKMS modules indicate communications links over
which cryptographic keys and metadata may be established according to the policy indicated
by the color of the line. Thus, Federal Entity 1 can establish keys with Federal Entity 2 using
the blue FCKMS with the blue FCKMS Security Policy. Federal Entity 1 can also establish
keys with Federal Entity 3 using the red FCKMS with the red FCKMS Security Policy.
Finally, Federal Entity 1 could store keys that it uses only for its own purposes using the
green FCKMS with the green FCKMS Security Policy.
