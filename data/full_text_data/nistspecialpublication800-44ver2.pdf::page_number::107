                                                                 GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



9.2.3   Maintain an Authoritative Copy of Organizational Web Content

All organizations should maintain an authoritative (i.e., verified and trusted) copy of their public Web
sites on a host that is inaccessible to the Internet. This is a supplement to, but not replacement for, an
appropriate backup policy (see Section 9.2.1). For simple, relatively static Web sites, this could be as
simple as a copy of the Web site on a read-only medium (e.g., Compact Disc-Recordable [CD-R]).
However, for most organizations, the authoritative copy of the Web site is maintained on a secure host.
This host is usually located behind the organization’s firewall on the internal network and not on the
DMZ (see Section 8.1.2). The purpose of the authoritative copy is to provide a means of restoring
information on the public Web server if it is compromised as a result of an accident or malicious action.
This authoritative copy of the Web site allows an organization to rapidly recover from Web site integrity
breaches (e.g., defacement).

To successfully accomplish the goal of providing and protecting an authoritative copy of the Web server
content, the following requirements must be met:

 Protect authoritative copy from unauthorized access.

     Use write-once media (appropriate for relatively static Web sites).

     Locate the host with the authoritative copy behind a firewall, and ensure there is no outside
        access to the host.

     Minimize users with authorized access to host.

     Control user access in as granular a manner as possible.

     Employ strong user authentication.

     Employ appropriate logging and monitoring procedures.

     Consider additional authoritative copies at different physical locations for further protection.

 Establish appropriate authoritative copy update procedures.

     Update authoritative copy first (any testing on code should occur before updating the
        authoritative copy).

     Establish policies and procedures for who can authorize updates, who can perform updates, when
        updates can occur, etc.

 Establish a process for copying authoritative copy to a production Web server.

     Physically transfer data using secure physical media (e.g., encrypted and/or write-once media,
        such as CD-Rs).

     Use a secure protocol (e.g., SSH) for network transfers.

 Include the procedures for restoring from the authoritative copy in the organizational incident
  response procedures (see Section 9.3).
