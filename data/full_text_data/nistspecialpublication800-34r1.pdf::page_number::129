arrangements should be made for them to work at an alternate site or at home if the facility is unsafe or
unavailable for use. This is an alternate space in addition to the alternate site for information system
recovery. Personnel with home computers or laptops should be given instruction, if appropriate, on how
to access the organization’s network from home. It may also be necessary to assist personnel with
procuring temporary housing. Planning for long-term relocations, such as those that took place in
response to Hurricane Katrina, should consider locating the alternate site near areas with available
housing in safe neighborhoods with schools and other family necessities.

Disasters may take a heavy psychological toll on personnel, especially if there has been loss of life or
extensive physical destruction. Organizations should be prepared to provide grief counseling and other
mental health support. The Employee Assistance Program (EAP), which is available to all federal
organizations, is a useful and confidential resource for these issues. Nonprofit organizations, such as the
American Red Cross, also provide referrals for counseling services as well as food, clothing, and other
assistance programs. Personnel will be most interested in the status of the health benefits and resumption
of payroll. It is very important that the organization communicate this status. Every effort should be
made to continue to pay personnel as per normal operations. Due to grief and stress, productivity may
also be low during the adjustment period.

Family Emergency Plan is available through this site at

Relationships with Response Organizations
A relationship should be built with local fire and police departments in order to achieve a thorough
understanding of the first response procedures and to achieve a trust relationship so that the organization
is not first meeting local fire and police departments in a disaster. Fire and police officials or federal
authorities may assume authority over the facility if the situation warrants. The organization should be
aware of why this may happen and what points of contact (POCs) and documentation will be needed to
regain access to their facility. Fire, police, and rescue organizations are often willing to work with the
organization to develop safe and coordinated procedures and participate in the organization’s exercises.
Based on the organization’s requirements, joint planning and exercises with federal or military
respondents may also be necessary.

Local response organizations should be contacted directly or through state emergency management.


Communication Planning
The crisis communication plan typically addresses internal communication flows to personnel and
management and external communication with the public. The most effective way to provide helpful
information and to reduce rumors is to communicate clearly and often. The plan should also prepare the
organization for the possibility that during a significant disaster, the organization may be a
communication-forwarding point between personnel, civil and federal authorities, and affected families
and friends.

One of the most important activities is internal communication within the organization. Staff and
management need to know what has occurred, the status of the situation, what actions they should take,
