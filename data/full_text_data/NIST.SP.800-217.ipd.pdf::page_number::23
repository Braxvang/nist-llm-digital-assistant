      NIST SP 800-217 ipd                        Guidelines for PIV Federation (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


580   based on the trust agreement provided by the authority. The federation authority SHALL
581   declare which IdP is the PIV IdP for any given population of PIV identity accounts within
582   the trust agreement. The federation authority SHALL establish and declare whether each
583   PIV IdP is the home IdP for any given PIV identity account within the trust agreement.
584   The federation authority SHALL vet all PIV IdPs and RPs within the federation to ensure
585   that all parties are acting within the terms of the agreements.
586   The federation authority SHALL disclose to all connected RPs whether a particular IdP
587   is the home IdP for an agency in question. Federation authorities SHALL make all home
588   IdP records (defined in Sec. 3.5) available to participants within the federation using a
589   machine-readable format appropriate for the federation protocol standards in use.
590   The federation authority SHALL make lists of all member IdPs and RPs available to other
591   members within the scope of the federation agreement. IdPs within a federation authority
592    SHOULD enable dynamic registration of new RPs, as discussed in [SP800-63C], subject
593   to the rules of the federation authority, the desired federation assurance level, and the
594   capabilities of the federation protocol in use.
595   The federation authority SHALL document the full set of attributes to be provided by
596   each IdP and allowed to be requested by RPs within the federation. The federation
597   authority SHALL collect the attributes requested by RPs joining the federation and
598    SHALL document the RP’s justification and use for these attributes.


599   3.3. Identity Proxies and Brokers
600   An identity proxy (also known as an identity broker) takes in federated authentications
601   from one domain and asserts them outbound to another domain. Identity proxies are
602   discussed in [SP800-63C], and all requirements for proxies enumerated therein apply to
603   identity proxies in a PIV federation.
604   In many cases, it is natural for a proxy to act as a federation authority for all connected
605   parties due to the proxy’s nature as a common connection point between IdPs and RPs.
606   However, bilateral agreements are still possible and allowable through a proxy, with each
607   IdP and RP making a pairwise agreement to the proxy itself.
608   For each federated transaction with an RP, the proxy SHALL determine the appropriate
609   upstream PIV IdP that is appropriate for each PIV identity account it proxies to a
610   downstream RP.
