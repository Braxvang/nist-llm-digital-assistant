     NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                                             Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
     November 2023


 1       Introduction
 2   Executive Order (EO) 13556 [1] established a governmentwide program to standardize the way
 3   the executive branch handles Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). 1 EO 13556 required
 4   that the CUI program emphasize openness, transparency, and uniformity of governmentwide
 5   practices and that the program implementation take place in a manner consistent with Office of
 6   Management and Budget (OMB) policies and National Institute of Standards and Technology
 7   (NIST) standards and guidelines. As the CUI program Executive Agent, the National Archives
 8   and Records Administration (NARA) provides information, guidance, policy, and requirements
 9   on handling CUI [4]. This includes approved CUI categories and descriptions, the basis for
10   safeguarding and dissemination controls, and procedures for the use of CUI. 2 The CUI federal
11   regulation [5] provides guidance to federal agencies on the designation, safeguarding, marking,
12   dissemination, decontrolling, and disposition of CUI; establishes self-inspection and oversight
13   requirements; and delineates other facets of the program.

14   The CUI regulation requires federal agencies that use federal information systems 3 to process,
15   store, or transmit CUI to comply with NIST standards and guidelines. The responsibility of
16   federal agencies to protect CUI does not change when such information is shared with nonfederal
17   organizations. 4 Therefore, a similar level of protection is needed when CUI is processed, stored,
18   or transmitted by nonfederal organizations using nonfederal systems. 5 To maintain a consistent
19   level of protection, the security requirements for safeguarding CUI in nonfederal systems and
20   organizations must comply with FIPS 199 [6] and FIPS 200 [7]. The requirements are derived
21   from the controls in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 [8].

22          Purpose and Applicability
23   The purpose of this publication is to provide federal agencies with recommended security
24   requirements 6 for protecting the confidentiality of CUI 7 when such information is resident in
25   nonfederal systems and organizations and where there are no specific safeguarding requirements
26   prescribed by the authorizing law, regulation, or governmentwide policy for the CUI category
27   listed in the CUI registry [4]. The requirements do not apply to nonfederal organizations that are
28   collecting or maintaining information on behalf of a federal agency or using or operating a
29   system on behalf of an agency. 8

     1
       CUI is any information that a law, regulation, or governmentwide policy requires to have safeguarding or disseminating controls, excluding
     information that is classified under EO 13526 [2], or any predecessor or successor order, or the Atomic Energy Act [3] as amended.
     2
       Procedures for the use of CUI include marking, safeguarding, transporting, disseminating, reusing, and disposing of the information.
     3
       A federal information system is a system that is used or operated by an executive agency, by a contractor of an executive agency, or by another
     organization on behalf of an executive agency. The term system is used in this publication to represent people, processes, and technologies
     involved in the processing, storage, or transmission of CUI. Systems can include operational technology (OT), information technology (IT),
     Internet of Things (IoT) devices, Industrial IoT (IIoT) devices, specialized systems, cyber-physical systems, embedded systems, and sensors.
     4
       A nonfederal organization is any entity that owns, operates, or maintains a nonfederal system.
     5
       A nonfederal system is any system that does not meet the criteria for a federal information system.
     6
       The term security requirement refers to the protection needs for a system or organization. Security requirements may be derived from laws,
     Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, mission and business needs, or risk assessments.
     7
       In accordance with EO 13526 [2] and 32 CFR 2002 [5], the scope of CUI protection is primarily focused on confidentiality. However, the
     security objectives of confidentiality and integrity are closely related since many of the underlying security mechanisms support both objectives.
     Therefore, the security requirements in this publication address the protection of CUI from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
     8
       Nonfederal organizations that collect or maintain information on behalf of a federal agency or that use or operate a system on behalf of an
     agency must comply with the requirements in FISMA [9].
