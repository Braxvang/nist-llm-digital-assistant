    The need to identify and implement appropriate federal government and agency-
specific information security governance practices can be daunting. Agencies should
identify applicable requirements based on relevant legislation, regulations, federal
directives, and agency-level directives. Agencies should also ensure that information
security governance structures are implemented in a manner that best supports their
unique missions and operations.

2.2 Information Security Governance Components
    Agencies should integrate their information security governance activities with
the overall agency structure and activities by ensuring appropriate participation of
agency officials in overseeing implementation of information security controls
throughout the agency. The key activities that facilitate such integration are
strategic planning, organizational design and development, establishment of roles
and responsibilities, integration with the enterprise architecture, and documentation
of security objectives in policies and guidance. Figure 2-2 illustrates the relative
relationship of these various components.
