         CSD Role in the NIST Cloud
            Computing Program
    During FY 2013, the NIST Cloud
 Computing Team continued to promote the
 development of publications, national and
 international standards, and specifications
 in support of the USG’s effective and secure
 use of cloud computing as well as providing
 technical guidance to USG agencies for
 secure and effective cloud computing
 adoption.. CSD supports many of the
 technical standards activities supported
 by the NIST Cloud Computing Program,
 with a particular focus on cloud computing
 security.
