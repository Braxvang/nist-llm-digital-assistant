8.3.2 GET DATA Command

8.3.2.1 Get Data for the Various Derived PIV Data Objects

 Test Assertion       TA-08.03.02.01
 Purpose              Verifies that the Derived PIV Application accepts the GET DATA
                      command with the access rule of each container as specified in Table 2
                      of [SP800-73], Part 1 as mapped to [SP800-157]. This test is applicable
                      to the mandatory and the optional data objects specified in [SP800-157].

 Vendor               The vendor to provide information in its documentation stating all the
 Documentation        optional data objects supported.
 Precondition(s)      •   A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                          appropriate token reader.
                      •   Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and an
                          instance of the reader.
                      •   The mandatory and optional data objects supported by the Derived
                          PIV Application are loaded.
 Test Scenario        1. Send the SELECT command with
                            • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                      2. Send the GET DATA command with
                            • Data field of the command containing the tag
                               ('5FC105') of the X.509 Certificate for Derived
                               PIV Authentication data object
                      3. If the X.509 Certificate for Digital Signature is
                         supported, send the GET DATA command with
                            • Data field of the command containing the tag
                               ('5FC10A') of the X.509 Certificate for Digital
                               Signature data object
                      4. If the X.509 Certificate for Key Management is
                         supported, send the GET DATA command with
                            • Data field of the command containing the tag
                               ('5FC10B') of the X.509 Certificate for Key
                               Management data object
                      5. If the Key History Object and the Retired X.509
                         Certificates for Key Management are supported, send the
                         GET DATA command with
                            A. Data field of the command containing the tag
                            ('5FC10C') of the Key History Object
                            B. Data field of the command containing the tag
                            ('5FC10D' to '5FC120') of a Retired X.509
                            Certificate for Key Management (send a separate
                            command for each supported Retired X.509 Certificate
                            for Key Management)
