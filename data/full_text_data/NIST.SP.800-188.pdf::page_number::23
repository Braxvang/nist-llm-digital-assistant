2.     Introducing De-Identifcation

If the information derived from personal data remains in a de-identifed dataset, the dataset
may inadvertently reveal attributes related to specifc individuals. When this happens, the
privacy protection provided by de-identifcation is compromised. Even if a specifc individ-
ual cannot be matched to a specifc data record, de-identifed data can be used to improve
the accuracy of inferences regarding individuals whose de-identifed data are in the dataset.
This so-called inference risk cannot be eliminated if there is any information in the de-
identifed data, but it can be managed or reduced to an acceptable level. Thus, the decision
of how or whether to de-identify data should be made in conjunction with decisions over
how the de-identifed data will be used, shared, or released.
De-identifcation is especially important for government agencies, businesses, and other or-
ganizations that seek to make data available to outsiders. For example, signifcant medical
research is made possible through the sharing of de-identifed patient information under the
framework established by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which is the primary U.S. regulation
that provides for the privacy of medical, billing, enrollment, payment, and claims records,
as well as “other records that are used, in whole or in part, by or for the covered entity
to make decisions about individuals” [119]. The HIPAA Privacy Rule de-identifcation
framework applies to both government organizations charged with protecting government
datasets and to private-sector organizations, such as health plans and health care providers.
Agencies may also be required to de-identify records when responding to a Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA) [164, 163] request in a manner that is consistent with Exemption
6, which protects information about individuals in “personnel and medical fles and similar
fles” when the disclosure of such information “would constitute a clearly unwarranted in-
vasion of personal privacy,” and Exemption 7(C), which is limited to information compiled
for law enforcement purposes and protects personal information when disclosure “could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” The
meaning of these exemptions has been clarifed by multiple cases before the U.S. Supreme
Court [134, 145, 146]. However, agencies should consider the cumulative privacy impact
of multiple FOIA requests and potential releases, as previous releases may be combined
with future releases to learn information about individuals that the agency had previously
attempted to protect from public release.

2.1.     Historical Context
The modern practice of de-identifcation can be broken down into three distinct phases:
