3.6   Organizational Conflict of Interest

An organizational conflict of interest (OCI) may exist when a party to an agreement has a past, present or
future interest related to the work performed (or to be performed), which may diminish its capacity to
provide impartial, technically sound, objective service or results in an unfair competitive advantage. Of
course, it is best to avoid organizational conflicts before they arise. The Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR) (subpart 9.5) describes two underlying principles why avoiding an OCI is important:

 Preventing the existence of conflicting roles that might bias a [service provider’s] judgment
 Preventing unfair competitive advantage
According to the FAR, an unfair competitive advantage exists where a [service provider] possesses
proprietary information that was obtained from a Government official without proper authorization or
source selection information that is relevant to the contract but is not available to all competitors, and
such information would assist that [service provider] in obtaining the contract.

Although the FAR applies to Federal contracts, any organization should be aware that an OCI could occur
in any phase of the IT security services lifecycle and may provide an unfair competitive advantage.

 There are several methods that an organization can take to avoid, neutralize, or minimize the effect of
  an OCI. They can include: modify or eliminate the offending parts of the agreement, statement of
  work, contract, etc.
 Prohibit bidding on a subsequent procurement in which the service provider plays a key role in
  development of the requirement
 Prohibit using proprietary or privileged information which the service provider has access to
 Segment the work within the service provider to prevent involvement in performance of the work or
  being in a position to influence the work
 Require the service provider to avoid conduct that may result in an OCI-such as when called on to
  inspect its own work. The service provider must disclose its relationship and disqualify itself from
  performing the work
 Make privileged documents available to all parties. (neutralizing the OCI)
If an organization determines that the OCI exists but cannot be avoided and the organization wishes to
proceed, the head of the organization may determine to proceed and waive the OCI.

Identifying the existence of OCIs, mitigating effect of the OCI to an acceptable level, and/or waiving the
OCI is important when managing the IT security service life cycle but it can involve complex legal and
regulatory issues and should not be considered without the close counsel of an organization’s legal
department.
