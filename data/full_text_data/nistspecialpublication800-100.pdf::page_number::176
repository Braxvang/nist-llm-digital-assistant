Q. What are federal civilian agencies accountable for in terms of reporting
   security incidents?
A. According to OMB Memorandum 05-15, FY 2005 Reporting Instructions for the
   Federal Information Security and Management Act Report and Privacy
   Management Report (June 13, 2005), agencies must identify and report the total
   number of successful incidents in the following categories: unauthorized access,
   denial of service attacks, malicious code, improper usage, or other, consistent
   with NIST Special Publication 800-61, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide
   (January 2004). Successful incidents must be recorded and reported internally,
   to US-CERT, and depending on their severity, to law enforcement. As stated in
   the US-CERT Concept of Operations, each incident category has a specific
   timeframe of when it needs to be reported to US-CERT. These time frames are
   as follows:
   • Unauthorized Access: Within one (1) hour of discovery and/or detection;
   • Denial of Service: Within two (2) hours of discovery and/or detection;
   • Malicious Code: Daily or within one (1) hour if discovery and/or detection is
     widespread; and
   • Improper Usage: On a weekly basis.
   In addition, agencies must report Scans/Probes/Attempted Access on a monthly
   basis or within one (1) hour of discover if it is a classified system.
   In addition, a system-specific incident response plan is considered an integral
   part of a complete system certification and accreditation package.

Q. Is it possible to prepare for incident response?
A. Yes. To prepare for incident response, the organization should do the following:
   • Create an organization-specific definition of the term “incident” so that the
     scope of the term is clear;
   • Create an incident response policy;
   • Develop incident response and reporting procedures;
   • Set guidelines for communicating with external parties;
   • Determine incident response team services;
   • Select a team structure and staffing model; and
   • Staff and train the incident response team.

Q. What should be included in the incident response policy?
A. An incident response policy should define which events are considered incidents,
   establish the organizational structure for incident response, define roles and
   responsibilities, and list the requirements for reporting incidents.

Q. What elements should be considered when selecting a team structure
   and staffing model?
A. The organization should select the appropriate team structure and staffing
   models based on several factors, including the size of the organization, the
   geographic diversity of major computing resources, the need for 24/7 availability,
   cost, and staff expertise.
