                        4. AS05.01.06
Precondition(s)         1. A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                        2. A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and
                             the contact reader.
                        3. The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                        4. A valid Card Holder Facial Image object is present on the PIV card.
                        5. Security conditions to read the object are met.
Test Scenario           1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                        2. Set OID := <<Card Holder Facial Image
                           (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.96.48)>>
                        3. Call pivGetData w/
                           • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                        4. Extract the value field for tag 0xBC, extract the first
                           88 bytes (CBEFF Header) and read the BDB Format Owner
                           field (based on its position) in CBEFF Header.
Expected Result(s) The BDB Format Owner field has a value of 0x001B.

9.2.2.4   BDB Format Type
Purpose                 Validates that for optional facial image data stored on a PIV card, the BDB
                        Format Type is set to a value of 0x0501.
