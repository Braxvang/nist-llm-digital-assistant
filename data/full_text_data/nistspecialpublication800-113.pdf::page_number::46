                              Figure 4-1. Firewall with SSL VPN Functionality

This approach has some advantages and disadvantages when compared to the other options:

Advantages:

 Holes do not need to be opened in the firewall between an external SSL VPN device and the internal
  network.
 Traffic between the device and the internal network must go through the firewall, so the traffic is still
  subject to the firewall’s policies.
 Network design and system administration are simpler because there are no additional devices to
  administer.
Disadvantages:

 The organization is limited to the VPN functionality offered by its firewall vendor. It does not have
  the option of using a VPN appliance because appliances are separate hardware devices.
 The firewall is directly accessible by external users on TCP port 443. This increases the likelihood of
  a vulnerability on the firewall that can be exploited via these ports.
 The firewall must be augmented by SSL VPN functionality. This additional code could introduce
  potential vulnerabilities to the firewall.
Placing the VPN device in the internal network. This option places the VPN device entirely within the
internal network behind the firewall. TCP port 443 for the address of the SSL VPN must be opened in the
firewall to access the device. Figure 4-2 illustrates this design. Although it is not shown in the diagram,
placement of an additional firewall between the SSL VPN device and the rest of the internal network is
highly recommended. That ensures both front-end and back-end protection for the SSL VPN device.
