GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



An alternative to using SIEM software for centralized logging is to use a solution based primarily on the
syslog protocol. 48 Syslog provides a simple framework for log generation, storage, and transfer that any
IDPS could use if designed to do so. Some IDPSs offer features that allow their log formats to be
converted to syslog format. Syslog is very flexible for log sources, because each syslog entry contains a
content field into which logging sources can place information in any format. However, this flexibility
makes analysis of the log data challenging. Each IDPS may use many different formats for its log
messages, so a robust analysis program would need to be familiar with each format and be able to extract
the meaning of the data within the fields of each format. It might not be feasible to understand the
meaning of all log messages, so analysis might be limited to keyword and pattern searches. Generally,
the use of syslog for centralized collection and analysis of IDPS logs does not provide sufficiently strong
analysis capabilities to support incident identification and handling.

8.3      Other Technologies with IDPS Capabilities

In addition to dedicated IDPS technologies, organizations typically have several other types of
technologies that offer some IDPS capabilities and complement the primary IDPSs. This section
discusses common types of complementary technologies: network forensic analysis tools, anti-malware
technologies (antivirus software and antispyware software), firewalls and routers, and honeypots. 49 For
each, a brief overview of the technology is provided, and its use in intrusion detection and prevention and
its relationship to IDPSs are explained. Recommendations are also made as applicable for how the
complementary technologies should be used alongside of IDPSs.

8.3.1      Network Forensic Analysis Tool (NFAT) Software

Network forensic analysis tools (NFAT) focus primarily on collecting and analyzing wired network
traffic. Unlike a network-based IDPS, which performs in-depth analysis and stores only the necessary
network traffic, an NFAT typically stores most or all of the traffic that it sees, and then performs analysis
on that stored traffic. In addition to its forensic capabilities, NFAT software also offers features that
facilitate network traffic analysis, such as the following:

 Reconstructing events by replaying network traffic within the tool, ranging from an individual session
  (e.g., instant messaging [IM] between two users) to all sessions during a particular time period. The
  speed of the replaying can typically be adjusted as needed.
 Visualizing the traffic flows and the relationships among hosts. Some tools can even tie IP addresses,
  domain names, or other data to physical locations and produce a geographic map of the activity.
 Building profiles of typical activity and identifying significant deviations.
 Searching application content for keywords (e.g., “confidential”, “proprietary”).
This makes it more valuable for network forensics and less valuable for intrusion detection and
prevention than a typical network-based IDPS.

      Although syslog has been in use for many years, it has not been standardized formally. Request for Comments (RFC) 3164,
      The BSD Syslog Protocol, was published in August 2001, and it is an informational RFC that describes commonly used
      syslog message formats based on existing implementations. It is available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3164.txt. By default,
      syslog’s transport mechanism is trivially simple; RFC 3164 states that “…the payload of any IP packet destined to UDP port
      514 MUST be considered to be a valid syslog message”. RFC 3195, Reliable Delivery for Syslog, was published in
      November 2001, and it defines multiple transport mechanisms for syslog. It is available at
      http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3195.txt.
