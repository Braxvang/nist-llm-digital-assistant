                       providing a uniform means to manage access to OT devices while
                       reducing the cost of maintaining individual device access levels
                       and minimizing errors. These logical access controls can also
                       restrict OT user privileges to only those required to perform each
                       person’s job (i.e., configuring each role based on the principle of
                       least privilege). The level of access can take several forms,
                       including viewing, using, and altering specific OT data or device
                       functions.
                   •   Solutions that provide credential management, authentication,
                       authorization, and system use monitoring technical capabilities.
                       These technologies may help manage risks associated with OT
                       devices and protocols by providing a secure platform to allow
                       authorized personnel to access the OT devices.
                   •   Access control systems that verify the identity of the individual,
                       process, or device before granting access to minimize latency or
                       delays in processing OT system access or commands.
                   •   Highly reliable systems that do not interfere with the routine or
                       emergency duties of OT personnel. Solutions should be designed
                       to reduce the impact of determining identity and authorization on
                       OT operations and safety.
To support access controls, an organization is not limited to a single access control approach. In
some cases, applying different access control techniques to different zones based on criticality,
safety, and operational requirements is more efficient and effective. For example, ACLs on
network zone firewalls combined with RBAC on engineering workstations and servers and
ABAC integrated into physical security to sensitive areas may achieve the risk-based access
control requirements of an organization.

6.2.1.2.       Physical Access Controls (PR.AC-2)
Physical security controls are physical measures that limit physical access to assets to prevent
undesirable effects, including unauthorized physical access to sensitive locations; the
unauthorized introduction of new systems, infrastructure, communications interfaces, or
removable media; and unauthorized disruption of the physical process. Physical access controls
include controls for managing and monitoring physical access, maintaining logs, and handling
visitors.
The deployment of physical security controls is often subject to specific environmental, safety,
regulatory, legal, and other requirements that must be identified and addressed for a given
environment. Physical security controls may be broadly applied or specific to certain assets.
The initial layers of physical access control are often determined based on the risk of access to
the overall facility, not just OT components. Some regulations, such as NERC CIP-006-5
(Physical Security of BES Cyber Systems) or from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC),
may also determine the strength and quantity of barriers used for the physical protection of a
facility.
