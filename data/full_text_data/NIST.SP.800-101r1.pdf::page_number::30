                                                         Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

        only be attempted for high profile cases equivalent to a national security crisis after all
        other acquisition techniques have been exhausted. Successful acquisition at this level
        would require a team of experts, proper equipment, time and in-depth knowledge of
        proprietary information. There are no known U.S. Law Enforcement agencies
        performing acquisitions at this level. Currently, there are no commercially available
        Micro Read tools.

Table 3 provides a classification of some tools currently used in mobile device investigations,
and identifies the facilities they provide: acquisition, examination, or reporting. Additional
tools do exist, but only those familiar to the authors are discussed. For a more complete an up
to     date     list   of    forensic     tools    refer     to:   NIST      Tool   Taxonomy
(http://www.cftt.nist.gov/tool_catalog/populated_taxonomy/). The tools listed in Table 3 are
grouped by level starting with Level 1 (Manual Extraction) through Level 4 (Chip-Off).

The following describes each of the headings contained within Table 3:

       Tool – tool name

           † Denotes a tool that supports the logical acquisition of a UICC

           ‡ Denotes a tool that supports the logical acquisition of a UICC and the creation
            of a Cellular Network Isolation Card (CNIC)

       Acquisition Level – level(s) at which the tool performs data extractions: 1- Manual
        extraction, 2 - Logical extraction, 3 - Physical extraction, 4 - Chip-off, 5 - Micro Read

       Network Type – acquisition of devices operating over specified networks

       Forensic Tool – is the tool specifically designed for forensic acquisition

       Examination/Analysis – provides the examiner with the ability to perform
        examination or analysis of acquired data

       Reporting – provides the examiner with the ability to generate reports

       3rd Party Tool Image Analysis (3PIA) – supports importing of raw data produced
        from another manufacturer’s tool

       Chinese Chipset Support (CCS) – mobile devices containing Chinese chipsets are
        increasing as they continue to flood the international market. Some mobile forensic
        tools provide either a logical and/or physical extraction solution.

       Cables/Hardware Available (C/HW) – cables are provided
