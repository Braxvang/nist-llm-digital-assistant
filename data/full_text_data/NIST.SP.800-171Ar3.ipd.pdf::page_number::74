       NIST SP 800-171Ar3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                         Assessing CUI Security Requirements
       November 2023

2356             memoranda of understanding or agreement; service-level agreements; user agreements;
2357             non-disclosure agreements}.
2358             A.03.12.05.a: the exchange of CUI between the system and other systems is approved and
2359             managed using <A.03.12.05.ODP[01]: selected parameter value(s)>.
2360             A.03.12.05.b[01]: interface characteristics are documented as part of the exchange
2361             agreements.
2362             A.03.12.05.b[02]: security requirements are documented as part of the exchange agreements.
2363             A.03.12.05.b[03]: responsibilities for each system are documented as part of the exchange
2364             agreements.
2365             A.03.12.05.c[01]: exchange agreements are reviewed periodically.
2366             A.03.12.05.c[02]: exchange agreements are updated periodically.

2367             ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
2368             Examine
2369             [SELECT FROM: access control policy and procedures; procedures for system connections;

2381           System and Communications Protection

2382   3.13.1. Boundary Protection
2383             REQUIREMENT: 03.13.01

2384             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
2385             Determine if:
2386             A.03.13.01.a[01]: communications at external managed interfaces to the system are monitored.
2387             A.03.13.01.a[02]: communications at external managed interfaces to the system are controlled.
2388             A.03.13.01.a[03]: communications at key internal managed interfaces within the system are
2389             monitored.
2390             A.03.13.01.a[04]: communications at key internal managed interfaces within the system are
2391             controlled.
2392             A.03.13.01.b: subnetworks are implemented for publicly accessible system components that
2393             are physically or logically separated from internal networks.
