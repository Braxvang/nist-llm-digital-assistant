                                                        GUIDE TO SECURITY FOR FULL VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGIES



allow a privileged VM to have full visibility to the network traffic. Unfortunately, these APIs may also
provide additional ways for attackers to attempt to monitor network communications. Another concern
with network monitoring through a hypervisor is the potential for performance degradation or denial of
service conditions to occur for the hypervisor because of high volumes of traffic.

The security implications of networks internal to a hypervisor should not be minimized. For example,
assume that an organization has two computers, one that acts as a public-facing web server and another
that is an internal database server. The organization also monitors the switch that connects the two
computers, watching for traffic that would indicate an attack on the database. If both of those servers were
moved onto a single hypervisor, and the hypervisor’s virtual network was used for communications
between the servers for increased efficiency, the ability to monitor all the traffic between the two systems
would be lost unless the hypervisor itself can perform this monitoring that meets the organization’s
security policies.

To get around this loss of visibility, some organizations purposely expose network traffic between
virtualized hosts to the physical network already in place in the organization. This requires the system on
which the hypervisor is running to have multiple network interfaces, and this may significantly slow
network communications as compared to a virtual-only network, but the advantage is that the
organization does not need to change its security policies to gain the cost advantages of virtualization.
Organizations should consider the tradeoffs between traffic being hidden within a hypervisor and the
extra overhead and risk of exposing that traffic but being able to control it using the same tools already
used for controlling other network traffic. See Section 3.5 for additional information.

2.3.2   Virtualized Storage

Hypervisor systems have many ways of simulating disk storage for guest OSs. All hypervisors, at a
minimum, have virtual hard drives, while some of them also have more advanced virtual storage options.
In addition, some hypervisors can use advanced storage interfaces on the host system, such as network-
attached storage (NAS) and storage area networks (SAN) to present different storage options to the guest
OSs. This section describes those options.

All hypervisors in common use present the guest OSs with virtual hard drives though the use of disk
images. A disk image is a file on the host that looks to the guest OS like an entire disk drive. Whatever
the guest OS writes onto the virtual hard drive goes into the disk image. With hosted virtualization, the
disk image appears in the host OS as a file or a folder, and it can be handled like other files and folders.

Most virtualization systems also allow a guest OS to access physical hard drives as if they were connected
to the guest OS directly. This is different than using disk images in that a disk image is a virtual
representation of a real drive. Direct access is common for floppy and CD-ROM drives that are attached
to the host OS, so that a guest OS can, for example, install new software from a CD-ROM that is inserted
in the host computer. Some hypervisors also allow a guest OS to connect to an entire physical hard drive.
The main advantage of using physical hard drives is that accessing them is much faster than accessing
disk images.

Many computers can access NAS and SAN systems. Some hypervisors can present these systems to the
guest OSs as a NAS or SAN, while others can make those systems appear as virtual drives. This is an
active area of development in the virtualization market, and new types of storage virtualization are being
added to hypervisors frequently.

The security implications of using virtual storage are essentially the same as using real storage. Access to
the various types of storage that a guest OS has access to should be controlled as it would be if the storage
