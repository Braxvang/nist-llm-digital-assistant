 Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)

        –   Like PPTP, L2TP protects communications between an L2TP-enabled client and an L2TP-
            enabled server, and it requires L2TP client software to be installed and configured on each
            user system.

        –   Unlike PPTP, which relies on GRE to tunnel data, L2TP uses its own tunneling protocol,
            which runs over UDP port 1701. Because of this, L2TP may be easier to pass through packet
            filtering devices than PPTP.

        –   L2TP can support multiple sessions within the same tunnel.

        –   L2TP with IPsec is an established standard of the IETF (RFC 3193).

        –   In addition to the PPP-provided authentication methods, L2TP can also use other methods,
            such as RADIUS and Terminal Access Controller Access Control System (TACACS+).

        –   L2TP often uses IPsec to provide encryption and key management services.
 Layer 2 Forwarding (L2F)

        –   Unlike PPTP and L2TP, L2F is intended for use between network devices, such as an ISP’s
            network access server and an organization’s VPN gateway. Users establish unprotected
            connections from their computers to the ISP. The ISP recognizes that the users’ traffic
            should be tunneled to the organization, so it authenticates each user and the organization’s
            VPN gateway, and then provides protection for the traffic between the ISP and the
            organization. The use of L2F requires the ISP’s support and participation.

        –   Because L2F is not client-based, users’ systems do not need L2F client software or
            configuration. However, this also means that communications between the users’ systems
            and the ISP are completely unprotected.

        –   Like L2TP, L2F can use authentication protocols such as RADIUS and TACACS+. L2F
            does not support encryption.
L2TP was intended to replace PPTP and L2F. When configured properly, L2TP combined with IPsec can
provide strong encryption and authentication. PPTP should not be used to protect communications
because of its known weaknesses. Because L2F can provide only limited protection for portions of
communications that involve a participating ISP, L2TP should be used instead of L2F when the link from
the remote user to the ISP needs to be protected (which is normally the case). L2TP with IPsec is a viable
option for providing confidentiality and integrity for dial-up communications, particularly for
organizations that contract VPN services to an ISP.

6.2   Network Layer VPN Protocols

Network layer VPN protocols apply to all applications and are not application-specific. This allows some
or all network communications between two hosts or networks to be protected without modifying any
applications. IPsec is the most common network layer security control used to create VPNs. It is a
framework of open standards for ensuring private communications over public networks. IPsec protocols
work together in various combinations to provide protection for communications. The primary
