                                Assessment
                                Determine that:
                                   (i) the issuer performs a 1:1 biometric match of the
                                       cardholder against the biometric included in the PIV Card
                                       or in the PIV chain of trust prior to providing the reset PIV
                                       Card back to the cardholder (observe, test);
                                  (ii) the issuer has alternate processes in place for situations
                                       where biometric matches are not possible (review,
                                       observe).


                   MP-13        When a PIN reset is performed at an unattended issuer-operated [FIPS 201-2], Section 2.9.3 -
                   (NEW)        kiosk, the issuer ensures that the PIV Card is authenticated and PIV Card Verification Data
                                that the cardholder’s biometric matches either the stored         Reset
                                biometric on the PIV Card, through an on-card 1:1 biometric
                                match, or biometric data stored in the chain-of-trust, through an
                                off-card 1:1 biometric match. If the biometric match or card
                                authentication is unsuccessful, the kiosk does not reset the PIV
                                Card.

                                Assessment
                                Determine that:
                                  (i) the issuer’s kiosk performs a 1:1 biometric match of the
                                      cardholder against the biometric included in the PIV Card
                                      or in the chain of trust prior to resetting the PIV Card
                                      (observe, test).


                   MP-14        Remote PIN reset on a general computing platform (e.g.,             [FIPS 201-2], Section 2.9.3 -
                   (NEW)        desktop, laptop) is only performed by the issuer if the following   PIV Card Verification Data
                                requirements are met: (i) the cardholder initiates a PIN reset with Reset
                                the issuer operator, (ii) the operator authenticates the owner of
                                the PIV Card through an out-of-band authentication procedure
                                (e.g., pre-registered knowledge tokens); (iii) the cardholder’s
                                biometric matches the stored biometric on the PIV Card through a
                                1:1 on-card biometric comparison.

                                Assessment
                                Determine that:
                                  (i) remote PIN resets meet all security requirements to be
                                      implemented by the issuer and the issuer information
                                      systems (review, observe, test).


                   MP-15        Before any verification data (e.g., PIN, OCC fingerprint templates, [FIPS 201-2], Section 2.9.3 -
                   (NEW)        etc.) is reset, the issuer performs a 1:1 biometric match of the     PIV Card Verification Data
                                cardholder to reconnect to the chain-of-trust. The type of           Reset
                                biometric used for the match is not the same as the type of
                                biometric data that is being reset. If no alternative biometric data
                                is available, the cardholder provides the PIV Card to be reset and
                                another primary identity source document (as specified in Section
                                2.7 of [FIPS 201-2]). An attending operator inspects these and
                                compares the cardholder with the facial image retrieved from the
                                enrollment data record and the facial image printed on the PIV
                                Card.
