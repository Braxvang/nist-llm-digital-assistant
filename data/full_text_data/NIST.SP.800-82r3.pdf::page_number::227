system can maintain knowledge of normal activity even as the environment evolves over time.
This ultimately reduces false positive detections and improves incident response capabilities.

E.2.6. Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
DLP is a collection of tools built to improve the confidentiality of sensitive data on a network.
DLP is often marketed as a feature set within SIEM that actively monitors both data at rest to
prevent unauthorized access and data in transit to prevent unauthorized extraction. Even if DLP
is unable to prevent the data loss, it can still alert the organization to a breach.

E.2.7. Deception Technology
A deception technology uses decoy data and/or devices placed across the network to lure
attackers away from legitimate assets. Decoys can range from access credentials and files to
complete endpoints. When a threat actor interacts with a decoy, it triggers an alarm to alert cyber
defenders to its presence. Defenders can then choose to further monitor the adversary for
intelligence or immediately mitigate the threat. Because decoys do not actively interact with
other network components, deception technologies can support malicious activity monitoring
and detection without jeopardizing the controlled process.

E.2.8. Digital Twins
A digital twin is a digital replica of a physical system or component that can be deployed within
OT environments as a tool for anomaly detection. The digital twin utilizes real-time sensor
inputs and compares them using heuristics and algorithms (including ML) against a baseline
model. Operational anomalies detected by digital twins most often indicate a maintenance or
failure situation. However, a detected operational anomaly could indicate an advanced cyber
attack that has bypassed other security mechanisms and would otherwise have gone undetected.

E.3.   Data Security
Various data security technologies assist information owners in protecting the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of their data. OT network owners are encouraged to identify the critical
files and data that reside in their networks and implement data security technologies to mitigate
risk.

E.3.1. Backup Storage
Backup storage is an alternative file storage location where copies of critical files are stored and
protected to assist with recovery should the originals be lost, compromised, or unusable. Using
backup tools and procedures is fundamental to ensuring the availability of critical data within an
OT network environment. Based on risk, backup plans should specify which files require
backup, how often they should be backed up, the number of copies to be made, the location of
the backup (e.g., offline, off-site) and how long backup copies should be kept. Various solutions
exist to automate backup storage of critical data on a regular basis.
