       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


1650   A packaged set of attributes, usually contained within an assertion. Attribute bundles offer
1651   RPs a simple way to retrieve the most relevant attributes they need from IdPs. OpenID
1652   Connect scopes [OIDC] are an implementation of attribute bundles.

1653   Attribute Provider
1654   A service that provides a subscriber’s attributes without asserting that the subscriber is
1655   present to the RP. An Identity Provider (IdP) is one type of attribute provider used in
1656   federated scenarios. Attribute providers often make these attributes available by means of
1657   an attribute API.

1658   Attribute Value
1659   A complete statement asserting a property of a subscriber, independent of format. For
1660   example, for the attribute “birthday,” a value could be “12/1/1980” or “December 1,
1661   1980.”

1662   Attribute Verification API
1663   An API that provides verification of attribute values for use during an identity proofing
1664   process. This API accepts attribute values as input queries and returns whether or not the
1665   attribute values can be verified. This is distinct from an attribute API which is used to
1666   convey attributes to an RP.

1667   Authenticate
1668   See Authentication.

1669   Authenticated Protected Channel
1670   An encrypted communication channel that uses approved cryptography where the
1671   connection initiator (client) has authenticated the recipient (server). Authenticated
1672   protected channels provide confidentiality and MitM protection and are frequently used in
1673   the user authentication process. Transport Layer Security (TLS) [BCP195] is an example
1674   of an authenticated protected channel where the certificate presented by the recipient is
1675   verified by the initiator. Unless otherwise specified, authenticated protected channels
1676   do not require the server to authenticate the client. Authentication of the server is often
1677   accomplished through a certificate chain leading to a trusted root rather than individually
1678   with each server.

1679   Authentication
1680   The process of determining the validity of one or more authenticators used to claim a
1681   digital identity. Authentication establishes that a subject attempting to access a digital
1682   service is in control of the technologies used to authenticate.

1683   Authentication Factor
1684   The three types of authentication factors are something you know, something you have,
1685   and something you are. Every authenticator has one or more authentication factors.
