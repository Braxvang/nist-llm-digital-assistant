    Subject: Privacy Policies on Federal Web Sites
    [See text at http://csrc.nist.gov/policies/privacypol.pdf.]

         Federal agencies must protect an individual's right to privacy when they collect personal
         information. This is required by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and OMB Circular No.
         A-130, "Management of Federal Information Resources," 61 Fed. Reg. 6428 (Feb. 20,
         1996), and supported by the Principles for Providing and Using Personal Information
         published by the Information Infrastructure Task Force on June 6, 1995. Posting a
         privacy policy helps ensure that individuals have notice and choice about, and thus
         confidence in, how their personal information is handled when they use the Internet.
