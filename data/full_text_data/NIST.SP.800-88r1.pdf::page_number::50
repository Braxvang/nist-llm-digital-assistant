NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                         Guidelines for Media Sanitization


Data                    Pieces of information from which “understandable information” is
                        derived.

Degauss                 To reduce the magnetic flux to virtual zero by applying a reverse
                        magnetizing field. Degaussing any current generation hard disk
                        (including but not limited to IDE, EIDE, ATA, SCSI and Jaz) will
                        render the drive permanently unusable since these drives store track
                        location information on the hard drive.

                        Also called “demagnetizing.”

Destroy                 A method of Sanitization that renders Target Data recovery
                        infeasible using state of the art laboratory techniques and results in
                        the subsequent inability to use the media for storage of data.

Digital                 The coding scheme generally used in computer technology to
                        represent data.

Disintegration          A physically Destructive method of sanitizing media; the act of
                        separating into component parts.

Disposal                Disposal is a release outcome following the decision that media does
                        not contain sensitive data. This occurs either because the media
                        never contained sensitive data or because Sanitization techniques
                        were applied and the media no longer contains sensitive data.

DVD                     A Digital Video Disc (DVD) has the same shape and size as a CD,
                        but with a higher density that gives the option for data to be double-
                        sided and/or double-layered.

DVD-RW                  A rewritable (re-recordable) DVD for both movies and data from the
                        DVD Forum.

DVD+RW                  A rewritable (re-recordable) DVD for both movies and data from the
                        DVD+RW Alliance.

DVD+R                   A write-once (read only) version of the DVD+RW from the
                        DVD+RW Alliance.

DVD-R                   A write-once (read only) DVD for both movies and data endorsed by
                        the DVD Forum.

Electronic Media        General term that refers to media on which data are recorded via an
                        electrically based process.

Erasure                 Process intended to render magnetically stored information
                        irretrievable by normal means.
