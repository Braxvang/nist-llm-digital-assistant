 Full Virtualization: A form of Virtualization in which the hypervisor presents virtualized resources
 that reflect the architecture of the underlying hardware and hence unmodified guest OSs can be run.

 Guest Operating System (OS): The operating system component of the execution stack of a
 Virtual Machine (see below), others being Virtual Hardware, Middleware and Applications.

 Hypervisor: A software built using a specialized kernel of an OS, along with supporting kernel modules
 that provides isolation for various execution stacks represented by Virtual Machines (see below).

 Virtualized Host: The physical host on which the virtualization software such as the Hypervisor
 is installed. Usually, the virtualized host will contain a special hardware platform that assists
 virtualization - specifically Instruction Set and Memory virtualization.

 Virtual Machine (VM): A software-defined complete execution stack consisting of virtualized
 hardware, operating system (guest OS), and applications.

 Virtualization: A methodology for emulation or abstraction of hardware resources that enables
 complete execution stacks including software applications to run on it.
