                                                                Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

      forensic tools. The following criteria have been suggested as a fundamental set of requirements
      for forensic tools, and should be considered when a choice of tools is available:

             Usability – the ability to present data in a form that is useful to an investigator

             Comprehensive – the ability to present all data to an investigator so that both
              inculpatory and exculpatory evidence can be identified

             Accuracy – the quality of the output of the tool has been verified

             Deterministic – the ability for the tool to produce the same output when given the
              same set of instructions and input data

             Verifiable – the ability to ensure accuracy of the output by having access to
              intermediate translation and presentation results

             Tested – the ability to determine if known data present within the mobile device
              internal memory is not modified and reported accurately by the tool

      Experimenting with various tools on test devices to determine which acquisition tools work
      efficiently with specific mobile device types is highly recommended. Besides gaining
      familiarity with the capabilities of the tool, experimentation allows special purpose search
      filters and custom configurations to be setup before use in an actual case. In addition, any
      needed software updates from the manufacturer can be installed.

      Established procedures should guide the technical process of acquisition, as well as the
      examination of evidence. New circumstances may arise sporadically that require adjustment to
      existing procedures, and in some situations require new procedures and methods to be devised.
      Some examples include: UICCs being permanently bonded into a mobile device, mobile
      devices capable of supporting multiple UICCs and mobile devices that block logical
      acquisition ports until a connection is made with a cell tower. Procedures must be tested to
      ensure that the results obtained are valid and independently reproducible. Testing should occur
      on the same model of mobile device before attempting procedures on the case device. The
      development and validation of the procedures should be documented and include the following
      steps [DOJ08]:

             Identifying the task or problem

             Proposing possible solutions

             Testing each solution on an identical test device and under known control conditions

             Evaluating the results of the test

             Finalizing the procedure

5.3   Mobile Device Memory Acquisition

      Mobile devices are often submitted for laboratory processing with only specific items
      requested for recovery, such as call logs or graphics. If any doubt or concerns exist about the
      requested data, contacting the submitter for clarification is recommended. Though it is not
                                                   40
