NIST SP 800-186                                                Discrete Logarithm-based Cryptography:
February 2023                                                        Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters

In addition, some special Edwards, Weierstrass, and Montgomery curves over GF(p) are given
for two size ranges.

       Curves Over Prime Fields
This section specifies elliptic curves over prime fields recommended for U.S. Federal
Government use, where each curve takes the form of a curve in short-Weierstrass form (Section
3.2.1), a Montgomery curve (Section 3.2.2), or a twisted Edwards curve (Section 3.2.3).

3.2.1. Weierstrass Curves
This specification includes pseudorandom Weierstrass curves generated over prime fields P-192,
P-224, P-256, P-384, and P-521 (see Sections 3.2.1.2 – 3.2.1.5) and special Weierstrass curves
over prime fields W-25519 (Section 3.2.1.6) and W-448 (Section 3.2.1.7).
For each Weierstrass curve,
                              E : y2 ≡ x3 +ax +b mod p,
the following domain parameters D =( p, h, n, Type, a, b, G, {Seed, c}) are given:
   •   The prime modulus p

   •   The cofactor h
           o For pseudorandom curves, the cofactor h = 1, so the order n is prime.
           o For special curves, the cofactor h > 1, so the order n is not prime.

   •   The Type is “Weierstrass curve”

   •   The coefficient a
           o For pseudorandom curves, a = –3 was made for reasons of efficiency; see IEEE
             Std 1363-2000.

   •   The coefficient b
           o For pseudorandom curves, the coefficient b satisfies b2 c ≡ –27 mod p.

   •   The base point G with x coordinate Gx and y coordinate Gy

   •   The 160-bit input Seed to the SHA-1 hash algorithm in Appendix C.3 for pseudorandom
       curves. Seed is not used with the special curves W-25519 (Section 3.2.1.6) and W-448
       (Section 3.2.1.7).

   •   The output c of the SHA-1 hash algorithm used for pseudorandom curves. The value c is
       not used with the special curves W-25519 (Section 3.2.1.6) and W-448 (Section 3.2.1.7).

All values (except for the cofactor and seed) are provided both in decimal and hexadecimal. The
cofactor is given in decimal form, and the seed is given in hexadecimal.
