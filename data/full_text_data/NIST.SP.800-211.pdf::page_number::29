Some of the key accomplishments for NICE during FY 2019 include:
  •   Growth in the National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity –
      NIST and NICE support the National Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) in
      Cybersecurity through a grant that funds the annual CAE Symposium held in
      conjunction with the annual NICE Conference and Expo. During FY 2019, the
      number of CAE institutions grew to 312, with 60 new CAE designations occurring
      during the NICE Conference and Expo. NICE also supports the CAE community
      through participation in and travel to the annual CAE Executive Leadership Forum.
      The National Security Agency and DHS co-lead the CAE Program.
  •   NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework Promotion and Alignment – Executive
      Order (EO) 13870, America’s Cybersecurity Workforce, has continued to
      increase awareness about the NICE Framework and encouraging its adoption by
      government, industry, and academia [21]. The EO requires an extension of the NICE
      Framework to federal contractors that provide cybersecurity or IT services to the
      Federal Government and encourages voluntary adoption by nonfederal entities.
      NIST continues to learn about applications and uses of the NICE Framework across
      public and private sectors and expects to use that experience and feedback to
      improve the NICE Framework during FY 2020.
  •   Public Conferences – The NICE team prepared for the 10th Annual NICE
      Conference and Expo and the 5th Annual NICE K12 Cybersecurity Education
      Conference. The broader NICE Conference will be held in Phoenix, Arizona in
      early FY 2020. The next NICE K12 Cybersecurity Education Conference, to be
      held in Garden Grove, California, will support school teachers, administrators,
      non-profit organizations, and others who mentor children and youth interested in
      cybersecurity as a career.
  •   International Engagement – NICE convenes bi-monthly meetings of Five Eyes
      partner countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the
      United States) to learn about each country’s respective initiatives and challenges
      in cybersecurity education and workforce development. NICE also actively
      participates in a working group on Cyber Culture and Skills of the Global Forum
      for Cyber Expertise (GFCE). NICE staff presented on the topic of “Workforce
      Development Frameworks” at the GFCE Annual Meeting in Ethiopia. NICE also
      coordinated a four-day International Workshop on Cybersecurity Education and
      Workforce Development Capacity Building in Germany.
