information. [24]

acquirer
Stakeholder that acquires or procures a product or service from a supplier. [4]

acquisition
Process of obtaining a system, product, or service. [4]

activity
Set of cohesive tasks of a process. [4]

adequate security (systems)
Meets minimum tolerable levels of security as determined by analysis, experience, or a combination of both and is
as secure as reasonably practicable (i.e., incremental improvement in security would require an intolerable or
disproportionate deterioration of meeting other system objectives, such as those for system performance, or would
violate system constraints).

adverse consequence
An undesirable consequence associated with a loss. [61]

adversity
The conditions that can cause a loss of assets (e.g., threats, attacks, vulnerabilities, hazards, disruptions, and
exposures).

agreement
Mutual acknowledgement of terms and conditions under which a working relationship is conducted (e.g.,
memorandum of agreement or contract). [4]

anomaly
Condition that deviates from expectations based on requirements specifications, design documents, user documents,
or standards, or from someoneâ€™s perceptions or experiences. [24]

anti-tamper
Systems engineering activities intended to prevent or delay exploitation of critical program information in U.S.
defense systems in domestic and export configurations to impede countermeasure development, unintended
technology transfer, or alteration of a system due to reverse engineering. [70]
See tampering.

architecture
Fundamental concepts or properties related to a system in its environment embodied in its elements, relationships,
and in the principles of its design and evolution. [71]
See security architecture.

architecture (system)
Fundamental concepts or properties of a system in its environment embodied in its elements, relationships, and in
the principles of its design and evolution. [71]

architecture description
A work product used to express an architecture. [71]

architecture framework
Conventions, principles, and practices for the description of architectures established within a specific domain of
application and/or community of stakeholders. [71]
