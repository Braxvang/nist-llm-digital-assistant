the message input to the hash function is the maximum length allowed by the hash
function, while the high end of the range applies to the situation where the message input
length is relatively small. Information on determining the actual second preimage
resistance strengths of the approved hash functions for different message lengths is
provided in Appendix A. In the case of SHA-384, SHA-512/224 or SHA-512/256, the
second preimage resistance strength does not depend on the message length; details can
be found in Appendix A.
Note that the preimage resistance and the second preimage resistance strengths are
greater than the collision resistance strength for each of the approved hash algorithms
specified in FIPS 180-4.

5 Hash function Usage
5.1       Truncated Message Digest
Some applications may require a value that is shorter than the (full-length) message
digest provided by an approved hash function as specified in FIPS 180-4. In such cases, it
may be appropriate to use a subset of the bits produced by the hash function as the
(shortened) message digest.
Let the (shortened) message digest be called a truncated message digest, and let λ be its
desired length in bits. A truncated message digest may be used if the following
requirements are met:
      1. The length of the output block of the approved hash function to be used shall be
         greater than λ (i.e., L > λ).
      2. The λ left-most bits of the full-length message digest shall be selected as the
         truncated message digest.
         For example, if a truncated message digest of 96 bits is desired, the SHA-256
         hash function could be used (e.g., because it is available to the application, and
         provides an output larger than 96 bits). The leftmost 96 bits of the 256-bit
         message digest generated by SHA-256 are selected as the truncated message
         digest, and the rightmost 160 bits of the message digest are discarded.
      3. If collision resistance is required, λ shall be at least twice the required collision
         resistance strength s (in bits) for the truncated message digest (i.e., λ ≥ 2s).
These specifications for truncating the output of a cryptographic hash function promote
application interoperability in situations where the use of shortened message digests is
appropriate (and permissible), as determined by implementers and application developers
acting in conformance with NIST Standards and Recommendations.
Truncating the message digest can impact the security of an application. By truncating a
message digest, the expected collision resistance strength is reduced from L/2 to λ/2 (in
bits). For the example in item 2 above, even though SHA-256 provides 128 bits of
collision resistance, the collision resistance provided by the 96-bit truncated message
digest is half the length of the truncated message digest, which is 48 bits, in this case.
