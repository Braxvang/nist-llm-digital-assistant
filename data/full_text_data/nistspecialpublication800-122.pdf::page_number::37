                            GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



    3.   By consolidating data into a single system, does it create additional vulnerabilities that could
         result in harm to the individual? What additional controls could be put in place to mitigate the
         risk?

    4.   Is all of the information necessary for the system to function? Is there a way to minimize the
         information in the system? Could PII on the system be replaced with anonymized data that is not
         PII?

    5. Is the organization required to conduct a PIA for this system?

Scenario 2: Protecting Survey Data

Recently, an organization emailed to individuals a link to an online survey, which was designed to gather
feedback about the organization‘s services. The organization identified each individual by name, email
address, and an organization-assigned ID number. The majority of survey questions asked individuals to
express their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the organization, but there were also questions asking
individuals to provide their ZIP code along with demographic details on their age, income level,
educational background, and marital status.

The following are additional questions for this scenario:

    1. Which data elements collected through this survey should be considered PII?

    2.   What is the PII confidentiality impact level? What factors were taken into consideration when
         making this determination?

    3. How are determinations made as to which data from the survey is relevant to the organization‘s
       operations? Does the Paperwork Reduction Act apply? What happens to data that is deemed
       unnecessary?

    4. What privacy-specific safeguards might help protect the PII collected and retained from this
       survey?

    5. What other types of controls for safeguarding data (that are not necessarily specific to
       safeguarding PII) might be used to protect the data from the responses?

Scenario 3: Completing Work at Home

An organization‘s employee needed to leave early for a doctor‘s appointment, but the employee was not
finished with her work for the day and had no leave time available. Since she had the same spreadsheet
application at home, she decided to email a data extract as an attachment to her personal email address
and finish her work at home that evening. The data extract was downloaded from an access-controlled
human resources database located on a server within the organization‘s security perimeter. The extract
contained employee names, identification numbers, dates of birth, salary information, manager names,
addresses, phone numbers, and positions. As she was leaving, she remembered that she had her personal
USB flash drive in her purse. She decided the USB drive would be good to use in case she had an
attachment problem with the email she had already sent. Although much of the USB drive‘s space was
taken up with family photos she had shared with her coworkers earlier in the day, there was still enough
room to add the data extract. She copied the data extract and dropped it in her purse as she left for her
appointment. When she arrived home that evening, she plugged the USB drive into her family‘s
computer and used her spreadsheet application to analyze the data.
