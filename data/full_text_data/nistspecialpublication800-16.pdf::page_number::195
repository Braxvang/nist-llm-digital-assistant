                                    APPENDIX C          — GLOSSARY
NOTE: The following terms are defined for use throughout this document.

Acceptable Risk        —   the level of Residual Risk that has been determined to be a reasonable
level of potential loss/disruption for a specific IT system.     (See Total Risk, Residual Risk, and
Minimum Level of Protection.)

Accreditation      —also known as authorize processing (OMB Circular A- 130, Appendix HI),
and approval to operate. Accreditation (or authorization to process information) is granted by a
management official and provides an important quality control. By accrediting a system or
application, a manager accepts the associated risk. Accreditation (authorization) must be based
on a review of controls. (See Certification.)

Acquisition, Development, and Installation Controls                 —   the process of assuring that
adequate controls are considered, evaluated, selected, designed and built into the system during
its early planning and development stages and that an on-going process is established to ensure

continued operation at an acceptable level of risk during the installation, implementation and
operation stages.


Adequate Security        —   security commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm
resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of information. This
includes assuring that systems and applications operate effectively and provide appropriate
confidentiality, integrity, and availability, through the use of cost-effective management,
acquisition, development, installation, operational, and technical controls.


Application    —    the system, functional area, or problem to which information technology is
applied.  The application includes related manual procedures as well as automated procedures.
Payroll, accounting, and management information systems are examples of applications.


Approval to Operate         —   see Certification and Accreditation.


Automated Information System Security                   — synonymous with Information Technology
Security.


Automated Information System Security Program                    — synonymous with IT Security
Program.


Availability   —    the timely, reliable access to data and information services for authorized users.
