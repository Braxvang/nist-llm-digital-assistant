                                                                                          GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



3.6   Summary

SSL VPNs can support a range of users, on a variety of computers, accessing resources from many
locations. They can provide secure remote access to internal services such as email, file servers, and
other applications in a Web-based format. SSL VPNs use the SSL protocol, which is included in all
standard Web browsers, to secure the transmission of data between the user and the organization as it
traverses public networks.

SSL VPNs consist of three core functions to enable secure access to internal resources. These
functions—proxying, application translation, and network extension—provide multiple methods to enable
remote access to a variety of applications. This allows SSL VPNs to support Web-based, client/server,
and legacy applications. Proxying provides the simplest form of an SSL VPN by enabling encryption and
authentication for internal Web sites. Application translation is often used to access non-Web-enabled
applications by converting a legacy or proprietary protocol into a more widely used or standard protocol.
Network extension provides complete network access to remote users as if they were physically located
on the internal local area network. Users with network extension can access all network resources, not
just Web servers; this is particularly useful in organizations with custom applications that cannot be
translated to the Web easily.

SSL VPNs vary in breadth, depth, and completeness of features and security services. This makes it
important to identify and define requirements, and evaluate several products to determine their fit into the
organization. Recommendations and considerations include the following:

 Because some SSL VPN products cannot cover all remote access needs, for selecting the best product
  it is recommended to identify the remote access needs and the applications that require remote access.
 Each SSL VPN supports different protocols via proxy and application translation. In addition, some
  SSL VPN products have concentrated their efforts and expertise in supporting certain protocols and
  applications. It is crucial to make sure that the SSL VPN provides the necessary proxies and
  application translators for the applications that require remote access.
 SSL VPN manageability features such as status reporting, logging, and auditing should provide
  adequate capabilities for the organization to effectively operate and manage the SSL VPN and to
  extract detailed usage information.
 The SSL VPN high availability and scalability features should support the organization’s
  requirements for failover, load balancing, and throughput. State and information sharing is
  recommended to keep the failover process transparent to the user.
 SSL VPN portal customization should allow the organization to control the look and feel of the portal
  and to customize the portal to support various devices such as PDAs and smart phones.
 SSL VPN authentication should provide the necessary support for the organization’s current and
  future authentication methods and to leverage existing authentication databases. SSL VPN
  authentication should also be tested to ensure interoperability with existing authentication methods.
 Some organizations, such as Federal agencies, have strict requirements for encryption and integrity
  protection. SSL VPNs should support the required algorithms for symmetric encryption, key
  exchange, and hash functions. All cryptographic algorithms and modules must be FIPS-approved.
 SSL VPNs should be evaluated to ensure they provide the level of granularity needed for access
  controls. Access controls should be capable of applying permissions to users, groups, and resources,
  as well as integrating with endpoint security controls.
