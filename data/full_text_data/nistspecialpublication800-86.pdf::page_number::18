GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



      ! Response Time. Personnel located on-site might be able to initiate computer forensic activity
        more quickly than could off-site personnel. For organizations with geographically dispersed
        physical locations, off-site outsourcers located near distant facilities might be able to respond
        more quickly than personnel located at the organization’s headquarters.
      ! Data Sensitivity. Because of data sensitivity and privacy concerns, some organizations might be
        reluctant to allow external parties to image hard drives and perform other actions that provide
        access to data. For example, a system that contains traces of an incident might also contain health
        care information, financial records, or other sensitive data; an organization might prefer to keep
        that system under its own control to safeguard the privacy of the data. On the other hand, if there
        is a privacy concern within the team—for example, if an incident is suspected to involve a
        member of the incident handling team—use of an independent third party to perform forensic
        actions would be preferable.
Incident handlers performing forensic tasks need to have a reasonably comprehensive knowledge of
forensic principles, guidelines, procedures, tools, and techniques, as well as anti-forensic tools and
techniques that could conceal or destroy data. It is also beneficial for incident handlers to have expertise
in information security and specific technical subjects, such as the most commonly used OSs, filesystems,
applications, and network protocols within the organization. Having this type of knowledge facilitates
faster and more effective responses to incidents. Incident handlers also need a general, broad
understanding of systems and networks so that they can determine quickly which teams and individuals
are well-suited to providing technical expertise for particular forensic efforts, such as examining and
analyzing data for an uncommon application.

Individuals performing forensics might need to perform other types of tasks as well. For example, if the
results of an investigation are used in a court of law, incident handlers may be called upon to provide
testimony and corroborate their findings. Incident handlers might provide training courses in forensics to
technical support staff, system and network administrators, and other IT professionals. Possible training
topics include an overview of forensics tools and techniques, advice on using a particular tool, and the
signs of a new type of attack. Incident handlers might also want to have interactive sessions with groups
of IT professionals to hear their thoughts on forensics tools and identify potential shortcomings in existing
forensics capabilities.

On an incident handling team, more than one team member should be able to perform each typical
forensic activity so that the absence of any single team member will not severely impact the team’s
abilities. Incident handlers can train each other in the use of forensic tools and other technical and
procedural topics. Hands-on exercises and external IT and forensic training courses can also be helpful in
building and maintaining skills. In addition, it might be beneficial to have team members see
demonstrations of new tools and technologies or try out forensic and anti-forensic tools in a lab. This can
be particularly useful in familiarizing incident handlers with the collection, examination, and analysis of
data from devices such as cell phones and PDAs. Incident handlers need to stay current with new
forensic technologies, techniques, and procedures.

2.3     Interactions with Other Teams

It is not feasible for any one person to be well-versed in every technology (including all software) used
within an organization; therefore, individuals performing forensic actions should be able to reach out to
other teams and individuals within their organization as needed for additional assistance. For example, an
incident involving a particular database server might be handled more efficiently if the database
administrator were available to provide background information, answer technical questions, and provide
database documentation and other reference material. Organizations should ensure that IT professionals
throughout the organization, especially incident handlers and other first responders to incidents,
