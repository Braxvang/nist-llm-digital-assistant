       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                                                     Recommendation for RBG Constructions

2048   properties. Rather, they have independent and identically distributed bits, with each bit taking on
2049   a value with a probability of exactly 0.5. These bitstrings are only unpredictable to an adversary
2050   who does not know the DRBG’s internal state.

2051   A.4.         Entropy and Security Strength in this Recommendation
2052   In the RBG1 construction specified in Section 4, the DRBG is instantiated from either an RBG2(P)
2053   or an RBG3 construction. In order to instantiate the RBG1 construction at a security strength of s
2054   bits, this Recommendation requires the source RBG to support a security strength of at least s bits
2055   and provide a bitstring that is 3s/2 bits long for most of the DRBGs. However, for a CTR_DRBG
2056   without a derivation function, a bitstring that is s + 128 bits long is required. (Note that an RBG3
2057   construction supports any desired security strength.)
2058   In the RBG2 and RBG3 constructions specified in Sections 5 and 6, respectively, the DRBG within
2059   the construction is instantiated using a bitstring with a certain amount of entropy obtained from a
2060   validated entropy source. 34 In order to instantiate the DRBG to support an s-bit security strength,
2061   a bitstring with at least 3s/2 bits of entropy is required for the instantiation of most of the DRBGs.
2062   Reseeding requires a bitstring with at least s bits of entropy. However, for a CTR_DRBG without
2063   a derivation function, a bitstring with exactly s + 128 full-entropy bits is required for instantiation
2064   and reseeding, either obtained directly from an entropy source that provides full-entropy output or
2065   from an entropy source via an approved (vetted) conditioning function (see Section 3.3).
2066   The RBG3 constructions specified in Section 6 are designed to provide full-entropy outputs but
2067   with a DRBG included in the design in case the entropy source fails undetectably. Entropy bits are
2068   possibly obtained from an entropy source via an approved (vetted) conditioning function. When
2069   the entropy source is working properly, an n-bit output from the RBG3 construction is said to
2070   provide n bits of entropy. The DRBG in an RBG3 construction is always required to support a
2071   256-bit security strength. If an entropy-source fails and the failure is undetected, the RBG3
2072   construction outputs are generated at a security strength of 256 bits. In this case, the security
2073   strength of a bitstring produced by the RBG is the minimum of 256 and its length (i.e.,
2074   security_strength = min(256, length)).
2075   In conclusion, entropy sources and properly functioning RBG3 constructions provide output with
2076   entropy. RBG1 and RBG2 constructions provide output with a security strength that depends on
2077   the security strength of the RBG instantiation and the length of the output. Likewise, if the entropy
2078   source used by an RBG3 construction fails undetectably, the output is then dependent on the
2079   DRBG within the construction (an RBG(P) construction) to produce output at a security strength
2080   of 256 bits.
2081   Because of the difference between the use of “entropy” to describe the output of an entropy source
2082   and the use of “security strength” to describe the output of a DRBG, the term “randomness” is
2083   used as a general term to mean either “entropy” or “security strength,” as appropriate. A
2084   “randomness source” is the general term for an entropy source or RBG that provides the
2085   randomness used by an RBG.

            However, note that the entropy-source output may be cryptographically processed by an approved conditioning function before being used.
