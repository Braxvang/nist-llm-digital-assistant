One of the key advantages of ad hoc WLANs is that theoretically they can be formed any time and
anywhere, allowing multiple users to create wireless connections cheaply, quickly, and easily with
minimal hardware and user maintenance. In practice, many different types of ad hoc networks are
possible, and the IEEE 802.11 specification allows all of them. Since it does not give the details of how
to form a network, but rather only how to establish the links in a network, ad hoc mode as specified by
802.11 is incomplete for any particular use. This means that different products built on it typically are not
interoperable, because there has not yet been standardization on any of these possible networks.

An ad hoc network can be created for many reasons, such as allowing the sharing of files or the rapid
exchange of e-mail. However, an ad hoc WLAN cannot communicate with external networks. A further
complication is that an ad hoc network can interfere with the operation of an AP-based infrastructure
mode network (see next section) that exists within the same wireless space.
