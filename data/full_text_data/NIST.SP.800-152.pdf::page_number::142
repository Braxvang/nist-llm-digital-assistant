SP 800-152                                             A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


Key custodian            An FCKMS role that is responsible for distributing keys or
                         key splits and/or entering them into a cryptographic module.
Key derivation           The process of deriving a key in a non-reversible manner from
                         shared information, some of which is secret.
Key distribution         See Key transport.
Key establishment        The process that results in the sharing of a key between two or
                         more entities, either by transporting a key from one entity to
                         another (key transport) or generating a key from information
                         shared by the entities (key agreement).
Key format               The data structure of a cryptographic key.
Key life cycle           The period of time between the creation of the key and its
                         destruction.
Key owner                A person authorized by an FCKMS service provider or
                         FCKMS service-using organization to use a specific key that
                         is managed by the FCKMS.
Key (plaintext)          A cryptographic key that can be directly used by a
                         cryptographic algorithm to perform a cryptographic operation.
Key splitting (k of n)   Splitting a key into n key splits so that for some k (where k <
                         n), any k key splits of the key can be used to form the key, but
                         having any kï€­1 key splits provides no knowledge of the key
                         value.
Key states               A categorization of the states that a key can assume during its
                         lifetime. See [SP 800-57 Part 1].
Key transport            A manual or automated key-establishment procedure whereby
                         one entity (the sender) selects and distributes the key to
                         another entity (the receiver).
Key type                 One of the twenty-one types of keys listed in [SP 800-130].
Key update               A key-derivation process whereby the derived key replaces
                         the key from which it was derived when the key-derivation
                         process is later repeated.
Key wrapping             A method of cryptographically protecting keys using a
                         symmetric key that provides both confidentiality and integrity
                         protection.
Key and metadata         Functions performed by a CKMS or FCKMS in order to
management functions     manage keys and metadata.
Key/metadata recovery    The process of retrieving or reconstructing a key or metadata
                         from backup or archive storage.
