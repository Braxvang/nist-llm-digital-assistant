5.       MEASURES DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

The benefit of devoting the time to set up an information security performance measures
program in advance is similar to that of allowing time for requirements definition during
information system development—investing time early in the process is more effective than
retrofitting requirements once the effort is under way. Important considerations for setting up an
information security performance measures program include:

     •   Selecting the measures most appropriate for the organization’s strategy and business
         environment, including mission and information security priorities, environment, and
         requirements;

     •   Taking time to collect input and get buy-in from, and provide education to, all relevant
         stakeholders; and

     •   Ensuring that appropriate technical and process infrastructure is in place, including
         creation/modification of data collection, analysis, and reporting tools.

Two processes—measures development and measures implementation—guide the establishment
and operation of an information security measurement program. The measures development
process establishes the initial set of measures as well as selection of the measures subset that is
appropriate for an organization at a given time. The information security measurement program
implementation process is iterative by nature and ensures that appropriate aspects of information
security are measured for a specific time period. The remainder of this section describes the
measures development process. (Section 6 describes the information security measurement
program implementation process.)

Figure 5-1 illustrates the place of information security measures within a larger organizational
context and demonstrates that they can be used to progressively measure the implementation,
effectiveness/efficiency, and business impact of information security activities within
organizations or for specific information systems.

The information security measures development process consists of two major activities:

     •   Identification and definition of the current information security program; and

     •   Development and selection of specific measures to gauge the implementation,
         effectiveness, efficiency, and impact of the security controls.

The activities outlined in Figure 5-1 need not be done sequentially. The process is provided as a
way to think about measures and facilitate the identification of measures tailored to a specific
organization and its different stakeholder groups.
