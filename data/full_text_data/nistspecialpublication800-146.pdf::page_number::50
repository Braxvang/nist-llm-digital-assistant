7.2   Software Stack and Provider/Consumer Scope of Control

In IaaS, the cloud provider controls the most privileged, lower layers of the software stack. Figure 16
illustrates how control and management responsibilities are shared. In the center, the figure depicts a
traditional software stack comprising layers for the hardware, operating system, middleware, and
applications. In the case of IaaS, the layer usually occupied by the operating system is split into two
layers. The lower (and more privileged) layer is occupied by the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM),
which is also called the hypervisor. A hypervisor uses the hardware to synthesize one or more Virtual
Machines (VMs); each VM is "an efficient, isolated duplicate of a real machine" [Pop73]. In essence,
when a consumer rents access to a VM, the VM appears to the consumer as actual computer hardware
that can be administered (e.g., powered on/off, peripherals configured) via commands sent over a network
to the provider. An operating system running within a VM is called a guest operating system; when full
virtualization techniques (see NIST SP 800-125) are used by the provider, the consumer is free (using the
provider's utilities) to load any supported operating system software desired into the VM.




                          Figure 16: IaaS Component Stack and Scope of Control

As shown in Figure 16, the provider maintains total control over the physical hardware and administrative
control over the hypervisor layer. The consumer may make requests to the cloud (including the
hypervisor layer) to create and manage new VMs but these requests are honored only if they conform to
the provider's policies over resource assignment. Through the hypervisor, the provider will typically
provide interfaces to networking features (such as virtual network switches) that consumers may use to
configure custom virtual networks within the provider's infrastructure. The consumer will typically
maintain complete control over the operation of the guest operating system in each VM, and all software
layers above it. While this structure grants very significant control over the software stack to consumers,
consumers consequently must take on the responsibility to operate, update, and configure these traditional
computing resources for security and reliability. This structure contrasts significantly with SaaS and PaaS
clouds where many of these issues are handled transparently for consumers.
