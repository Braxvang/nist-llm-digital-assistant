NIST SP 800-82r3                                            Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

objectives and scope of the OT security program, including the business organizations affected,
the systems and networks involved, the budget and resources required, and the division of
responsibilities.
The organization may already have an information security program in place or have developed
one for its IT systems. The OT cybersecurity manager should identify which existing practices to
leverage and which practices are specific to the OT system. Ultimately, it will be more effective
for the team to share resources with others in the organization that have similar objectives.

       Business Case for the OT Cybersecurity Program
The cybersecurity of OT systems is a critical component in the overall security of the
organization. Cybersecurity events could potentially impact the organization’s mission and
objectives, the environment, regulatory compliance, and even human safety. OT systems can also
be used as an entry point to organizational IT systems and other enterprise systems. As OT
systems are increasingly being connected to IT networks, relying on traditional measures (e.g.,
air gaps) is not enough to protect such systems from cyber attacks. Therefore, security measures
tailored to the OT system are required to protect the organization. An OT cybersecurity program
considers the characteristics of OT systems that require special consideration in order to mitigate
these risks.

3.2.1. Benefits of Cybersecurity Investments
OT cybersecurity supports the mission and business functions of the organization and provides
additional benefits, including:
   •   Improving OT system safety, reliability, and availability
   •   Improving OT system efficiency
   •   Reducing community concerns
   •   Reducing legal liabilities
   •   Meeting regulatory requirements
   •   Helping with insurance coverage and costs
A strong OT cybersecurity program is fundamental to a sustainable business operation and can
potentially enhance system reliability and availability. This includes minimizing unintentional
OT system information security impacts from inappropriate testing, policies, and misconfigured
systems. Cyber attacks can also have other significant impacts, such as:
   •   Physical impacts. Physical impacts encompass the set of direct consequences of OT
       failure, particularly personal injury and the loss of life. Other effects include the loss of
       property (including data) and potential damage to the environment.
   •   Economic impacts. Economic impacts are a second-order effect of physical impacts that
       ensue from an OT incident, which in turn inflict a greater economic loss on the facility,
       organization, or others who are dependent on the OT systems. The unavailability of
       critical infrastructure (e.g., electrical power, transportation) can have economic impacts
