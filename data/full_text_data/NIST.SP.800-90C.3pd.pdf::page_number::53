       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                         Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

1447           b)   If the consuming application does not require full entropy in the returned bitstring, the
1448                Get_randomness-source_input call is replaced by:
1449                                   (status, entropy_bitstring) = Get_ES_Bitstring(3s/2).
1450           Validated physical and/or non-physical entropy sources shall be used to provide the
1451           requested entropy. For an RBG2(P) construction, the requested 3s/2 bits of entropy shall
1452           be counted as specified in Method 1 of Section 2.3. For an RBG2(NP) construction, the
1453           requested 3s/2 bits of entropy shall be counted as specified in Method 2 of Section 3.3.

1454   5.2.2. Requesting Pseudorandom Bits from an RBG2 Construction
1455   Pseudorandom bits may be requested using the following call (see Section 2.8.1.2):
1456    (status, returned_bits) = Generate_function(RBG2_state_handle, requested_number_of_bits,
1457             requested_security_strength, prediction_resistance_request, additional_input),
1458   where state_handle (if used) was returned by the Instantiate_function (see Sections 2.8.1.1 and
1459   5.2.1).
1460   Support for prediction resistance is optional. If prediction resistance is supported, its use is
1461   optional. This RBG may be designed to always provide prediction resistance, to only provide
1462   prediction resistance upon request, or to be unable to provide prediction resistance (i.e., to not
1463   support prediction-resistance requests during generation).
1464   Note that when prediction resistance is requested, the Generate_function will invoke the
1465   Reseed_function. If sufficient entropy is not available for reseeding, an error indication shall be
1466   returned, and the requested bits shall not be generated.

1467   5.2.3. Reseeding an RBG2 Construction
1468   As discussed in Section 2.4.2, when the RBG2 construction includes a reseed capability, the
1469   reseeding of the DRBG may be performed 1) upon request from a consuming application (either
1470   an explicit request for reseeding or a request for the generation of bits with prediction resistance);
1471   2) on a fixed schedule based on time, number of outputs, or events; or 3) as sufficient entropy
1472   becomes available.
1473   An RBG2 construction is reseeded using the following call:
1474                    status = Reseed_function(RBG2_state_handle, additional_input),
1475   where the RBG2_state_handle (when used) was obtained during the instantiation of the RBG (see
1476   Sections 2.8.1.1 and 5.2.1).
1477   SP 800-90A uses a Get_randomness-source_input call to obtain the entropy needed for
1478   reseeding the DRBG (see Section 2.8.1.3 herein and in [SP800-90A]. The DRBG is reseeded at
1479   the instantiated security strength recorded in the DRBGâ€™s internal state. The Get_randomness-
1480   source_input call in SP 800-90A shall be replaced with the following:
1481       1. For the CTR_DRBG without a derivation function, use the appropriate replacement as
1482          specified in step 1 of Section 5.2.1.
