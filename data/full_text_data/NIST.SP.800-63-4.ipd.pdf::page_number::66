       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


1954   A characteristic of an authentication system or an authenticator that requires more than
1955   one distinct authentication factor for successful authentication. MFA can be performed
1956   using a single authenticator that provides more than one factor or by a combination of
1957   authenticators that provide different factors.
1958   The three authentication factors are something you know, something you have, and
1959   something you are.

1960   Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
1961   An authentication system that requires more than one distinct authentication factor for
1962   successful authentication. Multi-factor authentication can be performed using a multi-
1963   factor authenticator or by a combination of authenticators that provide different factors.
1964   The three authentication factors are something you know, something you have, and
1965   something you are.

1966   Multi-Factor Authenticator
1967   An authenticator that provides more than one distinct authentication factor, such as a
1968   cryptographic authentication device with an integrated biometric sensor that is required to
1969   activate the device.

1970   Network
1971   An open communications medium, typically the Internet, used to transport messages
1972   between the claimant and other parties. Unless otherwise stated, no assumptions are
1973   made about the networkâ€™s security; it is assumed to be open and subject to active
1974   (e.g., impersonation, attacker-in-the-middle, session hijacking) and passive (e.g.,
1975   eavesdropping) attack at any point between the parties (e.g., claimant, verifier, CSP, RP).

1976   Nonce
1977   A value used in security protocols that is never repeated with the same key. For example,
1978   nonces used as challenges in challenge-response authentication protocols must not be
1979   repeated until authentication keys are changed. Otherwise, there is a possibility of a
1980   replay attack. Using a nonce as a challenge is a different requirement than a random
1981   challenge, because a nonce is not necessarily unpredictable.

1982   Offline Attack
1983   An attack where the attacker obtains some data (typically by eavesdropping on an
1984   authentication transaction or by penetrating a system and stealing security files) that
1985   the attacker is able to analyze in a system of their own choosing.

1986   One-to-one (1:1) Comparison
1987   The process in which a biometric sample from an individual is compared to a biometric
1988   reference to produce a comparison score.
