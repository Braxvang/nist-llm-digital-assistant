mechanism
A process or system that is used to produce a particular result.
The fundamental processes involved in or responsible for an action, reaction, or other natural phenomenon.
A natural or established process by which something takes place or is brought about.
         Note 1: Generally, a means to an end.
         Note 2: A mechanism can be technology- or non-technology-based (e.g., apparatus, device, instrument,
         procedure, process, system, operation, method, technique, means, or medium).
See security mechanism.

module
Program unit that is discrete and identifiable with respect to compiling, combining with other units, and loading.
Discrete and identifiable element with a well-defined interface and well-defined purpose or role whose effect is
described as relations among inputs, outputs, and retained state. [24]

monitoring
Continual checking, supervising, critically observing or determining the status in order to identify change from the
performance level required or expected. [28]

operational concept
Verbal and graphic statement of an organization’s assumptions or intent in regard to an operation or series of
operations of a specific system or a related set of specific new, existing, or modified systems. [77]
         Note: The operational concept is designed to give an overall picture of the operations using one or more
         specific systems or set of related systems in the organization’s operational environment from the
         perspectives of users and operators.
See concept of operations.

operational environment
Context determining the setting and circumstance of all influences on a delivered system.
         Note: Operational environments include physical (e.g., land, air, maritime, space) and cyberspace contexts.

operational margin
The margin that is designed explicitly to provide space between the worst normal operating condition and the point
at which failure occurs (derives from physical design margin). [3] [6]

operator
Individual or organization that performs the operations of a system. [4]
         Note 1: The role of operator and the role of user can be vested, simultaneously or sequentially, in the same
         individual or organization.
         Note 2: An individual operator combined with knowledge, skills, and procedures can be considered an
         element of the system.
         Note 3: An operator may perform operations on a system that is operated or of a system that is operated,
         depending on whether or not operating instructions are placed within the system boundary.

organization
Group of people and facilities with an arrangement of responsibilities, authorities, and relationships. [4] [78]
         Note: An identified part of an organization (even as small as a single individual) or an identified group of
         organizations can be regarded as an organization if it has responsibilities, authorities, and relationships. A
         body of persons organized for some specific purpose – such as a club, union, corporation, or society – is an
         organization.
