        Subtask 8.2: Analyze the proposed or actual changes to the
                                                                            EIMO

                                      Subtask                                      Role(s) Responsible
        Subtask 9.1: Observe all of the processes involved in getting a
        PIV Card or a derived PIV credential, including those from
        sponsorship to maintenance. Observe each process, and compare
                                                                               EIMO (or designated appointee)
        its controls against the applicable list of required issuer controls.
        If an issuer has several facilities, this process needs to be repeated
        using randomly selected issuing facilities.
        Subtask 9.2: The results of the life cycle walkthrough are
        summarized in a report to the DAO. The report highlights any
                                                                            EIMO, DAO
        deficiencies and the corrective actions that need to be
        implemented to correct those deficiencies.
