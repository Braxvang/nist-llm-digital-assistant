personal devices to circumvent restrictive mobile device policies implemented by full enterprise
management of enterprise-provided mobile devices. Staff members may send work-related
emails or documents to their personal email accounts to better enable access during travel, use
unapproved apps or cloud services to store enterprise data, or take pictures of whiteboard
drawings with the camera on their personal devices. Staff members may also be motivated to use
shadow IT when enterprise administration practices appear to invade their privacy (e.g.,
warnings that enterprise system administrators are permitted to monitor all communication from
an enterprise-owned mobile phone). Another example involves tethering, such as using one
mobile device to provide network access for another mobile device. 1
Shadow IT systems do not comply with organizational requirements for enterprise control or
documentation and may or may not violate security or reliability policies. In a few cases, a
benefit arising from shadow IT is that some of the technologies, software, or systems become
part of the future enterprise due to their benefit in boosting productivity. Organizations should be
aware of the potential threats from shadow IT for which there is no single, complete solution
(e.g., EMM technologies do not completely address it) and should treat shadow IT seriously.

          Threats to Device Management Systems
The following threats are related to the use of EMM and other systems used to manage and
secure mobile devices. More information describing EMMs can be found Section 4.2.1.

3.2.1. Exploitation of Vulnerabilities within the Underlying EMM Platform
EMM infrastructure and subsequent components run on top of commodity hardware, firmware,
and software â€“ all of which are susceptible to publicly known software and hardware flaws.
Although systems are extensively customized, commodity hardware and well-known OSs should
be identified and understood. These systems should be properly configured, to leverage the
security configuration guides found in the NIST Checklists repository, and regularly patched to
remediate known vulnerabilities, such as those listed in the National Vulnerability Database [38].

3.2.2. EMM Administrator Credential Theft
Credential theft is a primary issue for employees, but the credentials of system administrators
who work with the EMM console can also be compromised. If attackers can log into the EMM as
an administrator, there could be a loss of sensitive information. EMMs store a variety of
sensitive information about employees at all levels of an organization, such as email addresses,
phone numbers, usernames, assigned resources, levels of access, and metadata from voice and
text communication. Additionally, EMM administrator credentials allow an attacker to
misconfigure and put mobile devices into an insecure state by modifying the policies enforced on
the devices. Finally, an attacker may also be able to perform a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on

  Organizations should have policies regarding the use of tethering. If an organization permits tethering, it should ensure that the
network connections involving tethering are strongly protected (e.g., communications encryption). If an organization prohibits
tethering, it should configure mobile devices to prevent tethering.
