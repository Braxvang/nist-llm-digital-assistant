the public internet or the internet itself, allowing enterprise-grade security between end users and
services.
The edge tier collects data from the edge nodes using the proximity network. The architectural
characteristics of this tier vary depending on the specific implementation (e.g., geographical
distribution, physical location, governance scope). It is a logical layer rather than a true physical
division. From a business perspective, the location of the edge depends on the business
objectives.

Edge computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure in which computing resources and
application services can be distributed along the communication path between the data source
and the cloud. It exists vertically within the full stack (i.e., from the device to the cloud) and
horizontally across IIoT subsystems. The edge is not merely a way to collect data for
transmission to the datacenter or cloud; it also processes, analyzes, and acts on data collected at
the edge and is, therefore, essential for optimizing industrial data at every aspect of an operation.
