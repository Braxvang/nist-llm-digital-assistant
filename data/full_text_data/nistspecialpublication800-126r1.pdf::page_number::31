4.7.1   Assigning CVE Identifiers to Rule Results

The <xccdf:rule-result> element provides data indicating the result of assessing a system using
the identified <xccdf:Rule> element. If the target <xccdf:Rule> identified by the
<xccdf:rule-result idref=""> attribute has one or more <ident> elements with the
―http://cve.mitre.org” or “CVE” system identifiers, then each <xccdf:ident> element SHALL also
appear within the <xccdf:rule-result> element.

For example:

<xccdf:rule-result idref="java-upgrade-278" weight="10.0">
   <xccdf:result>pass</xccdf:result>
   …
   <xccdf:ident system="http://cve.mitre.org">CVE-2006-0614</xccdf:ident>
   …
</xccdf:rule-result>

An <xccdf:rule-result> of ―pass‖ SHALL indicate that the target platform satisfies all the
conditions of the XCCDF rule and is unaffected by the vulnerability or exposure referenced by the CVE.

4.7.2   Assigning CCE Identifiers to Rule Results

The <xccdf:rule-result> element provides data indicating the result of assessing a system using
the identified <xccdf:Rule> element. If the target <xccdf:Rule> identified by the
<xccdf:rule-result> @idref attribute has one or more <xccdf:ident> elements with the
―http://cce.mitre.org” or “CCE” system identifiers, then each <xccdf:ident> element SHALL also
appear within the <rule-result> element. For example:

<xccdf:rule-result idref="minimum_password_length">
   <xccdf:result>pass</xccdf:result>
   …
   <xccdf:ident system="http://cce.mitre.org">CCE-2981-9</xccdf:ident>
   …
</xccdf:rule-result>

An <xccdf:rule-result> of ―pass‖ SHALL indicate that the target platform complies with the
configuration setting guidance expressed in the XCCDF rule.
