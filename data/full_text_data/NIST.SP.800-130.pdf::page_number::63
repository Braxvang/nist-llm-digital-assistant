6.7.1 The Access Control System (ACS)
The security of a CKMS depends on the proper sequence and execution of the key and
metadata management functions described in Section 6.4. The execution of these
functions may be driven by time, an event, an entity’s request, or some combination of
these options. An access control system is necessary to assure that key and metadata
management functions are only performed in response to requests (calls) by authorized
entities 16 and that all applicable constraints are met 17. For example, the recover key
function (see Section 6.4.17) may be restricted to the cryptographic officer role, and input
parameters may be verified to be within specified bounds and have specified formats.

The Access Control System works in conjunction with cryptographic modules to control
access to sensitive keys and metadata. An Access Control System (ACS) protects keys by
ensuring that only authorized entities are permitted to execute key and metadata
management functions. In addition, administrative access is typically logged and audited
for personal accountability. An ACS could be very simple; for example, any user
submitting an appropriate identifier and password might be authorized to perform any
key management function with any key, or the ACS may be much more complex.

Figure 10 illustrates the relationships between the calling entity, the Access Control
System, protected memory, and the cryptographic module. These devices may be
collocated, or they may be connected by a secure channel as shown in the figure. A
calling entity makes CKMS function calls that are serviced by the ACS. The ACS makes
use of protected memory and a cryptographic module to authenticate the calling entity. If
the authentication is successful, and the entity is properly authorized, then the function is
performed by making cryptographic service requests to the cryptographic module.
Finally, the response is then passed back to the calling entity.

Additional details of a sample key management function operation are shown in Figure
11. A function call consisting of the calling entity’s identifier, the calling entity’s
authenticator, the function name, and the key identifier is presented to the ACS. The
entity is first authenticated. Then the entity’s authorization to exercise the command is
verified by checking that the entity’s ID is in the access control list (located in the key
metadata) for the key and the function. If the ACS determines that the function should not
be permitted, then it returns a function-denied indicator. If, however, the function is
permitted for the authenticated entity using the key and metadata, then the ACS notifies
the function logic to perform the requested operation. The function logic may call upon
the cryptographic module to encrypt, decrypt, sign, verify or compute a MAC, as
necessary. Finally, the response to the function call is provided to the calling entity.



16
   The authorization of an entity is determined after the identity (or role) of the entity is
authenticated. The identity (or role) is verified as approved to execute the function.
17
   Constraints are limitations that are placed upon the input to and use of the function to help
ensure correct and secure operation.
