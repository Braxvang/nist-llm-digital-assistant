handling each report. A VDPO may choose to perform the prioritization prior to communicating
with its FCB member, or it may work with the FCB to determine priority. 12

3.2.5.2.                 Identification of Potentially Vulnerable Systems and Software
The first step to addressing a source vulnerability report is to identify the potentially vulnerable
technologies and the IT systems to which the report belongs. To enable this, each VDPO should
maintain a current list or database of contacts for each system within its purview. In some cases,
a VDPO that has received a source vulnerability report may need to coordinate with multiple
system owners (or their security officers) to determine which system or software is potentially
vulnerable. This step does not involve verifying the existence of the vulnerability but merely
identifying to which system the report belongs.
Many products are complex systems that include or are dependent on other products or
components. Therefore, the initial analysis may not result in a clear understanding of which
products are affected by the vulnerability. It may take multiple iterations of discovery and
research before a determination can be made that the vulnerability exists within government-
produced software or commercial/open-source software used by the Government.

3.2.5.3.                 Oversight and Support for the Verification of a Source Vulnerability
                         Report
The VDPO closest to the affected system should support the system owner (or their security
officer) in verifying the existence of the vulnerability. If the VDPO or the associated FCB
member has technical resources available to assist system owners in verifying vulnerabilities,
those resources may be utilized upon request by the system owner.
The investigation of a possible vulnerability often involves attempting to reproduce the
environment and behavior described by the reporter. The analysis can also include correlating
similar or related reports, assessing technical severity, and identifying other affected products.
The product, subcomponent, and methods of exploitation should be documented. If the initial
analysis shows that the vulnerability exists in the systemâ€™s product or service, further
investigation is needed, including a root cause analysis. The investigation may extend to related
products that utilize the same services or components to assess the extent of the impact, the
overall severity of the vulnerability, and the likelihood of exploitation. This information may
influence the prioritization of follow-up activities.
If a vulnerability is discovered in non-government-developed software that is used by a
government system, the source vulnerability report should be routed to the FCB for coordination
and handling. If it is determined that no vulnerability exists, the entity that originally received the
source vulnerability report (likely an FCB member but possibly the VDPO) should respond to
the reporter and explain the finding. The reporter may then provide additional details proving
that a vulnerability exists and trigger further investigation. If the source vulnerability report
cannot be verified, it should be forwarded to the FCB for finalization in their database and any
final communication with the reporter. Even if a source vulnerability report cannot be verified, it
is still important to appropriately communicate with the reporter.
