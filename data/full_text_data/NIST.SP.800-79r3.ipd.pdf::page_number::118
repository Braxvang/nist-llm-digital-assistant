       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                       Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                                              and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

           Identifier                          Issuer Control                              Applicability             Source

           MP(DC)-25     Invalidation of a derived PIV credential is accomplished by Non-PKI-AAL2,         [SP800-157], Sec. 2.4.2 –
            (NEW)        invalidating the reference to the associated authenticator in Non-PKI-AAL3        Non-PKI-Based Derived PIV
                         the PIV identity account so that the authenticator cannot be                      Credential Invalidation
                         used any longer.

                         Assessment
                         Determine that:
                              (i) The issuer has developed and follows compliant
                                  processes to terminate derived PIV credentials
                                  (review, observe).
                             (ii) Hardware-based authenticators (if used) are
                                  collected from the subscriber (observe).
           MP(DC)-26     If the activation secret is forgotten or the permitted number     Non-PKI-AAL2,   [SP800-157], Sec. 3.2.3 –
            (NEW)        of consecutive wrong attempts is reached, the activation          Non-PKI-AAL3    Activation Data
                         secret and attempt counter can be reset by centralized
                         management at the home agency. If centralized reset is
                         not available, the authenticator is reset and will require
                         rebinding to the PIV identity account.

                         Assessment
                         Determine that:
                            (i) The organization has a method to reset the
                                activation secret and the attempt counter (review,
                                observe, test).
                           (ii) If the activation secret and the attempt counter
                                cannot be reset, the authenticator is reset and
                                bound to the PIV identity account (observe, test).
