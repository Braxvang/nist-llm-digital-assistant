                                      Subtask                                         Role(s) Responsible
        Subtask 1.1: Confirm that the operations of the issuer is fully
                                                                                EIMO
        described and documented in an operations plan.
        Subtask 1.2: Confirm that processes performed are conducted in
        accordance with the policies and procedures specified in the
                                                                                EIMO, Issuing Facility Manager
        issuer’s operations plan and are documented in standard
        operating procedures.

                                      Subtask                                         Role(s) Responsible
        Subtask 2.1: Identify the SAO, DAO, PO, issuing facility
        managers, assessor, and other key personnel at the facility level
        who are performing functions, such as identity
        proofing/registration, card/token production, and                       EIMO
        activation/issuance (of the PIV Card or derived PIV credential).
        Maintenance personnel also need to be contacted to provide
        requested assessment information to the assessor.
        Subtask 2.2: Determine the authorization boundary for the issuer.       EIMO, DAO
        Subtask 2.3: Determine the resources and the time needed for the
        assessment of the issuer, and prepare a plan to execute the             EIMO, Assessor, DAO
        assessment.

                                      Subtask                                         Role(s) Responsible
        Subtask 3.1: Review the list of required issuer controls
        documented in the organization’s issuer operations plan, and            DAO, EIMO
        confirm that they have been implemented properly.
        Subtask 3.2: Analyze the operations plan to determine whether
        there are deficiencies in satisfying all of the policies, procedures,
        and other requirements in [FIPS201] that could result in a DATO
        being issued. After discussing the discovered deficiencies in the
        documentation and operations plan with the EIMO, the
        organization may still want to continue with the assessment if it       DAO, EIMO
        has determined that it can address all deficiencies within the time
        period of the current assessment. In this situation, the DAO either
        authorizes continuation of the assessment or terminates the
        assessment effort, depending on the evaluation of the issuer’s
        ability to address the deficiencies.
        Subtask 3.3: Verify that the operations plan is acceptable              DAO
