CHAPTER 5                                 Capital Planning and Investment Control


53. Exhibit 300s and Exhibit 53 are part of the agency’s budget submission to OMB
and provide an overview of an agency’s IT portfolio.
    To facilitate effective implementation of OMB capital planning and NIST security
requirements, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) offers a Select-Control-
Evaluate investment life-cycle model as a best practices approach to investment
management. While not compulsory, the framework articulates key activities for
managing IT investments throughout the life cycle. The three phases ensure that
investment management practices, including security, are disciplined and thorough
throughout each phase of the investment life cycle. Figure 5-1 illustrates the three
phases.
    The Select phase refers to activities involved with assessing and prioritizing
current and proposed IT projects based on mission needs and improvement
priorities, and then creates a portfolio of IT projects to address these needs and
priorities. Typical Select phase activities include screening new projects; analyzing
and ranking all projects based on benefit, cost, and risk criteria; selecting a portfolio
of projects; and establishing project review schedules.
   The Control phase refers to activities designated to monitor the investment
during its operational phase to determine whether the investment is within the cost
and schedule milestones established at the beginning of the investment life cycle.
Typical processes involved in the Control phase include using a set of performance
measures to monitor the developmental progress for each IT project to enable early
problem identification and resolution.
   The Evaluate phase refers to determining the efficacy of the investment,
answering the question, “Did the investment achieve the desired results and
performance goals identified during the Select phase?”
