 Phase 5: Operations—the service is operational, the service provider is fully installed, and constant
  assessment of the service level and performance is made. Section 4.5 discusses the importance of
  metrics in monitoring service level and performance.
 Phase 6: Closeout—the environment changes, the need for the service diminishes, or performance
  deficiencies are noted necessitating a replacement or termination of the IT security service. Section
  4.6 discusses the closeout and retirement of a service and/or service provider using the exit strategies
  developed in Phase 3.
4.1   Phase 1: Initiation

Figure 4-2 illustrates Phase 1, Initiation, of the IT security services life cycle. This phase has a single
step: an event sufficient to warrant assessing the current environment and identifying viable service

fall into one of the six issue areas listed in Section 3.4: strategy/mission, budgetary/funding,
technical/architectural, organizational, personnel, and policy/process. Table 4-1 shows sample trigger
events from each issue area.
