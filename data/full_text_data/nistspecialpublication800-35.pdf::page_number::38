                                                                                NIST Special Publication 800-35



 Establish Service Provider Service Level Targets—having identified and captured the relevant data
  in the baseline phase, and developed the direction of the desired future environment, the IT security
  managers should determine the performance targets they want the service provider to meet. These
  service levels will be further negotiated with the service provider and formally documented in the
  service agreement.
 Elicit Service Provider Proposals—the organization may identify potential service providers in
  numerous ways. If the service area has few providers or exists in a new market, the organization may
  solicit all of the service providers in the field for quotes and their service offering. The organization
  may also announce an RFP and direct interested parties to provide cost proposals. Regardless of the
  method, the organization should try to consider as many service providers as possible to encourage
  competition. The organization may want to ask service providers to answer some of the questions
  from section 3.5 of this guide.
 Assess the Proposals and Service Providers—the organization should evaluate the proposals, cost
  quotes, and/or management plans of the various service providers, and consider each provider
  carefully. Although the cost of the proposal may well be a leading factor, managers need to balance
  cost with value, reputation of the service provider, past performance of the service provider, and
  ability of the service provider to support the mission of the acquiring organization. The organization
  also needs to ensure that the methodologies, service levels, and costs are in-line with its expectations
  and that they are feasible. A proposal that far exceeds the competitors in cost and service level, for
  example, may warrant further investigation and skepticism.
 Select Service Provider—once the service providers are evaluated, the decision makers should select
  the service provider that most closely aligns with their needs, goals, and targets.
 Develop the Service Agreement—Further negotiation of price and service level may be necessary;
  however, once these are set, a service agreement should be developed. Depending on the service
  arrangement, this process may be more or less formal. Internal service arrangements, for example,
  may consist of an agreed-on process or reporting requirement or a MOA. External service
  arrangements should be documented with formal contracts. Regardless of the type of document used
  as a service agreement, the content of the agreement should be the same for both internal and external
  service providers.
Agreements, regardless of type, should specify the following:

 Explicit definitions of both the organization’s roles and responsibilities and the service provider’s
  roles and responsibilities (including level of clearance or background investigation needed for staff)
 Description of the service environment, including locations, facility security requirements, and
  policies, procedures, and standards; and, agreements and licenses
 Defined service levels and service level costs. The service level section of the service agreement may
  stipulate various service levels for different types of customers or price levels and it may stipulate
  different service levels for various periods of performance, e.g., year 1 may demand a higher service
  level than year 2 of the contract.
 Defined process regarding how the managers will assess the service provider’s compliance with the
  service level and due date targets, rules, and other terms of the agreement
 Specific remedies (e.g., financial, legal) for noncompliance or harm caused by the service provider
 Period of performance and/or deliverable due dates
