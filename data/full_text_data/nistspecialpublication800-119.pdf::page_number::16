                                                               GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


As a result of growing Internet use, IPv4’s address capacity could not meet the demand. In practice, the
supply of available IPv4 addresses has been limited since the early 1990s. Previously, an organization
could apply for and receive an order of magnitude more IPv4 addresses than it could actually justify.
However, as a result of regulatory advances, IP address allocations are now bound by strict policies that
include formal justification to a Regional Internet Registry (RIR). During the 1990s, address allocation
policies, along with address reuse and restriction technologies, were put into place to conserve IPv4
addresses.

Technologies widely adopted in response to the constrained supply of IPv4 addresses are network address
translation (NAT [RFC 3022]) and classless inter-domain routing (CIDR [RFC 4632]); both are discussed
in detail in Chapter 3. NAT essentially makes private IPv4 addresses (also known as non-routable
addresses) at least partially functional on the global Internet. Despite their adaptation to other uses,
private IPv4 addresses were designed for testing and other non-production purposes and never intended to
be usable on the Internet. Nevertheless, a NAT-capable router positioned at an organization’s boundary
has the ability to connect an entire network of privately addressed nodes within the organization to the
Internet via a single routable IP address.

This technology saves IPv4 address space because nodes bearing private addresses are essentially ―on‖
the Internet but do not have globally unique IP addresses. Nevertheless, this address conservation
technology can actually defeat certain aspects of the design intent of IPv4: network layer end-to-end
security, peer-to-peer (host-to-host connectivity), and interoperability. A host using private addressing
behind a NAT device cannot have a full peer-to-peer relationship with another host via the Internet or
backbone enterprise network using globally unique addressing. This is because NAT does not allow
communication sessions to be initiated from globally addressed nodes to the privately addressed nodes.

NAT traversal technologies are available to work around some of these barriers. They typically work in
one of two ways: (1) by maintaining stateful address lookup tables and redirecting inbound traffic to
appropriate private addresses; (2) by employing application layer gateways that listen for specific port
numbers and redirect traffic according to pre-configured parameters. Neither of these approaches to NAT
traversal lends itself to scalability or guarantees compatibility with all forms of NAT, not to mention the
efforts put into each of these work-arounds. In addition, neither approach lends itself to dynamic
configuration when, for example, hosts move or networks are renumbered.

Another limitation of IPv4 is that its design favored interoperability over security and did not contain
features that protected the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of communications. For example, IPv4
could not cryptographically protect data from eavesdropping or manipulation, and IPv4 did not provide a
method for endpoints to authenticate each other. Over time, the open nature of IPv4 was increasingly a
target of exploitation. The multi-path nature of the Internet, which was designed for high availability,
also allows multiple attack vectors for a variety of threats. As a response, new technologies were added
to IPv4 to provide needed security functionality. With IPv6, these features were designed into the new
protocol as mandatory components.



2.3   Major Features of the IPv6 Specification

IPv6 has many new or improved features that make it significantly different from its predecessor. These
features include extended address space, autoconfiguration, header structure, extension headers, IPsec,
mobility, quality of service, route aggregation, and efficient transmission. This section discusses these
features and compares specific aspects of IPv4 and IPv6 to help establish an understanding of the
protocols’ similarities and differences.
