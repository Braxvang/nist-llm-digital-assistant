A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



4.       Testing Strategy and Result Interpretation

Three topic areas will be addressed in this section: (1) strategies for the statistical analysis of a random
number generator, (2) the interpretation of empirical results using the NIST Statistical Test Suite, and (3)
general recommendations and guidelines.

4.1 Strategies for the Statistical Analysis of an RNG
In practice, there are many distinct strategies employed in the statistical analysis of a random number
generator. NIST has adopted the strategy outlined in Figure 1. Figure 1 provides an architectural
illustration of the five stages involved in the statistical testing of a random number generator.

Stage 1:        Selection of a Generator

Select a hardware or software based generator for evaluation. The generator should produce a binary
sequence of 0’s and 1’s of a given length n. Examples of pseudorandom generators (PRNG) that may be
selected include a DES-based PRNG from ANSI X9.17 (Appendix C), and two further methods that are
specified in FIPS 186 (Appendix 3) and are based on the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1) and the Data
Encryption Standard (DES).

Stage 2:        Binary Sequence Generation

For a fixed sequence of length n and the pre-selected generator, construct a set of m binary sequences and
save the sequences to a file7.

Stage 3:        Execute the Statistical Test Suite

Invoke the NIST Statistical Test Suite using the file produced in Stage 2 and the desired sequence length.
Select the statistical tests and relevant input parameters (e.g., block length) to be applied.

Stage 4:        Examine the P-values

An output file will be generated by the test suite with relevant intermediate values, such as test statistics,
and P-values for each statistical test. Based on these P-values, a conclusion regarding the quality of the
sequences can be made.

Stage 5:        Assessment: Pass/Fail Assignment

For each statistical test, a set of P-values (corresponding to the set of sequences) is produced. For a fixed
significance level, a certain percentage of P-values are expected to indicate failure. For example, if the
significance level is chosen to be 0.01 (i.e., α = 0.01), then about 1 % of the sequences are expected to
fail. A sequence passes a statistical test whenever the P-value ≥ α and fails otherwise. For each
statistical test, the proportion of sequences that pass is computed and analyzed accordingly. More in-
depth analysis should be performed using additional statistical procedures (see Section 4.2.2).
