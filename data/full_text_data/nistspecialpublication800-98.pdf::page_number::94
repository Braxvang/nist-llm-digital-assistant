GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



considerations. In 1973, the US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) (now the
Department of Health and Human Services) issued a report entitled Records, Computers, and the Rights
of Citizens. This report recommended that Congress enact legislation adopting a “Code of Fair
Information Practice” for automated personal data systems and many of its ideas were eventually
incorporated into the Privacy Act of 1974. 68 The HEW Fair Information Practices listed five main
privacy objectives:

 There must be no personal data record-keeping systems whose very existence is secret;
 There must be a way for an individual to find out what information is in his or her file and how the
  information is being used;
 There must be a way for an individual to correct information in his or her records;
 Any organization creating, maintaining, using, or disseminating records of personally identifiable
  information must assure the reliability of the data for its intended use and must take precautions to
  prevent misuse; and
 There must be a way for an individual to prevent personal information obtained for one purpose from
  being used for another purpose without his or her consent.
In 1980, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) adopted Guidelines on
the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data, which provide a framework for
privacy policy that has been referenced in US Federal guidance and internationally. 69 Table 6-1 lists the
OECD basic principles for privacy and data protection, their definitions, and discusses how each might be
addressed in the context of an RFID system.
