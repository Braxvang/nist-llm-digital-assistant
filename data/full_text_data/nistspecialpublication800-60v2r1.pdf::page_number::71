C.2.8.4 Central Property Management Information Type

Central Property Management involves most of the operations of the General Services
Administration. The following recommended provisional security categorization of central
property management information is particularly subject to change where critical infrastructure
elements or key national assets are involved:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low 15 ), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low 16 )}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of central property
management information on the ability of the General Services Administration to acquire,
provide, and centrally administer offices buildings, fleets, machinery, and other capital assets and
consumable supplies used by the Federal government. The consequences of unauthorized
disclosure of most central property management information are likely to have only a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of
information associated with very large procurements can result in fraud, waste, abuse, and/or
legal proceedings that can have a serious to severe effect on Federal government assets and
operations. Also, information associated with acquisition, maintenance, administration, and
operation of many Federal government office buildings, transportation fleets, and operational
facilities can be of material use to criminals seeking to gain access to Federal facilities to
facilitate or perpetrate fraud, theft, or some other criminal enterprise. In this case, unauthorized
disclosure of information can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets,
or individuals. The consequent confidentiality impact would be at least moderate.

Information associated with maintenance, administration, and operation of other Federal
government facilities can be of material use to terrorists seeking to penetrate and/or commandeer
such facilities as part of operations intended to harm critical infrastructures, key national assets,
or people. Examples of more potentially damaging information include architectural,
maintenance and administrative information that might permit either covert pedestrian or
unimpeded vehicular access to government buildings (e.g., Congressional office buildings, FBI
Headquarters, the National Archives, Smithsonian Institution buildings, dams, nuclear power
plants, etc.). In such cases, the confidentiality impact level may be high.

[Some information is classified as national security and is outside the scope of this guideline.]
Anticipated or realized unauthorized disclosure of one agencyâ€™s central property management
information by GSA could result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within
the central property management infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations
tasked with acquiring and managing government facilities and supplies.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for central property management information is low.

15
    Impact level is usually high where safety of major critical infrastructure components or key national assets is at
    stake.
16
   Impact level is usually moderate to high in emergency situations where time-critical processes affecting human
    safety or major assets are involved.
