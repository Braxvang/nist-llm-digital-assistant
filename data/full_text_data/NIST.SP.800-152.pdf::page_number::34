                             Figure 3: An FCKMS Network

Figure 3 shows that a module may function in different FCKMSs and support different
FCKMS Security Policies. For example, Federal Entity 1 has a module that can support
either a blue FCKMS Security Policy or a red FCKMS Security Policy. Such FCKMS
modules must be capable of maintaining the separation of the keys and metadata of each
FCKMS that it supports. Federal Entity 3 cannot exchange keys and metadata with Federal
Entity 2 or Federal Entity 4 unless the red and blue FCKMS Security Policies are determined
to be equivalent or compatible (see Section 4.11.3) by the red and blue system authorities.

4.5   Cryptographic Module Security Policy

A cryptographic module security policy is a statement of the rules that the cryptographic
module will follow when performing cryptographic functions (e.g., key generation and
signature verification). This policy specifies the mechanisms to be used to maintain the
                                             24
