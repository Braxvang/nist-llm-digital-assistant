NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                         Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


Without these limits, it becomes
possible, in principle, for an attacker to
observe enough outputs from
CTR_DRBG to distinguish its outputs
from ideal random bits.
The CTR_ DRBG may be
implemented to use the block cipher
derivation function specified in Section
10.3.2 during instantiation and
reseeding. However, the DRBG
mechanism is specified to allow an
implementation tradeoff with respect to
the use of this derivation function. The
use of the derivation function is
optional if either an approved RBG or
an entropy source provides full entropy
output when entropy input is requested
by the DRBG mechanism. Otherwise,
the derivation function shall be used.
Table 3 provides the lengths required
for the entropy_input,
personalization_string and
additional_input for each case.
When using TDEA as the selected
block cipher algorithm, the keys shall
be handled as 64-bit blocks containing
56 bits of key and 8 bits of parity as
specified for the TDEA engine
specified in [SP 800-67].
10.2.1.1      CTR_DRBG Internal
           State

The internal state for the CTR_DRBG
consists of:
    1. The working_state:
        a. The value V of blocklen                        Figure 12: CTR-DRBG
           bits, which is updated each
           time another blocklen bits of output are produced.
        b. The keylen-bit Key, which is updated whenever a predetermined number of output
           blocks are generated.
        c. A counter (reseed_counter) that indicates the number of requests for pseudorandom
           bits since instantiation or reseeding.
