7. Performance Measures
    A performance measures program provides numerous organizational and financial
benefits to federal agencies. Agencies can develop information security metrics that
measure the effectiveness of their security program, and provide data to be analyzed
and used by program managers and system owners to isolate problems, justify
investment requests, and target funds specifically to the areas in need of
improvement. By using metrics to target security investments, agencies can get the
best value from available resources. The typical information performance
management program consists of four interdependent components: senior
management support, security policies and procedures, quantifiable performance
metrics, and analyses.
    Strong senior management support establishes a focus on security within the
highest levels of the organization. Without a solid foundation (e.g., proactive support
of those persons in positions that control information resources), the effectiveness of
the security metrics program can fail when pressured by politics and budget
limitations. The second component of an effective security metrics program is
practical security policies and procedures backed by the authority necessary to
enforce compliance. Metrics are not easily obtainable in the absence of policies and
procedures. The third component is developing and establishing quantifiable
performance metrics that are designed to capture and provide meaningful
performance data. To provide meaningful data, quantifiable security metrics must be
based on information security performance goals and objectives, and be easily
obtainable, repeatable, relevant, useful, and measurable. Finally, the security
metrics program itself must emphasize consistent, periodic analysis of the metrics
data. The results of this analysis are used to apply lessons learned, improve the
effectiveness of existing security controls, and plan future controls to meet new
security requirements as they occur. Accurate data collection must be a priority with
stakeholders and users if the collected data is to be meaningful to the management
and improvement of the overall security program.
    A number of existing laws, rules, and regulations cite information technology (IT)
performance measurement in general and information security performance
measurement in particular, as requirements. These laws include the Clinger-Cohen
Act, Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), Government Paperwork
Elimination Act (GPEA), and the Federal Information Security Management Act
(FISMA).
    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP)
800-55, Security Metrics Guide for Information Technology Systems, provides
guidance on how an organization, by using metrics, identifies the adequacy of in-
place security controls, policies, and procedures. It provides an approach to help
management decide where to invest in additional security protection resources or
how to identify and evaluate nonproductive controls. It explains the metrics
development and implementation process and how it can also be used to adequately
justify security control investments. The results of an effective metrics program can
provide useful data for directing the allocation of information security resources and
should simplify the preparation of performance-related reports.
