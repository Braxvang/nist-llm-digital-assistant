                                                       GUIDE TO STORAGE ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES FOR END USER DEVICES



intended to imply that other solutions are not possible or that these solutions are preferable to others.
Each use case also omits security controls that are universal to the solutions, such as user awareness and
general endpoint security (e.g., patching, antivirus software, access control, physical security of endpoint
devices), as well as key management (for example, generating keys and securely deploying them to
devices).

3.3.1     Use Case 1: Sharing a Laptop

Three users share a laptop. One of the users uses the laptop to access data that the other two users are not
authorized to access. For this data, the major threats that the organization needs to mitigate are an insider
threat from the other two users, and unauthorized disclosure of data from the loss or theft of the laptop.
Possible solutions include the following:

 Implement volume, virtual disk, or file/folder encryption on the laptop. Protect the first user’s data
  using the storage encryption software, with the authentication and cryptographic keys implemented so
  that only the first user, and not the other two users, can access the protected data. If there is concern
  about the first user always remembering where to save files, configure the laptop’s access control so
  that the first user’s data is all saved to a particular location, and protect that location with the storage
  encryption software.

 Store the data on external media, such as a flash drive or external hard drive, and use volume, virtual
  disk, or file/folder encryption to protect the media. The user needs to protect physical access to the
  media and to remember to save new or modified data to the media.

 Store the data on a remote system and give the first user access to the data through secured means
  (e.g., VPN). Provide the data in such a way that it is not saved to the laptop (e.g., the user views and
  modifies the remote data through a Web interface).

3.3.2     Use Case 2: Transferring Files Between Computers

A user edits documents using both a desktop PC at the organization’s office and a personally owned
computer at home. The user transfers documents between the computers on a daily basis using a USB
flash drive. The two computers run different types of OSs. For the documents, the major threat that the
organization needs to mitigate is unauthorized disclosure of data from loss or theft of the user’s flash
drive. Possible solutions include the following:

 Acquire and use a flash drive with self-contained storage encryption capabilities, such as encryption
  software and secure key storage.

 Acquire a volume, virtual disk, or file/folder encryption solution that will work on both PCs, and
  deploy it. Encrypt the documents using the solution and store the encrypted data on a flash drive.

3.3.3     Use Case 3: Sharing Data with Contractor

A user wants to provide a contractor with copies of large data sets on a daily basis because the contractor
has no direct access to the system containing the data. The user will copy the data onto removable media
for the contractor. 27 For this data, the major threat that the organization needs to mitigate is unauthorized
disclosure of data from loss or theft of the removable media. Possible solutions include the following:

     Another use case, with similar possible solutions, is a user that needs to protect backups of a PC from loss or theft.
