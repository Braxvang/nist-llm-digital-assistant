access control, such as specifying for which sensors or agents particular users can monitor or analyze data
or generate reports or particular administrators can alter configurations. This allows a large IDPS
deployment to be divided into logical units for operational purposes.

Some IDPS products also offer command-line interfaces (CLI). Unlike GUI consoles, which are typically
used for remote management of sensors or agents and management servers, CLIs are typically used for
local management of those components. Sometimes a CLI can be reached remotely through an encrypted
connection established through secure shell (SSH) or other means. Consoles are typically much easier to
use than CLIs, and CLIs often provide only some of the functionality that consoles provide.

The rest of this section provides additional information on the operation and maintenance of IDPSs.
Section 3.3.2.1 describes how users can make effective use of consoles in their daily IDPS tasks. Section
3.3.2.2 provides more information on ongoing maintenance of the technologies, with Section 3.3.2.3
focusing specifically on acquiring and applying updates.

3.3.2.1 Typical Use

Most IDPS consoles offer many features to assist users in their daily tasks. For example, most consoles
offer drill-down capabilities, which means that when a user examines an alert, more details and
information are available in layers. 12 This allows users to see basic information on many alerts at once,
and to show additional information on particular events of interest as needed. Some products allow users
to see extensive supporting information, such as packet captures (both raw and parsed with a protocol
analyzer) and related alerts (e.g., other alerts for the same source or destination), as well as documentation
on the alert itself. Generally, the more data that the IDPS records, the easier it is for analysts to determine
what has happened. Some consoles also offer incident response features, such as turning an alert into an
incident case and providing workflow mechanisms that allow users to document additional information
on the alert and route the alert to particular users or groups of users for further review.

Most consoles also offer various reporting functions. For example, administrators or users might be able
to use the console to have certain reports run at set times and to e-mail or transfer the reports to the
appropriate users or hosts. Many consoles also allow users to generate reports as needed (including
reports for specific incidents) and to customize reports as needed. If an IDPS product stores its logs in a
database or in an easily parsed file format (e.g., comma-separated values in a text file), database queries
or scripts can also be used to generate custom reports, particularly if the console does not offer
sufficiently flexible report customization.

3.3.2.2 Ongoing Solution Maintenance

Administrators should maintain IDPSs on an ongoing basis. This should include the following:

 Monitoring the IDPS components themselves for operational and security issues
 Periodically verifying that the IDPS is functioning properly (e.g., processing events, alerting
  appropriately on suspicious activity) 13

     A detailed discussion of the analysis of IDPS data is outside the scope of this document. For more information, see NIST
     SP 800-86, Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques into Incident Response, which is available at
     http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/. NIST SP 800-86 discusses the analysis of data from IDPSs and other sources of
     security event information.
13
     One way of verifying component functionality is to perform periodic testing of the IDPS, either in a test environment or a
     production environment. Performing such testing in a production environment can inadvertently disrupt operations. See
     Section 9 for additional information on IDPS testing.
