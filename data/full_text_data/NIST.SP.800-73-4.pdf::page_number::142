Special Publication 800-73-4                                                       Part 3: PIV Client Application
Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification                                            Programming Interface

When used as an argument to the pivConnect entry point on the PIV client API described in this section,
an '8x' series data object with zero length together with a '9x' series data object requests the return of all
available card readers of the described type on the described node. Thus, '7F 21 04 81 00 90 00' would
request a list of all available PC/SC card readers on the host on which the client application was running.

                       CDLength                    Length of the card description parameter.

                       cardHandle                  The returned opaque identifier of a communication
                                                   channel to a particular ICC and hence of the card itself.
                                                   cardHandle is used in all other entry points on the PIV
                                                   client API to identify to which card the functionality of
                                                   the entry point is to be applied.

Return Codes:          PIV_OK
                       PIV_CONNECTION_DESCRIPTION_MALFORMED
                       PIV_CONNECTION_FAILURE
                       PIV_CONNECTION_LOCKED

3.1.3    pivDisconnect

Purpose:               Disconnect the PIV API from the PIV Card Application and the ICC containing the
                       PIV Card Application.

Prototype:             status_word pivDisconnect(
                          IN handle            cardHandle
                       );

Parameters:            cardHandle                  Opaque identifier of the card to be acted upon as
                                                   returned by pivConnect. The value of cardHandle is
                                                   undefined upon return from pivDisconnect.

Return Codes:          PIV_OK
                       PIV_INVALID_CARD_HANDLE
                       PIV_CARD_READER_ERROR

If secure messaging has been established, then the PIV Middleware shall zeroize the secure messaging
session keys.

3.2     Entry Points for Data Access

3.2.1    pivSelectCardApplication

Purpose:               Set the PIV Card Application as the currently selected card application and establish
                       the PIV Card Applicationâ€™s security state.

Prototype:             status_word pivSelectCardApplication(
                          IN handle            cardHandle,
                          IN sequence of byte applicationAID,
                          IN LONG              aidLength,
                          OUT sequence of byte applicationProperties,
                          INOUT LONG           APLength
                       );
