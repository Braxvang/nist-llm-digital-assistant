GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



2.1.2   Operating Systems

Operating systems (OS) for servers, workstations, and networking devices (e.g., routers, switches) usually
log a variety of information related to security. The most common types of security-related OS data are
as follows:

     System Events. System events are operational actions performed by OS components, such as
      shutting down the system or starting a service. Typically, failed events and the most significant
      successful events are logged, but many OSs permit administrators to specify which types of
      events will be logged. The details logged for each event also vary widely; each event is usually
      timestamped, and other supporting information could include event, status, and error codes;
      service name; and user or system account associated with an event.
     Audit Records. Audit records contain security event information such as successful and failed
      authentication attempts, file accesses, security policy changes, account changes (e.g., account
      creation and deletion, account privilege assignment), and use of privileges. OSs typically permit
      system administrators to specify which types of events should be audited and whether successful
      and/or failed attempts to perform certain actions should be logged.
OS logs might also contain information from security software and other applications running on the
system. Section 2.1.3 provides more information on application log data.

OS logs are most beneficial for identifying or investigating suspicious activity involving a particular host.
After suspicious activity is identified by security software, OS logs are often consulted to get more
information on the activity. For example, a network security device might detect an attack against a
particular host; that host’s OS logs might indicate if a user was logged into the host at the time of the
attack and if the attack was successful. Many OS logs are created in syslog format; Section 3.3 discusses
syslog in detail and provides examples of syslog log entries. Other OS logs, such as those on Windows
systems, are stored in proprietary formats. Figure 2-2 gives an example of log data exported from a
Windows security log.

2.1.3   Applications

Operating systems and security software provide the foundation and protection for applications, which are
used to store, access, and manipulate the data used for the organization’s business processes. Most
organizations rely on a variety of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) applications, such as e-mail servers
and clients, Web servers and browsers, file servers and file sharing clients, and database servers and
clients. Many organizations also use various COTS or government off-the-shelf (GOTS) business
