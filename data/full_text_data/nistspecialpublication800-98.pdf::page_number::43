part of an asset management system. One difference between relatively simple asset management
systems and tracking systems is that an asset management system can detect the presence of an item with
readers at a single location. In contrast, tracking systems require more than one reader, as well as a
network, so that a central system can aggregate and correlate information received from each of the
readers.

At transportation hubs (such as ports or train stations), readers are placed throughout the facility. The
security staff can track the location of its employees wearing RFID-equipped identification badges as they
pass through doors or gates. In addition to restricting access to specific areas of the facility, these RFID-
enabled identification badges help the security department locate specific staff members during
emergency situations and to monitor building evacuations during fire alarms.

Tracking applications can also be used to measure sports performance. Some companies sell systems to
track athletes during races. This application requires each racer to wear a unique tag that is registered
with the tracking system. Such systems can be used for any mass start event, including bicycling,
running, or triathlons. Different events may require the athletes to wear the tags in a certain way to be
detected by the system. For example, runners may be required to put the tag in one of their shoes or
cyclists may be required to mount the tag on their bicycles.

3.1.3    Authenticity Verification

In authenticity verification applications, the tag provides evidence of the source of a tagged item.
Authenticity verification often is incorporated into a tracking application. The originating source of the
tag creates a record of the initialization transaction, either on the tag or in an enterprise subsystem
database. When readers subsequently query the tag, they can determine if it originated from a proper
source. For authenticity verification systems to provide appropriate levels of assurance, they typically
need to incorporate cryptography and mechanisms to prevent cloning. 24 Digital signatures use
cryptography to provide the property of non-repudiation, which means the signatory cannot later deny
creating the signature. 25 Authenticity verification applications can use digital signatures to establish
evidence of authenticity and enable later verification. The pharmaceutical industry is using RFID for
authenticity verification to reduce the prevalence of counterfeit drugs.

3.1.4    Matching

In a matching application, two tagged items are matched with each other and a signal (e.g., a light or
tone) is triggered if one of the items is later matched with an incorrect tagged item. The most common
matching application today occurs in hospitals and involves placing bracelets with tags on mothers and
their newborn babies. If a new mother is accidentally given another woman’s infant, the system issues an
alert. Similar technology allows day care centers to match children to parents or guardians, and hospital
patients to their medicines and designated visitors. In the future, RFID tags might match airline
passengers with their checked luggage to prevent theft and inadvertent mistakes.

3.1.5    Process Control

Process control applications allow business processes to use information associated with a tag (or the
item attached to the tag) to take a customized action. A common process control application is the
facilitation of product design variations in manufacturing processes. For example, a tag might be affixed
to the frame of a product on an assembly line in a manufacturing plant. The tag’s identifier would be
