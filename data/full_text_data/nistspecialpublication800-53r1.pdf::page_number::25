3.3 SELECTING AND TAILORING THE INITIAL BASELINE
Once the overall impact level of the information system is determined, an initial set of security
controls can be selected from the corresponding low, moderate, or high baselines listed in
Appendix D. Organizations have the flexibility to tailor the security control baselines in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this publication. Tailoring activities
include: (i) the application of appropriate scoping guidance to the initial baseline; (ii) the
specification of compensating security controls, if needed; and (iii) the specification of
organization-defined parameters in the security controls, where allowed. To achieve a cost-
effective, risk-based approach to providing adequate information security organization-wide,
security control baseline tailoring activities should be coordinated with and approved by
appropriate organizational officials (e.g., chief information officers, senior agency information
security officers, authorizing officials, or authorizing officials’ designated representatives).
Tailoring decisions should be documented in the security plan for the information system. 38

Scoping Guidance
Scoping guidance provides organizations with specific terms and conditions on the applicability
and implementation of individual security controls in the security control baselines. There are
several considerations, described below, that can potentially impact how the baseline security
controls are applied by the organization:
Common security control-related considerations—
•    Security controls designated by the organization as common controls are, in most cases,
     managed by an organizational entity other than the information system owner.
     Organizational decisions on which security controls are viewed as common controls may
     greatly affect the responsibilities of individual information system owners with regard to the
     implementation of controls in a particular baseline. Every control in a baseline must be fully
     addressed either by the organization or the information system owner.

Operational/environmental-related considerations—
•    Security controls that are dependent on the nature of the operational environment are
     applicable only if the information system is employed in an environment necessitating the
     controls. For example, certain physical security controls may not be applicable to space-
     based information systems, and temperature and humidity controls may not be applicable to
     remote sensors that exist outside of the indoor facilities that contain information systems.

Physical Infrastructure-related considerations—
•    Security controls that refer to organizational facilities (e.g., physical controls such as locks
     and guards, environmental controls for temperature, humidity, lighting, fire, and power) are
     applicable only to those sections of the facilities that directly provide protection to, support
     for, or are related to the information system (including its information technology assets such
     as electronic mail or web servers, server farms, data centers, networking nodes, boundary
     protection devices, and communications equipment).

38
   It is important for organizations to document the decisions taken during the security control baseline tailoring
process, providing a sound rationale for those decisions whenever possible. This documentation is essential when
examining the overall security considerations for information systems with respect to potential mission and/or business
case impact.
