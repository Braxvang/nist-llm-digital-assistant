312          Scope
313   The scope of this guide covers the steps that an organization should take to create a strategy and
314   program plan, including the design, development, implementation, and maintenance of a CPLP
315   as part of an enterprise cybersecurity and privacy program. The scope includes identifying the
316   learning needs for the personnel of an organization, from federal and contract employees to
317   supervisors, functional managers, and executive-level managers. As noted previously, CPLPs are
318   inclusive of various other programs, including awareness programs, social engineering
319   campaigns, new hire training, annual training, technical training and requirements for role-based
320   training, and other relevant learning activities. These learning activities may be conducted within
321   the organization or necessitate access to external resources, such as courses, certificates, and
322   advanced programs.

323          The CPLP Life Cycle
324   The CPLP must have an actively managed plan, which requires attention and adjustment over
325   time, throughout the Life Cycle. Learning Program Managers should carefully and thoughtfully
326   outline, discuss, review, and document the CPLP’s goals and available options. When the owners
327   of the organization’s CPLP adopt an effective strategy and develop a proper planning approach
328   with measurement and feedback through the year, the entire organization remains connected to
329   the CPLP objectives. Fig. 1 shows the various phases of building and managing a Learning
330   Program: Plan and Strategy, Analysis and Design, Development and Implementation,
331   Assessment and Improvement.
