Three general types of keys are used in OTAR: a Key-Wrapping Key (KWK)33, a
Traffic-Encryption Key (TEK) and a key to be used for the computation of a Message
Authentication Code (MAC).

7.2 Security and Compliance Issues
7.2.1 Cryptographic Algorithms
Although the protocol has been designed to allow the use of any block cipher algorithm
to apply the cryptographic protection, only three block cipher algorithms have been
included in the specification: DES, TDEA and AES.

Approval for DES has been withdrawn because DES no longer provides the security that
is needed to protect Federal Government information.

TDEA, as specified in [SP 800-67], uses three DES encryption/decryption operations
with a “key bundle” consisting of three separate DES keys. Two versions of TDEA have
been included in the OTAR specification: a one-key version, whereby all three keys are
the same for compatibility with DES, and a three-key version (3-TDEA), whereby the
three keys are different. Since DES is no longer considered secure, the one-key version of
the TDEA is also no longer considered secure and shall not be used.


7.2.2 Message Authentication and Cryptoperiods
A Message Authentication Code (MAC) is used to authenticate and protect the integrity
of many of the KMMs as specified in OTAR1, using the CBC-MAC mode of operation.
The security of a MAC depends, in part, on the block size of the MAC algorithm. AES
has a larger block size than 3-TDEA, and so the security of AES CBC-MAC is better
than 3-TDEA CBC-MAC. The OTAR documentation provides no guidance on the length
of cryptoperiods (i.e., the number of messages or the length of time that a key may be
used before it must be changed).

For AES, the number of messages that can be authenticated using a given key is, in
practice, not an issue. However, AES keys shall be periodically updated because of other
threats to the system, e.g., lost radios or an undetected compromise of a key.

When using 3-TDEA, no more than 1 000 000 messages shall be sent using a given key
because of threats to the security of the algorithm. However, like AES, it may be prudent
to update the 3-TDEA keys more frequently because of other threats to the system.


7.2.3 Key Usage
Part 1 of this Recommendation states that keys shall be used for only one purpose.34
However, OTAR1 states that the key used to generate a MAC must be either a key

33
     A Key Wrapping Key may also be referred to as a Key Encryption Key (KEK).
34
     There is an allowed exception to this rule, but it does not apply to OTAR [SP 800-57 Part 1, Sec. 5.2]).
