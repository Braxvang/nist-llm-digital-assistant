SA-8      SECURITY ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES

          Control: The organization designs and implements the information system using security
          engineering principles.
          Supplemental Guidance: NIST Special Publication 800-27 provides guidance on engineering
          principles for information system security. The application of security engineering principles is
          primarily targeted at new development information systems or systems undergoing major
          upgrades and is integrated into the system development life cycle. For legacy information
          systems, the organization applies security engineering principles to system upgrades and
          modifications, to the extent feasible, given the current state of the hardware, software, and
          firmware components within the system.
          Control Enhancements: None.

SA-9      EXTERNAL INFORMATION SYSTEM SERVICES

          Control: The organization: (i) requires that providers of external information system services
          employ adequate security controls in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders,
          directives, policies, regulations, standards, guidance, and established service-level agreements; and
          (ii) monitors security control compliance.
          Supplemental Guidance: An external information system service is a service that is implemented
          outside of the accreditation boundary of the organizational information system (i.e., a service that
          is used by, but not a part of, the organizational information system). Relationships with external
          service providers are established in a variety of ways, for example, through joint ventures,
          business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements (i.e., through contracts, interagency agreements,
          lines of business arrangements), licensing agreements, and/or supply chain exchanges. Ultimately,
          the responsibility for adequately mitigating risks to the organizationâ€™s operations and assets, and to
          individuals, arising from the use of external information system services remains with the
          authorizing official. Authorizing officials must require that an appropriate chain of trust be
          established with external service providers when dealing with the many issues associated with
          information system security. For services external to the organization, a chain of trust requires
          that the organization establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating service
          provider in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection
          for the services rendered to the organization. Where a sufficient level of trust cannot be
          established in the external services and/or service providers, the organization employs
          compensating security controls or accepts the greater degree of risk to its operations and assets, or
          to individuals. The external information system services documentation includes government,
          service provider, and end user security roles and responsibilities, and any service-level
          agreements. Service-level agreements define the expectations of performance for each required
          security control, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements
          for any identified instance of non-compliance. NIST Special Publication 800-35 provides
          guidance on information technology security services. NIST Special Publication 800-64 provides
          guidance on the security considerations in the system development life cycle.
          Control Enhancements: None.
