3.4     Establishing Priorities

Once the security awareness and training strategy and plan have been finalized, an implementation
schedule must be established. If this needs to occur in phases (e.g., due to budget constraints and resource
availability), it is important to decide the factors to be used in determining which initiative to schedule
first and in what sequence. Key factors to consider are:

     Availability of Material/Resources—If awareness and training material and necessary resources are
      readily available, key initiatives in the plan can be scheduled early. However, if course material must
      be developed and/or instructors must be identified and scheduled, these requirements should be
      considered in setting priorities.
     Role and Organizational Impact—It is very common to address priority in terms of organizational
      role and risk. Broad-based awareness initiatives that address the enterprise wide mandate may
      receive high priority because the rules of good security practices can be delivered to the workforce
      quickly. Also, it is common to look at high trust/high impact positions (e.g., IT security program
      managers, security officers, system administrators, and security administrators whose positions in the
      organization have been determined to have a higher sensitivity) and ensure that they receive high
      priority in the rollout strategy. These types of positions are typically commensurate with the type of
      access (and to what system) these users possess.
     State of Current Compliance – This involves looking at major gaps in the awareness and training
      program (e.g., gap analysis) and targeting deficient areas for early rollout.
     Critical Project Dependencies – If there are projects dependent upon a segment of security training
      in order to prepare the necessary requirements for the system involved (e.g., new operating system,

      This element of the awareness and training plan should document how the organization will track who has been trained and
      who still requires training, how attendees can provide comments on the appropriateness of material, and how the agency will
      determine if the attendee benefits from exposure to the awareness or training material.
13
      At a minimum, the entire workforce should be exposed to awareness material annually. A continuous awareness program,
      using various methods of delivery throughout the year, can be very effective. Security training for groups of users with
      significant security responsibility (e.g., system and network administrators, managers, security officers) should be
      incorporated into ongoing functional training as needed.
