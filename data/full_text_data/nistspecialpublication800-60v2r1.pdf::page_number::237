licensing information could be serious. In such cases, the confidentiality impact level might be
moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most permits and licensing information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of permits and licensing information
depends primarily on the criticality of the regulated activity with respect to protection of
government assets, and safety of individuals. Typically, the effects of modification or deletion of
permits and licensing information are limited with respect to agency missions or assets.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
permits and licensing information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to permits and licensing information. The
nature of permits and licensing processes is tolerant of reasonable delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
permits and licensing information is low.

D.22.1 Manufacturing Information Type

Manufacturing involves all programs and activities in which the Federal Government produces
both marketable and non-marketable goods. The following provisional security categorization is
recommended for the manufacturing information type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of manufacturing
information on the abilities of responsible agencies to produce both marketable and non-
marketable goods. In a few cases, unauthorized disclosure of details of the products or
manufacturing processes can give adversaries opportunities (e.g., terrorism, industrial
espionage). However, in most cases, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of
