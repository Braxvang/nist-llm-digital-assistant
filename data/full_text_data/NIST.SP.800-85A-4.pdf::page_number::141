                                                                 INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

C.3         Card Commands for Credential Initialization and Administration

C.3.1        PUT DATA Command

C.3.1.1        Contact Interface
 Purpose              Validates that the PUT DATA command exhibits the appropriate
                      behavior under the following conditions:
                      1. Without the security condition is satisfied.
                      2. After the security condition is satisfied.
 Reference(s)         1. SP 800-73-4, Part 2, Section 3.3.1
                      2. AS05.01, AS05.02, AS05.37
 Precondition(s)      1. The IUT is inserted into the contact reader.
                      2. There exists a valid PC/SC connection between the test system
                          and the contact reader.
                      3. The PIV Card Application is the currently selected application on
                          the card.
                      4. The mutual authentication of PIV Card Application and the Test
                          Toolkit Application has not been performed.
 Test Scenario        1. Send PUT DATA card command with
                           • CLA is set to:
                              • '00' if command chaining is not needed or
                              • '10' if command chaining is used. (The last chain
                                 of the command sets CLA to '00')
                           • Data field in the command is to include the tag of the
                              Card Capability Container data object
                           • Data field in the command is to include the data that
                              will replace the Card Capability Container
                      2.   Repeat step 1 with
                           • Data field in the command is to include the tag of the
                              CHUID data object
                           • Data field in the command is to include the data
                              content that will replace the CHUID
                      3.   Repeat step 1 with
                           • Data field in the command is to include the tag of the
                              X.509 Certificate for PIV Authentication data object
                           • Data field in the command is to include data content
                              that will replace the X.509 Certificate for PIV
                              Authentication
                      4.   Repeat step 1 with
                           • Data field in the command is to include the tag of the
                              Cardholder Fingerprints data object
                           • Data field in the command is to include data content
                              that will replace the Cardholder Fingerprints
                      5.   If the card supports the Printed Information data object,
                           repeat step 1 with
                           • CLA='00'
                           • Data field in the command is to include the tag of the
                              Printed Information data object
