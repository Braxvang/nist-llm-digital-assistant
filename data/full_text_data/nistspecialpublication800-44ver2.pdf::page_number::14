                                                                               GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



1.      Introduction

1.1     Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency
Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, although attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
the Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2     Purpose and Scope

The purpose of the Guidelines on Securing Public Web Servers is to recommend security practices for
designing, implementing, and operating publicly accessible Web servers, including related network
infrastructure issues. Some Federal organizations might need to go beyond these recommendations or
adapt them in other ways to meet their unique requirements. While intended as recommendations for
Federal departments and agencies, it may be used in the private sector on a voluntary basis.

This document may be used by organizations interested in enhancing security on existing and future Web
server systems to reduce the number and frequency of Web-related security incidents. This document
presents generic principles that apply to all systems.

This guideline does not cover the following aspects relating to securing a Web server:

 Securing other types of network servers

 Firewalls and routers used to protect Web servers beyond a basic discussion in Section 8

 Security considerations related to Web client (browser) software 4

 Special considerations for high-traffic Web sites with multiple hosts 5

 Securing back-end servers that may support the Web server (e.g., database servers, file servers)

      For more information on securing Web browsers, see NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-46, Security for Telecommuting
      and Broadband Communications (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/).

      Although this document does not address the specific security concerns that arise from high-traffic multiple-server Web
      farms, much of what is covered will apply to these types of installations.
