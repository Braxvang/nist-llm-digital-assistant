7.      Host-Based IDPS

A host-based IDPS monitors the characteristics of a single host and the events occurring within that host
for suspicious activity. Examples of the types of characteristics a host-based IDPS might monitor are
wired and wireless network traffic (only for that host), system logs, running processes, file access and
modification, and system and application configuration changes. This section provides a detailed
discussion of host-based IDPS technologies. First, it covers the major components of the technologies
and explains the architectures typically used for deploying the components. It also examines the security
capabilities of the technologies in depth, including the methodologies they use to identify suspicious
activity. The rest of the section discusses the management capabilities of the technologies, including
recommendations for implementation and operation.

7.1     Components and Architecture

This section describes the major components of typical host-based IDPSs and illustrates the most
common network architectures for these components. It also provides recommendations for selecting
which hosts should use host-based IDPSs. This section also describes how host-based IDPSs can affect a
host’s internal architecture, such as intercepting process calls.

7.1.1     Typical Components

Most host-based IDPSs have detection software known as agents installed on the hosts of interest. Each
agent monitors activity on a single host and if IDPS capabilities are enabled, also performs prevention
actions. Section 7.2.2 discusses the types of activity monitored by host-based IDPSs. The agents
transmit data to management servers, which may optionally use database servers for storage. 42 Consoles
are used for management and monitoring.

Some host-based IDPS products use dedicated appliances running agent software instead of installing
agent software on individual hosts. Each appliance is positioned to monitor the network traffic going to
and from a particular host. Technically, these appliances could be considered network-based IDPSs,
because they are deployed inline to monitor network traffic. However, they usually monitor activity for
only one specific type of application, such as a Web server or database server, so they are more
specialized than a standard network-based IDPS. Also, the software running on the appliance often has
the same or similar functionality as the host-based agents. Therefore, host-based IDPS products using
appliance-based agents are included in this section.

Each agent is typically designed to protect one of the following:

 A server. Besides monitoring the server’s operating system (OS), the agent may also monitor some
  common applications.
 A client host (desktop or laptop). Agents designed to monitor users’ hosts usually monitor the OS
  and common client applications such as e-mail clients and Web browsers.
 An application service. Some agents perform monitoring for a specific application service only,
  such as a Web server program or a database server program. This type of agent is also known as an
  application-based IDPS.


42
      Because this publication focuses on enterprise IDPS deployment, it assumes that agents send their data to management
      servers; however, some agents can be deployed standalone, and managed and monitored directly by the host’s administrators
      without using a management server.
