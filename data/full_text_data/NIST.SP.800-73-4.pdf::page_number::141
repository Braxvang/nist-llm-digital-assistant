Parameters:            sharedConnection                If TRUE other client applications can establish
                                                       concurrent connections to the ICC. If FALSE and the
                                                       connection is established, then the calling client
                                                       application has exclusive access to the ICC.

                       connectionDescription A connection description data object (tag 0x7F21).
                                                       See Table 2.

                                                       If the length of the value field of the '8x' data object in
                                                       the connection description data object is zero, then a

                                                       of the '8x' series data object and available at the '9x'
                                                       location is returned in the connectionDescription.

                                                       In order to provide sufficient space for the return
                                                       value, the client application shall allocate a buffer of at
                                                       least 2048 bytes for connectionDescription.

                                                       on the PIV client API shall have the structure

At most one selection from the '8x' series and one selection from the '9x' series shall appear in the
connection description template.

For example, '7F 21 0C 82 04 41 63 6D 65 91 04 C0 00 02 17' describes a connection to a generic card
reader at Internet address 192.0.2.23. As another example, '7F 21 0B 82 01 00 93 06 16 17 55 50 12 3F'
describes a connection to the subscriber identity module in the mobile phone at +1 617 555 0123.
