and covers the entire system life cycle (including research and development, design, manufacturing,
acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, and disposal) since supply chain
threats and vulnerabilities may (intentionally or unintentionally) compromise a technology product
or service at any stage.
In FY 2021, NIST launched the National Initiative for Improving Cybersecurity in Supply Chains
(NIICS). The initiative will rely on private companies of all sectors and sizes, as well as government
and academia, to contribute to the development of usable and effective domestic and global
supply chain risk management practices. The process aims to reflect lessons learned from the
past and current joint efforts to improve the way in which cybersecurity risks are managed â€“
especially as they relate to supply chains involving smaller organizations, which frequently face
special cybersecurity-related challenges. From the outset, NIST will include a special focus on
promoting the development and adoption of international standards that will lead to the global use
of the approaches and solutions developed as a result of this partnership.
NIST served as a principal member of the Federal Acquisition Security Council (FASC), which was
created as a requirement of the Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act of 2018 (FASCSA).
In addition, NIST participated in the FASC policy working group and FASC task force and assisted
in the development and finalization of the FASC rule (41 CFR Part 201). The FASC and its
subsidiary bodies are responsible for the development of policies and processes for agencies to
use when purchasing technology products. It also recommends C-SCRM standards, guidelines,
and practices that NIST should develop. Ongoing participation in the C-SCRM Forum enabled
important discussions among many of those leading C-SCRM efforts in the federal ecosystem.
These discussions helped to prepare participants for many of the supply chain risk events that
federal stakeholders have recently faced.
NIST initiated its first major revision to its foundational supply chain risk management guidance,
publishing the initial public draft of Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM)
Practices for Systems and Organizations (SP 800-161, Revision 1) in April 2021. This revision
provides organizations with updated guidance for mitigating cybersecurity risks in the supply chain
and provides a directional roadmap for agencies to follow to aid them in developing and growing their
C-SCRM capabilities. It lays out a set of foundational practices to build a sustainable program and,
over time, mature and evolve to incorporate enhanced capabilities. The publication emphasizes
the importance of an inter-disciplinary and cross-organizational approach to C-SCRM grounded
in governance, accountability, and responsibility. Ensuring that supply chain risk is addressed
throughout the entirety of the life cycle of a product or system and across all procurement and
contract management phases is a core theme throughout the guidance.
NIST also includes expansive, updated guidance for supply chain security controls that can
be selected, tailored, and implemented to mitigate cybersecurity risks in the supply chain and
risks inherited from and inherent in acquired products and services. The publication instructs
organizations on the activities and roles involved in the supply chain risk management process;
provides templates to aid them in their development of internal C-SCRM policy, strategy, and
implementation plans; and highlights and describes a number of factors (addressing C-SCRM
in acquisitions, the importance of information sharing, having sufficient resources, investing in
training, and measuring progress and outcomes) that are critical to the successful implementation
and effectiveness of a C-SCRM Program.
The second public draft of the publication was released in October 2021. Two new significant
