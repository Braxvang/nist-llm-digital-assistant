                                          Abstract

This recommendation defines five confidentiality modes of operation for use with an underlying
symmetric key block cipher algorithm: Electronic Codebook (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining
(CBC), Cipher Feedback (CFB), Output Feedback (OFB), and Counter (CTR). Used with an
underlying block cipher algorithm that is approved in a Federal Information Processing Standard
(FIPS), these modes can provide cryptographic protection for sensitive, but unclassified,
computer data.

KEY WORDS: Computer security; cryptography; data security; block cipher; encryption;
Federal Information Processing Standard; mode of operation.
