      ! Audit. Audit log entries, also known as security log entries, contain information pertaining to
        audited activities, such as successful and failed logon attempts, security policy changes, file
        access, and process execution.115 Applications may use audit capabilities built into the OS or may
        provide their own auditing capabilities.
      ! Error. Some applications create error logs, which record information regarding application
        errors, typically with timestamps. Error logs are helpful in troubleshooting both operational
        issues and attacks. Error messages can be helpful in determining when an event of interest
        occurred and in identifying some characteristics of the event.
      ! Installation. An application may create a separate installation log file that records information
        pertinent to the initial installation and subsequent updates of that application. Information
        recorded in an installation log varies widely but is likely to include the status of various phases of
        the installation. The log may also indicate the source of the installation files, the locations where
        the application components were placed, and options involving the application’s configuration.
      ! Debugging. Some applications can be run in a debugging mode, which means that they log far
        more information than usual regarding the operation of the application. Debugging records are
        often very cryptic and may have meaning only to the software’s creator, who can decipher error
        codes and other facets of the records. If an application offers a debugging capability, typically it
        is enabled only if administrators or developers need to resolve a specific operational problem.
7.1.4     Data

Nearly every application is specifically designed to handle data in one or more ways, such as creating,
displaying, transmitting, receiving, modifying, deleting, protecting, and storing data. For example, an e-
mail client allows a user to create an e-mail message and to send it to someone, as well as to receive,
view, and delete an e-mail message from someone else. Application data often resides temporarily in
memory, and temporarily or permanently in files. The format of a file containing application data may be
generic (e.g., text files, bitmap graphics) or proprietary. Data may also be stored in databases, which are
highly structured collections of files and data specifications. Some applications create temporary files
during a session, which may contain application data. If an application fails to shut down gracefully, it
may leave temporary files on media. Most OSs have a directory designated for temporary files; however,
some applications have their own temporary directory, and other applications place temporary files in the
same directory where data is stored. Applications may also contain data file templates and sample data
files (e.g., databases, documents).

7.1.5     Supporting Files

Applications often include one or more types of supporting files, such as documentation and graphics.
Supporting files tend to be static, but that does not mean that they are not of value for forensics. Types of
supporting files include the following:

      ! Documentation. This may include administrator and user manuals, help files, and licensing
        information. Documentation can be helpful to analysts in many ways, such as explaining what
        the application does, how the application works, and what components the application has.
        Documentation also typically contains contact information for the vendor of the application; the
        vendor might be able to answer questions and provide other assistance in understanding the
        application.

      Some applications record logon attempts to a separate authentication log. Section 7.1.2 contains additional information
      about authentication.
