                                                                                                           immediately upon receipt (e.g., it is decrypted a week later than the email was sent),
                                                                                                           then the cryptoperiod of the ephemeral public key does not end (from the perspective of
                                                                                                           the receiver) until the shared secret is generated that uses that public key.
