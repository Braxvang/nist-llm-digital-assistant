NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                             Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                    Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


   3.    In Section 7.2, paragraph 3. 2nd sentence: The “should” has been changed to “shall”, so
         that the sentence now reads:
         The personalization string shall be unique for all instantiations of the same DRBG
         mechanism type (e.g., HMAC_DRBG).
   4.    In Section 8.2, paragraph 2, additional text was added to the first sentence, which now
         reads:
         A DRBG is instantiated using a seed and may be reseeded; when reseeded, the seed
         shall be different than the seed used for instantiation.
   5.    In Section 8.5, Figure 4 has been updated, and the last paragraph has been revised to
         discuss the use of a secure channel.
   6.    In Sections 8.6.5 and 8.6.9, statements were inserted that prohibit a DRBG instantiation
         from reseeding itself.
   7.    References to “entropy input” have been removed from Section 8.6.9.
   8.    Section 8.8: An example was added to further clarify the meaning of prediction
         resistance.
   9.    In Section 9, a prediction_resistance_request parameter has been added to the
         Get_entropy_input call, along with a description of its purpose to the text underneath
         the call.
   10. In Section 9, a footnote was inserted to explain why a prediction_resistance_request
       parameter may be useful in the Get_entropy_input call.
   11. In Section 9.1, the following changes were made:
         •   The following sentence has been added to the description of the
             prediction_resistance_flag:
             In addition, step 6 can be modified to not perform a check for the
             prediction_resistance_flag when the flag is not used in an implementation ; in this
             case, the Get_entropy_input call need not include the
             prediction_resistance_request parameter.
         •   The following requirement has been added to the Required information not
             provided by the consuming application during instantiation:
             This input shall not be provided by the consuming application as an input
             parameter during the instantiate request.
         •   A prediction_resistance_request parameter has been added to the
             Get_entropy_input call of step 6 of the Instantiate Process.
         •   Step 5 was originally intended for implementations of the Dual_EC_DRBG to
             select an appropriate curve. This function is now performed by the
             Dual_EC_DRBG’s Instantiate_algorithm. Changes were made to provide the
             security strength to the Instantiate_algorithm. The Instantiate_algorithm for each
             DRBG was changed to allow the input of the security strength.
   12. In Section 9.2, the following changes have been made:

                                                96
