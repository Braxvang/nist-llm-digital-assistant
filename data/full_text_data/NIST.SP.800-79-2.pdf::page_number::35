Special Publication 800-79-2                            Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                         and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



There are certain controls that although they are put in place at the organizational level, they
need to be reviewed at the issuing facility level. An example of such a control artifact is
“contingency/disaster recovery plan for information systems”. Though the development of the
contingency/disaster recovery plan is an organizational level control, a review of this control
artifact is needed whenever new information systems in the existing facilities or new facilities
are added to ensure that these new systems are brought within the scope of the plan.

Unlike organization level issuer controls, facility level issuer controls need to be assessed
individually at each facility. A facility is often designated based on the type of PIV process it
performs (exceptions are the Sponsorship Process and Adjudication Process). Hence, for
example, if there are multiple facilities for identify proofing/registration (e.g., multiple
registration centers), assessment of the issuer controls under the focus area identity
proofing/registration, should take place in each of the enrollment centers. However, if all
facilities are operating using uniform operational procedures and underlying information
systems, it is acceptable to perform assessments at facilities that are selected randomly or
through some other established criteria (e.g., geographical region or service provider).

Prior assessments may be used as a starting point for the assessment of an issuer. While past
assessments provide insight into the implementation and operation of an issuer, a number of
factors affect the validity of past assessments. These include updates in policies and procedures,
changes in systems/technology, and turnover in employees and contractors. Any significant
changes in one or more of these factors should trigger a new assessment. The Assessor must
validate whether the issuer is currently operating as expected using the given assessment
procedures, including specially tailored or augmented procedures. It is only through a current
valid assessment of issuer controls that the Assessor and Organization Identity Management
Official will have confidence in the reliability of the issuer and its issuing facilities.

The use of automated security controls, if reliably implemented and maintained in information
systems, results in a high assurance of the protection of information and other organizational
assets. Human involvement results in more variability in how issuer controls are implemented
and operated, as security and reliability depend on many factors, including an individual’s
training, knowledge, motivation, experience, and management. Relying on humans for data
protection, rather than on reliable, automated security mechanisms, makes it critical that trust and
reliability assessments of management, operators, and maintenance personnel are current and up-
to-date. Many of the assessment procedures rely on interactions among the Assessor, issuer
management, and facilities staff. Interviews with all involved personnel and observations of all
PIV processes are required. On-site visits, real-time observations, and reviews of processes are
essential, as the Assessor must not rely solely on documentation to determine if a given issuer
control has been implemented.

4.1 Assessment Methods

In order to assess the capability and reliability of an issuer, one or more assessment procedures
associated with each issuer control have to be completed. An assessment procedure is carried out
using one or more of the following assessment methods. (The assessment methods associated
with an assessment procedure are given in parenthesis in Table G.1 and Table G.2.)
