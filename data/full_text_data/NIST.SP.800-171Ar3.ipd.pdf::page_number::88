2874             REQUIREMENT: 03.16.01

2875             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
2876             Determine if:
2877             A.03.16.01.ODP[01]: the security requirements for the system, system component, or
2878             system service are defined.
2879             A.03.16.01: the following security requirements are included in the acquisition contract for the
2880             system, system component, or system service: <A.03.16.01.ODP[01]: security
2881             requirements>.

2882             ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
2883             Examine
2884             [SELECT FROM: system and services acquisition policy and procedures; procedures for the
2885             integration of information security and SCRM into the acquisition process; configuration
2886             management plan; acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service;
2887             system design documentation; SCRM plan; system security plan; other relevant documents or
2888             records]
2889             Interview
2890             [SELECT FROM: personnel with acquisition/contracting responsibilities; personnel with SCRM
2891             responsibilities; personnel with information security responsibilities; system administrators]
2892             Test
2893             [SELECT FROM: processes for determining system security requirements; processes for
2894             developing acquisition contracts; mechanisms for supporting and/or implementing acquisitions
2895             and the inclusion of security requirements in contracts]
