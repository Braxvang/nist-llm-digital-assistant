                                                                                                or more applications through a single centralized interface. A teleworker uses a portal client on a telework
                                                                                                client device to access the portal. Most portals are web-based—for them, the portal client is a regular web

                                                                                                In terms of security, portals have most of the same characteristics as tunnels: portals protect information
                                                                                                between client devices and the portal, and they can provide authentication, access control, and other
                                                                                                security services. However, there is an important difference between tunnels and portals—the location of
                                                                                                the application client software and associated data. In a tunnel, the software and data are on the client

                                                                                                rendered desktop screen images or web pages, but data is typically stored on the client device much more
                                                                                                temporarily than data for a tunneled solution is. (However, portals can be configured to allow clients to
                                                                                                download content from the portal and store it on the client device or other locations outside the secure

                                                                                                more control over how the software and data is secured as opposed to more distributed remote access
                                                                                                solutions. Portals limit the access a teleworker has to particular application clients running on the portal
                                                                                                itself. Those applications further limit the access the teleworker has to the servers inside the network.
