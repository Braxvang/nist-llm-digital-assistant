F.7.13.  ORGANIZATION-WIDE INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM
   MANAGEMENT CONTROLS â€“ PM
Characteristics of the Organization-Wide Information Security Program Management
Control Family
Organization-wide information security program management controls are deployed to support
the information security program. They are not associated with control baselines and are
independent of any system impact level.
Program management controls should specifically address the unique properties and
requirements of OT, the relationship to non-OT systems, and the relationship to other programs
concerned with the operational characteristics of OT (e.g., safety, efficiency, reliability,
resilience). To achieve this, the security program should utilize interdisciplinary teams that can
help reconcile and balance conflicting equities, objectives, and responsibilities, such as
capability, adaptability, resilience, safety, security, usability, and efficiency.
