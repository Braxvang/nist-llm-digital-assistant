                                                           GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



Completed                                         Action
            Provides guidelines on styles and formats appropriate for Web publishing
            Provides for appropriate review of the information for sensitivity and
            distribution/release controls (including the sensitivity of the information in
            aggregate)
            Determines the appropriate access and security controls
            Provides guidance on the information contained within the source code of the
            Web content
            Maintain Web user privacy
            Maintain a published privacy policy
            Prohibit the collection of personally identifying data without the explicit
            permission of the user and collect only the data that is absolutely needed
            Prohibit the use of “persistent” cookies
            Use the session cookie only if it is clearly identified in published privacy policy
            Mitigate indirect attacks on content
            Ensure users of the site are aware of the dangers of phishing and pharming
            attacks and how to avoid them
            Validate official communication by personalizing emails and providing unique
            identifying (but not confidential) information only the organization and user
            should know
            Use digital signatures on e-mail if appropriate
            Perform content validation within the Web application to prevent more
            sophisticated phishing attacks (e.g., cross-site scripting based attacks)
            Personalize Web content to aid in users’ identifying fraudulent Web sites
            Use token-based or mutual authentication if applicable
            Suggest the use of Web browsers or browser toolbars with phishing/
            pharming protection
            Use current versions of DNS software with the latest security patches
            Install server-side DNS protection mechanisms
            Monitor organizational domains and similar domains
            Simplify the structure of organization domain names
            Use secure connections for logins
            If necessary, engage a vendor to provide stronger anti-phishing/
            anti-pharming measures
            Client-side active content security considerations
            Weigh the risks and benefits of client-side active content
            Take no actions without the express permission of user
            When possible, only use widely-adopted active content such as JavaScript,
            PDF, and Flash
            When possible, provide alternatives (e.g., HTML provided along with PDF)
            Maintain server-side active content security
            Only simple, easy-to-understand code should be used
            Limited or no reading or writing to the file system should be permitted
            Limited or no interaction with other programs (e.g., sendmail) should be
            permitted
            There should be no requirement to run with suid privileges on Unix or Linux
            Explicit path names should be used (i.e., does not rely on path variable)
