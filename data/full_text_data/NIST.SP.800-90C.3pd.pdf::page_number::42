       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                        Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

1148   4.2.1. Instantiating the DRBG in the RBG1 Construction
1149   The DRBG within the RBG1 construction may be instantiated at any security strength possible for
1150   the DRBG design using the Instantiate_function discussed in Section 2.8.1.1 and [SP800-90A],
1151   subject to the maximum security strength that is supported by the RBG used as the randomness
1152   source.
1153                                    (status, RBG1_state_handle) =
1154        Instantiate_function (s, prediction_resistance_flag = FALSE, personalization_string),
1155   where s is the requested security strength for the DRBG in the RBG1 construction. If used, the
1156   prediction_resistance_flag is set to FALSE since the DRBG cannot be reseeded to provide
1157   prediction resistance.
1158   An external RBG (i.e., the randomness source) shall be used to obtain the bitstring necessary for
1159   establishing the DRBGâ€™s s-bit security strength.
1160   In SP 800-90A, the Instantiate_function specifies the use of a Get_randomness-source_input
1161   call to obtain randomness input from the randomness source for instantiation (see Section 2.8.1.4
1162   in this document and in [SP800-90A]). For an RBG1 construction, an approved external RBG2(P)
1163   or RBG3 construction must be used as the randomness source (see Sections 5 and 6, respectively).
1164   If the randomness source is an RBG2(P) construction (see Figure 13), the Get_randomness-
1165   source_input call in the Instantiate_function shall be replaced by a Generate_function call to
1166   the RBG2(P) construction (in whatever manner is required) (see Sections 2.8.1.2 and 5.2.2). The
1167   RBG2(P) construction must be reseeded using its internal entropy source(s) before generating bits
1168   to be provided to the RBG1 construction. This is accomplished by setting the
1169   prediction_resistance_request parameter in the Generate_function call to TRUE (see steps 1a
1170   and 2a below).
