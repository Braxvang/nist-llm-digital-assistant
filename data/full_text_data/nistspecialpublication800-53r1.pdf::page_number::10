Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1               Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


•    Providing a stable, yet flexible catalog of security controls for information systems to meet
     current organizational protection needs and the demands of future protection needs based on
     changing requirements and technologies; and
•    Creating a foundation for the development of assessment methods and procedures for
     determining security control effectiveness.

The guidelines provided in this special publication are applicable to all federal information
systems 8 other than those systems designated as national security systems as defined in 44
U.S.C., Section 3542. 9 The guidelines have been broadly developed from a technical perspective
to complement similar guidelines for national security systems. This publication is intended to
provide guidance to federal agencies implementing FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements
for Federal Information and Information Systems. In addition to the agencies of the federal
government, state, local, and tribal governments, and private sector organizations that compose
the critical infrastructure of the United States, are encouraged to use these guidelines, as
appropriate.

1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE
This publication is intended to serve a diverse federal audience of information system and
information security professionals including: (i) individuals with information system and
information security management and oversight responsibilities (e.g., chief information officers,
senior agency information security officers, and authorizing officials); (ii) individuals with
information system development responsibilities (e.g., program and project managers,
mission/application owners, system designers, system and application programmers); (iii)
individuals with information security implementation and operational responsibilities (e.g.,
information system owners, information owners, information system administrators, information
system security officers,); and (iv) individuals with information system and information security
assessment and monitoring responsibilities (e.g., auditors, inspectors general, evaluators, and
certification agents). Commercial companies producing information technology products and
systems, creating information security-related technologies, and providing information security
services can also benefit from the information in this publication.

1.3 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER SECURITY CONTROL PUBLICATIONS
To create the most technically sound and broadly applicable set of security controls for
information systems, a variety of sources were considered during the development of this special
publication. The sources included security controls from the defense, audit, financial, healthcare,
and intelligence communities as well as controls defined by national and international standards
organizations. 10 The objective of NIST Special Publication 800-53 is to provide a set of security

 A federal information system is an information system used or operated by an executive agency, by a contractor of an
executive agency, or by another organization on behalf of an executive agency.
9
 NIST Special Publication 800-59 provides guidance on identifying an information system as a national security
system.

  Security controls from the audit, defense, healthcare, intelligence, and standards communities are contained in the
following publications: (i) Government Accountability Office, Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual; (ii)
Department of Defense Instruction 8500.2, Information Assurance Implementation; (iii) Department of Health and
Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Core Security Requirements; (iv) Director of Central
Intelligence Directive 6/3 Manual, Protecting Sensitive Compartmented Information within Information Systems; (v)
NIST Special Publication 800-26, Security Self-Assessment Guide for Information Technology Systems; and (vi)
