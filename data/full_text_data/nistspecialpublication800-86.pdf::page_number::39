                                                       GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



of files or partitions and may ignore free or unallocated drive space, whereas others create a bit-by-bit
image copy of the media.

In addition to their primary function, some disk imaging tools can also perform forensic recordkeeping,
such as automated audit trails and chain of custody. The use of such tools can support consistency in the
examination process and the accuracy and reproducibility of results. An increasing number of disk
imaging tools are becoming available. In response to this proliferation and the lack of a standard for
testing them, NIST’s Computer Forensics Tool Testing (CFTT) project has developed rigorous testing
procedures for validating the tools’ results. Currently, only a few disk imaging tools have undergone
CFTT testing.31

Generally, tools that perform bit stream imaging should not be used to acquire bit-by-bit copies of an
entire physical device from a live system—a system currently in use—because the files and memory on
such a system are changing constantly and therefore cannot be validated.32 However, a bit-by-bit copy of
the logical areas of a live system can be completed and validated. When logical backups are being
performed, it is still preferable not to copy files from a live system; changes might be made to files during
the backup, and files that are held open by a process might not be easy to copy. Accordingly, analysts
should decide whether copying files from a live system is feasible based on which files need to be
obtained, how accurate and complete the copying needs to be, and how important the live system is.33 For
example, it is not necessary to take down a critical server used by hundreds of people just to collect files
from a single user’s home directory. For logical backups of live systems, analysts can use standard
system backup software. However, performing a backup could affect the performance of the system and
consume significant amounts of network bandwidth, depending on whether the backup is performed
locally or remotely.

Organizations should have policy, guidelines, and procedures that indicate the circumstances under which
bit stream images and logical backups (including those from live systems) may be performed for forensic
purposes and which personnel may perform them.34 It is typically most effective to establish policy,
guidelines, and procedures based on categories of systems (i.e., low, moderate, or high impact) and the
nature of the event of interest; some organizations also choose to create separate policy statements,
guidelines, and procedures for particularly important systems. The policy, guidelines, or procedures
should identify the individuals or groups with authority to make decisions regarding backups and images;
these people should be capable of weighing the risks and making sound decisions. The policy, guidelines,
or procedures should also identify which individuals or groups have the authority to perform the backup
or imaging for each type of system. Access to some systems might be restricted because of the sensitivity
of the operations or data in the system.

4.2.2     Data File Integrity

During backups and imaging, the integrity of the original media should be maintained. To ensure that the
backup or imaging process does not alter data on the original media, analysts can use a write-blocker
while backing up or imaging the media. A write-blocker is a hardware or software-based tool that
prevents a computer from writing to computer storage media connected to it. Hardware write-blockers
are physically connected to the computer and the storage media being processed to prevent any writes to

32
     For example, services or processes running on the system might be writing to a system’s hard drive, even if no person is
     currently using the computer.
33
     Analysts should also consider the possible need to collect volatile data from the system. If the system is live, its volatile
     data is likely to change more quickly and to be more challenging to preserve.
34
     This recommendation is not intended to restrict users from performing backups of their own data and local workstations, but
     to prevent people from collecting backups of others’ systems and data without appropriate cause for doing so.
