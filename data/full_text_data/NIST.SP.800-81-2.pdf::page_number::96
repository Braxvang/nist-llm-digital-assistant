SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



seen as BOGUS to other DNSSEC validators). However, DNSSEC-unaware clients will not know to do
this comparison, so there is the risk that invalid DNSSEC RRsets will be stored in DNSSEC unaware
caches.

TTL values should be on the order of hours, with a recommended range of 1800 (30 minutes) to 86400 (1
day). If a zone administrator knows that the DNS data is likely to change frequently, the TTL value
should be set low, to insure that old, stale data is purged from client caches. If the zone administrator
believes the DNS data will not change frequently, then the TTL value can be set higher, to gain optimal
benefit of caching in client systems. Note that some specialized load-balancing scenarios rely on much
shorter time periods (60 seconds or less), but for the majority of DNS data, 30 minutes to 24 hours is
sufficient. If the data is signed using DNSSEC, the value should always be long enough to insure that the
data will not be purged from client caches before those clients have a chance to validate it. Experience
has shown that very low TTL values (e.g. 30 seconds and under) can cause problems with DNSSEC
validating caches and these values should be avoided for DNSSEC signed RRsets.

Checklist item 28: TTL values for DNS data should be set between 30 minutes (1800 seconds) and 24
hours (86,400 seconds).

Checklist item 29: TTL values for RRsets should be set to be a fraction of the DNSSEC signature
validity period of the RRSIG that covers the RRset.


10.6 Recommendations Summary

The following items provide a summary of the major recommendations from this section:

    •   Checklist item 18: The refresh value in the zone SOA RR should be chosen with the frequency
        of updates in mind. If the zone is signed, the refresh value should be less than the RRSIG validity
        period.

    •   Checklist item 19: The retry value in a zone SOA RR should be 1/10th of the refresh value.

    •   Checklist item 20: The expire value in the zone SOA RR should be 2 to 4 weeks.

    •   Checklist item 21: The minimum TTL value should be between 30 minutes and 5 days.

    •   Checklist item 22: A DNS administrator should take care when including HINFO, RP, LOC, or
        other RR types that could divulge information that would be useful to an attacker, or the external
        view of a zone if using split DNS. These RR types should be avoided if possible and only used if
        necessary to support operational policy.

    •   Checklist item 23: A DNS administrator should review the data contained in any TXT RR for
        possible information leakage before adding it to the zone file.

    •   Checklist item 24: The validity period for the RRSIGs covering a zone’s DNSKEY RRSet
        should be in the range of 2 days to 1 week. This value helps reduce the vulnerability period
        resulting from a key compromise.

    •   Checklist item 25: A zone with delegated children should have a validity period of a few days to
        1 week for RRSIGs covering the DS RR for a delegated child. This value helps reduce the child
        zone’s vulnerability period resulting from a KSK compromise and scheduled key rollovers.
