server. The Web server processes the requested page and executes any script commands encountered
before sending a generated HTML page to the user’s browser.

Both C# and VBScript are natively supported as ASP.NET scripting languages, but other languages can
be accommodated through the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which provides common services
such as cross-language integration, cross-language exception handling, and security. ASP.NET scripting
engines are available for the PERL, REXX, and Python languages from various sources. Scripting
capabilities can also be extended through the use of ActiveX objects, which can be developed in a variety
of languages, including Visual Basic, C++, Cobol, and Java. A script that invokes an ActiveX object
causes the object to be created and supplies any needed input parameters. While Microsoft’s .NET
platform was originally limited to its Windows OS, Novell sponsors the Mono project, which implements
the ECMA standards for C# and CLR on UNIX-like OSs. 7

As with Java, code written in .NET can be downloaded and run from untrusted sources. To alleviate this
problem, Microsoft has integrated code access security into the .NET Framework. Code access security
provides various levels of trust for code based on where the code originates and allows individual users to
specify what permissions will be given to an application. Because code access security is part of the
.NET Framework, all applications that access the .NET Framework can be subject to code access security.
Because policies are defined on a per machine basis, libraries are provided that allow applications to
determine whether the application has a particular permission before performing a potentially restricted
act—allowing .NET applications to alter their behavior rather than simply generate a security exception.
Nevertheless, like Java, implementation bugs have been found in .NET that may allow attackers to bypass
security mechanisms [MS07].

4.2.4   C# and Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET)

C# (pronounced C sharp) is a strongly typed, object-oriented programming language that enables
programmers to build applications for the Microsoft .NET platform. C# borrows most of its operators,
keywords, and statements from C++ and is intended to be used in programming both hosted and
embedded systems. C# is normally compiled into Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) byte codes
and then just-in-time compiled into native code during execution, but also can be compiled directly into
native code. The language and security features (through code access security) are similar to Java’s and
pose similar risks.

VB.NET was released alongside of C# as a successor to the legacy Visual Basic language. While the
VB.NET syntax is similar to the original Visual Basic language, VB.NET provides a fully object-oriented
language in place of the component object model (COM)-based language of Visual Basic. While Visual
Basic has some security concerns, VB.NET’s support of garbage collection, object-oriented design, code
access security, and the .NET framework make VB.NET similar to C#. Through the .NET framework
and the CLR, VB.NET has access to .NET’s security libraries and is protected by code access security.

4.2.5   PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP)

PHP is a scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages. With a syntax borrowed from the C,
Java, and Perl programming languages, PHP code is embedded within HTML pages for server-side
execution. PHP is commonly used to extract data from a database and present it on a Web page. Most
major Windows and Unix Web servers support the language, and it is widely used with the mySQL
database. PHP provides a number of options that simplify development. Nevertheless, it is a rich,
powerful scripting environment with subtle processing implications, and some options can make it more
