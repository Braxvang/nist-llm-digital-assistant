1. Introduction
This Framework for Designing Cryptographic Key Management Systems (CKMS 1) is a
description of the topics to be considered and the documentation requirements
(henceforth referred to as requirements) to be addressed when designing a CKMS. The
CKMS designer satisfies the requirements by selecting the policies, procedures,
components (hardware, software, and firmware), and devices (groups of components) to
be incorporated into the CKMS, and then specifying how these items are employed to
meet the requirements of this Framework.

A CKMS consists of policies, procedures, components and devices that are used to
protect, manage and distribute cryptographic keys and certain specific information, called
(associated) metadata herein. A CKMS includes all devices or sub-systems that can
access an unencrypted key or its metadata. Encrypted keys and their cryptographically
protected (bound) metadata can be handled by computers and transmitted through
communications systems and stored in media that are not considered to be part of a
CKMS.

This CKMS Framework provides design documentation requirements for any CKMS. In
other words, it describes what needs to be documented in the CKMS design. The goal of
the Framework is to guide the CKMS designer in creating a complete uniform
specification of the CKMS that can be used to build, procure, and evaluate the desired
CKMS.

This Framework offers the following advantages:
   a) It helps define the CKMS design task by requiring the specification of significant
       CKMS capabilities,
   b) It encourages CKMS designers to consider the factors needed in a comprehensive
       CKMS,
   c) It encourages CKMS designers to consider factors and mechanisms that, if
       properly addressed, can provide security to the system,
   d) It can be used when logically comparing different compliant CKMS systems and
       their capabilities,
   e) It aids in performing a security assessment by requiring the specification of
       implemented and supported CKMS capabilities, and
   f) It forms the basis for a U.S. Federal CKMS Profile.


NIST Standards and Special Publications are referenced in this Framework as examples
only. This Framework is intended to be general enough to encompass any reasonably
complete and well-designed CKMS.
