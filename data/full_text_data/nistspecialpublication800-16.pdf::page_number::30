Information Technology Security Training Requirements


Thus, "In a training environment the employee is taught to use specific skills as part of exacting
job performance. Li an educational context the employee would be encouraged to examine and
evaluate not only skills and methods of work but fundamental operating principles and tenets
upon which job skills are based.. .."^

The distinction among the three levels is not always easy to interpret and apply. Exhibit 2-2,
below, illustrates this distinction.
