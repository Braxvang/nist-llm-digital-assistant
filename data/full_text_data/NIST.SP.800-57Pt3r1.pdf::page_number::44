6 Kerberos
6.1 Description
The Kerberos authentication mechanism was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) to enable the secure authentication of users to Target Servers (TSs)
over an unprotected network, where client software acts on behalf of a user24. The
original design and implementation of Kerberos and its first three revisions (i.e., versions
1 through 4) was primarily the work of Steve Miller, Clifford Neuman, Jerome Saltzer
and Jeffrey Schiller25. Kerberos is used for local logins, remote (over the network)
authentication, and for client-to-TS requests. It can also be extended to provide for the
establishment of cryptographic keys between a client and a TS. Kerberos has been
designed so that a user and a TS rely on a trusted third party to provide assurance of each
party’s identity. This assurance is granted by means of tickets and authentication
information, each encrypted with symmetric keys.

The trusted third party is a Key Distribution Center (KDC), which consists of an
Authentication Server (AS) and a Ticket Granting Service (TGS). The AS and TGS may
or may not reside on the same machine. The KDC has a database of user, TS, and TGS
symmetric keys. All KDC symmetric keys are accessible by the TGS. The user’s key is
normally created by hashing a user’s password with other information.

An overview of the Kerberos version 5 protocol is shown in Figure 6-1. The following is
a simplification of the process (e.g., the generation of most keys and the use of most
cryptographic operations are not specified). For example, tickets and authentication
information are protected with checksums and encryption when transmitted.

     1. A user logs onto a client by entering a password, from which a user symmetric
        key is generated.
     2. The client, acting on behalf of the user, requests a Ticket Granting Ticket from the
        AS.
     3. The AS generates a Ticket Granting Ticket, for a specified validity period, and
        sends it to the client.
     4. The client provides the Ticket Granting Ticket to the TGS, along with his own
        authentication information, which includes the client identifier and a time stamp.
     5. The TGS checks the authentication information and the validity period of the
        Ticket Granting Ticket. The TGS then generates a Target Server Ticket and sends
        it to the client.

  Note that a single client implementation may be used by multiple users, and a single user may use
multiple client implementations (e.g., a user could access different workstations, each with its own client
implementation).

  The design was based in part upon a protocol proposed by Needham and Schroeder [NEED] with
modifications provided by Denning and Sacco [DENN]. For more detail on the goals, motivations, and
rationale of Kerberos see [NEUM].
