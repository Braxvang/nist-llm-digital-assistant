                                                                                                                         Components        Should Consider      Status
                                             The selected RFID standards in effect determine the types of tags
                                             that will be deployed and the operating frequencies on which RF
                                             subsystem communication will occur. The standards also specify the
                                             available technical security mechanisms. For instance, some tags
             Identify the RFID standards     support passwords while others do not. An organization may also

             will comply.                    avoid unwanted RF interference, improve performance, and reduce
                                             technical problems. The choice of operating frequency is often
                                             closely associated with relevant regulations and the application area
                                             (e.g., healthcare, supply chain, security access control, and animal
                                             tracking).
                                             Including security and privacy planning in funding plans ensures that
                                             adequate resources are available for implementation of appropriate
