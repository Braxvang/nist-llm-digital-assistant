                                                TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



Examples of log information that may be useful when conducting technical security assessments include:

       Authentication server or system logs may include successful and failed authentication attempts.
       System logs may include system and service startup and shutdown information, installation of
        unauthorized software, file accesses, security policy changes, account changes (e.g., account
        creation and deletion, account privilege assignment), and privilege use.
       Intrusion detection and prevention system logs may include malicious activity and inappropriate
        use.
       Firewall and router logs may include outbound connections that indicate compromised internal
        devices (e.g., rootkits, bots, Trojan horses, spyware).
       Firewall logs may include unauthorized connection attempts and inappropriate use.
       Application logs may include unauthorized connection attempts, account changes, use of
        privileges, and application or database usage information.
       Antivirus logs may include update failures and other indications of outdated signatures and
        software.
       Security logs, in particular patch management and some IDS and intrusion prevention system
        (IPS) products, may record information on known vulnerable services and applications.
Manually reviewing logs can be extremely time-consuming and cumbersome. Automated audit tools are
available that can significantly reduce review time and generate predefined and customized reports that
summarize log contents and track them to a set of specific activities. Assessors can also use these
automated tools to facilitate log analysis by converting logs in different formats to a single, standard
format for analysis. In addition, if assessors are reviewing a specific action—such as the number of failed
logon attempts in an organization—they can use these tools to filter logs based on the activity being
checked.

3.3     Ruleset Review

A ruleset is a collection of rules or signatures that network traffic or system activity is compared against
to determine what action to take—for example, forwarding or rejecting a packet, creating an alert, or
allowing a system event. Review of these rulesets is done to ensure comprehensiveness and identify gaps
and weaknesses on security devices and throughout layered defenses such as network vulnerabilities,
policy violations, and unintended or vulnerable communication paths. A review can also uncover
inefficiencies that negatively impact a ruleset’s performance.

Rulesets to review include network- and host-based firewall and IDS/IPS rulesets, and router access
control lists. The following list provides examples of the types of checks most commonly performed in
ruleset reviews:

       For router access control lists

          –   Each rule is still required (for example, rules that were added for temporary purposes are
              removed as soon as they are no longer needed)

          –   Only traffic that is authorized per policy is permitted, and all other traffic is denied by default
       For firewall rulesets
