                                                                         Guidelines on PDA Forensics


                MMCmobile are higher performance variants of MMC and RS-MMC cards
                respectively that have a 13-pin connector and an 8-bit data bus.

                Secure Digital (SD) Cards - Secure Digital (SD) memory cards (length-32 mm,
                width-24 mm, and thickness-2.1mm) are comparable to the size and solid-state design
                of MMC cards. In fact, SD card slots can often accommodate MMC cards as well.
                However, SD cards have a 9-pin connector and a 4-bit data bus, which afford a higher
                transfer rate. SD memory cards feature an erasure-prevention switch. Keeping the
                switch in the locked position protects data from accidental deletion. They also offer
                security controls for content protection (i.e., Content Protection Rights Management).
                MiniSD cards are an electrically compatible extension of the existing SD card
                standard in a more compact format (length-21.5 mm, width-20 mm, and thickness-1.4
                mm). They run on the same hardware bus and use the same interface as an SD card,
                and also include content protection security features, but have a smaller maximum
                capacity potential due to size limitations. For backward compatibility, an adapter
                allows a MiniSD Card to work with existing SD card slots.

                Memory Sticks - Memory sticks provide solid-state memory in a size similar to, but
                smaller than, a stick of gum (length-50mm, width-21.45mm, thickness-2.8mm). They
                have a 10-pin connector and a 1-bit data bus. As with SD cards, Memory Sticks also
                have a built-in erasure-prevention switch, to protect the contents of the card. Memory
                Stick PRO cards offer higher capacity and transfer rates than standard Memory Sticks,
                using a 10-pin connector, but with a 4-bit data bus. Memory Stick Duo and Memory
                Stick PRO Duo, smaller versions of the Memory Stick and Memory Stick PRO, are
                about two-thirds the size of the standard memory stick (length-31mm, width-20mm,
                thickness-1.6mm). An adapter is required for a Memory Stick Duo or Memory Stick
                PRO Duo to work with standard Memory Stick slots.

                Extended Memory Cards - Memory cards may support extensions for additional
                functionality. For example, the X-Mobile Card from Renesas is a MultiMedia card
                that contains both a smart card and a memory chip and able to function in either
                mode.

6.3.3   USB Memory Drives

        Many manufacturers produce USB memory drives of various capacities. Currently, however,
        very few PDA devices support host USB ports, which are needed to interface with these
        peripherals. Moreover, few if any USB drive manufacturers provide the necessary drivers for
        PDA operating systems. This situation is understandable given that host USB specifications
        intend for an interface to be capable of supporting multiple devices sharing the port, which if
        permitted would place a significant power drain on the battery of the device. Other factors
        include the restrictions in mobility imposed by a USB drive sticking out of the side of a PDA
        compared to the benefits of providing one or more memory card slots that completely contain
        a card when inserted.

        As with memory card extensions, USB drives may offer additional capabilities such as a
        wireless interface. Access to memory contents may also be protected through a built-in
        fingerprint reader or some other mechanism such as a smart card, which complicates the
        acquisition process. However, for the reasons mentioned above these peripherals are not
        normally associated with PDA devices.
