Appendix C. Security Policy and Requirements
This appendix discusses security policy and requirements considerations 57 in support of
Appendix D, Appendix E, and Appendix H. Covered topics include the rules and scope of
control for security policy (Section C.1), stakeholder and system security requirements (Section
C.2), and the relationship among security requirements, policy, and mechanisms (Section C.3).

C.1.       Security Policy
A security policy is a set of rules (Section C.1.1) that governs behavior and outcomes within a
defined scope of control (Section C.1.2). The policy generally includes a set of policies that
reflect the needs and expectations established by an authority with a specific scope and purpose
(Section C.1.2). The policy rules have a hierarchy, from security policy top-level objectives that
are refined and allocated to organizational security policies, which in turn are refined and
allocated to system security policies.

C.1.1. Rules
Security policy rules are stated in terms of authorized relationships that involve subjects (i.e.,
active entities) and objects (i.e., passive entities). The rules govern the operations that a subject
can perform or invoke on other subjects (i.e., subject-to-subject operations) and the operations
that a subject can perform or invoke on objects (i.e., subject-to-object operations). The rules must
be accurate, consistent, compatible, and complete with respect to stakeholder security objectives
within the defined scope of control. Inaccurate, inconsistent, incompatible, or incomplete rule
sets will allow undesired behavior and outcomes.

C.1.2. Scope of Control
Security policies reflect and are derived from laws, directives, regulations, life cycle concepts, 58
requirements, or stakeholder objectives. Each policy includes a scope of control that establishes
the bounds within which the policy applies. A typical scope of applicability includes:
•    Security Policy (Protection) Objectives: A set of objectives that captures a preferred state
     or what is to be achieved. These objectives include assets to be protected, statements of intent
     to protect the assets within the specific scope of stakeholder responsibility, and the protection
     scope. Security policy objectives are the basis for deriving all other security policy forms.
•    Organizational Security Policy: A set of rules 59 that regulates how an organization achieves
     its objectives. The rules provide individuals with a reasonable ability to determine whether
     their actions either violate or comply with the security policy. Organizational security policy
     defines the individual’s behavior in performing their missions and business functions and is
     used for developing processes and procedures.

   This appendix discusses policy in a manner that suggests policy precedes engineering. However, policy may need to be modified to align with
the capabilities of the delivered as-is system.
58
   Life cycle concepts include operation, sustainment, evolution, maintenance, training, startup, and shutdown.
59
   The rules may be captured in laws and practices.
