NIST SP 800-215                                                             Guide to a Secure Enterprise
November 2022                                                                       Network Landscape

turn, needs an infrastructure for also authenticating services (in addition to users) with special
requirements as follows:
   •   A portable and interoperable cryptographic identity is required for workloads or services,
       as well as a standardized way to retrieve, validate, and interact with those identities. An
       example of such a specification is Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone
       (SPIFFE) [47].

   •   The location of the service may change due to the virtualized nature of the application
       hosting environment (e.g., migration to different Virtual Machines (VMs), migration to a
       different pod in containerized applications). Hence, the identity should abstract the
       environment hosting the service.
   •   The validation of identity (authentication) and authorization need to be done continuously
       (and not just at the beginning of a service request) as the risk profile associated with the
       request may change if there are multiple entities involved or if there are changes in
       behavioral patterns that need to be included as a validation parameter and monitored.
