                  Reports on Computer Systems Technology

The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing
technical leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL
develops tests, test methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and
technical analyses to advance the development and productive use of information
technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the development of management,
administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective
security and privacy of other than national security-related information in Federal
information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative
activities with industry, government, and academic organizations.

                                       Abstract

This Framework for Designing Cryptographic Key Management Systems (CKMS)
contains topics that should be considered by a CKMS designer when developing a CKMS
design specification. For each topic, there are one or more documentation requirements
that need to be addressed by the design specification. Thus, any CKMS that addresses
each of these requirements would have a design specification that is compliant with this
Framework.


                                      Keywords

access control; confidentiality; cryptographic key management system; cryptographic
keys; framework; integrity; key management policies; key metadata; source
authentication.
