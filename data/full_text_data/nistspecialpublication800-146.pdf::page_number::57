                                                              CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



8.      Open Issues

Cloud computing is not a solution for all consumers of IT services, nor is it appropriate for all
applications. As an emerging technology, cloud computing contains a number of issues, not all of which
are unique to cloud, that are concerns for all IT hosted services. The purpose of this section is make the
reader aware of how cloud computing relates to open issues in both locally-managed and outsourced IT
computing services.

Some of these issues are traditional distributed computing topics that have remained open for decades but
have now become more relevant because of the emergence of cloud computing. Other issues appear to be
unique to cloud computing.

Complex computing systems are prone to failure and security compromise. Moreover, software that must
accommodate complex requirements such as concurrency, dynamic configuration, and large scale
computations, may exhibit higher defect densities than typical commercial grade software. With this in
mind, it is important to understand that cloud systems, like all complex computing systems, will contain
flaws, experience failures, and experience security compromises. This does not disqualify cloud systems
from performing important work, but it does mean that techniques for detecting failures, understanding
their consequences, isolating their effects, and remediating them, are central to the wide-scale adoption of
clouds.

Cloud computing has potential to foster more efficient markets through swift leasing of computing
resources. In some scenarios, cloud computing offers consumers the ability to forgo capital expenses
(e.g., building internal computing centers) in exchange for variable service fees. Thus clouds offer
consumers potential decreases in IT cash outflow. From a provider's perspective, cloud computing allows
capital expenses to be leveraged into positive revenue streams after initial investments are made. These
are familiar economic concepts that become mixed with the complexities of network and system
configurations as well as the normal risks from exposing data and software assets to any external party.

The technical means of providing the quality of service promised by clouds are usually not disclosed to
the consumer, thus raising questions about how consumers can verify that the promised quality of service
has been provided. Additionally, efficient markets rely on consumers' ability to practically compare
service offerings. This is difficult since service agreements do not all adhere to standard metrics,
terminology, and vocabularies.

In summary, cloud computing raises a variety of issues that are grouped below into five areas in the
remainder of this section: Computing Performance (Section 8.1), Cloud Reliability (Section 8.2),
Economic Goals (Section 8.3), Compliance (Section 8.4), and Information Security (Section 8.5).

8.1     Computing Performance

Different types of applications require differing levels of system performance. For example, email is
generally tolerant of short service interruptions, but industrial automation and real-time processing
generally require both high performance and a high degree of predictability. Cloud computing incurs
several performance issues that are not necessarily dissimilar from performance issues of other forms of
distributed computing, but that are worth noting here.

8.1.1    Latency

Latency is the time delay that a system experiences when processing a request. Latency experienced by
cloud consumers typically includes at least one Internet round-trip time, i.e., the time it takes for a request
