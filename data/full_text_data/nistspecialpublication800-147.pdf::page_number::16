                                                                                BIOS PROTECTION GUIDELINES



3.      Threat Mitigation

BIOS is a critical component of a secure system. As the first code executed during the boot process, the
system BIOS is implicitly trusted by hardware and software components in a system. The previous
section described the system BIOS’s role in the boot process, the system BIOS’s appeal to attackers, and
the potential threats resulting in the unauthorized modification of the BIOS. This section presents
security guidelines for BIOS implementations and recommended practices for managing BIOSs in an
enterprise environment. Section 3.1 provides guidelines for a secure BIOS update process. It is intended
for platform vendors designing, implementing, or selecting a system BIOS implementation. While
products may not be immediately available, organizations can use these guidelines at input to their
procurement processes and begin developing plans to make use of these security features when they are
available. Organizations can use the recommended BIOS management practices in Section 3.2 when
developing these plans. The recommendations are intended to prevent unauthorized modification of the
BIOS.

3.1     Security Guidelines for System BIOS Implementations

This subsection provides guidelines intended to maintain the integrity of the BIOS after it has been
provisioned by securing the mechanisms used for updating the BIOS. In particular, this subsection
defines guidelines for system BIOS implementations for a secure BIOS update mechanism. A secure
BIOS update mechanism includes:
    1. a process for verifying the authenticity and integrity of BIOS updates; and
    2. a mechanism for ensuring that the BIOS is protected from modification outside of the secure
        update process.

Authentication verifies that a BIOS update image was generated by an authentic source and is unaltered.
All updates to the system BIOS shall either go through an authenticated BIOS update mechanism as
described in Section 3.1.1 or use an optional secure local update mechanism compliant with the
guidelines in Section 3.1.2.

These guidelines for a secure BIOS update mechanism do not mitigate all risks associated with the system
BIOS. Some threats to unauthorized modification of the system BIOS remain. For example, these
guidelines do not prevent individuals with physical access to systems from modifying the system BIOS.
Nor do they guarantee the absence of vulnerabilities in the system BIOS implementations. The guidelines
on the system BIOS should be used in conjunction with organizations’ existing security policies and
procedures.

3.1.1    BIOS Update Authentication

The authenticated BIOS update mechanism employs digital signatures to ensure the authenticity of the
BIOS update image. To update the BIOS using the authenticated BIOS update mechanism, there shall be
a Root of Trust for Update (RTU) that contains a signature verification algorithm and a key store that
includes the public key needed to verify the signature on the BIOS update image. The key store and the
signature verification algorithm shall be stored in a protected fashion on the computer system and shall be
modifiable only using an authenticated update mechanism or a secure local update mechanism as outlined
in Section 3.1.2.

The key store in the RTU shall include a public key used to verify the signature on a BIOS update image
or include a hash [FIPS 180-3] of the public key if a copy of the public key is provided with the BIOS
update image. In the latter case, the update mechanism shall hash the public key provided with the BIOS
