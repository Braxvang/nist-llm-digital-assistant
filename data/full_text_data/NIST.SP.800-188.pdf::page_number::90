6.    Conclusion

Government agencies can use de-identifcation technology to make datasets available to
researchers and the public while minimizing the compromise of privacy of the people con-
tained within the data.
There are currently three primary models available for de-identifcation:
     1. Agencies can make data available with traditional de-identifcation techniques that
        rely on the suppression of identifying information (direct identifers) and the manip-
        ulation of information that partially identifes (quasi-identifers).
     2. Agencies can create synthetic datasets.
     3. Agencies can make data available through a query interface.
These models can be mixed within a single dataset to provide different kinds of access for
different users or intended uses.
Privacy protection can be strengthened when agencies employ formal models for privacy
protection, such as differential privacy, because the mathematical models that these sys-
tems use are designed to ensure privacy protection irrespective of future data releases or
developments in re-identifcation technology. However, the mathematics underlying these
systems is very new, and there is little experience within the Government in using these
systems. Thus, agencies should understand the implications of these systems before de-
ploying them in place of traditional de-identifcation approaches that do not offer formal
privacy guarantees.
Agencies that use de-identifcation should establish appropriate governance structures to
support de-identifcation, data release, and post-release monitoring. Such structures will
typically include a Disclosure Review Board as well as appropriate education, training,
and research efforts.
A summary of this documentâ€™s advice for practitioners appears in Figure 5.
In closing, it is important to remember that different jurisdictions may have different stan-
dards and policies regarding the defnition and use of de-identifed data. Information that
is considered de-identifed in one jurisdiction may be regarded as being identifable in an-
other.
