                                                                                        GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



 Risk Assessment and Management—Risk assessment is the process of analyzing and interpreting
  risk. It involves determining an assessment’s scope and methodology, collecting and analyzing risk-
  related data, and interpreting the risk analysis results. Collecting and analyzing risk data requires
  identifying assets, threats, vulnerabilities, safeguards, consequences, and the probability of a
  successful attack. Risk management is the process of selecting and implementing controls to reduce
  risk to a level acceptable to the organization.

 Standardized Configurations—Organizations should develop standardized secure configurations
  for widely used OSs and server software. This will provide recommendations to server and network
  administrators on how to configure their systems securely and ensure consistency and compliance
  with the organizational security policy. Because it only takes one insecurely configured host to
  compromise a network, organizations with a significant number of hosts are especially encouraged to
  apply this recommendation.

 Secure Programming Practices—Organizations should adopt secure application development
  guidelines to ensure that they develop their applications for servers in a sufficiently secure manner.

 Security Awareness and Training—A security training program is critical to the overall security
  posture of an organization. Making users and administrators aware of their security responsibilities
  and teaching the correct practices helps them change their behavior to conform to security best
  practices. Training also supports individual accountability, which is an important method for
  improving information system security. If the user community includes members of the general
  public, providing security awareness specifically targeting them might also be appropriate.

 Contingency, Continuity of Operations, and Disaster Recovery Planning—Contingency plans,
  continuity of operations plans, and disaster recovery plans are established in advance to allow an
  organization or facility to maintain operations in the event of a disruption. 8

 Certification and Accreditation—Certification in the context of information system security means
  that a system has been analyzed to determine how well it meets all of the security requirements of the
  organization. Accreditation occurs when the organization’s management accepts that the system
  meets the organization’s security requirements. 9

3.4     System Security Plan

The objective of system security planning is to improve protection of information system resources. 10
Plans that adequately protect information assets require managers and information owners—directly
affected by and interested in the information and/or processing capabilities—to be convinced that their
information assets are adequately protected from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or modification,
unavailability, and undetected activities.

The purpose of the system security plan is to provide an overview of the security and privacy
requirements of the system and describe the controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements.
The system security plan also delineates responsibilities and expected behavior of all individuals who
access the system. The system security plan should be viewed as documentation of the structured process
