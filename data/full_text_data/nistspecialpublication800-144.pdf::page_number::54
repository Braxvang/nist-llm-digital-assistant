          Compliance with various federal standards, OMB guidance, and public law imposes
          requirements that need to be addressed in the requirement analysis. The implications of
          some key laws and regulations were discussed in the previous chapter, but others abound.
          For example, if a public-facing aspect to the cloud implementation exists, OMB
          Memoranda M-10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization
          Technologies, and M-10-23, Guidance for Agency Use of Third-Party Websites and
          Applications, provide compliance guidance in terms of branding, PIA, policy, and other
          issues to be considered during planning. Compliance-related requirements, such as the
          protection of PII, may also be specific to an agency [Mcc10].22 Other requirements
          relevant to outsourcing exist, such as records management controls, accessibility, and
          user training, and should also be addressed. For example, Section 508 of the
          Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) establishes electronic and information
          technology requirements for accessibility to people with disabilities, including employees
          and members of the public.

          Reviewing common outsourcing provisions in existing cloud computing contracts that
          cover areas such as privacy and security standards, regulatory and compliance issues,
          service level criteria and penalties, change management processes, continuity of service
          provisions, and termination rights, can be helpful in formulating requirements [Ove10].
          Existing information technology outsourcing contracts in use by the organization can also
          be helpful.


             Fair Information Practice Principles. Fair Information Practices, also known as Privacy
             Principles, are the framework for most modern privacy laws around the world [Mcc10].
             The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), of which the
             U.S. is a member, adopted Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder
             Flows of Personal Data in 1980 [OECD80]. The guidelines provide a framework for
             privacy that has been referenced in U.S. Federal guidance and also internationally, and
             can be used by federal agencies to formulate their requirements and address privacy
             concerns during planning. The guidelines specify the following eight privacy principles:

             ▪ Collection Limitation. There should be limits to the collection of personal data and any
             such data should be obtained by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the
             knowledge or consent of the data subject.

             ▪ Data Quality. Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which they are to be
             used and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete and
             kept up-to-date.

             ▪ Purpose Specification. The purposes for which personal data are collected should be
             specified not later than at the time of data collection and the subsequent use limited to the

   For example, the Veterans Affairs Information Security Enhancement Act, Title IX of P.L. 109-461, requires the Veterans
Administration to implement agency-wide information security procedures to protect sensitive personal information (SPI) and
information systems. SPI includes any information that is maintained about the individual, such as education, financial transactions,
medical history, and criminal or employment history; and information that can be used to distinguish or trace the individual’s identity,
such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, and biometric records.
