If a client has multiple certificates that meet the requirements of the TLS server, the TLS client
(e.g., a browser) may ask the user to select from a list of certificates. The extended key usage
(EKU) extension limits the operations for which the keys in a certificate may be used, and so the
use of the EKU extension in client certificates may eliminate this request. If the EKU extension
is included in client certificates, then the id-kp-client-auth key purpose OID should be included
in the certificates to be used for TLS client authentication and should be omitted from any other
certificates.

Client certificates are also filtered by TLS clients on the basis of an ability to build a path to one
of the trust anchors in the hints list sent by the server as described in Section 3.5.4.

4.2.2     Obtaining Revocation Status Information for the Server Certificate

The client shall perform revocation checking of the server certificate. Revocation information
can be obtained by the client from one of the following locations:
