      NIST SP 800-171Ar3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                                       Assessing CUI Security Requirements
      November 2023


273       Introduction
274   The security assessment process gathers information and produces evidence to determine the
275   effectiveness of security requirements by:
276        •     Identifying potential problems or shortfalls in security and risk management programs;
277        •     Identifying security weaknesses and deficiencies in systems and the environments in
278              which those systems operate;
279        •     Prioritizing risk mitigation decisions and activities;
280        •     Confirming that identified security weaknesses and deficiencies in the system and
281              environment of operation have been addressed; and
282        •     Supporting continuous monitoring activities and providing information security
283              situational awareness.

284            Purpose and Applicability
285   The purpose of this publication is to provide procedures for assessing the security requirements
286   in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
287   (CUI) in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations [3]. Organizations can use the assessment
288   procedures to generate evidence to support the assertion that the security requirements have been
289   satisfied. The scope of the security assessments conducted using the procedures described in this
290   publication are guided and informed by the system security plans for systems that process, store,
291   or transmit CUI. The assessment procedures offer the flexibility to customize assessments based
292   on organizational policies and requirements, known threat and vulnerability information, system
293   and platform dependencies, operational considerations, and tolerance for risk. 1

294         Organization of This Publication
295   The remainder of this special publication is organized as follows:
296        •     Section 2 describes the fundamental concepts associated with assessments of security
297              requirements, including assessment procedures, methods, objects, and assurance cases
298              that can be created using evidence produced during assessments.
299        •     Section 3 provides assessment procedures for the security requirements in NIST SP 800-
300              171, including assessment objectives and potential assessment methods and objects for
301              each procedure.

302   The following sections provide additional information to support the protection of CUI in
303   nonfederal systems and organizations:

305        •     Appendix A: Acronyms

       The term risk refers to risks to organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals,
      other organizations, and the Nation. See NIST SP 800-39 [4] for additional information on organizational risk management and risk tolerance.
