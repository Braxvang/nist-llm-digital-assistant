GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



 Determine how the mail server will be managed (e.g., locally, remotely from the internal network,
  remotely from external networks).
 Decide if and how users will be authenticated and how authentication data will be protected.
 Identify any security or privacy requirements for address-related information, such as username, user
  identity, and organizational association.
 Determine how appropriate access to information resources will be enforced.
 Determine which mail server applications meet the organization’s requirements. Consider servers
  that may offer greater security, albeit with less functionality in some instances. Some issues to
  consider include the following:

    –   Cost

    –   Compatibility with existing infrastructure

    –   Knowledge of existing employees

    –   Existing manufacturer relationship

    –   Past vulnerability history

    –   Functionality
 Work closely with manufacturer(s) in the planning stage.
The choice of mail server application may determine the choice of operating system. However, to the
degree possible, mail server administrators should choose an operating system that provides the following
[Alle00]:

 Minimal exposure to vulnerabilities (which can be identified on all operating systems)
 Ability to restrict administrative or root level activities to authorized users only
 Ability to deny access to information on the server other than that intended to be available
 Ability to disable unnecessary network services that may be built into the operating system or server
  software
 Ability to log appropriate server activities to detect intrusions and attempted intrusions.
In addition, organizations should consider the availability of trained, experienced staff to administer the
server and server products. Many organizations have learned the difficult lesson that a capable and
experienced administrator for one type of operating environment is not automatically as effective for
another.

Given the sensitive nature of the mail server, it is critical that it is located in an area that provides a secure
physical environment. When planning the location of the mail server, the following items should be
considered:

 Does the proposed location offer the appropriate physical security protection mechanisms? Examples
  include locks, card reader access, security guards, and physical intrusion detection systems (e.g.,
  motion sensors, cameras).
