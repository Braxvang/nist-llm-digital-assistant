5         Other Existing Key Derivation Functions
In this section, several application-specific KDFs that are not specified in SP 800-
56A, SP 800-56B, SP 800-56C or SP 800-108, are considered. They do not follow the
extraction-then-expansion procedure in SP 800-56C or may not meet all the
specification requirements in either SP 800-56A, SP 800-56B or SP 800-108. The
following figure illustrates the application of these KDFs.

5.1    Key Derivation Functions in American National Standards (ANS)
       X9.42-2001 and ANS X9.63-2001
There are two hash-based KDFs specified in ANS X9.42-2001 and one hash-based
KDF specified in ANS X9.63-2001. These hash-based KDF specifications are similar
to (but not the same as) the specifications of the hash-based KDFs specified in SPs
800-56A and B. A shared secret that is generated during a key agreement scheme and
other non-secret values are used as input to the hash-based KDF to produce the
derived keying material for the application. A counter value is pre-pended to the
shared secret in the input to the hash-based KDFs in SPs 800-56A and B, but it is
appended to the shared secret in the input to the hash-based KDFs in ANS X9.42-
2001 and ANS X9.63-2001. Also, the identifiers of the communicating parties are
required in the input to the hash-based KDFs in SPs 800-56A and B, but optional in
ASN X9.42-2001 and ASN X9.63-2001.
