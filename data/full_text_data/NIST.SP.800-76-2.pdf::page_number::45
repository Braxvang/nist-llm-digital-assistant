      When multiple samples (e.g., two single finger minutiae views) are included in one record (e.g., an INCITS 378
      record) and the Creation Dates are different, the Creation Date shall be the earliest of the multiple views.
5.    The Validity Period contains two dates each of which shall be coded according to Normative Note 4.
      a.    The validity period should start at the time when the biometric data is available for use (e.g., according to
            policy or issuance considerations). It shall be no earlier than the Creation Date. Biometric applications (e.g.,
            authentication) should respect this date.
      b.    [FIPS 201-2] limits the lifetime for biometric data. For facial images, agencies might reduce those limits to
                        22
            eight years (Creation Date to closing date), but this might vary with technical or policy factors at agency
            discretion. Biometric ageing is considered to be a slow continuous process. This field therefore serves as an
            advisory that biometric data should be re-collected from the Cardholder at the next opportunity. This date is
            not intended to invalidate any function of the card (see [FIPS] for that).
6.    For PIV the Creator field has length 18 bytes of which the first K ≤ 17 bytes shall be printable ASCII characters, and
      the first of the remaining 18-K shall be a null terminator (zero).
7.    This field shall contain the 25 bytes of the FASC-N component of the CHUID identifier, per [800-73, 1.8.{3,4}]. The
      FASC-N field may be filled with zeroes in the one exceptional case where PIV registration images are being stored
      before a FASC-N has been assigned. In such instances, the digital signature shall be regenerated once the FASC-N
      is known.
8.    Iris quality may be set to [-2,100]. Note that formal standardization of iris image properties and quality metrics are
      pending in the ISO/IEC 29794-6 standard [IRISQUAL] with publications expected in late 2013 or early 2014. The
      value -2 indicates a failure to compute, and -1 indicates no attempt to compute quality.

9.3        The CBEFF Signature Block
The CBEFF_SIGNATURE_BLOCK contains the digital signature of the biometric data and thus facilitates the verification
of the integrity of the biometric data. The process of generating a CBEFF_SIGNATURE_BLOCK is described as follows.
The CBEFF_SIGNATURE_BLOCK shall be encoded as a CMS external digital signature as defined in [RFC5652]. The
digital signature shall be computed over the entire CBEFF structure except the CBEFF_SIGNATURE_BLOCK itself
(which means that it shall include the CBEFF_HEADER and the biometric records). The algorithm and key size
specifications for the digital signature shall be implemented according to [800-78].
The CMS encoding of the CBEFF_SIGNATURE_BLOCK is as a SignedData type, and shall include the following
information:
―     The message shall include a version field specifying version v3
―     The digestAlgorithms field shall be as specified in [SP 800-78]
―     The encapcontentInfo shall:
            −   Specify an eContentType of id-PIV-biometricObject
            −   Omit the eContent field
―     If the signature on the biometric was generated with the same key as the signature on the CHUID, the certificates
      field shall be omitted
―     If the signature on the biometric was generated with a different key than the signature on the CHUID, the
      certificates field shall include only a single certificate, which can be used to verify the signature in the SignerInfo
      field. The certificate shall be an X.509 digital signature certificate that has been issued in accordance with Section
      4.2.1 of FIPS 201-2
―     The crls field shall be omitted
―     signerInfos shall be present and include only a single SignerInfo
―     The SignerInfo shall:

  The eight year duration comes from a study of the effect of face ageing on recognition accuracy [FACEPERF]. Because face-
 based manual verification is common, this duration is adopted as a default. Iris seems to have longer-term stability [IREX-VI].
 There are no published studies of long term fingerprint stability.
