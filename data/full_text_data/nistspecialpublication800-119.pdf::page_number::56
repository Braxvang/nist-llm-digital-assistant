3.6       IPv6 and Routing

Routing protocols fall into two general types. Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) are designed for use
within an autonomous system (AS), that is, among routers that are all controlled by the same enterprise or
organization. Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs) are designed for exchanging routes between
autonomous systems, such as between network carriers or between a large enterprise and its network
service providers. To support IPv6, routing protocols, such as Routing Information Protocol (RIP),
OSPF, Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS), Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol
(EIGRP), and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), had to be updated. This section covers changes to routing
protocols, as well as security support for such protocols.

  3.6.1    Specification Overview

Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a link-state hierarchical Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP). Dijkstra’s
algorithm is used to calculate the shortest path tree. It uses path cost as its routing metric. Path cost is
determined generally by the speed (i.e., bandwidth) of a given route. IPv4 networks run OSPF version 2
(OSPFv2) as specified in RFC 2328.

OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3) is designed specifically for IPv6 and is specified in RFC 5340. OSPFv3 for
IPv6 is a completely independent routing protocol from OSPFv2 for IPv4. OSPFv3 expands on OSPFv2
to provide support for IPv6 routing prefixes and the larger size of IPv6 addresses. OSPF is commonly
used in large enterprise networks.

The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is a distance-vector routing protocol that employs hop count as a
routing metric. IPv4 uses RIP version 2 (RIPv2) as specified in RFC 2453. The IPv6 version of RIP is
standardized in RFC 2080. It is easy to configure, but offers limited flexibility and scalability. RIP
enhancements for IPv6, detailed in RFC 2080, also known as RIPng, include support for IPv6 addresses
and prefixes and the use of the all-RIP-routers multicast group address FF02::9 as the destination address
for RIP update messages. Each RIPng update contains a copy of the entire routing table. RIPng is suited
for networks of modest size only.

IS-IS is an IGP that advertises link-state information throughout the network to create a picture of the
network topology. IS-IS is an Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) hierarchical routing protocol that
designates an intermediate system as a Level 1 or Level 2 device. Level 2 devices route between Level 1
areas to create an intradomain routing backbone. Integrated IS-IS uses a single routing algorithm to
support several network address families, such as IPv6, IPv4, and OSI. It runs point to point over the link
layer protocol; it does not use IPv4 or IPv6. Each IS-IS update contains only changes to the network
topology. IS-IS is flexible, efficient, and suitable for large IPv4/IPv6 networks.

Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) is Cisco’s proprietary routing protocol. EIGRP is
an advanced distance-vector routing protocol, with optimizations to minimize both the routing instability
incurred after topology changes, as well as the use of bandwidth and processing power in the router.
EIGRP and IGRP are compatible with each other. EIGRP for IPv4 and EIGRP for IPv6 are configured
and managed separately.

BGP4 is the Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) used mainly to connect separate routing domains that
contain independent routing policies (autonomous systems). Connecting to a service provider for access
