risk of a standard that does not have provable privacy guarantees.27 If such determinations
are made, they should be clearly documented.
Prescriptive de-identifcation standards carry the risk that the standard may not suffciently
de-identify to avoid the risk of re-identifcation, especially as methodology advances and
more data sources become available. A second risk is that different agencies (or govern-
ments) may adopt inconsistent rules. In such cases, information that is legally de-identifed
for one purpose or in one jurisdiction may not be legally de-identifed in another.

3.7.3.    Risk-Based De-Identifcation Standards
Risk-based de-identifcation standards specify the properties that de-identifed data must
have rather than the process that was used to create the de-identifed data. For example,
under the “Expert Determination” method of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, a technique for de-
identifying is suffcient if an appropriate expert applying generally accepted statistical and
scientifc principles and methods “determines that the risk is very small that the information
could be used, alone or in combination with other reasonably available information, by an
anticipated recipient to identify an individual who is a subject of the information” [118].
The rule requires that experts document their methods and the results of their analyses.
Risk-based standards have the advantage of allowing users many different ways to solve
a problem by leaving room for innovation. Another advantage is that they can require the
desired outcome rather than specifying an aspirational mechanism.
There are two fundamental challenges with the risk-based approach:
    • This approach depends on having experts with knowledge of all prior releases of
      related data.
    • The assurance that the experts provide may not be valid if additional data are released
      or come to light.
Risk-based standards should be suffciently detailed to perform in a manner that is reliable
and repeatable. For example, standards that call for the use of experts can specify how an
expert’s expertise should be determined. Standards that call for the reduction of risk to an
acceptable level should provide a procedure for determining that level.

3.8.     Education, Training, and Research
De-identifying data in a manner that preserves privacy can be a complex mathematical, sta-
tistical, administrative, and data-driven process. Frequently, the opportunities for identity
disclosure will vary from dataset to dataset. Privacy-protecting mechanisms developed for
27 For example, while the HIPAA Safe Harbor method does not have provable privacy guarantees, it provides

 guidance that is fairly easy to follow. However, it also adds that “(ii) The covered entity does not have actual
 knowledge that the information could be used alone or in combination with other information to identify
 an individual who is a subject of the information” [119].
