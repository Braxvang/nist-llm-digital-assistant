NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                     Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
December 2023                                                                            and Derived PIV Credential Issuers


   Identifier                                  Issuer Control                                              Source

                Card are revoked. The certificates corresponding to the digital signature
                and key management keys are also revoked, if present.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                   (i) In the case of reissuance and termination, the requirement that the
                       PIV Card is collected and destroyed whenever possible is
                       documented and performed (review, observe).
                  (ii) The issuer has procedures to notify the CA in the event that the PIV
                       Card cannot be collected (review, observe).
     MP-3       During PIV Card reissuance and termination, (i) normal revocation             [FIPS201], Sec. 2.9.1 – PIV
  (UPDATED)     procedures are completed within 18 hours of notification if the issued PIV    Reissuance Requirements
                Card cannot be collected and destroyed, and (ii) any databases maintained
                by the PIV Card issuer that indicate current valid (or invalid) FASC-N or     [FIPS201], Sec. 2.9.4 – PIV Card
                card UUID values are updated to reflect the change in status.                 Termination Requirements

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                   (i) Documentation includes the requirement that if a PIV Card cannot
                       be collected and destroyed, normal revocation procedures are
                       completed within 18 hours of notification (review).
                  (ii) If the PIV Card cannot be collected and destroyed, normal
                       revocation procedures are completed within 18 hours of notification
                       (observe).
                 (iii) Databases maintained by the issuer indicate that the FASC-N or
                       card UUID values are updated to reflect the change in status
                       (review, observe).
     MP-4       During PIV Card termination, the following actions are taken: (i) the PIV      [FIPS201], Sec. 2.9.4 – PIV Card
  (UPDATED)     Card is collected and destroyed; (ii) per OPM guidance, the Central            Termination Requirements
                Verification System is updated to reflect the change in status; and (iii) card
                management systems are updated to reflect the PIV Card termination and
                method of termination (e.g., PIV Card destruction for collected PIV Cards or
                certificate revocations for uncollected PIV Cards).

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                   (i) The PIV Card is collected and destroyed, if available (review,
                       observe).
                  (ii) The Central Verification System is updated to reflect the change in
                       status (observe).
                 (iii) Card management systems are updated to reflect the PIV Card
                       termination and method of termination (review, observe).
     MP-5       Upon PIV Card termination, the organization enforces a standard               Commonly accepted security
                methodology of updating systems of records to indicate the PIV Card           readiness measures
                status. This information is distributed effectively throughout the systems
                used for physical and logical access to organizational facilities and
                resources.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                   (i) The issuing facility has procedures to update information systems
                       and disseminate information to indicate PIV Card termination
                       (review).
                  (ii) The organization’s information systems are updated to indicate PIV
                       Card termination (observe).
