                                     ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



10.     Summary of Concepts and Recommendations

This section summarizes the major concepts and recommendations presented in Sections 2 through 8 of
this document. It provides a summary of the major IEEE 802.11 network components and terms, an
overview of IEEE 802.11i security, and an introduction to the product certification programs from the
Wi-Fi Alliance. It also discusses the operation of a Robust Security Network (RSN) and outlines a
recommended life cycle for IEEE 802.11 RSN deployment. Finally, it provides additional
recommendations for wireless local area network (WLAN) security.

10.1 IEEE 802.11 Concepts

WLANs usually are implemented as extensions to existing wired LANs, and are used by devices within a
fairly limited range, such as an office building. The need for interoperability among different brands of
WLAN products led to the development of various WLAN standards. IEEE 802.11 is the dominant
WLAN standard. The basic IEEE 802.11 network components and architectural models are as follows:

       Station (STA). A STA is a wireless endpoint device, such as a laptop, PDA, or mobile phone.
       Access Point (AP). An AP logically connects STAs with a distribution system, which is
        typically an organizationâ€™s wired network infrastructure. APs can also logically connect wireless
        STAs with each other without accessing a distribution system.
       Ad Hoc Mode. This is a wireless network configuration that does not use APs; STAs
        communicate directly with each other.
       Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS). An IBSS is a set of STAs configured in ad hoc mode.
       Infrastructure Mode. This wireless network configuration requires APs and is the most
        commonly used mode for WLANs. An AP connects wireless STAs to each other or to a
        distribution system.
       Basic Service Set (BSS). A BSS is composed of an AP and one or more STAs configured in
        infrastructure mode. A BSS is the basic building block of a WLAN.
       Distribution System (DS). A DS is an infrastructure, typically a wired LAN, that connects
        individual BSSs to each other.
       Extended Service Set (ESS). An ESS is a WLAN comprising more than one BSS connected by
        a DS.
10.2 IEEE 802.11i Security Overview

Also known as pre-RSN IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.11 technologies that rely on Wired Equivalent Privacy
(WEP) have several well-documented security problems that can be exploited to circumvent or adversely
impact access control and authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and availability. To address these,
IEEE amended IEEE 802.11 with 802.11i, which was approved in July 2004.

The IEEE 802.11i specification introduces the concept of a Robust Security Network (RSN), which is a
wireless network that allows the creation of RSN associations (RSNA) only. RSNAs are logical
connections between communicating IEEE 802.11 entities established through the IEEE 802.11i 4-Way
Handshake. RSNAs allow for the protection of data frames and provide enhanced security relative to the
flawed WEP. RSNAs provide the following security features for IEEE 802.11 WLANs:
