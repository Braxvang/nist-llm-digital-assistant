                                                                                         GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



 Access. All SSL VPNs allow the administrator to specify which users have access to the VPN
  services. User authentication might be done with a simple password through a Web form, or through
  more sophisticated authentication mechanisms.
 Capabilities. The administrator can specify the services to which each authorized user has access.
  For example, some users might have access to only certain Web pages, while others might have
  access to those Web pages plus other services.
Different SSL VPNs have very different administrative interfaces and very different capabilities for
allowing access and specifying allowed actions for users. For example, many but not all SSL VPNs allow
validation of users through the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Server (RADIUS) protocol. As
another example, some SSL VPNs allow the administrator to create groups of users who have the same
access methods and capabilities; this makes adding new users to the system easier than gateways that
require the administrator to specify both of these for each new user.

2.3   Summary

Section 2 describes the TCP/IP model and its layers—application, transport, network, and data link—and
explained how security controls at each layer provide different types of protection for TCP/IP
communications. SSL, a transport layer security control, can provide several types of protection for data,
depending on its configuration. The section describes SSL VPNs and highlights the two primary SSL
VPN architecture models (SSL portal VPNs and SSL tunnel VPNs). The following summarizes the key
points from Section 2:

 TCP/IP is widely used throughout the world to provide network communications. The TCP/IP model
  is composed of the following four layers, each having its own security controls that provide different
  types of protection:

        –   Application layer, which sends and receives data for particular applications. Separate
            controls must be established for each application; this provides a very high degree of control
            and flexibility over each application’s security, but it may be very resource-intensive.
            However, inventing new application layer security controls can create vulnerabilities.
            Another potential issue is that some applications may not be capable of providing such
            protection or of being modified to do so.

        –   Transport layer, which provides connection-oriented or connectionless services for
            transporting application layer services across networks. Controls at this layer can protect the
            data in a single communications session between two hosts. The most frequently used
            transport layer control is SSL, which most often secures HTTP traffic but is also used to
            implement VPNs. To be used, transport layer controls must be supported by both the clients
            and servers. SSL portal VPNs operate at the transport layer.

        –   Network layer, which routes packets across networks. Controls at this layer apply to all
            applications and are not application-specific, so applications do not have to be modified to
            use the controls. However, network layer controls provide less control and flexibility for
            protecting specific applications than transport and application layer controls. Network layer
            controls can protect both the data within packets and the IP information for each packet.
            IPsec VPNs operate at the network layer; since they can secure both TCP and UDP traffic,
            SSL tunnel VPNs operate as network layer VPNs.

        –   Data link layer, which handles communications on the physical network components. Data
            link layer controls are suitable for protecting a specific physical link, such as a dedicated
