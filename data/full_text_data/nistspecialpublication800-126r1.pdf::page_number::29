                The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



definitions SHALL be evaluated; all other classes of definitions (e.g., inventory class definitions) SHALL
NOT be evaluated.

4.6     SCAP Result Data Streams

An SCAP result data stream contains the results of the evaluation of one or more SCAP source data
streams by an SCAP product. Correlation and aggregation products such as security awareness incident
response tools may consume properly formatted SCAP result data streams to support organizational
reporting requirements.

For its filenames, every SCAP result data stream SHALL use two common locator prefixes that are
appended to the URL base of the deployed result file. The first locator prefix (a string followed by a
hyphen) SHALL be associated with a specific result data stream. The first locator prefix SHALL be
consistent between multiple evaluations of the same source content. The second locator prefix (a string
followed by a hyphen) MAY be used to differentiate among similar result data streams.

Every SCAP result data stream component SHALL have a filename comprised of the first locator prefix,
the second locator prefix, and the appropriate component suffix (as listed in Table 5), in that order. Each
component SHALL use the element specified in Table 5 as its document element.

                                                                <xccdf:Benchmark> or
           XCCDF Benchmark        xccdf-res.xml
                                                                <xccdf:TestResults>

4.7     XCCDF Results

Each XCCDF result data stream component SHALL comply with the XCCDF Results schema.

XCCDF test results SHALL be documented as the contents of an <xccdf:TestResult> element that
either stands alone as the root of an XML document or is embedded as a child-element of an
<xccdf:Benchmark> root element. In the former case, the <xccdf:TestResults> document
requires an embedded <xccdf:benchmark> element that identifies the associated benchmark. In the
latter case, the associated benchmark is the embedding benchmark; <xccdf:benchmark> elements
SHALL be ignored in <xccdf:TestResult> elements that are embedded in their associated
benchmark.

To be considered valid SCAP result content, the following conditions SHALL be met:

      1. One or more <xccdf:organization> elements SHALL be provided to indicate the
         organizational units responsible for applying the checklist.
