       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                      Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                                             and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

         Identifier                                 Issuer Control                                  Applicability            Source

                           (ii) The policy is consistent with the organization’s mission and
                                functions, [FIPS201], [SP800-157], and applicable laws,
                                directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance
                                (review).
                          (iii) The policy and procedures are approved by the federal
                                department or agency (review).
                          (iv) The organization periodically reviews and updates the policy
                                and procedures as required (review, interview).

1220   Some organizations may need to customize some of the issuer controls to meet their specific
1221   characteristics and mission needs. In such cases, the associated assessment procedures may also
1222   have to be customized or augmented to ensure proper implementation of the controls.

1223            Issuer Assessment Report
1224   The assessment report contains the results of the assessment in a format that facilitates reviewing
1225   by the DAO. The DAO SHALL evaluate the information in the assessment report in order to
1226   make a sound, credible decision regarding the residual risk of authorizing the operations of the
1227   issuer.
1228   Appendix E provides an assessment report template organized by authorization focus. For each
1229   issuer control, it SHALL document which entity is responsible for the implementation of that
1230   control (e.g., the organization or an external service provider) and whether the issuer control is at
1231   the organizational or facility level.
         Activation/Issuance Process

         Issuer Control Identifier — AI-7

         Control Description — Before the PIV Card is provided to the applicant, the operator performs a one-to-one comparison of the
         applicant against the biometric data records available on the PIV Card or in the PIV enrollment record. If the biometric verification
         decision is negative, or if no biometric data records are available, the cardholder provides two identity source documents (as
         specified in [FIPS201], Sec. 2.7), which are inspected and compared by the operator with the photograph printed on the PIV Card.

         Control Owner/ Control Level — External Service Provider/Facility Level

         ASSESSMENT DETAILS

                      Assessment Method(s):

                      Review: Operations Plan

                      Observe: Activation/Issuance Process

         Assessment Result — Partially Satisfied

         Assessment Findings — There is operational evidence that a one-to-one comparison of the applicant against the biometric data
         records available on the PIV Card or in the PIV enrollment record is carried out before the card is released to the applicant.

         Assessment Deficiency and Potential Impact — The requirement to carry out this task is not documented clearly enough in the
         operations plan. Although personnel are knowledgeable about this requirement and the task was observed to be performed
         correctly during card issuance, the lack of documentation could be a problem if there is turnover in staff. Alternate processes when
         a biometric match is unsuccessful are not in place.

         Recommendation — Update the issuance process description within the operations plan to include a clear description of this task in
         the process, and develop alternate processes for issuance when the biometric match is not successful.
