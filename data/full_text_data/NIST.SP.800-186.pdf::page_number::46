Appendix C. Generation Details for Recommended Elliptic Curves

C.1.   General Cryptographic Criteria
All curves recommended in this specification satisfy the following general cryptographic criteria:
   1. Underlying finite field. The underlying finite field GF(q) shall be either a prime field or q
      = 2m, where m is a prime number.
   2. Curve order. Each curve E defined over the finite field GF(q) shall have order |E| = h⋅n,
      where n is a large prime number, h is co-prime with n, and h is small (h is called the
      cofactor of E). Each curve shall have cofactor h ≤ 210.
   3. Base point. Each curve E shall have a fixed base point G of prime order n.
   4. Avoiding anomalous curve attack. Each curve E defined over the finite field GF(q) shall
      have order |E| ≠ q so as to avoid attacks using additive transfers.
   5. Large embedding degree. The elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem in E can be
      converted to an ordinary discrete logarithm problem defined over the finite field GF(qk),
      where k is the smallest positive integer so that qk ≡ 1 mod n, called the embedding degree.
      Each curve shall have embedding degrees k ≥ 210. All of the elliptic curves specified in
      this document have much larger embedding degrees that are close to the order n (which is
      typical for elliptic curves).
   6. Endomorphism field. For each curve E over GF(q) with trace t, the (negative) number
      Disc = t2 − 4q is closely related to the discriminant of the endomorphism field of E. As of
      the publication of this document, there is no technical rationale for imposing a large
      lower bound on the square-free part of |Disc|, although this value is often large except for
      curves used in pairing-based cryptography. This Recommendation does not impose
      restrictions on the value of the square-free part of |Disc|.

C.1.1. Implementation Security Criteria
Each field shall have a fixed representation.

C.2.   Curve Generation Details

C.2.1. Weierstrass Curves Over Prime Fields

C.2.1.1.          Curves P-224, P-256, P-384, P-521
Each of the curves P-224 (Section 3.2.1.2), P-256 (Section 3.2.1.3), P-384 (Section 3.2.1.4), and
P-521 (Section 3.2.1.5) is a curve Wa,b in short-Weierstrass form with prime order (and, thus,
cofactor h = 1). Each curve is defined over a prime field GF(p) where the prime number is of a
special form to allow efficient modular reduction (see Appendix G.1).
The NIST prime curves were generated using the procedure in Appendix C.3.1 with hdigest =
160 and SHA-1 hash function.
