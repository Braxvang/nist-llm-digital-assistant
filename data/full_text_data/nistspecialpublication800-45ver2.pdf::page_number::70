GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



the resources located within it to both internal and external users. There are a wide variety of DMZ
configurations, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

Creating a DMZ involves placing a firewall between an organization’s border router and its internal
network, and creating a new network segment that can only be reached through the DMZ device. The
mail server or mail gateway is placed on the new segment, along with other network infrastructure
components and servers that need to be externally accessible. For example, if Web-based mail access is
offered, the associated servers are typically placed on the DMZ. In some configurations, the border router
itself may act as a basic firewall. Figure 7.1 illustrates an example of this simple DMZ using a router
with access control lists (ACL) to restrict certain types of network traffic to and from the DMZ.

A single-firewall DMZ is a low-cost approach, since the organization needs only to add a single firewall
and use its existing border router to provide protection to the DMZ. It is usually appropriate only for
small organizations that face a minimal threat. The basic weakness in the approach is that while the
router is able to protect against most network attacks, it is not “aware” of the mail server application layer
protocols (e.g., SMTP, POP, IMAP) and thus cannot protect against application layer attacks aimed at the
mail server. In addition, a router cannot provide any virus scanning of incoming email. A superior
approach is to add a second firewall between the Internet and the DMZ, as shown in Figure 7.2.
