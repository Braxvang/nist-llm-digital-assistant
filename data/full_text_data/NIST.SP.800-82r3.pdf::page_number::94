NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

5.2.5.1.       Application Allowlisting
Application allowlisting technologies provide an additional protection mechanism on hosts by
restricting which applications are allowed to execute. When properly configured, non-authorized
applications will not execute on the host environment.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            The relatively static nature of OT environments presents an opportunity
            for organizations to include application allowlisting as part of their
            defense-in-depth strategy and is a recommended best practice by DHS.
            When considering application allowlisting within an OT environment,
            organizations should coordinate with their vendors and review available
            implementation guidance, such as NIST SP 800-167, Guide to
            Application Whitelisting [SP800-167]; Guidelines for Application
            Whitelisting in Industrial Control Systems; or relevant guidance for their
            industry. The configurations and policies should be thoroughly tested
            before being deployed to ensure that the rules and settings properly
            support organizational security objectives.

5.2.5.2.       Patching
Patches have two main purposes: to address vulnerabilities and to enhance functionality. In the
context of defense-in-depth software security, patching is associated with reducing
vulnerabilities. As a result, patch management is a defense-in-depth capability that supports
vulnerability management as part of an organizational risk management strategy.
Deploying patches to OT environments requires additional considerations for organizations,
including testing and validation to ensure that the patches do not impact operational capabilities
or safety. OT operational requirements can also impact the frequency with which patches are
applied. For example, some OT environments must run nearly continuously for extended periods
of time or have small maintenance windows for applying approved updates. Additionally,
patching older OT components that run on unsupported OSs may not be an option. In these
cases, organizations may want to consider updating their OSs or investing in additional controls
that can protect the environment from attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities. Some tools,
such as web application firewalls (WAF) and IPS, could be configured to provide additional
protection to detect or prevent attacks against unpatched vulnerabilities while the organization
waits for an opportunity to apply the updates. Other tools, such as bump-in-the-wire security
devices, can be installed in line with devices that cannot be updated or are using obsolete
operating systems.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Whenever possible, patches should be tested on a sandbox system (i.e.,
            test environment) to ensure that they do not cause problems before being
            deployed into a production system. Organizations should plan patches
            and updates during scheduled maintenance windows for the environment
            and have a recovery plan for the OT component or system being patched.
