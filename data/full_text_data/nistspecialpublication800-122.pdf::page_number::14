                                   GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



Organizations are required to identify all PII residing within their organization or under the control of
their organization through a third party (e.g., a system being developed and tested by a contractor).
Organizations should use a variety of methods to identify PII. Privacy threshold analyses (PTAs), also
referred to as initial privacy assessments (IPAs), are often used to identify PII. 19 Some organizations
require a PTA to be completed before the development or acquisition of a new information system and
when a substantial change is made to an existing system. PTAs are used to determine if a system contains
PII, whether a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is required, whether a System of Records Notice
(SORN) is required, and if any other privacy requirements apply to the information system. PTAs are
usually submitted to an organization‘s privacy office for review and approval. PTAs are comprised of
simple questionnaires that are completed by the system owner in collaboration with the data owner.
PTAs are useful in initiating the communication and collaboration for each system between the privacy
officer, the information security officer, and the information officer. Other examples of methods to
identify PII include reviewing system documentation, conducting interviews, conducting data calls, using
data loss prevention technologies (e.g., automated PII network monitoring tools), or checking with system
and data owners. Organizations should also ensure that retired hardware no longer contains PII and that
proper sanitization techniques are applied. 20

2.2      Examples of PII Data

The following list contains examples of information that may be considered PII.

 Name, such as full name, maiden name, mother‘s maiden name, or alias
 Personal identification number, such as social security number (SSN), passport number, driver‘s
  license number, taxpayer identification number, patient identification number, and financial account
  or credit card number 21
 Address information, such as street address or email address
 Asset information, such as Internet Protocol (IP) or Media Access Control (MAC) address or other
  host-specific persistent static identifier that consistently links to a particular person or small, well-
  defined group of people
 Telephone numbers, including mobile, business, and personal numbers
 Personal characteristics, including photographic image (especially of face or other distinguishing
  characteristic), x-rays, fingerprints, or other biometric image or template data (e.g., retina scan, voice
  signature, facial geometry)
 Information identifying personally owned property, such as vehicle registration number or title
  number and related information
 Information about an individual that is linked or linkable to one of the above (e.g., date of birth, place
  of birth, race, religion, weight, activities, geographical indicators, employment information, medical
  information, education information, financial information).

      Some organizations have similar processes in place and do not call them PTA or IPA. For example PTA/IPA templates, see
      http://www.usdoj.gov/opcl/initial-privacy-assessment.pdf or
      http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/privacy/privacy_pta_template.pdf.

      http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-88/NISTSP800-88_rev1.pdf.

      Partial identifiers, such as the first few digits or the last few digits of SSNs, are also often considered PII because they are
      still nearly unique identifiers and are linked or linkable to a specific individual.
