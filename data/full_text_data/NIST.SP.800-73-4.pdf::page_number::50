Appendix B–– PIV Authentication Mechanisms

To provide guidelines on the usage and behavior supported by the PIV Card, PIV authentication
mechanisms and application scenarios are described in this section. FIPS 201 describes PIV
authentication as “the process of establishing confidence in the identity of the cardholder presenting a
PIV Card.” The fundamental goal of using the PIV Card is to authenticate the identity of the
cardholder to a system or person that is controlling access to a protected resource or facility. This end
goal may be reached by various combinations of one or more of the validation steps described below:

Card Validation (CardV) — This is the process of verifying that a PIV Card is authentic (i.e., not a
counterfeit card). Card validation mechanisms include:

    +   visual inspection of the tamper-proofing and tamper-resistant features of the PIV Card as per
        Section 4.1.2 of FIPS 201;
    +   use of cryptographic challenge-response schemes with symmetric keys; and
    +   use of asymmetric authentication schemes to validate private keys embedded within the PIV
        Card.
Credential Validation (CredV) — This is the process of verifying the various types of credentials
(such as visual credentials, CHUID, biometrics, and certificates) held by the PIV Card. Credential
validation mechanisms include:

    +   visual inspection of PIV Card visual elements (such as the photo, the printed name, and rank,
        if present);

    +   verification of certificates on the PIV Card;

    +   verification of signatures on the PIV biometrics and the CHUID;

    +   checking the expiration date; and

    +   checking the revocation status of the credentials on the PIV Card.

Cardholder Validation (HolderV) — This is the process of establishing that the PIV Card is in the
possession of the individual to whom the card has been issued. Classically, identity authentication is
achieved using one or more of these factors: a) something you have, b) something you know, and c)
something you are. The assurance of the authentication process increases with the number of factors
used. In the case of the PIV Card, these three factors translate as follows: a) something you have –
possession of a PIV Card, b) something you know – knowledge of the PIN, and c) something you are
– the visual characteristics of the cardholder, and the live fingerprint or iris image samples provided
by the cardholder. Thus, mechanisms for PIV cardholder validation include:

    +   presentation of a PIV Card by the cardholder;

    +   matching the visual characteristics of the cardholder with the photo on the PIV Card;

    +   matching the PIN provided with the PIN on the PIV Card; and
