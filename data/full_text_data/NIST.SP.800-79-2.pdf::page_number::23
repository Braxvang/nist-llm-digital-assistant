Special Publication 800-79-2                           Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                        and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



assessment, must understand their roles in the process, and must be made available in accordance
with the planned assessment schedule.

The OIMO must ensure that all relevant documentation has been completed and organized
before the assessment begins. This documentation includes policies and procedures,
organizational structure, information system architecture, product and vendor details, and
specifics regarding the implementation of all the requirements from FIPS 201-2 and related
publications. If the issuer has outsourced functions to an external service provider, all necessary
documentation must be obtained from the provider regarding the outsourced operations. Before
providing any documentation to the assessment team, the OIMO must review it to make certain it
is complete, current and approved.

Another significant activity during the assessment is the observation by the assessment team of
actual processes performed by the issuer. In order for the assessment team to confirm that
processes are implemented in accordance with the operations plan, the issuer organization will
need to ensure that assessment team members have access to facilities, and are able to observe
PIV processes in real time. This could include scheduling activities to observe identity proofing,
adjudication, card/token production, activation/issuance, and maintenance processes.

In order to aid the issuer’s planning and preparation for the assessment, Appendix C includes an
issuer readiness review checklist. This checklist contains items needed during the assessment
process. Satisfying the list of items before the assessment commences will facilitate efficient
utilization of the assessment team’s time, and will contribute towards the overall effectiveness of
the assessment activity.

2.8.2 Assessment Team Duties
The independence of the assessment team is an important factor in assessing the credibility of the
assessment results. In order to ensure that the results of the assessment are impartial and
unbiased, the members of the assessment team must not be involved in the development, day-to-
day maintenance, and operations of the issuer, or in the removal, correction, or remediation of
deficiencies.

The assessment team may obtain information during an assessment that the organization does not
want to disclose publicly. The assessment team has an obligation to safely and securely store and
protect the confidentiality of all security assessment related records and information, including
limiting access to the individuals that need to know the information. When using, storing, and
transmitting information related to the assessment, the assessment team shall follow the
guidelines established by the organization in addition to all relevant laws, regulations, and
standards regarding the need, protection, and privacy of information.

2.9 Authorization Decisions

An authorization decision is a judgment made by the DAO regarding authorizing operation of an
issuer and its facilities. The DAO reviews the results of the assessment, considers the impact to
the organization of any identified deficiencies, and then decides whether to authorize the
operation of the issuer and its facilities. In doing so, the DAO agrees to accept the security and
privacy risks of organization in issuing and maintaining PIV Cards or Derived PIV Credentials.
