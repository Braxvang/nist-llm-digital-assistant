                                                 Federal Information Systems and Organizations




 Coverage                     An attribute associated with an assessment method that addresses
 [NISTIR 7298]                the scope or breadth of the assessment objects included in the
                              assessment (e.g., types of objects to be assessed and the number
                              of objects to be assessed by type). The values for the coverage
                              attribute, hierarchically from less coverage to more coverage, are
                              basic, focused, and comprehensive.

 Data Loss                    The exposure of proprietary, sensitive, or classified information
                              through either data theft or data leakage.

 Depth                        An attribute associated with an assessment method that addresses
 [NISTIR 7298]                the rigor and level of detail associated with the application of the
                              method. The values for the depth attribute, hierarchically from
                              less depth to more depth, are basic, focused, and comprehensive.

 Domain                       An environment or context that includes a set of system resources
 [CNSSI 4009]                 and a set of system entities that have the right to access the
                              resources as defined by a common security policy, security
                              model, or security architecture. See Security Domain.

 Environment of Operation     The physical surroundings in which an information system
 [NISTIR 7298]                processes, stores, and transmits information.

 Examine                      A type of assessment method that is characterized by the process
 [NISTIR 7298]                of checking, inspecting, reviewing, observing, studying, or
                              analyzing one or more assessment objects to facilitate
                              understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence, the
                              results of which are used to support the determination of security
                              control effectiveness over time.

 Executive Agency             An executive department specified in 5 U.S.C., Sec. 101; a
 [41 U.S.C., Sec. 403]        military department specified in 5 U.S.C., Sec. 102; an
                              independent establishment as defined in 5 U.S.C., Sec. 104(1);
                              and a wholly owned Government corporation fully subject to the
                              provisions of 31 U.S.C., Chapter 91.

 Expected Output              Any data collected from monitoring and assessments as part of
                              the ISCM strategy.

 Federal Agency               See Executive Agency.

 Federal Information          An information system used or operated by an executive agency,
 System                       by a contractor of an executive agency, or by another
 [40 U.S.C., Sec. 11331]      organization on behalf of an executive agency.

 High-Impact System           An information system in which at least one security objective
 [FIPS 200]                   (confidentiality, integrity, or availability) is assigned a FIPS 199
                              potential impact value of high.
