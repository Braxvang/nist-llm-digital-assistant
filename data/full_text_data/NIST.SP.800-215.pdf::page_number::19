NIST SP 800-215                                                             Guide to a Secure Enterprise
November 2022                                                                       Network Landscape

       (HTTP), came into existence. A feature advancement in this class of firewalls is
       advanced Uniform Resource Locator (URL) filtering. This is the ability to detect traffic
       from malicious URLs and prevent web-based threats and attacks by receiving real-time
       data analyzed by machine learning algorithms [7][8]. Specifically, this class of firewalls
       can inspect threat vectors for SQL Injection, operating system (OS) command injections,
       and cross-site scripting attacks, as well as prevent inbound attacks. They are used in
       content delivery networks (CDN) and to prevent distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
       attacks. Some additional features found in this class of firewalls are:
           a. Ability to specify an allowable list of services (control at the application level)
           b. Traffic matches the intent of allowed ports
           c. Filtering of some unwanted protocols

       Appliance-set with Integrated Functions
   •   Unified threat management (or UTMs): UTM devices combine many of the most critical
       security functions – firewall, IPS, VPN concentrator, gateway antivirus, content filtering,
       and WAN load balancing – into a single device, usually with a unified management
       console.
   •   Next-generation firewall (NGFW): The distinguishing feature of NGFW is application
       data awareness. It can look at data not only at layers 3 and 4 of an Open Systems
       Interconnection (OSI) stack but also at layer 7 – the application level. Its capabilities
       extend beyond packet filtering and stateful inspection. There are multiple deployment
       options available for NGFWs, such as an appliance in the data center, as a software
       running in a VM in a cloud, or as a cloud service (FWaaS). Some capabilities of NGFW
       include [9]:
           a. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)
           b. TLS decryption and inspection of packet payload
           c. Intrusion prevention system (IPS) feature
   •   Web application and API protection (WAAP): This is a comprehensive security approach
       and an enhancement over WAF. WAF is an integral component for API security, BOT
       (abbreviation for Robot) defense, and DDOS protection.
           a. These can be offered as a product suite or as a cloud-based service [10][11].
           b. Secure web gateway (SWGs): SWGs are appliances utilized for policy-based
              access to and control of cloud-based applications as well as governance of access
              to the open web for enterprise users in ubiquitous locations (e.g., headquarters,
              branch offices, home, remote locations). An SWG is fundamentally a web filter
              that protects outbound user traffic through HTTP or Hypertext Transfer Protocol
              Secure (HTTPS) inspection [12]. It also protects user endpoints from web-based
              threats that can occur when users click on links to malicious websites or to
              websites infected with malware. They centralize control, visibility, and reporting
              across many locations and types of users. They are not a replacement for WAFs,
