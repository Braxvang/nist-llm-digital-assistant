       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                            Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                              Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1446   collection and maintenance of PII or other attributes necessary to conduct identity
1447   proofing.
1448   The SAOP can similarly assist the agency in determining whether a PIA is required.
1449   These considerations should not be read as a requirement to develop a Privacy Act SORN
1450   or PIA for identity proofing alone; in many cases it will make the most sense to draft
1451   a PIA and SORN that encompasses the entire digital identity lifecycle or includes the
1452   identity proofing process as part of a larger, programmatic PIA that discusses the program
1453   or benefit to which the the agency is establishing online access.
1454   Due to the many components of the digital identity lifecycle, it is important for the
1455   SAOP to have an awareness and understanding of each individual component. For
1456   example, other privacy artifacts may be applicable to an agency offering or using proofing
1457   services such as Data Use Agreements, Computer Matching Agreements, etc. The SAOP
1458   can assist the agency in determining what additional requirements apply. Moreover, a
1459   thorough understanding of the individual components of digital authentication will enable
1460   the SAOP to thoroughly assess and mitigate privacy risks either through compliance
1461   processes or by other means.
