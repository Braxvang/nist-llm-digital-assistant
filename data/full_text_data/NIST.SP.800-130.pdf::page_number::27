4.1 Information Management Policy
An organization’s Information Management Policy specifies what information is to be
collected or created, and how it is to be managed. An organization’s management
establishes this policy using industry standards of good practices, legal requirements
regarding the organization’s information, and organizational goals that must be achieved
using the information that the organization will be collecting and creating.

An Information Management Policy typically identifies management roles and
responsibilities and establishes the authorization required for people performing these
information-management duties. It also specifies what information is to be considered
valuable and sensitive and how it is to be protected. In particular, this highest policy layer
specifies what categories of information need to be protected against unauthorized
disclosure, modification or destruction. These specifications form the foundation for an
Information Security Policy and dictate the levels of confidentiality, integrity,
availability, and source-authentication protections that must be provided for differing
categories of sensitive and valuable information.

4.2 Information Security Policy
An organization’s Information Security Policy is created to support and enforce portions
of the organization’s Information Management Policy by specifying in more detail what
information is to be protected from anticipated threats and how that protection is to be
attained. The rules for collecting, protecting, and distributing valuable and sensitive
