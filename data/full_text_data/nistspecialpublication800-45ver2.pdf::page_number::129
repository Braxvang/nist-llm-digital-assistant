                                                             GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



Completed                                         Action
            Firewall blocks (in conjunction with the intrusion detection or prevention system)
            IP addresses or subnets that the IDS or IPS reports are attacking the
            organizational network
            Firewall blocks known “blacklisted” networks or subnets, as identified by a
            trusted external security response center
            Firewall notifies the network administrator or mail server administrator of
            suspicious activity through an appropriate means
            Firewall provides content filtering and malware scanning
            Firewall is configured to protect against DoS attacks
            Firewall logs critical events
            Firewall and firewall operating system patched to latest or most secure level
            Intrusion detection and prevention systems
            IDPS configured to monitor traffic network traffic to and from the mail server
            IDPS configured to monitor changes to critical files on mail server (host-based
            IDPS or file integrity checker)
            IDPS configured to monitor the system resources available on the mail server
            host (host-based IDPS)
            IDPS blocks (in conjunction with the firewall) IP addresses or subnets that are
            attacking the organizational network
            IDPS notifies the necessary parties of suspected attacks through appropriate
            means according to the organization’s incident response policy and procedures
            IDPS configured to maximize detection with an acceptable level of false positives
            IDPS configured to log events and to capture packet header information for
            network events
            IDPS updated with new attack signatures frequently (e.g., on a daily to weekly
            basis, typically after testing the updates)
            Network switches
            Network switches are used to protect against network eavesdropping
            Network switches are configured in high-security mode to defeat ARP spoofing
            and ARP poisoning attacks
            Network switches are configured to send all traffic on network segment to
            network-based IDPS
