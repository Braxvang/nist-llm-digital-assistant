FAMILY: AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY                                                             CLASS: TECHNICAL


AU-1      AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY POLICY AND PROCEDURES

          Control:The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a formal,
          documented, audit and accountability policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
          management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and (ii)
          formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the audit and accountability
          policy and associated audit and accountability controls.
          Supplemental Guidance: The audit and accountability policy and procedures are consistent with
          applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The
          audit and accountability policy can be included as part of the general information security policy
          for the organization. Audit and accountability procedures can be developed for the security
          program in general, and for a particular information system, when required. NIST Special
          Publication 800-12 provides guidance on security policies and procedures.
          Control Enhancements: None.

AU-2      AUDITABLE EVENTS

          Control: The information system generates audit records for the following events: [Assignment:
          organization-defined auditable events].
          Supplemental Guidance: The purpose of this control is to identify important events which need to be
          audited as significant and relevant to the security of the information system. The organization
          specifies which information system components carry out auditing activities. Auditing activity
          can affect information system performance. Therefore, the organization decides, based upon a risk
          assessment, which events require auditing on a continuous basis and which events require auditing
          in response to specific situations. Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction,
          including at the packet level as information traverse the network. Selecting the right level of
          abstraction for audit record generation is a critical aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate
          the identification of root causes to problems. Additionally, the security audit function is
          coordinated with the network health and status monitoring function to enhance the mutual support
          between the two functions by the selection of information to be recorded by each function. The
          checklists and configuration guides at http://csrc.nist.gov/pcig/cig.html provide recommended lists
          of auditable events. The organization defines auditable events that are adequate to support after-
          the-fact investigations of security incidents. NIST Special Publication 800-92 provides guidance
          on computer security log management.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system provides the capability to compile audit records from multiple components
                throughout the system into a systemwide (logical or physical), time-correlated audit trail.
          (2)   The information system provides the capability to manage the selection of events to be audited by
                individual components of the system.
          (3)   The organization periodically reviews and updates the list of organization-defined auditable events.
