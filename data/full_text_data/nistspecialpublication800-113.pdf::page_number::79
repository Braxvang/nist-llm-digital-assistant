being preconfigured and already hardened by the vendor. Furthermore, support is more straightforward
because the device configuration is standardized.

7.2.6   Device Placement and Firewall Configuration

The organization adopts an internal SSL VPN approach for device placement. Access to TCP port 443 on
the SSL VPN for all external addresses is added to the corporate firewall; no other access rules are added
to the firewall. This is similar to the architecture shown in Figure 4-2.

7.2.7   Routing Policy

The organization prohibits split tunneling, so the remote access host sends all traffic destined for internal
subnets and the rest of the Internet through the VPN tunnel. Traffic destined for machines outside the
organization’s perimeter is blocked by the SSL VPN. In this case, attempts to go off the corporate
network directly from the user's system are blocked. Some SSL VPNs include hairpin proxies that allow
VPN users to leave the network, but only by traversing the SSL VPN gateway which has been set up as a
normal outgoing firewall.

The organization has a main headquarters location and several branch offices, but it only deploys SSL
VPN appliances at headquarters. All of the organization’s internal IT resources are available at
headquarters.

7.2.8   High Availability

The organization is pursuing a high availability strategy. The VPN appliance supports high availability
with an active/passive architecture. Configuration settings are mirrored across both devices, so any
configuration change made to the active device is automatically copied to the passive device’s
configuration. VPN session information is also mirrored; users do not have to reauthenticate after a
device failure, but existing TCP connections are broken and do have to be reestablished.

7.2.9   Management

The management policy for the VPN appliances is consistent with the organization’s security policy.
Administrative access is only supported on the appliance’s internal interface and is limited to a small set
of IP addresses. Accounts with limited administrative access are created and assigned to different groups,
such as one account that can review system logs and another account that can update the host integrity
checks to search for recent security updates.

Configuration settings are backed up each week to a central server. The organization also uses a set of
appliances for testing and staging. They are configured identically to the live units, and any updates or
patches are applied on them first.

The appliances are monitored by the organization’s network management system. The network
management system periodically pings the appliances’ IP addresses and polls the appliances’ SNMP
management information base (MIB). It compares data from the MIB with known operational values to
search for any potential operational issues.
