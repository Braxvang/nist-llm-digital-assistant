NIST SP 800-82r3                                                   Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

                       and the priorities and trade-offs considered as part of managing
                       risk
              In the context of OT, the potential for damage to equipment, human
              safety, the natural environment, and other critical infrastructures is part
              of these considerations. Organizations may need to consider evaluating
              the potential physical impacts for all parts of an OT system.
              Organizations may also need to determine how OT systems interact or
              depend on IT to support risk framing. These processes may require
              organizations to identify a common framework for evaluating impacts
              that incorporate OT considerations. One approach is based on NIST
              FIPS 199 [FIPS199], which specifies that systems are categorized as low
              impact, moderate impact, or high impact for the security objectives of
              confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Another approach that is based
              on ISA 62443-3-2 [ISA62443] provides example definitions for
              determining a system categorization utilizing OT impacts.
Table 3 provides possible example categories and impact levels that organizations may
customize to meet their specific industry or business requirements. For example, some
organizations may see an outage lasting up to one day as a having a high impact instead of
moderate, as shown in the table.
