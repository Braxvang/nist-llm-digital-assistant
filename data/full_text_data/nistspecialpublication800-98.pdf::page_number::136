GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



Forward Channel: The channel on which a reader transmits its signals.

Inter-Enterprise Subsystem: The portion of the RFID system that connects multiple enterprise
subsystems together. The inter-enterprise subsystem consists of network infrastructure, a naming service,
and possibly a discovery service. Inter-enterprise subsystems are most commonly associated with supply
chain applications.

Jamming: A deliberate communications disruption meant to degrade the operational performance of the
RF subsystem. Jamming is achieved by interjecting electromagnetic waves on the same frequency that
the reader to tag uses for communication.

Kill Command: A command that readers can send to tags that uses electronic disabling mechanisms to
prevent tags from responding to any additional commands.

Lock Command: A command that readers can send to a tag to block access to certain information on the
tag.

Lock Pointer: A memory pointer that points to a target area of memory and write protects all memory
locations less than the target location. This form of access control is implemented in ISO/IEC 18000-3.

Middleware: Software that aggregates and filters data collected by RFID readers and possibly passes the
information to an enterprise subsystem database. Middleware may also responsible for monitoring and
managing readers.

Minimalist Cryptography: Cryptography that can be implemented on devices with very limited
memory and computing capabilities, such as RFID tags.

Object Naming Service: An inter-enterprise subsystem for the EPCglobal Network that provides
network resolution services that direct EPC queries to the location where information associated with that
EPC can be accessed by authorized users.

Open System: A system that allows entities from different enterprises to access information related to
tags used in the system. Open systems use an inter-enterprise subsystem to share information between
entities.

Passive Tag: A tag that does not have its own power supply. Instead, it uses RF energy from the reader
for power. Due to the lower power, passive tags have shorter ranges than other tags, but are generally
smaller, lighter, and cheaper than other tags.

Permalock: A security feature that makes the lock status of an area of memory permanent. If the area of
memory is locked and permalocked, then that area is permanently locked. If the area of memory is
unlocked and permalocked, then that area is permanently unlocked.

Reader: A device that can wirelessly communicate with tags. Readers can detect the presence of tags as
well as send and receive data and commands from the tags.

Reader Spoofing: The act of impersonating a legitimate reader of an RFID system to read tags.

Reader Talks First: An RF transaction in which the reader transmits a signal that is received by tags in
its vicinity. The tags may be commanded to respond to the reader and continue with further transactions.
