manufacturer’s original distribution media and that the Web server data be restored from a known good
backup.

If legal action is pursued, system administrators need to be aware of the guidelines for handling a host
after a compromise. Consult legal counsel and relevant law enforcement authorities as appropriate.

9.4     Security Testing Web Servers

Periodic security testing of public Web servers is critical. Without periodic testing, there is no assurance
that current protective measures are working or that the security patch applied by the Web server
administrator is functioning as advertised. Although a variety of security testing techniques exists,
vulnerability scanning is the most common. Vulnerability scanning assists a Web server administrator in
identifying vulnerabilities and verifying whether the existing security measures are effective. Penetration
testing is also used, but it is used less frequently and usually only as part of an overall penetration test of
the organization’s network. 81

9.4.1     Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanners are automated tools that are used to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
of hosts. Many vulnerability scanners also provide information about mitigating discovered
vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability scanners attempt to identify vulnerabilities in the hosts scanned. Vulnerability scanners can
help identify out-of-date software versions, missing patches, or system upgrades, and they can validate
compliance with or deviations from the organization’s security policy. To accomplish this, vulnerability
scanners identify OSs and major software applications running on hosts and match them with known
vulnerabilities in their vulnerability databases.

However, vulnerability scanners have some significant weaknesses. Generally, they identify only surface
vulnerabilities and are unable to address the overall risk level of a scanned Web server. Although the
scan process itself is highly automated, vulnerability scanners can have a high false positive error rate
(reporting vulnerabilities when none exist). This means an individual with expertise in Web server
security and administration must interpret the results. Furthermore, vulnerability scanners cannot
generally identify vulnerabilities in custom code or applications.

Vulnerability scanners rely on periodic updating of the vulnerability database to recognize the latest
vulnerabilities. Before running any scanner, Web server administrators should install the latest updates to
its vulnerability database. Some databases are updated more regularly than others (the frequency of
updates should be a major consideration when choosing a vulnerability scanner).

Vulnerability scanners are often better at detecting well-known vulnerabilities than more esoteric ones
because it is impossible for any one scanning product to incorporate all known vulnerabilities in a timely
manner. In addition, manufacturers want to keep the speed of their scanners high (the more
vulnerabilities detected, the more tests required, which slows the overall scanning process). Therefore,
vulnerability scanners may be less useful to Web server administrators operating less popular Web
servers, OSs, or custom-coded applications.

Vulnerability scanners provide the following capabilities:
