APPENDIX H

STANDARDS AND GUIDANCE MAPPINGS
CROSSWALK BETWEEN NIST STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES AND SECURITY CONTROLS




T
       he mapping table in this appendix provides organizations with a two-way crosswalk
       between NIST security standards and guidance documents (i.e., the current version of the
       FIPS Publications and Special Publications in the 800- series) and the security controls in
the catalog of controls listed in Appendix F. The first crosswalk maps a specific NIST security
publication to the associated security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53 that are
relevant to that publication. The second crosswalk maps each security control in Special
Publication 800-53 to the appropriate NIST standards and guidance documents that apply to that
particular control. 55 The purpose of the crosswalk is to provide organizations with additional
useful information regarding security control selection and implementation. The two-way
crosswalk between publications and security controls and security controls and publications is not
intended to be exhaustive. In addition to providing useful information for organizations, the
crosswalk also indicates particular areas where additional security guidance might be needed.




55
   There are certain FIPS and NIST Special Publications that are listed in the crosswalk for a particular security control
in Appendix H that do not appear in the supplemental guidance for that control. The supplemental guidance for
security controls lists only the most relevant NIST publications associated with that control or the publications that
provide the most extensive guidance for that security control area.
