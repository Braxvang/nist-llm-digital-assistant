security classification. National security information is outside the scope of this guideline. The
recommended categorization for unclassified anti-terrorism information follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, High), (integrity, High), (availability, High)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of critical infrastructure
protection information on the ability of responsible agencies to monitor and assess the
leadership, motivations, plans, and intentions of foreign and domestic terrorist groups and their
state and non-state sponsors. The effects of unauthorized disclosure of this information can
reasonably be expected to jeopardize fulfillment of critical infrastructure protection missions.
The consequent threat to critical infrastructures, key national assets, and human life can be
catastrophic.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for critical infrastructure protection information is high.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Unauthorized
modification or destruction of information affecting critical infrastructure protection operations
may adversely affect mission operations and result in unacceptable damage to critical
infrastructures, damage to key national assets, or loss of human life.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
critical infrastructure protection information is high.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to critical infrastructure protection
information. Generally, critical infrastructure protection missions are not reliably tolerant of
delays. Significant degradation in mission capability and resultant catastrophic consequences
for critical infrastructures, key national assets, and/or human life may occur from disruption
of access to critical infrastructure protection information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
critical infrastructure protection information is high.

D.2.3 Catastrophic Defense Information Type

Catastrophic Defense involves the development of technological countermeasures (chemical,
biological, radiological and nuclear [CBRN]) to terrorist threats, conducting laboratory testing on
new and promising devices, and conducting basic and applied science that can lead to the
development of countermeasures. Under the provisions of Executive Order 13292, some anti-
terrorism information is subject to security classification. National security information is
