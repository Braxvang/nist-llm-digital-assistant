IMPERATIVE 7
Bolstering Infrastructure Protection

NIST is focusing on three major national critical infrastructure programs where effective
cybersecurity is a vital element: the internet infrastructure, Energy Infrastructure
Cybersecurity, and cybersecurity aspects of electronic voting.
     •    Internet Infrastructure Protection (IIP). NIST works with industry to develop the
          measurement science, new standards, and standards implementation capabilities
          necessary to ensure the resilience and security of the global Internet. In FY18,
          research focused on developing measurement and modeling techniques necessary
          to understand, predict, and control the behavior of internet-scale networked
          information systems, especially foundational routing and communications
          protocols. This includes the internet’s Domain Name System (DNS), Border
          Gateway Protocol (BGP), and electronic mail and messaging infrastructures. In
          addition, NIST has been giving special attention to systemic vulnerabilities in
          core internet technologies such as those that enable distributed denial-of-service
          (DDoS) attacks on a massive scale.
          In FY18, multiple NIST publications contributed to showing how to remedy serious
          security and robustness vulnerabilities in network infrastructures. Cybersecurity
          practice guides were developed with step-by-step example solutions using
          commercially available technologies. These included SP 1800-6,60 which shows
          how to combat spear phishing by improving assurance of the correctness of email
          sources, destinations, and cryptographic protection of email, and SP 1800-14,61
          which explains how service providers can better control routing of internet traffic.
          NIST also initiated a network infrastructure project to illustrate how to better
          manage cryptographic certificates in order to reduce system outage and security
          breach risks (SP 1800-16).62 In addition to completing ongoing network security
          activities in FY19, NIST plans to collaborate with government and private industry
          on a major feasibility demonstration effort for transitioning systems and services
          from IPv4 to improved IPv6 information transfer protocols.
