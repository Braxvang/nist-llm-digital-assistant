consideration and verification that they do not adversely impact the operational performance of
the OT.

OT Discussion: The organization selects an appropriate failure state. Preserving OT state
information includes consistency among OT state variables and the physical state that the OT
represents (e.g., whether valves are open or closed, communication permitted or blocked,
continue operations).
Rationale for adding SC-24 to MOD baseline: As part of the architecture and design of the OT,
the organization selects an appropriate failure state in accordance with the function performed by
the OT and the operational environment. The ability to choose the failure mode for the physical
part of OT differentiates OT systems from other IT systems. This choice may be a significant
influence in mitigating the impact of a failure since it may be disruptive to ongoing physical
processes (e.g., valves failing in closed position may adversely affect system cooling).
