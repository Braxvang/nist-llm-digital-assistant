Information security requirements defined in the segment architecture are implemented in the
solution architecture in the form of management, operational, and technical security controls. The
security controls are employed within or inherited by the individual information systems and the
environments in which the systems operate. The allocation39 of security controls is consistent with
the information security architecture as well as concepts such as defense-in-depth and defense-in-
breadth. Figure 3 illustrates the process of integrating information security requirements into the
enterprise architecture and the associated information systems supporting the mission/business
processes of organizations.

                      FIGURE 3: INFORMATION SECURITY REQUIREMENTS INTEGRATION

To summarize, risk management considerations can be addressed as an integral part of the
enterprise architecture by:
•    Developing a segment architecture linked to the strategic goals and objectives of
     organizations, defined missions/business functions, and associated mission/business
     processes;
•    Identifying where effective risk response is a critical element in the success of organizational
     missions and business functions;
•    Defining the appropriate, architectural-level information security requirements within
     organization-defined segments based on the organization’s risk management strategy;
•    Incorporating an information security architecture that implements architectural-level
     information security requirements;

  Security control allocation occurs down to the information system component level, employing security controls in
selected system components assigned to provide a specific security capability. Specific guidance on how to incorporate
information security requirements into enterprise architecture is provided in the FEA Security and Privacy Profile.
