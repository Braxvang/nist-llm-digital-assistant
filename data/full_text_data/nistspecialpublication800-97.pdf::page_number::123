                                    ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



9.      Case Studies

This section presents three case studies to illustrate how various issues discussed in Sections 3 through 8
might be addressed in practice. Although the case studies are hypothetical, they are intended to resemble
real-world problems and solutions. They do not cover all the aspects of system engineering or all the
technical implementation details that an organization should consider when implementing an IEEE
802.11 RSN; they provide a representative sample of the issues an organization may face. The case
studies are as follows:

 Case Study 1: First Time WLAN Deployment. This case study presents the scenario of an
  organization that planned to deploy a WLAN for the first time. With no existing WLAN
  infrastructure to replace or update, the organization methodically applied the best practices introduced
  in this guide.
 Case Study 2: Transitioning an Existing WLAN Infrastructure to RSN Technology. This case
  study discusses an organization that had implemented WLAN technology already but later wanted to
  migrate to a RSN framework. Having just experienced a major WLAN security breach, the
  organization felt that it must act quickly. To meet its needs, the organization developed and
  implemented first an interim WLAN solution, and then a long-term one.
 Case Study 3: Supporting Users Who Are Not Employees. This case study presents the scenario
  of an organization that planned a future WLAN deployment, whose WLAN user population will
  consist of many people who are not employees, or perhaps may not have any prior relationship with
  the organization. It created a security architecture that allows for access from a very diverse set of
  users. Supporting these users might not require an IEEE 802.11 RSN.
In each case study, the organization followed the information system development life cycle introduced in
NIST SP 800-64, Security Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle, and the best
practices discussed in Section 8.

9.1     Case Study 1: First Time WLAN Deployment

For several months, many of agency XYZ’s employees had requested the ability to read e-mail and access
Web sites when they were in the agency’s conference rooms. Several technically inclined users had
suggested that a WLAN solution could provide this functionality more effectively than wired
connectivity. The agency’s IT group initially resisted implementation of WLAN technology, citing
security concerns such as the vulnerabilities of WEP. These concerns were allayed substantially with the
final release of IEEE 802.11i and its RSN framework. Additionally, the IT group knew they could now
identify interoperable IEEE 802.11i-compliant products through the Wi-Fi Alliance’s WPA2-Enterprise
product certification program. Given these developments, the agency’s CIO commissioned an enterprise
WLAN deployment project in conjunction with other agency executives. The agency used the NIST SP
800-64 information system development life cycle model to guide the project, but excluded the
disposition phase because it would not occur until some time after the project had been completed.

9.1.1    Phase 1: Initiation

The first step in the project plan was to conduct a risk assessment that identified agency information
assets and the threats a new WLAN could pose to those assets. The assessment’s conclusion was that the
mission of the agency could be significantly impacted if external users were able to access the agency’s
internal network, and that a WLAN solution would need to provide reasonable protection against such
threats.
