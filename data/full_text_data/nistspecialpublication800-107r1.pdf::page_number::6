Conformance testing for implementations of this Recommendation will be conducted
within the framework of the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP) and
the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP). The requirements of this
Recommendation are indicated by the word “shall”. Some of these requirements may be
out-of-scope for CAVP and CMVP validation testing, and thus are the responsibility of
entities using, implementing, installing, or configuring applications that incorporate this
Recommendation.

3.1     Terms and Definitions


Adversary                 An entity that is not authorized to access or modify information,
                          or who works to defeat any protections afforded the
                          information.
Algorithm                 A clearly specified mathematical process for computation; a set
                          of rules that, if followed, will give a prescribed result.
Approved                  FIPS-approved and/or NIST-recommended. An algorithm or
                          technique that is either 1) specified in a FIPS or NIST
                          Recommendation, 2) adopted in a FIPS or NIST
                          Recommendation or 3) specified in a list of NIST-approved
                          security functions.
Approved hash             Hash algorithms specified in FIPS 180-4.

Bit string                An ordered sequence of 0 and 1 bits. In this Recommendation,
                          the leftmost bit is the most significant bit of the string. The
                          rightmost bit is the least significant bit of the string.
Bits of security          See security strength.

Block cipher              An invertible symmetric-key cryptographic algorithm that
                          operates on fixed-length blocks of input using a secret key and
                          an unvarying transformation algorithm. The resulting output
                          block is the same length as the input block.
Collision                 An event in which two different messages have the same
                          message digest.
Collision resistance      An expected property of a hash function whereby it is
                          computationally infeasible to find a collision, See “Collision”.
