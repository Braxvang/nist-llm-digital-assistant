336            Authentication Information Stored on the PIV Card

337   3.2.1. Specification of Digital Signatures on Authentication Information
338   FIPS 201-3 requires the use of digital signatures to protect the integrity and authenticity of
339   information stored on the PIV Card. FIPS 201-3 and NIST SP 800-73 require digital signatures
340   on the following objects stored on the PIV Card:
341       •    X.509 public key certificates,
342       •    The optional secure messaging card verifiable certificate (CVC),
343       •    The optional intermediate CVC,
344       •    The CHUID,
345       •    Biometric information (e.g., fingerprints), and
346       •    The NIST SP 800-73-4 Security Object.
347   Approved digital signature algorithms are specified in [FIPS186]. Table 2 provides specific
348   requirements for public key algorithms and key sizes, hash algorithms, and padding schemes for
349   generating digital signatures for digitally signed information stored on the PIV Card. Agencies
350   are cautioned that generating digital signatures with elliptic curve algorithms may initially limit
351   interoperability.

354   Note that RSA signatures may use either the PKCS #1 v1.5 padding scheme or the Probabilistic
355   Signature Scheme (PSS) padding as defined in [PKCS1]. The PSS padding scheme object
356   identifier (OID) is independent of the hash algorithm. The hash algorithm is specified as a
357   parameter (for details, see [PKCS1]).
358   The secure messaging CVC shall be signed using ECDSA (Curve P-256) with SHA-256 if it
359   contains an ECDH (Curve P-256) subject public key and shall be signed using ECDSA (Curve
360   P-384) with SHA-384 otherwise. The Intermediate CVC shall be signed using RSA with SHA-
361   256 and PKCS #1 v1.5 padding.
362   FIPS 201-3, NIST SP 800-73, and NIST SP 800-76 specify formats for the CHUID, the Security
363   Object, the biometric information, and X.509 public key certificates, which rely on OIDs to
364   specify which signature algorithm was used to generate the digital signature. The object
