The server certificate used in the SSL/TSL handshake (described in more detail in Section 7.5.5) specifies
the algorithm the certificate’s public key supports, the public key, and the key size. The certificate may
also describe its intended use (e.g., for generating digital signatures, encryption, or authentication).
During the handshake phase, the client indicates the cipher suites and key lengths it supports. Ultimately,
the choice of cipher suite and key length is dictated by the server.

Choosing an appropriate encryption algorithm depends on several factors that vary for each organization.
Although at first glance it might appear that the strongest encryption available should always be used, that
is not always true. The higher the level of the encryption, the greater impact it will have on the Web
server’s resources and communications speed. 59 Furthermore, a number of countries still maintain
restrictions on the export, import, and/or use of encryption. Patents and licensing issues may affect which
commercial encryption schemes can be used. Common factors that influence the choice of encryption
algorithm are as follows:

 Required security

      Value of the data (to either the organization and/or other entities—the more valuable the data, the
         stronger the required encryption)

57
     Triple DES is considerably slower than AES. For more information about DES and 3DES, see
     http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/cryptval/.
58
     For more information about the SHA and the associated Secure Hash Standard (SHS), see FIPS PUB 180-2, Secure Hash
     Standard, http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-2/fips180-2withchangenotice.pdf. NIST has recommended that the
     use of SHA-1 be phased out by 2010 in favor of SHA-224, SHA-256, and other larger, stronger hash functions. See
     http://csrc.nist.gov/hash_standards_comments.pdf for additional information.
59
     AES 128 is the exception to this rule because it provides higher performance and security than 3DES.
