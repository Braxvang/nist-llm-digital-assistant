1845          Assessment and Improvement of the CPLP
1846   An effective CPLP meets the needs of the learners and the organization by measuring and
1847   evaluating the performance of the Program on a continual basis. This requires up-to-date
1848   knowledge, awareness, and understanding of the legal and regulatory compliance requirements
1849   for the organization and the cybersecurity and privacy risks that may impact the organization.
1850   The Learning Program Manager works with organizational leaders, training staff, and learners to
1851   share performance reporting and decision-making throughout all phases of the CPLP. Both the
1852   analysis of organizational risks (e.g., employee responses to practical exercises) and review of
1853   the efficacy of material (e.g., learner feedback responses to courses) are important in the
1854   continual improvement of a CPLP in an evolving threat landscape.

1855          Steps for Assessing and Improving the CPLP
1856   The process for assessing and improving the CPLP may vary by organization and available
1857   resources. Consider the following steps before evaluating the CPLP’s performance, whether for
1858   the entire CPLP, per audience segment, or for a single CPLP element, such as a new training
1859   course:
1860      1. Create a CPLP Assessment Report
1861      2. Agree on the changes needed to the CPLP
1862      3. Evaluate budget requirements for program improvement
1863      4. Review and update the strategic plan
1864      5. Implement changes into the next revisions of the program elements and schedule

1865          Create a CPLP Assessment Report
1866   At the end of a campaign, each quarter, or annually, the Learning Program Manager should
1867   create a summary document that is suitable for review with senior leadership. This report will
1868   provide an analysis of attendance, feedback, measurements, and other metrics and help to
1869   identify action items, areas of improvement, and next steps. It should be tailored for the senior
1870   leadership reader, using language and framing that is appropriate. Avoid using technical jargon
1871   without explanation.
1872   Key elements of an Assessment Report include:
1873      •   Measurements and metrics
1874      •   Compliance information
1875      •   Evaluating CPLP effectiveness
1876      •   CPLP improvement efforts
1877   The Learning Program Manager will have established their Program Metrics Plan during the
1878   planning stage (see Section 2.4) and should strive to include a number of different quantitative
1879   and qualitative tools. Metrics are an important and effective tool for determining an
1880   organization’s cybersecurity and privacy learning needs. Metrics monitor the accomplishment of
1881   the program goals and objectives by quantifying the level of implementation, effectiveness, and
