While automation of IT security has the potential to significantly reduce the amount of time a
human must spend doing certain tasks, it is not possible to fully automate all of an organization's
information security program functions. The technologies discussed in Appendix D, for example,
still require human analysis for implementation and maintenance of the tools as well as
appropriate interpretation of findings. Similarly, these tools operate within the context of
processes designed, run, and maintained by humans. If individuals carry out their responsibilities
insecurely, then the effectiveness of the technologies is compromised, and the security of the
systems and the mission/business or organizational processes supported by those systems is put in
jeopardy.

Automation makes security-related information readily available in an environment where
ongoing monitoring needs change. Therefore, during security control implementation (RMF Step
3), consideration is given to the capabilities inherent in available technology to support ISCM as
part of the criteria in determining how best to implement a given control.

Consideration is given to ISCM tools that:

•    Pull information from a variety of sources (i.e., assessment objects22);

•    Use open specifications such as the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP);
•    Offer interoperability with other products such as help desk, inventory management,
     configuration management, and incident response solutions;

•    Support compliance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
     regulations, standards, and guidelines;
•    Provide reporting with the ability to tailor output and drill down from high-level, aggregate
     metrics to system-level metrics; and

•    Allow for data consolidation into Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools
     and dashboard products.
 Automation supports collecting more data more frequently and from a larger and more diverse
pool of technologies, people, processes, and environments. It can therefore make comprehensive,
ongoing control of information security practical and affordable. How effective the organization
is in utilizing the monitoring results (obtained in a manual or automated fashion) still depends
upon the organizational ISCM strategy, including validity and comprehensiveness of the metrics,
as well as the processes in place to analyze monitoring results and respond to findings.
Technologies for enabling automation of some ISCM tasks are discussed in greater detail in
Appendix D.

2.4    IS CM ROLES AND RES PONS IBILITIES
This section describes the roles and responsibilities of key participants involved in an
organization’s ISCM program. Widely varying missions and organizational structures may lead to
differences in naming conventions for ISCM-related roles and how specific responsibilities are
allocated among organizational personnel (e.g., multiple individuals filling a single role or one
