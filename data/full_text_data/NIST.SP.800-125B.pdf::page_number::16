NIST SP 800-125B                                              SECURE VIRTUAL NETWORK CONFIGURATION
                                                                                 FOR VM PROTECTION


Local Area Network (VXLAN), Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE), and Stateless Transport
Tunneling (STT). Figure 3 illustrates the encapsulation process using VXLAN. First, the Ethernet frame
received from a VM, which contains the MAC address of the destination VM, is encapsulated in two
stages: first with the 24-bit VXLAN ID (virtual Layer 2 (L2) segment) to which the sending/receiving
VM belongs, and second, with the source and destination IP addresses of the VXLAN tunnel endpoints
(VTEP), which are kernel modules residing in the hypervisors of the sending and receiving VMs,
respectively. VXLAN encapsulation enables creation of a virtual Layer 2 segment that can span not only
different virtualized hosts but also IP subnets within the data center.

The two stages of encapsulation used to generate a VXLAN packet are performed by a hypervisor kernel
module called the overlay module. The overlay module needs the mapping of the MAC address of the
remote VM to the corresponding VTEPâ€™s IP address. The overlay module can obtain this IP address in
two ways: either by flooding using IP learning packets, or by configuring the mapping information using
a SDN controller that uses a standard protocol to deliver this mapping table to the overlay modules in
each virtualized host. The second approach is more desirable since learning using flooding results in
unnecessary network traffic in the entire virtualized infrastructure.

VXLAN-based network segmentation can be configured to provide isolation among resources of multiple
tenants of a cloud data center. A particular tenant can be assigned two or more VXLAN segments (or
IDs). The tenant can make use of multiple VXLAN segments by assigning VMs hosting each tier (web,
application, or database) to the same or different VXLAN segments. If VMs belonging to a client are in
different VXLAN segments, selective connectivity can be established among those VXLAN segments
belonging to the same tenant through suitable firewall configurations, while communication between
VXLAN segments belonging to different tenants can be prohibited.
