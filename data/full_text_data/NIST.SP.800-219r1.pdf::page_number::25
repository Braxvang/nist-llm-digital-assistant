NIST SP 800-219r1                                                     Automated Secure Configuration
July 2023                                                                  Guidance from the mSCP

Appendix A. mSCP User Roles
The mSCP was designed to meet the needs of different security roles. These perspectives are
briefly examined below.
Security policy authors define the policies for their organizations. The customization and ease
of extensibility offered by the mSCP facilitate new content creation. Policy authors will need to
familiarize themselves with the YAML rule file format described in Section 3.2.1. Of particular
interest is the ability to map rules directly to references. Additionally, the generate mapping
script (Section 3.4.5) enhances portability between compliance frameworks.
System administrators and security professionals are responsible for configuring the systems
under their purview. They implement the guidance issued by security policy authors. Security
professionals may wish to generate baselines (Section 3.4.1), guidance (Section 3.4.2), and
configuration using the macOS Security Compliance Tool (Section 3.4.3).
Auditors approach macOS security compliance from a validator perspective, seeking proof that
a system is configured in the required way. They are more interested in system setting
documentation and compliance evidence than technical tools, such as configuration scripts. Both
of these needs can be met by mSCP tools. The generate guidance script (Section 3.4.2) provides
the necessary documentation in a variety of formats, including HTML, PDF, and Excel. The
macOS Security Compliance Tool (Section 3.4.3) assesses a system and produces a log of the
results. Additionally, some auditors may be interested in examining YAML rule content directly
(Section 3.2.1).
Information security officers have a variety of goals but are ultimately responsible for ensuring
that systems are configured according to their organizational requirements. To accomplish this,
they need policy documentation (Section 3.4.2) and the results of compliance scans (Section
3.4.3). Information security officers may also be responsible for reviewing the security rules
proposed by the policy authors. If this is the case, they may be interested in YAML rule file
components (Section 3.2.1).
Vendors of device management, security, configuration assessment, and compliance tools
can produce a series of audit files based on mSCP content to support different macOS versions
and associated security baselines. These audit files are maintained, tested, published, and
supported by the tool vendors. Tool customers can download and import the content into the tool
to assess the state of their system against a particular baseline in an automated way.
Specific audit files of the mSCP by tool vendors are described on the project wiki page. This
content will be updated as contributing tool vendors develop new audit content.
