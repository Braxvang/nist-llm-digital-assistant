software logically organizes ROM and RAM for a handheld device into one or more memory
modules known as a card. Each memory card can contain ROM, RAM, or both. A handheld
device can have one card, multiple cards, or no cards. The main suite of applications provided
with each Palm OS powered handheld is built into ROM. This design permits the user to
replace the operating system and the entire application suite by installing a single replacement
module. Additional or replacement applications and system extensions can be loaded into
RAM.

The Palm OS divides the total available RAM store into two logical areas: dynamic RAM and
storage RAM. Dynamic RAM is used as working space for temporary allocations, and is
analogous to the RAM installed in a typical desktop system. The remainder of the available
RAM on the card is designated as storage RAM and is analogous to disk storage on a typical
desktop system. Because power is always applied to the memory system, both areas of RAM
preserve their contents when the device is turned "off" (i.e., is in low-power sleep mode). All
of the storage memory is preserved even when the device is reset explicitly (i.e., manually
pressing the reset button to perform a warm boot). As part of the warm boot sequence (i.e., a
soft reset), the system software reinitializes the dynamic area, and leaves the storage area
intact. The entire area of dynamic RAM is used to implement a single collection of free
storage or heap that provides memory for dynamic allocations such as global variables, system
buffers (e.g., TCP/IP, IrDA communications), and application stacks. Storage RAM is
configured as one or more storage heaps used to hold non-volatile user data. Storage heaps
may also be ROM-based. As part of the cold boot sequence (i.e., a hard reset), in addition to
reinitializing the dynamic area of RAM, the storage area is erased [PPC04].

Palm OS storage memory is arranged in chunks called “records,” which are grouped into
“databases.” The Palm OS “databases” can be thought of as files. The Palm file format (PFF)
conforms to one of the three types defined below [Hil03]:

          Palm Database – A record database used to store application data, such as contact
          lists, or user specific data.

          Palm Resource – A database similar to the Palm Database that contains application
          code and user interface objects.

          Palm Query Application – A database that contains world-wide-web content for use
          with Palm OS wireless devices.6

With Palm OS, because all applications share the same dynamic RAM, they can interfere with
each other’s data. Buffer overflow attacks are also easily implemented [Ket00].

The latest Palm OS PDAs offer two expansion modes for providing an increase in
functionality: the Palm Universal Connector System and Palm Expansion Card Slot. The
Universal Connector System allows GPS receivers, wireless modems, keyboards, and other
peripherals to interact with the device via a USB enabled connection. The Palm Expansion
Card Slot accommodates MultiMediaCard (MMC) and Secure Digital (SD) cards. MMC card
modules are removable solid-state memory of similar size and design to SD memory Cards.
