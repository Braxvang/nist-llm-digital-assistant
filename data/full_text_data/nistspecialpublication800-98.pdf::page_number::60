GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



small program encoded on a tag that becomes active once it has been read and is then passed to the
middleware or database of an IT system. If the system is poorly designed, the virus could possibly take
advantage of internal software weaknesses in middleware or database products to replicate itself to other
tags. This distinguishes the risk from AIDC technologies such as bar codes that cannot be changed after
manufacture because they do not contain modifiable memory.

Some factors influencing the magnitude of the risk to the IT infrastructure and the applications they
support are presented in Table 4-3.

                                              assurance of the implementing software (e.g., reader drivers, middleware,

4.5     Summary

For RFID implementations to be successful, organizations should effectively manage their risk. The
major categories of risk are as follows:

 Business Process Risk. This encompasses threats and vulnerabilities that could cause part or all of
  the RFID system to fail. Potential impacts range from a deceleration of the business process to the
  loss of critical business or operational records. Business process risk can occur for many reasons,
  including human action (either benign or malicious) and natural causes. Factors influencing business
  process risk include the importance of the RFID-supported business processes to the mission of the
  organization, the robustness of business continuity planning, and the environment in which the RFID
  technology is located. The cloning of tags and attacks on enterprise subsystem networks are
  examples of threats to business processes.
 Business Intelligence Risk. This involves threats and vulnerabilities that could permit unauthorized
  parties to gain access to sensitive or proprietary information. A competitor or adversary can gain
