                                                         CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



Chapter 2.         Background

Information systems are vulnerable to a variety of disruptions, ranging from mild (e.g., short-term power
outage, disk drive failure) to severe (e.g., equipment destruction, fire). Much vulnerability may be
minimized or eliminated through management, operational, or technical controls as part of the
organization’s resiliency effort; however, it is virtually impossible to completely eliminate all risks. 6
Contingency planning is designed to mitigate the risk of system and service unavailability by providing
effective and efficient solutions to enhance system availability.

This chapter discusses the ways in which federal information system contingency planning fits into an
organization’s larger risk management, security, and emergency preparedness programs (each of which is
a key component in developing a resiliency program). Other types of emergency preparedness-related
plans and their relationships to information system contingency planning are also described. Finally, the
section discusses how integrating contingency planning principles throughout the SDLC promotes system
compatibility and a cost-effective means to increase an organization’s ability to respond quickly and
effectively to a disruptive event.

2.1       Contingency Planning and Resilience

An organization must have the ability to withstand all hazards and sustain its mission through
environmental changes. These changes can be gradual, such as economic or mission changes, or sudden,
as in a disaster event. Rather than just working to identify and mitigate threats, vulnerabilities, and risks,
organizations can work toward building a resilient infrastructure, minimizing the impact of any disruption
on mission essential functions.

Resilience 7 is the ability to quickly adapt and recover from any known or unknown changes to the
environment. Resiliency is not a process, but rather an end-state for organizations. The goal of a resilient
organization is to continue mission essential functions at all times during any type of disruption. Resilient
organizations continually work to adapt to changes and risks that can affect their ability to continue
critical functions. Risk management, contingency, and continuity planning are individual security and
emergency management activities that can also be implemented in a holistic manner across an
organization as components of a resiliency program.

Effective contingency planning begins with the development of an organization contingency planning
policy and subjection of each information system to a business impact analysis (BIA). This facilitates
prioritizing the systems and processes based on the FIPS 199 impact level and develops priority recovery
strategies for minimizing loss. FIPS 199 provides guidelines on determining information and information
system impact to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations and the nation
through a formula that examines three security objectives: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. 8

          Confidentiality preserves authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including
           means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information.
          Integrity guards against improper information modification or destruction, and includes ensuring
           information non-repudiation and authenticity.

   For example, in many cases, critical resources (such as electric power or telecommunications) may reside outside the
   organization’s control, and the organization may be unable to ensure their availability.

   The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Risk Lexicon (September 2008) defines resilience as the “ability to resist,
   absorb, recover from or successfully adapt to adversity or a change in conditions.” The DHS Risk Lexicon can be found at
