Special Publication 800-79-2                              Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



                 Subtask 4.2: Assemble all documentation and supporting materials necessary
                 for the assessment of the issuer; if these documents include previous assessments,
                 review the findings and determine if they are applicable to the current assessment.
                 Responsibility: OIMO; Assessor
                 Guidance: The OIMO assists the Assessor in gathering all relevant documents
                 and supporting materials from the organization that will be required during the
                 assessment of the issuer. Central to this effort is the operations plan. The issuer’s
                 operations shall be completely described in the operations plan. The operations
                 plan may include by reference, or point to, the supporting materials. In this case,
                 the OIMO will also need to gather this supporting material for the Assessor.
                 Examples of other documentation include: (i) letters of appointment; (ii) privacy-
                 related documentation; (iii) information forms utilized by the issuer; (iv)
                 documentation from each outsourced service provider, including control
                 implementation specifics, support and service level agreements, and contracts; (v)
                 standard operating procedures for the issuing facilities within the authorization
                 boundary is; and (vi) signed authorization letters under [SP 800-37-1] for all
                 information systems.
                 When previous assessments exist, including the one on which the current
                 Authorization to Operate (ATO) is based, the Assessor is strongly encouraged to
                 review these results. The Assessor may satisfy some of the issuer control
                 assessment requirements by reviewing and referencing previous assessment
                 report(s). Although previous assessments cannot be used as a substitute for the
                 current assessment, they provide a snapshot view of the issuer and highlight
                 problems that may have existed in the past.

                 Subtask 4.3: Assess the required issuer controls using the prescribed assessment
                 procedures found in Table G.1 and Table G.2 based on the scope of the issuance
                 functions.
                 Responsibility: Assessor
                 Guidance: The Assessor performs the assessment procedures selected for each
                 issuer control to assess if they have been implemented correctly, are operating as
                 intended, and producing the desired outcomes. The Assessor uses the assessment
                 methods specified in Section 4.1. Documentation collected in the previous task is
                 reviewed, and any deficiencies are identified. Interviews can be used as an
                 opportunity to clarify issues encountered during a review of the issuer’s
                 documentation, as well as to determine the expertise of the personnel performing
                 key PIV functions. Processes need to be observed to ensure that they are being
                 followed as documented and tests executed to determine if the PIV components
                 have been configured and are operating in a PIV-compliant manner.
                 As part of an assessment all applicable issuer controls need to be assessed. If PIV
                 services have been outsourced to an external provider, the Assessor shall verify
                 that the issuer controls applying to those services have been assessed, and the
                 reliability of the service provider has been found satisfactory. If an issuer and its
                 facilities have already been assessed and are operating under a current ATO, and
                 the purpose of the assessment is to add a facility(s) to the authorization letter, the
                                                   36
