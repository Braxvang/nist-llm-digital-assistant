GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



Additionally, some of the organization’s security administrators act as log management infrastructure
administrators, with responsibilities such as the following:

      Contacting system-level administrators to get additional information regarding an event or to
       request that they investigate a particular event
      Identifying changes needed to system logging configurations (e.g., which entries and data fields
       are sent to the centralized log servers, what log format should be used) and informing system-
       level administrators of the necessary changes
      Initiating responses to events, including incident handling and operational problems (e.g., a
       failure of a log management infrastructure component)
      Ensuring that old log data is archived to removable media and disposed of properly once it is no
       longer needed39
      Cooperating with requests from legal counsel, auditors, and others
      Monitoring the status of the log management infrastructure (e.g., failures in logging software or
       log archival media, failures of local systems to transfer their log data) and initiating appropriate
       responses when problems occur
      Testing and implementing upgrades and updates to the log management infrastructure’s
       components
      Maintaining the security of the log management infrastructure.
Another key responsibility of many log management infrastructure administrators is verifying the work of
system-level administrators. When deciding how to divide log management duties, organizations might
want to consider separation of duties and accountability. For example, having someone other than a
system administrator review the logs for a particular system helps to provide accountability for the system
administrator’s actions, including confirming that logging is enabled. Separation of duties considerations
can have a significant impact on an organization’s logging policies, the resources necessary to support
logging, and the design of log management infrastructures, should there be a desire to have large volumes
of log data forwarded to log servers for independent reviews.

Organizations need to determine how much analysis should be done by system-level administrators and
how much by the log management infrastructure administrators. Generally, at least some analysis should
be performed at the system level because the system’s administrators can often provide context for events
recorded in the log data. For example, if a log shows that a system rebooted three times in an hour, an
infrastructure administrator might not be able to determine why that occurred from reviewing other log
entries, but a local administrator would know that the system was being patched at that time and that the
reboots were intentional. Another reason for performing system-level analysis is that local administrators
might have different interests than infrastructure administrators, such as identifying operational problems
and other non-security concerns. Also, there are often far too many events for infrastructure
administrators to review them all, and too much data to transfer across networks to the log management
infrastructure. Performing analysis at the system level is also helpful to administrators in gaining a better
understanding of each system’s characteristics so that they can fine-tune logging configurations.

Performing some analysis at the infrastructure level is particularly helpful in a few ways. It is much more
likely to be performed in near-real-time than system-level analysis; this supports more rapid responses to
