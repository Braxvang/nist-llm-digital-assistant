Precondition(s)           1.   A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                          2.   A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and the
                               contact reader.
                          3.   The test application is currently connected to the card application
                               which is accessible through card handle.
                          4.   A valid card holder facial image object is present on the PIV card.
Test Scenario             1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                          2. Set OID := <<Card Holder Facial Image
                              (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.96.48)>>
                          3. Call pivGetData w/
                              • (IN) cardHandle
                               • (IN) OID
                               • (OUT) data
                          4. Read and parse the byte array in accordance with BER-TLV
                             format.
Expected Result(s)        1. The size of the byte array does not exceed 12710 bytes.
                          2. All mandatory tags in “Card Holder Facial Image” table are
                             present.

8.7    “X.509 Certificate for Digital Signature” Data Object
