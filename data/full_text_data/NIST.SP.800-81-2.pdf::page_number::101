                                                         SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE




    •   Wait the TTL of the zone’s DNSKEY RRset.

    •   Remove the old, outgoing ZSK from the DNSKEY RRset to reduce the size of the DNSKEY RRset in
        responses.

    •   Re-sign the DNSKEY RRSet with the new ZSK.
It might be in the DNS administrator’s best interest to perform a ZSK rollover continuously. The
administrator can perform the first three steps and wait indefinitely before deleting the old DNSKEY
from the key set, even continuing to sign the zone with the old DNSKEY when the RRSIGs in the zone
expire. This procedure allows the administrator to perform an emergency key rollover more efficiently
(see below).


Zones that pre-publish the new public key should observe the following:

Checklist item 31: The secure zone that pre-publishes its public key should do so at least one TTL period
before the time of the key rollover.

Checklist item 32: After removing the old public key, the zone should generate a new signature (RRSIG
RR), based on the remaining keys (DNSKEY RRs) in the zone file.


In rolling over the KSK, the secure zone may not know which resolvers have stored the public key as a
trust anchor. If the network administrator has an out-of-band method of contacting resolver administrators
that have stored the public key as a trust anchor (such as e-mail), the network administrator should send
out appropriate warnings and set up a trusted means of disseminating the new trust anchor. Otherwise, the
DNS administrator can do nothing except pre-publish the new KSK with ample time to give resolver
administrators enough time to learn the new KSK.

11.2.2 Key Rollover in a Chained Secure Zone

A globally secure zone uses two sets of keys: the ZSK and the KSK.

11.2.3 ZSK Key Rollover in a Chained Secure Zone

The operations involved in a ZSK rollover in a globally secure zone are no different from those in a ZSK
key rollover in a locally secure zone. (See Section 11.2.)

11.2.4 KSK Key Rollover in a Chained Secure Zone (Manually without Revoke Bit)

The KSK (KSK-public) is the key for which the secure parent of a secure zone provides trust. It provides
this trust by using a new RR type called the DS RR, which contains the hash of the child’s KSK. The
delegating parent signs this DS RR with its own ZSK. When a zone changes its KSK, the trust
relationship between itself and its parent will be broken. To maintain this trust relationship, the zone
making the KSK rollover must:

    •   Generate a new KSK and add it to the zone key set

    •   Sign the zone key set with the new KSK as well as the old KSK (the key about to expire)
