2210   Sample Authorization Decision Letter (Authorization to Operate)
2211   From: Designated Authorizing Official                         Date:
2212   To: Enterprise Identity Management Official
2213   Subject: Authorization Decision for [PCI/DPCI]
2214   After reviewing the results of the authorization package of the [PCI/DPCI NAME], I have
2215   determined that its policies, procedures, and processes comply with both [FIPS201] and our
2216   organization’s own policies, regulations, and standards. Accordingly, I am issuing an
2217   authorization to operate (ATO). [PIV Card and/or derived PIV credential] issuance services are
2218   authorized without any restrictions or limitations. This authorization is my formal declaration
2219   that the requirements of [HSPD-12] are being satisfied.
2220   This ATO also applies to issuing facilities under this [ISSUER]. Included is a list of facilities
2221   authorized to operate under this authorization decision.
2222   This authorization and ATO will remain in effect for 3 years from the date of this letter if (i) all
2223   required documentation is updated annually; (ii) a life cycle walkthrough is completed annually,
2224   and the results are sent to me within 30 days of completion; and (iii) no deficiencies are
2225   identified during the walkthrough that would increase the risk to the organization’s mission.
2226   A copy of this letter and all supporting authorization documentation shall be retained in
2227   accordance with the organization’s record retention schedule.
