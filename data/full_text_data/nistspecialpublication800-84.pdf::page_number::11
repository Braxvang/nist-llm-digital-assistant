                                   GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



1.    Introduction

1.1   Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency
Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2   Purpose and Scope

Although it is important to have plans in place to help an organization respond to and manage various
situations involving information technology (IT), it is equally important to maintain these plans in a state
of readiness. This includes having IT personnel trained to fulfill their roles and responsibilities; having
plans exercised to validate their policies and procedures; and having systems tested to ensure their
operability. These three types of events can be carried out efficiently and effectively through the
development and implementation of a test, training, and exercise (TT&E) program.

This publication seeks to assist organizations in designing, developing, conducting, and evaluating TT&E
events in an effort to aid personnel in preparing for adverse situations involving IT. The events are
designed to train personnel, exercise IT plans, and test IT systems, so that an organization can maximize
its ability to prepare for, respond to, manage, and recover from disasters that may affect its mission. The
guide describes the design, development, conduct, and evaluation of events for single organizations, as
opposed to large-scale events that may involve multiple organizations. The TT&E methodology
described in this document can be applied to TT&E events built around any type of IT-related plan,
including, but not limited to, contingency plans (e.g., disaster recovery plans) and computer security
incident response plans. The vocabulary related to TT&E varies across organizations; this document
provides definitions of the terms most commonly used for TT&E-related activities and teams.

1.3   Audience

This document has been created for individuals responsible for their organization’s TT&E program.
Specifically, the document is designed to assist the IT personnel responsible for designing, developing,
conducting, and/or evaluating TT&E events in fulfilling these responsibilities effectively.
