senior information security officers, and the risk executive (function), on a range of security-
related issues including, for example, establishing information system boundaries, assessing the
severity of weaknesses and deficiencies in the information system, plans of action and milestones,
risk mitigation approaches, security alerts, and potential adverse effects of vulnerabilities.

D.12 INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY ENGINEER
The information system security engineer is an individual, group, or organization responsible for
conducting information system security engineering activities. Information system security
engineering is a process that captures and refines information security requirements and ensures
that the requirements are effectively integrated into information technology component products
and information systems through purposeful security architecting, design, development, and
configuration. Information system security engineers are an integral part of the development team
(e.g., integrated project team) designing and developing organizational information systems or
upgrading legacy systems. Information system security engineers employ best practices when
implementing security controls within an information system including software engineering
methodologies, system/security engineering principles, secure design, secure architecture, and
secure coding techniques. System security engineers coordinate their security-related activities
with information security architects, senior information security officers, information system
owners, common control providers, and information system security officers.

D.13 SECURITY CONTROL ASSESSOR
The security control assessor is an individual, group, or organization responsible for conducting a
comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and technical security controls
employed within or inherited by an information system to determine the overall effectiveness of
the controls (i.e., the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as
intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements
for the system). Security control assessors also provide an assessment of the severity of
weaknesses or deficiencies discovered in the information system and its environment of operation
and recommend corrective actions to address identified vulnerabilities. In addition to the above
responsibilities, security control assessors prepare the final security assessment report containing
the results and findings from the assessment. Prior to initiating the security control assessment, an
assessor conducts an assessment of the security plan to help ensure that the plan provides a set of
security controls for the information system that meet the stated security requirements.

The required level of assessor independence is determined by the specific conditions of the
security control assessment. For example, when the assessment is conducted in support of an
authorization decision or ongoing authorization, the authorizing official makes an explicit
determination of the degree of independence required in accordance with federal policies,
directives, standards, and guidelines. Assessor independence is an important factor in: (i)
preserving the impartial and unbiased nature of the assessment process; (ii) determining the
credibility of the security assessment results; and (iii) ensuring that the authorizing official
receives the most objective information possible in order to make an informed, risk-based,
authorization decision. The information system owner and common control provider rely on the
security expertise and the technical judgment of the assessor to: (i) assess the security controls
employed within and inherited by the information system using assessment procedures specified
in the security assessment plan; and (ii) provide specific recommendations on how to correct
weaknesses or deficiencies in the controls and address identified vulnerabilities.
