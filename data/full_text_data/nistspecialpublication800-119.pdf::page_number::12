                                                              GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


           internal employees that make use of an organization’s Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to
           establish trust).

        Identify capabilities and weaknesses of network protection devices in an IPv6 environment.

        Enable controls that might not have been used in IPv4 due to a lower threat level during initial
         deployment (implementing default deny access control policies, implementing routing
         protocol security, etc).

        Pay close attention to the security aspects of transition mechanisms such as tunneling
         protocols.

        Ensure that IPv6 routers, packet filters, firewalls, and tunnel endpoints enforce multicast scope
         boundaries and make sure that Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) packets are not
         inappropriately routable.

        Be aware that switching from an environment in which NAT (Network Address Translation)
         provides IP (Internet Protocol) addresses to unique global IPv6 addresses could trigger a
         change in the FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act) system boundaries.

After reviewing this document, the reader should have a reasonable understanding of IPv6 and how it
compares to IPv4, as well as security impacts of IPv6 features and capabilities, and increased knowledge
and awareness about the range of IPv4 to IPv6 transition mechanisms.
