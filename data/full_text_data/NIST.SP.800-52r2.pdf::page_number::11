NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                          GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


Block Chaining (CBC) mode of operation used by TLS. The handling of padding errors was
altered to treat a padding error as a bad message authentication code rather than a decryption
failure. In addition, the TLS 1.1 RFC acknowledges attacks on CBC mode that rely on the time
to compute the message authentication code (MAC). The TLS 1.1 specification states that to
defend against such attacks, an implementation must process records in the same manner
regardless of whether padding errors exist. Further implementation considerations for CBC
modes (which were not included in RFC 4346 [24]) are discussed in Section 3.3.2.

TLS 1.2, specified in RFC 5246 [25], made several cryptographic enhancements, particularly in
the area of hash functions, with the ability to use or specify the SHA-2 family of algorithms for
hash, MAC, and Pseudorandom Function (PRF) computations. TLS 1.2 also adds authenticated
encryption with associated data (AEAD) cipher suites.

TLS 1.3, specified in RFC 8446 [57], represents a significant change to TLS that aims to address
threats that have arisen over the years. Among the changes are a new handshake protocol, a new
key derivation process that uses the HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function
(HKDF) [37], and the removal of cipher suites that use RSA key transport or static Diffie-
Hellman (DH) key exchanges, the CBC mode of operation, or SHA-1. Many extensions defined
for use with TLS 1.2 and previous versions cannot be used with TLS 1.3.

1.2   Scope

Security is not a single property that is (or is not) possessed by a protocol. Rather, security
includes a complex set of related properties that together provide the required information
assurance characteristics and information protection services. Security requirements are usually
derived from a risk assessment of the threats or attacks that an adversary is likely to mount
against a system. The adversary is likely to take advantage of implementation vulnerabilities
found in many system components, including computer operating systems, application software
systems, and the computer networks that interconnect them. Thus, in order to secure a system
against a myriad of threats, security must be judiciously placed in the various systems and
network layers.

These guidelines focus only on network security, and they focus directly on the small portion of
the network communications stack that is referred to as the transport layer. Several other NIST
publications address security requirements in the other parts of the system and network layers.
Adherence to these guidelines only protects the data in transit. Other applicable NIST standards
and guidelines should be used to ensure protection of systems and stored data.

These guidelines focus on the common use cases where clients and servers must interoperate
with a wide variety of implementations, and authentication is performed using public-key
certificates. To promote interoperability, implementations often support a wide array of
cryptographic options. However, there are much more constrained TLS implementations where
security is needed but broad interoperability is not required, and the cost of implementing unused
features may be prohibitive. For example, minimal servers are often implemented in embedded
controllers and network infrastructure devices, such as routers, and then used with browsers to
remotely configure and manage the devices. There are also cases where both the client and server
for an applicationâ€™s TLS connection are under the control of the same entity, and therefore
