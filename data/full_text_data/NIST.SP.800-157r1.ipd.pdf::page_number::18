      NIST SP 800-157r1 ipd                            Derived PIV Credentials (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


448   the derived PIV credentials will be lost/stolen without the loss being reported or that the
449   subscriber will inappropriately provide one of them to someone else. Accordingly, issuers
450    MAY place a limit on the number of active derived PIV credentials that a subscriber may
451   have.

452   2.2.1. PKI-based Derived PIV Credential Issuance
453   Issuance of a PKI-based derived PIV credential requires the generation of a public/private
454   keypair followed by the creation of a corresponding authentication certificate by the
455   CSP. For a derived PIV credential capable of being used at AAL3, the keypair SHALL
456   be generated in the device (authenticator or endpoint) that will house the derived PIV
457   credential. The device SHALL send the certificate signing request that contains the
458   public key to the CSP, which SHALL return an X.509 authentication certificate that
459    SHALL be stored on the credential. The CSP SHALL retain a copy of the issued
460   certificate for use should revocation be required. For a derived PIV credential that is
461   issued for use only at AAL2, the same procedure MAY be used, or the CSP MAY
462   generate a keypair and corresponding certificate and send the certificate and private key
463   to the device over an authenticated protected channel for installation. The CSP SHALL
464   immediately and securely delete its copy of the private key.
465   The private key SHALL be stored on the device in a manner that makes it accessible
466   only upon entry of the correct activation secret or presentation of a biometric factor that
467   matches a stored biometric image or template. This SHALL be accomplished either
468   through the use of strong access controls for the stored private key or through decryption
469   of the private key using an encryption key that is derived from the activation secret.

470   2.2.2. Non-PKI-based Derived PIV Credential Issuance
471   The applicant SHALL be provided with or supply an approved physical authenticator
472   for the highest AAL that the derived PIV credential will be used to authenticate. If the
473   authenticator is not directly provided by the issuer (i.e., the home agency), the issuer
474    SHALL verify that the authenticatorâ€™s characteristics (e.g., single-factor or multi-factor)
475   meet the requirements of [SP800-63B] for the highest authentication assurance level at
476   which it will be used (AAL2 or AAL3), including [FIPS140] requirements.
477   The issuance process for a multi-factor authenticator SHALL prompt the applicant to
478   establish a memorized secret or biometric activation factor (or both) for the authenticator
479   and successfully authenticate using that authenticator. The issuance process with a single-
480   factor authenticator SHALL prompt the applicant to register a memorized secret that
481   meets the requirements of [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.1.1 and that will be verified along with the
482   physical authenticator in the authentication process.
