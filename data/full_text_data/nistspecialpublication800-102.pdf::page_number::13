   b. SIGA(M, TSP) was generated at some point after the time indicated by the
      timestamp in the TSP.
   c. D was assembled after the time indicated by the timestamp in the TSP.
If a more precise time is required for the generation of SIGA(M, TSP), a second trusted
timestamp may be acquired (as specified in Section 4.4) that will provide assurance that
(M, TSP) had existed and been signed by (at least) the time indicated in the second
timestamp.

4.3.2 A Hash of M is Provided to the TTA by Entity A
Entity A may provide the hash value of M to the TTA when requesting a timestamp as
shown in Figure 2. Let H denote a hash value that is generated on M using an approved
hash function (i.e., H = Hash(M)).

                 Figure 2: Entity A Provides a Hash Value to the TTA
   1. Entity A sends H (and possibly other information) to the TTA in a timestamp
      request, i.e., user_supplied_info = H, other_info. Note that the other_info may be
      Null.
   2. The TTA returns a TSP to entity A:
           TSP = timestamped_data, timestamp_signatureTTA
       where:
           user_supplied_info = H, other_info.
           timestamped_data = user_supplied_info, TTA-supplied_info, timestamp.
           timestamp_signatureTTA = SIGTTA(user_supplied_info, TTA_supplied_info,
              timestamp).
       If there is a mutual agreement between entity A and the TTA, the following
       information may be omitted from the TSP data that is transmitted by the TTA:
