                     Measure 16: Risk Assessment (RA) (system-level)
         Field                                                Data
Measure ID       Risk Assessment Vulnerability Measure 1 (or a unique identifier to be filled out by the
                 organization)
Goal             •   Strategic Goal: Ensure an environment of comprehensive security and accountability
                     for personnel, facilities, and products.
                 •   Information Security Goal: Periodically assess the risk to organizational operations
                     (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, and
                     individuals resulting from the operation of organizational information systems.
Measure          Percentage (%) of vulnerabilities remediated within organization-specified time frames
                 NIST SP 800-53 Controls – RA-5: Vulnerability Scanning and CA-5: Plan of Actions
                 and Milestones
Measure Type     Effectiveness/Efficiency
Formula          (Number of vulnerabilities remediated according to POA&M schedule/total number of
                 POA&M-documented vulnerabilities identified through vulnerability scans) *100
Target           This should be a high percentage defined by the organization.
Implementation   1. Does the organization conduct periodic vulnerability scans (RA-5)?
Evidence
                       Yes                     No

                 2. What is the periodicity of vulnerability scans (RA-5)?

                        Weekly

                        Monthly

                        Quarterly

                        Other ____________

                 3. Does the organization’s POA&M process require vulnerabilities identified through
                 vulnerability scanning to be documented in appropriate system POA&Ms (CA-5)?

                       Yes                     No

                 4. How many vulnerabilities were identified through vulnerability scanning and entered
                 into applicable POA&Ms (CA-5)? _____

                 5. How many of the vulnerabilities from Question 4 were remediated on schedule
                 according to their POA&Ms (CA-5)? _____

Frequency        Collection Frequency: Organization-defined (example: monthly)
                 Reporting Frequency: Organization-defined (example: monthly)
