7.    Infrastructure-as-a-Service Cloud Environments

The purpose of this section is to describe the architecture and basic operation of Infrastructure as a
Service (IaaS) clouds. This information is important for readers who need to evaluate whether IaaS
clouds can satisfy particular reliability, compliance, and security requirements, as well as understand
operational mechanisms. It is important to remember, however, that most public cloud implementations
are proprietary, and thus their operational details are not publically available.

                                                  IaaS
 Who are the consumers?
       System administrators.
 What does a consumer get?
       Access to virtual computers, network-accessible storage, and network infrastructure
       components such as firewalls, and configuration services.
 How are usage fees calculated?
       Typically, per cpu hour, data GB stored per hour, network bandwidth consumed,
       network infrastructure used (e.g., IP addresses) per hour, value-added services used
       (e.g., monitoring, automatic scaling).


The technical information contained in this section is a distillation of information from three sources: (1)
openly published technical work on base technologies such as hardware virtualization [Pop74] that some
cloud providers have publically acknowledged that they leverage, (2) inferences from openly published
cloud system interfaces (e.g., [Ama10, Ama06]), and (3) insights from several Open Source cloud
projects that have made design documentation and source code available (e.g., [Can11, Nas10, War09]).
As such, this section describes how IaaS clouds operate in general and not specific terms. Note that this
section refers to specific cloud computing projects by name, but these references do not constitute
endorsements.

The following six subsections describe several important characteristics of IaaS offerings: Abstract
Interaction Dynamics; Software Stack and Provider/Consumer Scopes of Control; an Operational View of
an IaaS cloud; Benefits; Issues and Concerns; and Recommendations.

7.1   Abstract Interaction Dynamics

Figure 15 presents a simplified view of the interactions within an IaaS cloud. Figure 15.A depicts clients
interacting with an IaaS cloud over a network. The provider has a number of available virtual machines
(vmâ€™s) that it can allocate to clients. In the figure, client A has access to vm1 and vm2, and client B has
access to vm3. The provider retains vm4 through vmn, where it is presumed that n is larger than the
number of vms any client is expected to request. Figure 15.B shows the situation just after a new client,
C, has requested and received access to three more vms. At this point, client C has access to vm4, vm5
and vm6, and the provider now retains only vm7 through vmN. Figure 15 is admittedly an extreme
simplification of how an IaaS cloud really works, but it is still sufficient to illustrate a number of technical
issues that must be addressed for an IaaS cloud to function. Further, Figure 15 only illustrates virtual
machine allocation (by a provider) and interaction (by a consumer). Although it would be possible to
build an IaaS cloud that provides only simple virtual machines that reset to default values when released,
such a cloud would have limited functionality. Practical IaaS cloud systems also provide persistent data
storage and stable network connectivity. They must also track resources that have economic cost, and bill
those costs to consumers.
