       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


1821   key requirements shall meet the minimum requirements stated in Table 2 of NIST
1822   [SP800-57Part1].
1823   See also Asymmetric Keys, Symmetric Key.

1824   Cryptographic Module
1825   A set of hardware, software, and/or firmware that implements approved security functions
1826   (including cryptographic algorithms and key generation).

1827   Data Integrity
1828   The property that data has not been altered by an unauthorized entity.

1829   Derived Attribute Value
1830   A statement asserting a property of a subscriber without necessarily containing identity
1831   information, independent of format. For example, instead of requesting the attribute
1832   “birthday,” a derived value could be “older than 18”. Instead of requesting the attribute for
1833   “physical address,” a derived value could be “currently residing in this district.” Previous
1834   versions of these guidelines referred to this construct as an “attribute reference”.

1835   Digital Authentication
1836   The process of establishing confidence in user identities presented digitally to a system.
1837   In previous editions of SP 800-63, this was referred to as Electronic Authentication.

1838   Digital Signature
1839   An asymmetric key operation where the private key is used to digitally sign data and
1840   the public key is used to verify the signature. Digital signatures provide authenticity
1841   protection, integrity protection, and non-repudiation, but not confidentiality protection.

1842   Disassociability
1843   Per [NISTIR8062]: The processing of PII or events without association to individuals or
1844   devices beyond the operational requirements of the system.

1845   Eavesdropping Attack
1846   An attack in which an attacker listens passively to the authentication protocol to capture
1847   information that can be used in a subsequent active attack to masquerade as the claimant.

1848   Electronic Authentication (E-Authentication)
1849   See Digital Authentication.

1850   Enrollment
1851   The process through which an applicant applies to become a subscriber of a CSP and the
1852   CSP validates the applicant’s identity.
