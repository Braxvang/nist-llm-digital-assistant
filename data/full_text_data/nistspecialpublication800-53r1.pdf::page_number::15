Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1                Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


Selection statements also narrow the potential input values by providing a specific list of items
from which the organization must choose.

The supplemental guidance section provides additional information related to a specific security
control. Organizations are expected to apply the supplemental guidance as appropriate, when
defining, developing, and implementing security controls. In certain instances, the supplemental
guidance provides more detail concerning the control requirements or important considerations
(and the needed flexibility) for implementing security controls in the context of an organization’s
operational environment, specific mission requirements, or assessment of risk. In addition,
applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance
documents (e.g., OMB Circulars, FIPS, and NIST Special Publications) are listed in the
supplemental guidance section, when appropriate, for the particular security control.

The control enhancements section provides statements of security capability to: (i) build in
additional, but related, functionality to a basic control; and/or (ii) increase the strength of a basic
control. In both cases, the control enhancements are used in an information system requiring
greater protection due to the potential impact of loss or when organizations seek additions to a
basic control’s functionality based on the results of a risk assessment. Control enhancements are
numbered sequentially within each control so that the enhancements can be easily identified when
selected to supplement the basic control. In the example above, if all three control enhancements
are selected, the control designation subsequently becomes AU-2 (1) (2) (3). The numerical
designation of a security control enhancement is used only to identify a particular enhancement
within the control structure. The designation is neither indicative of the relative strength of the
control enhancement nor assumes any hierarchical relationship among enhancements. In the
above example, enhancement (3) is used before (1) and (2) since that enhancement is appropriate
at a lower level than the other two. This type of situation arises from the decision to enhance
control stability in the face of change by not renumbering existing enhancements when new ones
are added or when decisions about placement within baselines change.

2.2 SECURITY CONTROL BASELINES
Organizations are required to employ security controls to meet security requirements defined by
applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, or regulations (e.g., Federal
Information Security Management Act, OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III). The challenge for
organizations is to determine the appropriate set of security controls, which if implemented and
determined to be effective in their application, would most cost-effectively comply with the stated
security requirements. 19 Selecting the appropriate set of security controls to meet the specific,
and sometimes unique, security requirements of an organization is an important task—a task that
demonstrates the organization’s commitment to security and the due diligence exercised in
protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their information and information
systems.

To assist organizations in making the appropriate selection of security controls for their
information systems, the concept of baseline controls is introduced. Baseline controls are the
minimum security controls recommended for an information system based on the system’s


19
   An information system may require security controls at different layers within the system. For example, an operating
system or network component typically provides an identification and authentication capability. An application may
also provide its own identification and authentication capability rendering an additional level of protection for the
overall information system. The selection and specification of security controls should consider components at all
layers within the information system as part of effective security and privacy architectures.
