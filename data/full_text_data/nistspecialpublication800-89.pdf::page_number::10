Signatory             The entity that generates a digital signature on data using a private
                      key.

Signature-inÂ­         The digital signature to be verified and validated.
question

Signature             The process of using a digital signature algorithm and a private key
generation            to generate a digital signature on data.

Signature validation The (mathematical) verification of the digital signature plus
                     obtaining the appropriate assurances (e.g., public key validity,
                     private key possession, etc.).

Signature             The process of using a digital signature algorithm and a public key
verification          to verify a digital signature on data.

Signed data           The data or message upon which a digital signature has been
                      computed. Also, see Message.

Timestamp             A token of information that is used to provide assurance of
                      timeliness; contains timestamped data, including time, and a
                      signature generated by a Trusted Timestamp Authority (TTA).

timestamp_time        The time provided in a timestamp.

Trusted Third Party   An entity other than the owner and verifier that is trusted by the
(TTP)                 owner, the verifier or both to provide certain services.

Trusted timestamp     A timestamp that has been signed by a Trusted Timestamp
                      Authority.

Trusted Timestamp     An entity that is trusted to provide accurate time information.
Authority (TTA)

Verifier              The entity that verifies the authenticity of a digital signature using
                      the public key.
