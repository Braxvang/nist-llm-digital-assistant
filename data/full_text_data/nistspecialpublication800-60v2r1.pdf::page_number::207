warrant or on the success of subsequent prosecution of the apprehended criminal a serious
adverse effect on agency operations can result. This can place the agency at a significant
disadvantage.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In some cases, major investigations can be
jeopardized when the time-critical criminal investigation and surveillance information is
modified or destroyed. Where the criminal case under investigation involves major property
losses, large-scale financial frauds that have serious implications for financial markets, poses a
threat to key national assets or human life, the Recommended Integrity Impact Level is high. In
international matters, such as trade enforcement, tariff agreements, etc., or where foreign
nationals might be involved, the integrity impact level for criminal investigation and surveillance
information will be high. Any compromise of such information could result in catastrophic
adverse effects on future operations, individual and agency reputations, and on human life.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
criminal investigation and surveillance information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to criminal investigation and surveillance
information. Missions supported by criminal investigation and surveillance information are not
always tolerant of delay.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: There are some cases in which relatively
short periods of unavailability of criminal investigation and surveillance information may result
in lost surveillance opportunities or opportunities to make an arrest. Where the crimes involved
pose a threat to human life and/or result in a loss of major assets, the availability impact level
recommended for criminal investigation and surveillance information is high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
criminal investigation and surveillance information is moderate.

D.16.3 Citizen Protection Information Type

Citizen protection involves all activities performed to protect the general population of the
United States from criminal activity. The following security categorization is recommended for
the citizen protection information type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate, (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of citizen protection
information on the ability of responsible agencies to protect the general population of the United
States from criminal activity. In some cases, the criminal activity is terrorist activity intended to
cause mass casualties. While the results of unauthorized disclosure of most citizen protection
