OT Discussion: Reconstitution of the OT includes considering whether system state variables
should be restored to initial values or the values before disruption (e.g., are valves restored to full
open, full closed, or settings prior to disruption). Restoring system state variables may be
disruptive to ongoing physical processes (e.g., valves initially closed may adversely affect
system cooling).
Control Enhancement: (2) (4) No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (6) OT Discussion: Organizations should consider recovery and
reconstitution timeframes when storing spare equipment, including environmental hazards that
could damage the equipment. Storage locations and environments should be chosen
appropriately for the type of backup equipment.
Rationale for adding CP-10 (6) to MOD and HIGH baselines: OT system components stored
without protection against environmental threats and unauthorized physical or logical access can
be susceptible to compromise or damage. Certain system components may include embedded
electronics that must be protected from environmental hazards.

No OT Discussion for this control.
Rationale for adding CP-12 to LOW, MOD, and HIGH baselines: This control provides a
framework for the organization to plan its policy and procedures for dealing with IT and OT
conditions beyond its control in the environment of operations to minimize potential safety and
environmental impacts.
