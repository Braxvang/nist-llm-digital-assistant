Executive Summary

Modern computers rely on fundamental system firmware, commonly known as the Basic Input/Output
System (BIOS), to facilitate the hardware initialization process and transition control to the hypervisor or
operating system. The BIOS is typically developed by both original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)
and independent BIOS vendors, and is distributed to end-users by motherboard or computer
manufacturers. Manufacturers frequently update system firmware to fix bugs, patch vulnerabilities, and
support new hardware. This document is the second in a series of publications on BIOS protections. The
first document, SP800-147, BIOS Protection Guidelines, was released in April 2011 and provides
guidelines for desktop and laptop systems deployed in enterprise environments.

Unauthorized modification of BIOS firmware by malicious software constitutes a significant threat
because of the BIOS’s unique and privileged position within modern computing architectures. Malicious
BIOS modification could be part of a sophisticated, targeted attack on an organization—either a
permanent denial of service or a persistent malware presence.

This document covers BIOS protections for basic, managed and blade servers. These types of servers
often contain Service Processors—specialized microcontrollers that provide administrators with an
interface to manage the host server. Servers, particularly those with Service Processors, may implement
multiple BIOS update mechanisms. Servers implementing a single BIOS update mechanism may
implement the guidelines in SP800-147, if the update mechanism is sufficiently similar to those in PC
client systems, or they may implement the guidelines in this document.

The security guidelines in this publication do not attempt to prevent installation of an inauthentic BIOS
through the supply chain, by physical replacement of the BIOS chip, or through secure local update
procedures.

Security guidelines are specified for four system BIOS security features:
    Authenticated BIOS update mechanisms, where digital signatures prevent the execution of
        BIOS update images that are not authentic.
    An optional secure local update mechanism, which requires that an administrator be physically
        present at the machine in order to install BIOS images without signature verification.
    Firmware integrity protections, to prevent unintended or malicious modification of the BIOS
        outside the authenticated BIOS update process.
    Non-bypassability features, to ensure that there are no mechanisms that allow the main processor
        or any other system component to bypass the BIOS protections.

This document also provides additional information and recommendations for implementing BIOS
protections using three BIOS update mechanisms that are commonly implemented in servers. This
material is intended to help implementers design systems that meet the security requirements in this
publication.

Service Processors are critical management components in many modern server designs. They are
responsible for various management features, depending on the implementation of the system. Some, but
not all, Service Processors are able to update the system BIOS. This document describes the possible
roles of Service Processors in the system BIOS update process, and describes how the security guidelines
apply to systems containing these components.
