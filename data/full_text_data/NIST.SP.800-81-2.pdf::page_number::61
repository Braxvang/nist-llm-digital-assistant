                                                                     SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



To use the allow-update statement, an address match list must be created. The command to create an ACL
DU_Allowed_List with one IP address is as follows:

            acl “DU_Allowed_List” {
                 192.249.12.21;
            };

The ACL DU_Allowed_List (consisting of IP addresses of hosts allowed to send dynamic update requests
for updating the contents of the zone example.com) is used within the allow-update substatement of the
zone statement as follows:

            zone “example.com” {
                 type master;
                 file “zonedb.example.com”;
                 allow-update { “DU_Allowed_List”; };
            };

Dynamic update requests generally originate from hosts such as DHCP servers that assign IP addresses
dynamically to hosts. Once they assign an IP address to a new host, they need to store the FQDN-to-IP
address mapping (by creating an A RR) and address-to-FQDN mapping (by creating a PTR RR)
information in the primary authoritative name servers for the zones. Creation of this information occurs
through dynamic updates.

As of the time of writing, NSD does not support dynamic update so there are no comparable configuration
options for NSD. All dynamic update messages sent to a DNS sever running NSD will be rejected.
Updates to a zone must be done offline and then the server signaled to reload the new modified zone.

For details on how to secure dynamic update on Windows DNS servers, administrators should consult the
Microsoft TechNet for details 7.

8.1.6       Restricting BIND DNS NOTIFY Transaction Entities

Once zone transfers have been set up between servers, it is a good idea to make sure that secondary name
servers are informed about changes to zone file data through a notification message. By default, a
notification message is sent whenever a primary name server detects a change in the zone file. It sends a
DNS NOTIFY message to every name server listed in the NS RRSet in the zone because they are the
recognized secondary name servers of the zone. DNS administrators should keep notification on because
this configuration will allow updates to be propagated quickly to secondary name servers. If the DNS
administrator wants to turn off the functionality for a specific zone, however, the notify substatement
should be used in the zone statement of that zone:

            zone “example.com” {
                 type master;
                 notify no;
                 file “zonedb.example.com”;
            };

If there are any additional servers to which the zone administrator wants the DNS NOTIFY message to be
sent (e.g., a stealth slave server), the “also-notify” substatement should be added to the zone statement,
and the IP addresses of the additional servers should be specified as its parameter values, as shown below:
