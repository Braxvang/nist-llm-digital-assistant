Various SSL VPN products can use internal databases, combine external authentication servers with an
internal database stored on the SSL VPN device itself, or just use external authentication. Either the SSL
VPN database or the authentication server database can contain user-specific information, such as
preferences for portal settings and bookmarks for Web sites. For ease of management, user information
should be stored on the external authentication server whenever possible to reduce the amount of
duplicated information, which can get out of sync.

In addition to user authentication, the organization should also evaluate different server authentication
options. The SSL VPN device requires an SSL server certificate so it can authenticate itself to clients.
The organization can purchase a server certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA), have the
server certificate signed by its own CA if it already has a public key infrastructure (PKI) in place, or give
the server a self-signed certificate. A user then validates the credentials of the SSL VPN device by
decrypting the certificate with the issuerâ€™s public key and possibly chaining to a trust anchor such as the
trusted CA. The type and issuer of the server certificate may determine whether users from other
organizations can access the VPN. 16

Because integration with authentication servers is an area where SSL VPN products vary greatly, an
organization should ensure that whatever product it chooses is able to support its authentication
requirements. Any potential products should also be tested with the existing authentication servers to
verify interoperability.

4.3.4    Design the Architecture

The architecture of the SSL VPN implementation refers to the selection of devices and software to
provide SSL VPN services and the placement of SSL VPN devices within the existing network
infrastructure. This section focuses on specific recommendations such as selection of hardware
configuration, device placement and firewall configuration, routing policy and other network
considerations, high availability or load balancing support, device management, client software selection,
and portal design.

4.3.4.1 Selection of Hardware Configuration

A key decision to be made for the SSL VPN implementation is the type of hardware configuration to use
for the SSL VPN device. There are three main types of hardware configuration: a hardware appliance, an
upgrade to an existing security product, and a software solution.
