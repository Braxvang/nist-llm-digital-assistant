NIST SP 800-85A-4                                       PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                 INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

                            padded with 'FF' to complete the total length of the
                            value to 8 bytes. This operation is repeated until the
                            number of resets allowed is exceeded
 Expected Result(s)   1. Command returns the application property template with the
                          status word '90 00' at the end.
                      2. The command returns '6A 80' (incorrect parameter in command
                          data field).
                      3. The command returns '6A 80' (incorrect parameter in command
                          data field).
                      4. The command returns '63 CX' (X == number of retries left) and
                          the retry counter will be decremented by 1.
                      5. The command returns '90 00'.
                      6. The command returns '63 CX' (X == number of reties left). Verify
                          that X from this step is > X from step 4.
                      7. The command returns '90 00'.
                      8. The command returns '63 CX' (X == number of reset left).
                      9. The command returns '90 00'.
                      10. The command returns '63 CX'. Verify that X from this step = X
                          from step 8.
                      11. The command returns '6A 80' (incorrect parameter in command
                          data field) and the retry counter remains unchanged.
                      12. The command returns '6A 80' (incorrect parameter in command
                          data field). The retry counter remains unchanged.
                      13. The command returns:
                          • '63 CX' (X==number of resets left).
                          • '69 83' (reset operation blocked) – when the command is
                              invoked after the value of X becomes zero.
                      NOTE: Testing this condition may leave the card unusable in some
                      implementations for all operations related to the key reference
                      associated with this reset counter.
 Postcondition(s)     No further resets of reference data associated with key reference
                      possible.

C.2.3.2       Contactless Interface
 Purpose             Validates that the RESET RETRY COUNTER command cannot be
                     issued through the contactless interface without secure messaging.
 Reference(s)        1. SP 800-73-4 Part 2, Table 2
                     2. AS05.03
 Precondition(s)     1. The IUT is placed within the reading range of the contactless
                         reader.
                     2. There exists a valid PC/SC connection between the test system
                         and the contactless reader.
                     3. No other contactless card is within the proximity of the reader.
