                                                                GUIDELINES ON ACTIVE CONTENT AND MOBILE CODE



 Read the fine print before agreeing to download application software and plug-ins.
 Institutionalize how needed plug-ins and other software code are obtained from software
  manufactures, evaluated, and distributed throughout the organization.
 Do not peruse active content or run downloaded software from untrusted sources. Enable ActiveX
  code only from trusted Web sites that require its use.
 Create and distribute active content documents only after carefully considering the risk and benefits.
 Consider using an isolated system and safe browser settings when visiting untrusted Web sites.
 Limit the applications installed on a system, deleting any that are not used or no longer needed.
 Disable JavaScript and any other active content processing capabilities within email desktop
  applications that are capable of handling HTML or other markup language encoded messages.
 Do not open active content documents or execute any email attachments without first verifying them
  with the sender. Be especially wary of attachments to electronic chain mails forwarded from or
  through friends.
 Keep informed of latest security advisories from the United States Computer Emergency Readiness
  Team (US-CERT) and the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) Coordination Center, and
  subscribe to security mailing lists.
 Periodically cross-check products against published lists of known vulnerabilities, such as the
  National Vulnerability Database (NVD), 10 that provide pointers to solution resources and patch
  information.
 Regularly audit systems and networks, quickly remedying any deficits noted.
 Know who to contact and what steps to take when discovering evidence of an intrusion.
One typical and common sense approach is to improve the security infrastructure incrementally over time.
At each step, apply safeguards against the most critical risk items. For example, start with firewalls and
gateway servers capable of screening active content and executable email attachments and successfully
defending against a high percentage of Internet launched attacks. Later, for additional protection,
complement antivirus software with behavioral controls, intrusion detection capabilities, or other
technologies. Regular site security audits also help to identify vulnerabilities and appropriate safeguards,
and to decide whether the remaining risks warrant further expenditures of time and money.
