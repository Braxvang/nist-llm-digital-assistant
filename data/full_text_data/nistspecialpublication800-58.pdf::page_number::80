 10 Planning for VOIP Deployment

      VOIP is still an emerging technology, so it is somewhat speculative to develop a
      complete picture of what a mature worldwide VOIP network will one day look
      like. As the emergence of SIP has shown, new technologies and new protocol
      designs have the ability to change VOIP. The situation is analogous to the state of
      the Internet in the late 80s and early 90s. Competing protocols and designs for the
      infrastructure of the net flourished at the time, but as the purpose of the Internet
      became more defined with the emergence of the world wide web and other staples
      of today’s net, the structure and protocols became standardized and
      interoperability became much easier. The same may one day be true of VOIP.
      Although there are currently many different architectures and protocols to choose
      from, eventually a dominant standard will emerge.

      The most obvious of these competing standards are SIP and H.323. Comparisons
      are made in numerous academic papers including [16, 18, and 15]. SIP is a fast
      growing protocol with similarities to current Internet standards such as HTTP, but
      it has yet to reach the level of deployment of H.323 [15]. The opinion of many
      academics [16, 18] seems to favor SIP, and we have seen that some of the security
      issues associated with VOIP become simpler with the SIP scheme. It is not clear
      which standard will prevail in the market. It is misleading to portray the choice
      between SIP and H.323 as mutually exclusive. In fact, in today’s non-
      standardized VOIP environment, organizations looking to integrate several VOIP
      networks ought to support both protocols. Several companies have developed
      infrastructure elements to enable multi-protocol telephony. As voice and data
      networks converge, support for both protocols is essential for a robust and
      forward-looking network. Although the future will probably see the emergence of
      one of these protocols as the defined standard in the field the present
      disorganization makes support for both protocols in a VOIP network a pertinent
      issue. Deploying a VOIP network in today’s non-standardized world requires
      support for both protocols. Consequently, organizations moving to VOIP should
      seek out gateways and other network elements that can support both H.323 and
      SIP. Such a strategy helps to ensure a stable and robust VOIP network in the
      years that come, no matter which protocol prevails.

      The other high-level issue in VOIP security today is the choice of end-to-end
      VPNs versus firewall-based VPNs. That is, VOIP traffic must traverse firewalls
      one way or the other. The question becomes, should one build firewalls with
      ALGs, proxies, firewall control proxies, and IPsec functionality to facilitate this,
      or simply tunnel all VOIP traffic straight through the firewall with a VPN. The
      security benefits and administrative troubles associated with each of these
      implementations have been presented in detail in this publication. The use of
      VPNs has been touted by many industry articles as the definitive solution to the
      tribulations posed by firewall and NAT traversal in tunnel mode. However,
      much of their research has focused on small-scale operations where VOIP phones
