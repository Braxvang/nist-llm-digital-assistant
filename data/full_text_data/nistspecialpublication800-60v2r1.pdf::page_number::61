impact may exist. Also, the more serious integrity impacts become increasingly likely as E-
government initiatives progress.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
official information dissemination information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the official information dissemination
information. Official information dissemination processes are generally tolerant of limited
delays. However, even temporary loss of availability of official information dissemination
information is likely to have an adverse effect on public confidence in the agency. In most cases,
disruption of access to official information dissemination information can be expected to have
only a limited adverse effect on overall agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: While most cases will result in only
limited consequences, repeated outages can have a serious adverse effect on public confidence in
the agency. This can significantly degrade the official information dissemination mission
capability. In such cases, the availability impact might be moderate.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
official information dissemination information is low.
C.2.6.3 Product Outreach Information Type

Product Outreach relates to the marketing of government services products, and programs to the
general public in an attempt to promote awareness and increase the number of
customers/beneficiaries of those services and programs. The recommended security
categorization for the product outreach information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of product outreach
information on the ability of responsible agencies to market government services products, and
programs to the general public in an attempt to promote awareness and increase the number of
customers/beneficiaries of those services and programs. Product outreach information is usually
in the public domain and poses no confidentiality impact.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for product outreach information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In most cases,
the adverse effect of unauthorized modification or destruction of product outreach information
on overall agency mission functions will be limited.
