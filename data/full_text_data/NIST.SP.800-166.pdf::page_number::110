                                                                  DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

9.3.1.2 Subject Public Key Algorithm

 Test Assertion           TA-09.03.01.02
 Purpose                  Verifies that the public key algorithm used for generating the keys
                          is as specified in Table 3-4 of [SP800-78].

 Issuer Documentation     None.
 Precondition(s)          • A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                             appropriate token reader.
                          • Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                             an instance of the reader.
                          • A Derived PIV Authentication certificate is present within the
                             Derived PIV Application.
 Test Scenario            1. Send the SELECT command with
                                • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                          2. Send the GET DATA command with
                                • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                   ('5FC105') of the X.509 Certificate for
                                   Derived PIV Authentication data object
                          3. Extract subjectPublicKeyInfo->algorithm->algorithm
                             field value
                          4. Match the algorithm value to the Table 3-4 of
                             [SP800-78].
                          5. If the algorithm is elliptic curve, ensure that the
                             OID for Curve P-256 from Table 3-5 of [SP800-78] is
                             populated in the subjectPublicKeyInfo->algorithm-
                             >parameters->namedCurve field.

                          Note: If the RSA algorithm is used, the
                          subjectPublicKeyInfo->algorithm->parameters field will
                          be NULL.
 Expected Result(s)       1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                             template with the status word ‘90 00’.
                          2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                             along with the status word ‘90 00’.
                          3. From Steps 4 and 5, it is determined that the Derived PIV
                             Authentication key is generated using an allowed asymmetric
                             key algorithm.

9.3.1.3 Public Key Size

 Test Assertion           TA-09.03.01.03
 Purpose                  Verifies that the key size requirements are in accordance with
                          Table 3-1 of [SP800-78].
