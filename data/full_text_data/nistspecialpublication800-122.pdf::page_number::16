    reasons if a request made under subparagraphs (a) and (b) is denied, and to be able to challenge such
    denial; and (d) to challenge data relating to him and, if the challenge is successful, to have the data
    erased, rectified, completed, or amended.
 Accountability—A data controller should be accountable for complying with measures which give
  effect to the principles stated above.
Privacy is much broader than just protecting the confidentiality of PII. To establish a comprehensive
privacy program that addresses the range of privacy issues that organizations may face, organizations
should take steps to establish policies and procedures that address all of the Fair Information Practices.
For example, while providing individuals with notice of new information collections and how their
personal information will be used and protected is central to providing individuals with privacy
protections and transparency, it may not have a significant impact on protecting the confidentiality of
their personal information. On the other hand, the Fair Information Practices related to establishing
security safeguards, purpose specification, use limitation, collection limitation, and accountability are
directly relevant to the protection of the confidentiality of PII. As a result, these principles are
highlighted throughout this document as appropriate.
For more information on the Fair Information Practices, see Appendix D.
