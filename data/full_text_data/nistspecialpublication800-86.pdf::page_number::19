                                              GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



understand their roles and responsibilities for forensics, receive ongoing training and education on
forensic–related policies, guidelines, and procedures, and are prepared to cooperate with and assist others
when the technologies that they are responsible for are part of an incident or other event.

In addition to IT professionals and incident handlers, others within an organization may also need to
participate in forensic activities in a less technical capacity. Examples include management, legal
advisors, human resources personnel, auditors, and physical security staff. Management is responsible for
supporting forensic capabilities, reviewing and approving forensic policy, and approving certain forensic
actions (e.g., taking a mission-critical system off-line for 6 hours to collect data from its hard drives).
Legal advisors should carefully review all forensic policy and high-level guidelines and procedures, and
they can provide additional guidance when needed to ensure that forensic actions are performed lawfully.
The human resources department can provide assistance in dealing with employee relations and the
handling of internal incidents. Auditors can help determine the economic impact of an incident, including
the cost of forensic activity. Physical security staff can assist in gaining access to and physically securing
evidence. Although these teams often do not play a prominent role in the forensic process, the services
that these teams provide can be beneficial.

To facilitate inter-team communications, each team should designate one or more points of contact.
These individuals are responsible for knowing the expertise of each team member and directing inquiries
for assistance to the appropriate person. Organizations should maintain a list of contacts that the
appropriate teams can reference as needed. The list should include both standard (e.g., office phone) and
emergency (e.g., cell phone) contact methods.

2.4     Policies

Organizations should ensure that their policies contain clear statements that address all major forensic
considerations, such as contacting law enforcement, performing monitoring, and conducting regular
reviews of forensic policies, guidelines, and procedures. At a high level, policies should allow authorized
personnel to monitor systems and networks and perform investigations for legitimate reasons under
appropriate circumstances. Organizations may also have a separate policy for incident handlers and
others with forensic roles; this policy would provide more detailed rules for appropriate behavior. Such
personnel should be familiar with and understand the policy. Policies may need to be updated frequently,
particularly for organizations that span many jurisdictions, because of changes to laws and regulations, as
well as new court rulings. In addition, the organization’s forensic policy should be consistent with the
organization’s other policies, including policies related to reasonable expectations of privacy. Sections
2.4.1 through 2.4.3 discuss policy-related topics in more detail.

2.4.1    Defining Roles and Responsibilities

Forensic policy should clearly define the roles and responsibilities of all people performing or assisting
with the organization’s forensic activities. This should include actions performed during both incident
handling and routine work activities (e.g., system administration, network troubleshooting). The policy
should include all internal teams that may participate in forensic efforts, such as those listed in Section
2.3, and external organizations such as law enforcement agencies, outsourcers, and incident response
organizations. The policy should clearly indicate who should contact which internal teams and external
organizations under different circumstances. The policy should also discuss jurisdictional conflicts—a
crime that involves multiple jurisdictions, which could be investigated by multiple law enforcement
agencies—and explain how to resolve them. As mentioned in Section 2.2, some organizations have an
Office of Inspector General (OIG) that is responsible for investigating allegations of misconduct; the OIG
may also be well-suited to resolving jurisdictional conflicts. In some organizations, if a crime may have
been committed, the OIG immediately takes over the investigation.
