Universal Integrated Circuit Card – An integrated circuit card that securely stores the
international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) and the related cryptographic key used to
identify and authenticate subscribers on mobile devices. A UICC may be referred to as a: SIM,
USIM, RUIM or CSIM, and is used interchangeably with those terms.

UMTS Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) – A module similar to the SIM in GSM/GPRS
networks, but with additional capabilities suited to 3G networks.

Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) – A third-generation (3G) mobile
phone technology standardized by the 3GPP as the successor to GSM.

Universal Serial Bus (USB) – A hardware interface for low-speed peripherals such as the
keyboard, mouse, joystick, scanner, printer, and telephony devices.

Volatile Memory – Memory that loses its content when power is turned off or lost.

Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) – A standard that defines the way in which Internet
communications and other advanced services are provided on wireless mobile devices.

Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) – A term describing a wireless local area network that observes the
IEEE 802.11 protocol.

Write-Blocker – A device that allows investigators to examine media while preventing data
writes from occurring on the subject media.

Write Protection – Hardware or software methods of preventing data from being written to a
disk or other medium.
