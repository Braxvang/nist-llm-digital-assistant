                                      Abstract

Cryptographic keys are vital to the security of internet security applications and
protocols. Many widely-used internet security protocols have their own application-
specific Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) that are used to generate the cryptographic
keys required for their cryptographic functions. This Recommendation provides security
requirements for those KDFs.
