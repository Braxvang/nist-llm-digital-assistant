                                                                            Guidelines on PDA Forensics


       specific areas such as file identification or search facilities; tools may report, acquire, and
       examine the contents of acquired data differently; and some tools may be platform specific.
       Therefore, using a toolkit that offers the best set of features for recovering and analyzing
       evidence from a specific device is advantageous.

7.2   Applying Tools

       Once the acquired image has been copied, the next step is to begin searching the data, creating
       bookmarks, and developing the contents of a final report. Forensic examination tools are a
       crucial component in this process as they translate data from raw bit images to a format and
       structure that is understandable by the examiner and can be effectively used to identify and
       recover evidence. It is important to note that tools have the possibility to contain some degree
       of error. For example, the implementation of the tool may have a programming error; the
       specification of a file structure used by the tool to translate bits into data comprehensible by the
       examiner may be inaccurate or out of date; or the file structure generated by another program
       as input may be incorrect, causing the tool to function improperly [Car02]. Therefore, having
       a high degree of trust and understanding of the tool’s ability to perform its function properly is
       essential. In addition, a knowledgeable suspect may tamper with device information, such as
       purposefully misnaming a file extension to foil the workings of a tool or apply a wiping tool to
       remove or eliminate data. Over time, experience with a tool provides an understanding of its
       limitations, allowing an examiner to compensate for them and avoid error.

       Forensic Examination of Digital Evidence – A Guide for Law Enforcement, produced by the
       U.S. Department of Justice [DOJ04], offers the following suggestions for the analysis of
       extracted data:

                Timeframe analysis – Determine when events occurred on the system to associate
                usage with an individual by reviewing any logs present and the date/time stamps in
                the filesystem, such as the last modified time.

                Data hiding analysis – Detect and recover hidden data that may indicate knowledge,
                ownership, or intent by correlating file headers to file extensions to show intentional
                obfuscation; gaining access to password-protected, encrypted, and compressed files;
                gaining access to steganographic information detected in images; and gaining access
                to reserved areas of data storage outside the normal filesystem.

                Application and file analysis – Identify information relevant to the investigation by
                examining file content, correlating files to installed applications, identifying
                relationships between files (e.g., e-mail files to e-mail attachments), determining the
                significance of unknown file types, examining system configuration settings, and
                examining file metadata (e.g., documents containing authorship identification).

                Ownership and possession – Identify the individuals who created, modified, or
                accessed a file, and the ownership and possession of questioned data by placing the
                subject with the device at a particular time and date, locating files of interest in non-
                default locations, recovering passwords that indicate possession or ownership, and
                identifying contents of files that are specific to a user.

       The capabilities of the tools, the richness of features, and the operating system (e.g., Windows
       CE, Palm OS, Linux) and type of device under examination determines what information can
