SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


2.10 Modules, Devices, and Components

This Profile uses the term “component” to mean any hardware, software, and/or firmware
required to construct a CKMS. The term “device” denotes a combination of components that
function together to serve a specific purpose. An FCKMS module is a device that performs a
set of key and metadata management functions for at least one FCKMS.

As shown in Figure 1, an FCKMS includes one or more computers, each with an FCKMS
module that interacts with the FCKMS modules in other computers, often using a means of
communication that requires cryptographic protection. An FCKMS module is the hardware
and/or software that can interact with identical or compatible FCKMS modules located
wherever keys and their metadata are required. Each FCKMS module is associated with a
cryptographic module. A cryptographic module is the hardware and/or software that
performs the actual cryptographic operations, e.g., encryption, decryption and generating a
digital signature. Each FCKMS module must have access to a cryptographic module that
functions as a sub-module of the FCKMS module.




                     Figure 1: FCKMS and its FCKMS Modules

The cryptographic modules used in an FCKMS must be FIPS 140-validated at an appropriate
FIPS 140 security level for the impact-level associated with the information that the keys will
protect. A higher FIPS 140 security level than the minimum level is acceptable.

At a minimum, low impact data must be protected by employing a cryptographic module that
has been validated at level 2 or higher, or at security level 1 if the FCKMS provides either
identity-based or role based authentication and physical-security protection that compensates
for the level 2 physical-security requirements not included in the module. Accordingly, the
