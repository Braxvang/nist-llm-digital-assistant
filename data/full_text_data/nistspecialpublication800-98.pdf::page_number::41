3.    RFID Applications and Application Requirements

RFID technologies are being deployed by many organizations because they have the potential to improve
mission performance and reduce operational costs. To achieve these goals, RFID systems must be
engineered to support the specific business processes that the organization is automating. Applications
for RFID technologies are diverse because of the wide range of business processes that exist.

RFID security risks and the controls available to mitigate them are also highly varied. Typically, only a
subset of the full range of technologies, risks, and controls is applicable to any given RFID
implementation. Important business drivers that shape RFID application requirements and the resulting
characteristics of RFID systems include:

 The general functional objective of the RFID technology (i.e., the application type),
 The nature of the information that the RFID system processes or generates,
 The physical and technical environment at the time RFID transactions occur,
 The physical and technical environment before and after RFID transactions take place, and
 The economics of the business process and RFID system.
This section discusses each of these characteristics in greater detail and provides an overview of common
types of RFID applications.

3.1   RFID Application Types

There are many types of RFID applications, of which some of the most common are asset management,
asset tracking, automated payment, and supply chain management. The key characteristic differentiating
one RFID application from another is the purpose of identifying the tagged items. Table 3-1 lists reasons
why an organization might want to identify an item and the general application type that best corresponds
to those reasons.

                                       Table 3-1. RFID Application Types

                          Purpose of Identification                          Application Type
         Determine the presence of an item                            Asset management
         Determine the location of an item                            Tracking
         Determine the source of an item                              Authenticity verification
         Ensure affiliated items are not separated                    Matching
         Correlate information with the item for decision-making      Process control
         Authenticate a person (holding a tagged item)                Access control
         Conduct a financial transaction                              Automated payment


Application types are not mutually exclusive; an implementation can combine elements of several
application types. For example, both access control systems and sophisticated asset management systems
include tracking features. Supply chain management is a tracking application that spans organizational
boundaries and often includes process control and payment transactions.

Personnel responsible for designing and implementing RFID systems should understand what application
types apply to their implementation so that they can select appropriate security controls. For example, the
