NIST SP 800-58                                              Voice Over IP Security
_____________________________________________________________________________

       loss of one packet is fairly inconsequential, probabilistically the loss of one packet
       means the loss of several packets, which severely degrades the quality of service
       in a VOIP network.

       In a comparison of VOIP quality versus traditional circuit switched networks,
       Sinden [12] reported data from a Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA)
       study that showed even a fairly small percentage of lost packets could push VOIP
       network QoS below the level users have come to expect on their traditional phone
       lines. Each codec the TIA studied experienced a steep downturn in user
       satisfaction when latency crossed the 150 ms point. However, even with less than
       150 ms of latency, a packet loss of 5% caused VOIP traffic encoded with G.711
       (an international standard for encoding telephone audio on a 64 kbps stream) to
       drop below the QoS levels of the PSTN, even with a packet loss concealment
       scheme. Similarly, losses of 1 and 2 percent, respectively, were enough to place
       quality in VOIP networks encoded with G.723.1 (for very low bit rate speech
       compression) and G.729A (for voice compression on an 8kbps stream) below this
       threshold. At losses of 3 and 4 percent, respectively, the performance of these
       networks resulted in a majority of dissatisfied users. These results corroborated
       the findings of a 1998 study at UCal-Berkeley that determined “tolerable loss
       rates are within 1-3% and the quality becomes intolerable when more than 3% of
       the voice packets are lost” [9]. Both studies found that greater payload
       compression rates resulted in a higher sensitivity to packet loss. On the bright
       side, the implementation of forward error correction [9] and packet loss
       concealment schemes produced a VOIP network that was less sensitive to packet
       loss. The percentages presented in both studies did not take into account varying
       packet sizes and several other properties that can affect the relationship between
       packet loss and QoS.

       Despite the infeasibility of using a guaranteed delivery protocol such as TCP,
       there are some remedies for the packet loss problem. One cannot guarantee all
       packets are delivered, but if bandwidth is available, sending redundant
       information can probabilistically annul the chance of loss. Such bandwidth is not
       always accessible and the redundant information will have to be processed,
       introducing even more latency to the system and ironically, possibly producing
       even greater packet loss. Newer codecs such as internet Low Bit-rate Codec
       (iLBC) are also being developed that offer roughly the voice quality and
       computational complexity of G.729A, while providing increased tolerance to
       packet loss.

 3.4   Bandwidth & Effective Bandwidth

       In any network, the obvious first concern is whether the network is available for
       use. Since a network can be broken down into nodes and links between nodes
       where traffic flows, the quest for an available network boils down to the
       availability of each node, and the availability of each path between the nodes.
       Later on, we will consider the nodes themselves, in cases where firewalls, CPUs,
