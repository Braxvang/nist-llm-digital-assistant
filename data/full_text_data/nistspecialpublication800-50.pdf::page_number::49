      personalized and private than the focus group approach and may encourage participants to be more
      forthcoming in their critique of the program.
     Independent Observation/Analysis – Another approach for soliciting feedback is to incorporate a
      review of the IT security awareness and training program as a task to an outside contractor or other
      third party as part of an agency-initiated audit. The agency would do this in addition to the normal
      oversight activity (e.g., OIG, GAO) to get an unbiased opinion regarding program effectiveness.
     Formal Status Reports – A good way to keep focus on security awareness and training requirements
      agency wide is to implement a requirement for regular status reporting by functional managers.
     Security Program Benchmarking (External View) – Many organizations incorporate “Security
      Program” benchmarking as part of their strategy for continuous improvement and striving for
      excellence. This type of benchmarking is focused on the question: How do I rate among my peers?
      The externally focused form of security benchmarking compares an organization’s performance
      against a number of other organizations and provides a report back to the agency on where they fall
      based on observed baselines across all organizations with data currently available. A component of
      this type of benchmarking should include security awareness and training. This type of
      benchmarking is normally done by experts in benchmarking techniques who have extensive
      information (data) across a broad range of organizations over a fairly long duration (five years or
      more).
6.3     Managing Change

It will be necessary to ensure that the program,
                                                    Managing change is the component of the program
as structured, continues to be updated as new

                                                    deployments do not become stagnant and therefore
emerge. Training needs will shift as new skills

objectives can also influence ideas regarding
how best to design training venues and content.
Emerging issues, such as homeland defense, will also impact the nature and extent of security awareness
activities necessary to keep users informed/educated about the latest exploits and countermeasures. New
laws and court decisions may also impact agency policy that, in turn, may affect the development and/or
implementation of awareness and training material. Finally, as security directives change or are updated,
awareness and training material should reflect these changes.

6.4     Ongoing Improvement (“Raising the Bar”)

This stage of the program is focused on creating a level of security awareness and excellence that
achieves a pervasive security presence in the organization. The processes that deliver awareness, training,
and education to the workforce should be totally integrated into the overall business strategy. A mature
security awareness and training program defines a set of metrics for this area, and automated systems
should be in place to support the capture of quantitative data and delivery of management information to
accountable parties on a regular, predefined cycle.
