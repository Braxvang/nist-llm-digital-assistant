Recommended Integrity Impact Level: Although there are regulatory environments in which a low
impact level is appropriate, the circumstances associated with most inspections and auditing
support information require at least a moderate provisional integrity impact level.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to inspections and auditing information.
In most cases, disruption of access to inspections and auditing information is expected to have
only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Not many
inspection or auditing operations involve activities for which temporary loss of availability is
likely to cause significant degradation in mission capability, place the agency at a significant
disadvantage, result in major damage to major assets, or pose a threat to human life.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: For most inspection and audit functions, the recommended
provisional availability impact level is low.

D.21.2 Standards Setting/Reporting Guideline Development Information Type

Standard Setting/Reporting Guideline Development involves the establishment of allowable
limits associated with a regulated activity and the development of reporting requirements
necessary to monitor and control compliance with allowable limits. This includes the
development of requirements for product sampling and testing, emissions monitoring and
control, incident reporting, financial filings, etc. The following provisional security
categorization is recommended for the standards setting/reporting guideline development
information type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of standards
setting/reporting guideline development information on the abilities of responsible agencies to
establish allowable limits associated with a regulated activity and to develop reporting
requirements necessary to monitor and control compliance with allowable limits. In a few cases,
the unauthorized public dissemination of standards or guidelines

information can harm the effectiveness of the function being supported (e.g., public
dissemination of Internal Revenue Service audit thresholds for certain deductions). However,
most Federal standards and guidelines are intended for public dissemination. The consequences
of unauthorized disclosure of the majority of standards setting/reporting guideline development
information will result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals.

There are some cases for which standards or guidelines include classified or other national
security information. Such cases are outside the scope of this guideline.
