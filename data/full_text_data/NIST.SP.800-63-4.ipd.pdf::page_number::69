       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


2054   determine if a biometric sample is being captured from a living subject present at the
2055   point of capture.

2056   Protected Session
2057   A session wherein messages between two participants are encrypted and integrity is
2058   protected using a set of shared secrets called session keys.
2059   A protected session is said to be authenticated if, during the session, one participant
2060   proves possession of one or more authenticators in addition to the session keys, and if the
2061   other party can verify the identity associated with the authenticator(s). If both participants
2062   are authenticated, the protected session is said to be mutually authenticated.

2063   Provisioning API
2064   An attribute API that allows an RP to access to attributes for multiple subscribers for
2065   the purposes of provisioning RP subscriber accounts. Access to a provisioning API is
2066   generally granted to the RP outside of a specific federated authentication transaction.

2067   Pseudonym
2068   A name other than a legal name.

2069   Pseudonymity
2070   The use of a pseudonym to identify a subject.

2071   Pseudonymous Identifier
2072   A meaningless but unique number that does not allow the RP to infer anything regarding
2073   the subscriber but which does permit the RP to associate multiple interactions with the
2074   subscriberâ€™s claimed identity.

2075   Public Key
2076   The public part of an asymmetric key pair that is used to verify signatures or encrypt data.

2077   Public Key Certificate
2078   A digital document issued and digitally signed by the private key of a certificate authority
2079   that binds an identifier to a subscriber to a public key. The certificate indicates that the
2080   subscriber identified in the certificate has sole control and access to the private key. See
2081   also [RFC5280].

2082   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
2083   A set of policies, processes, server platforms, software, and workstations used for the
2084   purpose of administering certificates and public-private key pairs, including the ability to
2085   issue, maintain, and revoke public key certificates.
