NIST SP 800-167                                                                 GUIDE TO APPLICATION W HITELISTING


Executive Summary

An application whitelist is a list of applications and application components (libraries, configuration files,
etc.) that are authorized to be present or active on a host according to a well-defined baseline. The
technologies used to apply application whitelists—to control which applications are permitted to install or
execute on a host—are called whitelisting programs, application control programs, or application
whitelisting technologies. Application whitelisting technologies are intended to stop the execution of
malware and other unauthorized software. Unlike security technologies such as antivirus software, which
block known bad activity and permit all other, application whitelisting technologies are designed to permit
known good activity and block all other. The purpose of this publication is to assist organizations
in understanding the basics of application whitelisting and planning for its implementation.

Implementing the following recommendations should facilitate more efficient and effective application
whitelisting use for federal departments and agencies.

Consider using application whitelisting technologies already built into the host operating system.

Organizations should consider these technologies, particularly for centrally managed desktops, laptops,
and servers, because of the relative ease in managing these solutions and the minimal additional cost. If
built-in application whitelisting capabilities are not available or are determined to be unsuitable, then the
alternative is to examine third-party solutions with robust centralized management capabilities.

Use products that support more sophisticated application whitelisting attributes.

Choosing attributes is largely a matter of achieving the right balance of security, maintainability, and
usability. Simpler attributes such as file path, filename, and file size should not be used by themselves
unless there are strict access controls in place to tightly restrict file activity, and even then there are often
significant benefits to pairing them with other attributes. A combination of digital signature/publisher and
cryptographic hash techniques generally provides the most accurate and comprehensive application
whitelisting capability, but usability and maintainability requirements can put significant burdens on the
organization.

Test prospective application whitelisting technology in monitoring mode.

It is highly recommended to test any prospective application whitelisting technology in a monitoring
mode to see how it behaves before solution deployment. This testing should include a thorough
evaluation of how the solution reacts to changes in software, such as installing an update. An application
whitelisting technology might be considered unsuitable if, for instance, it had to be disabled in order to
install security updates for the operating system or particular applications.

Address application whitelisting technology planning and deployment in a phased approach.

A successful deployment will require a clear, step-by-step planning and implementation process. The use
of a phased approach for deployment can minimize unforeseen issues and identify potential pitfalls early
in the process. This model also allows for incorporating advances in new technology and adapting the
technology to the ever-changing enterprise. In addition to following the security recommendations
presented in this publication, organizations implementing application whitelisting technologies should
also follow the recommendations from NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4, Security and
Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, which defines minimum
recommended management, operational, and technical controls for information systems based on impact
categories.
