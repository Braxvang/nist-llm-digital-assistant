NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                       Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
December 2023                                                                              and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

                      protected channel as defined in [SP800-63B], and the
                      authenticator meets the requirements of [SP800-63B],
                      Sec. 4.2.2, including being validated to [FIPS140] Level
                      1 or higher (review).
  CI(DC)-13    Binding a derived PIV credential to a PIV identity account is           DPCI         [SP800-157], Sec. 3.3 –
 (UPDATED)     accomplished through a connection to a PIV-authenticated                             Binding Derived PIV
               endpoint, a direct connection to the PIV Card, or the use of the                     Credentials
               external authenticator binding procedure, as described in
               [SP800-63B], Sec. 6.1.2.4. In all cases, binding SHALL require
               the use of the PIV-AUTH authentication mechanism specified in
               [FIPS201].

               Assessment
               Determine that:
                  (i) The organization has implemented a method to bind the
                      derived PIV credential to the PIV identity account
                      (review).
                 (ii) Binding of the derived PIV credential to the PIV identity
                      account uses the PIV-AUTH mechanism (observe).
  CI(DC)-14    The issuer retains the biometric sample used to verify the              DPCI         [SP800-157], Sec. 2.2 – Initial
               applicant for future reference.                                                      Issuance

               Assessment
               Determine that:
                 (i) The issuer has implemented a process/system to retain
                     the applicant’s biometric data for maintenance of the
                     derived PIV Credential (review).
  CI(DC)-18    Derived PIV authentication certificates are issued under the id-      PKI-AAL2       [SP800-157], Sec. 3.1.1 –
   (NEW)       fpki-common-derived-pivAuth policy of the X.509 Certificate                          Certificate Policies for Derived
               Policy for the U.S. Federal PKI Common Policy Framework.                             PIV Credentials

               Assessment                                                                           [SP800-157], Sec. 3.1.2 –
               Determine that:                                                                      Cryptographic Specifications
                  (i) The PKI is listed on the Federal PKI Policy Authority’s
                      website as being a provider of derived PIV Credential
                      certificates (review).
                 (ii) Derived PIV authentication certificates comply with the
                      derived PIV authentication certificate profile (review).
                (iii) Cryptographic algorithms and key sizes are based on
                      [SP800-78] (review).
  CI(DC)-19    Once the applicant is authenticated and the derived PIV                 DPCI         [SP800-157], Sec. 2.2 – Initial
   (NEW)       credential is issued, it is represented in the cardholder’s PIV                      Issuance
               identity account.

               Assessment
               Determine that:
                 (i) The issuance of a derived PIV credential is recorded in
                     the PIV identity account for the cardholder (review,
                     observe, test).
