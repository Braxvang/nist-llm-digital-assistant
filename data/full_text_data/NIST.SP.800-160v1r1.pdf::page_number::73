quality management
Coordinated activities to direct and control an organization with regard to quality. [78]

reference monitor concept
An abstract model of the necessary and sufficient properties that must be achieved by any mechanism that performs
an access mediation control function. [21] [37]

reference validation mechanism
An implementation of the reference monitor concept that validates each access to resources against a list of
authorized accesses allowed. [37]

requirement
Statement that translates or expresses a need and its associated constraints and conditions. [31]
A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a system or system element to satisfy an agreement,
standard, specification, or other formally imposed documents. [131]

requirements engineering
An interdisciplinary function that mediates between the domains of the acquirer and supplier to establish and
maintain the requirements to be met by the system, software, or service of interest. [31]
         Note: Requirements engineering is concerned with discovering, eliciting, developing, analyzing, verifying,
         validating, managing, communicating, and documenting requirements.

resource
Asset used or consumed during the execution of a process. [4]
         Note 1: Includes diverse entities, such as funding, personnel, facilities, capital equipment, tools, and
         utilities, such as power, water, fuel, and communication infrastructures.
         Note 2: Resources include those that are reusable, renewable, or consumable.

retirement
Withdrawal of active support by the operation and maintenance organization, partial or total replacement by a new
system, or installation of an upgraded system. [4]

risk
Effect of uncertainty on objectives. [28]
         Note 1: An effect is a deviation from the expected, positive or negative. A positive effect is also known as
         an opportunity.
         Note 2: Objectives can have different aspects (i.e., financial, health and safety, and environmental goals)
         and can apply at different levels (i.e., strategic, organization-wide, project, product, and process).
         Note 3: Risk is often characterized by reference to potential events and consequences or a combination of
         these.
         Note 4: Risk is often expressed in terms of a combination of the consequences of an event (including
         changes in circumstances) and the associated likelihood of occurrence.
         Note 5: Uncertainty is the state, even partial, of deficiency of information related to the understanding or
         knowledge of an event, its consequence, or likelihood.

risk analysis
Process to comprehend the nature of risk and to determine the level of risk. [28]

risk assessment
Overall process of risk identification, risk analysis, and risk evaluation. [28]

risk criteria
Terms of reference against which the significance of a risk is evaluated. [28]
