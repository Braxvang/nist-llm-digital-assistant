      NIST SP 800-157r1 ipd                            Derived PIV Credentials (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


889       • Derived PIV application holder validation (HolderV) is established when the
890         authenticator holder proves knowledge of the derived PIV activation secret
891         associated with the derived PIV credential that contains valid and unrevoked
892         certificates.
893   The derived PIV application facilitates a single authentication mechanism, which is a
894   cryptographic challenge and response authentication protocol that uses the derived PIV
895   authentication private key as described in Appendix B.1.2 of [SP800-73] Part 1 with the
896   following translations:
897       • References to “PIV application” are replaced with “derived PIV application.”
898       • References to “PIV auth certificate” are replaced with “derived PIV authentication
899         certificate.”
900       • References to “PIV Card app ID” are replaced with “derived PIV application ID.”
901   The authentication can also be performed wirelessly over a virtual contact interface (VCI)
902   if a VCI has been established with the derived PIV application.

903   B.2. Derived PIV Application Token Command Interface
904   This appendix contains the technical specifications for the command interface to the
905   derived PIV application surfaced by the card edge of the integrated circuit card (ICC) that
906   represents the removable hardware cryptographic token. The command interface for the
907   derived PIV application SHALL implement all of the card commands supported by the
908   PIV Card application as described in [SP800-73] Part 2, which include:
909       • SELECT
910       • GET DATA
911       • VERIFY
912       • CHANGE REFERENCE DATA
913       • RESET RETRY COUNTER
914       • GENERAL AUTHENTICATE
915       • PUT DATA
916       • GENERATE ASYMMETRIC KEY PAIR
917   The specifications for the token command interface SHALL be the same as the
918   specifications for the corresponding card edge commands for a PIV Card as described
919   in [SP800-73] Part 2, except for the following deviations:
920       • References to “PIV Card application” are replaced with “derived PIV application.”
921       • References to “PIV data objects” are replaced with “derived PIV data objects.”
