      NIST SP 800-157r1 ipd                            Derived PIV Credentials (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


227   1.   Introduction
228   This section is informative.
229   [FIPS 201] specifies a common set of identity credentials to satisfy the requirements of
230   [HSPD-12] in a smart card form factor known as the Personal Identity Verification (PIV)
231   Card. This publication is a companion document to FIPS 201 that specifies the use of
232   additional common identity credentials, known as derived PIV credentials, that are issued
233   by a federal department or agency and may be used when the use of a PIV Card is not
234   practical. Consistent with the goals of HSPD-12, derived PIV credentials are designed to
235   serve as a Federal Government-wide standard for a secure and reliable identity credential
236   that supports interoperability across agencies.

237   1.1. Background
238   FIPS 201 originally required that the PIV credential and associated keys be stored in a
239   PIV Card. While the use of the PIV Card for electronic authentication works well with
240   many traditional desktop and laptop computers, it is not well-suited to other devices, such
241   as mobile devices. In response to the growing use of mobile endpoints within the Federal
242   Government, FIPS 201-2 permitted the issuance of additional PKI-based credentials,
243   referred to as derived PIV credentials, for which the corresponding private key is stored
244   in a cryptographic module within a mobile device, such as a smartphone. PKI-based
245   derived PIV credentials use the Federal PKI Infrastructure to securely establish the
246   binding between the credential and the PIV identity account. PKI-based derived PIV
247   credentials are typically integrated into user endpoints, such as mobile devices, although
248   they are not limited to use in these devices.
249   In order to provide additional flexibility for federal departments and agencies, FIPS 201-3
250   expands the set of credentials beyond those that are PKI-based and broadens their use
251   to other types of devices in addition to mobile devices. The technical details for the
252   expanded set of derived PIV credentials is specified in this revision of SP 800-157 (SP
253   800-157, Revision 1) in a variety of form factors. Non-PKI-based derived PIV credentials
254   are authenticators (as defined in [SP800-63B]) that may be separate from the endpoint
255   being authenticated and, if so, are connected to the endpoint for that purpose. Since there
256   is no PKI infrastructure to validate and supply attributes for non-PKI-based derived PIV
257   credentials, non-PKI-based derived PIV credentials are always used to authenticate to the
258   home agency of the PIV cardholder from which the cardholder’s PIV identity account
259   is accessed. When access to the PIV identity account is needed outside of the home
260   agency — particularly when a non-PKI-based derived PIV credential is presented in
261   authentication — federation allows connection across security domains as detailed in
262   [SP800-217].
263   Derived PIV credentials leverage the current investment in the PIV infrastructure
264   for electronic authentication and build upon the solid foundation of the well-vetted
265   and trusted identity of the PIV cardholder as represented in the PIV identity account,
