Subsequent to the publication of the standard, NIST created an mDL reader device reference
implementation, which is used to test vendor mDL instances and enable relying parties to
apply mDL in their systems.
Access Control Policy Verification and Development Tools
Traditional access control policy verification methods have capability and performance issues
related to inaccuracy and complexity that is limited by applied technologies. For instance, model
proof, test oracle, and data structure methods initially assume that the policy under verification
is faultless unless the policy model cannot handle test cases. Thus, the challenge of the
method is to compose test cases that can comprehensively discover all faults. Alternatively, a
system simulation method requires translating the policy to a simulated system. The translation
between systems may be difficult or impractical to implement if the policy logic is complicated
or the number of policy rules is large. To answer these challenges, Machine Learning Method
for Access Control Policy Verification (NISTIR 8360) proposes an efficient and straightforward
method for access control policy verification by applying a classification algorithm of machine
learning that does not require comprehensive test cases, oracle, or system translation but
rather checks the logic of policy rules directly, making it more efficient and feasible compared
to traditional methods.
Attribute-based Access Control for Microservices-based Applications
Cloud-native applications now consist of loosely coupled components called microservices
(typically implemented as containers), with all application services (e.g., authentication,
authorization, load balancing, setting up of network connections) provided through a dedicated
infrastructure called the service mesh, which is independent of the application code. The
requirements of the authorization service in this environment are to build the following:
•   The concept of zero trust by enabling all authorizations for every application request to
    be based on a verification of the identity of the user, service, or device irrespective of the
    location or nature of the requesting service; and
•   A robust access control mechanism based on an expressive access control model, such as
    Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC), that can be used to express a wide set of policies
    based on a rich set of all contextual attributes and is scalable in terms of the user base,
    objects (resources), and deployment environment.
Attribute-based Access Control for Microservices-based Applications Using a Service Mesh
(SP 800-204B) was published in August 2021. This publication provides guidance for building
an ABAC-based deployment within the service mesh that meets the requirements stated above.
The security assurance provided by the deployment, the supporting infrastructure needed, and
the advantages of Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) – the ABAC model representation
developed at NIST that is used in the deployment – are also discussed.
