NIST SP 800-215                                                            Guide to a Secure Enterprise
November 2022                                                                      Network Landscape

   Network Configurations for Basic Security Functions
Any enterprise-wide secure network that consists of on-premises and cloud-hosted applications
should be based on an established security framework. In turn, security frameworks consist of
many basic security functions. The purpose of this section is to describe the network
configurations or designs (and network communication exchanges based on them) that have
emerged as the state of practice for implementing these security functions. The state of practice
network configuration features (NCF) found in enterprises with hybrid application environments
can be classified under the following areas [19]:
   •   Network configuration for Device Management
   •   Network configuration for User Authentication
   •   Network configuration for Device Authentication and Health Monitoring
   •   Network configuration for Authorizing Application/Service Access
   •   Network configurations for Preventing Attack Escalation
Each of the network configuration features is enumerated using the identifier of the form HAE-
NCF-x, where HAE denotes a hybrid application environment, NCF denotes the network
configuration feature, and x stands for the sequence number of the feature. First, consider the
conceptual underpinning – critical information that is used as part of the deployment of a
security functionality using a network configuration.

4.1 Conceptual Underpinning – Contextual Information
Section 2.4 discussed the limitation of using user identity alone to authorize application requests.
However, this does not mean that identity verification can be relegated to a secondary
requirement. It has been widely recognized that identity validation is the entry point (may be a
highly-vulnerable point of entry into the system) to an application request [26] since all requests
– whether coming from a service (or microservice), user, or device – come with a claimed
identity. This identity must be verified using robust, phishing-resistant multi-factor
authentication.
However, other attributes associated with the user and the information associated with other
entities involved in an application access request, such as devices and services, are required in
current enterprise IT environments and are collectively called contextual information. This
contextual information set may vary from one enterprise to another and is based on the level of
trust that the organization requires for a particular access request. Since the role of contextual
information in potential attacks may not be known, the set to be included in the access decision is
a risk-based decision. Contextual information may broadly belong to the following five key areas
[27]:
   1. Information about the user requesting access – Apart from user identity, attributes
      associated with the user, such as their role in the organization, current assignments, and
      status (cross verification of identity in the enterprise identity management (IDM) system
      vs enterprise directory)
