                                              ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



1.       Introduction

1.1      Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency
Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2      Purpose and Scope

This publication seeks to assist organizations in understanding, selecting, and implementing technologies
based on Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11i, part of the IEEE 802.11 family
of wireless networking standards. 2 The document explains at length the security features and capabilities
associated with IEEE 802.11i through its framework for Robust Security Networks (RSN), and provides
extensive guidance on the planning and deployment of RSNs. The document also discusses previous
IEEE 802.11 security measures and their shortcomings.

1.3      Audience

This document has been created for those who are responsible for ensuring the security of wireless local
area networks (WLAN). The guide should also be useful for network and security engineers and
administrators who are responsible for designing, implementing, securing, and maintaining IEEE 802.11i
implementations.

1.4      Document Structure

The remainder of this document is organized into the following nine major sections:

       Section 2 provides an overview of wireless networking, focusing on the IEEE 802.11 family of
        WLAN standards, and explains the basic IEEE 802.11 WLAN components and architectural
        models.



2
      By the end of 2006, 802.11i will no longer exist, because it is being rolled into the base standard. At that time, the reference
      is expected to be IEEE 802.11:2006.
