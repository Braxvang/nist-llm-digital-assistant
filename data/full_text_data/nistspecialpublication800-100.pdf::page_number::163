       3. What impact are those tasks having on the mission of my organization?

Q. How are the different metrics selected?
A. The universe of possible metrics, based on existing policies and procedures, will
   be quite large. Metrics must be prioritized to ensure that the final set selected for
   initial implementation has the following qualities:
   • Facilitates improvement of high-priority security control implementation. High
     priority may be defined by the latest GAO or IG reports, results of a risk
     assessment, or internal organizational goal.
   • Uses data that can realistically be obtained from existing processes and data
     repositories.
   • Measures processes that already exist and are relatively stable. Measuring
     nonexistent or unstable processes will not provide meaningful information
     about security performance and will, therefore, not be useful for targeting
     specific aspects of performance.
   Metrics can be derived from existing data sources, including C&A, security
   assessments, POA&M, incident statistics, and agency-initiated or independent
   reviews.

Q. Can a weighting scale be used during the selection process for metrics?
A. Yes. If weights were assigned to metrics in the Prepare for Data Collection phase,
   these weights should be used to prioritize corrective actions. Alternatively,
   weights may be assigned to corrective actions in the Identify Corrective Actions
   phase based on the criticality of implementing specific corrective actions, the cost
   of corrective actions, and the magnitude of corrective actions’ impact on the
   organization’s security posture.

Q. Are there any specific characteristics that should be defined in each
   metric?
A. Once applicable metrics that contain the qualities described above are identified,
   they will need to be documented with supporting detail, including frequency of
   data collection, data source, formula for calculation, implementation evidence for
   measured activity, and guide for metric data interpretation.
