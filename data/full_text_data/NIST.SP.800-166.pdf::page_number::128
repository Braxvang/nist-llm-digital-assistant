NIST SP 800-166                                                 DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

 DTR(s)                  • DTR-07.03.03.07
 Issuer Documentation    None.
 Precondition(s)         • A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                            appropriate token reader.
                         • Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                            an instance of the reader.
                         • A key management certificate is present within the Derived
                            PIV Application.
 Test Scenario           1. Send the SELECT command with
                               • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                         2. Send the GET DATA command with
                               • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                  ('5FC10B') of the X.509 Certificate for Key
                                  Management data object
                         3. Extract the value of the authorityInfoAccess
                            extension from the certificate.
 Expected Result(s)      1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                            template with the status word '90 00'.
                         2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                            along with the status word '90 00'.
                         3. From Step 3, the authorityInfoAccess extension contains an id-
                            ad-caIssuers (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2) accessMethod with an
                            accessLocation of type uniformResourceIdentifier where the
                            scheme is “http” or “ldap.”

9.3.3.7 Asymmetric Key Pair

 Test Assertion          TA-09.03.03.07
 Purpose                 Verifies that the public key that exists in the key management
                         certificate corresponds to the private key within the Derived PIV
                         Application.

                         • A key management certificate is present within the Derived
                             PIV Application.
