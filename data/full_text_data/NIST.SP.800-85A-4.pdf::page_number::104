NIST SP 800-85A-4                                        PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                  INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

 Test Scenario        1. Send SELECT card command with
                         • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 10 00 01 00'
                      2. Send VERFY card command with
                         • P2, key reference value is set to '80'
                         • Data file of the command will contain the PIN value
                            obtained from the vendor, padded with 'FF' to complete
                            to total length of the value to 8 bytes.
                      3. Repeat step 1 with
                         • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 00 00' (invalid AID)
                      4. Send GET DATA card command with
                         • Data field of the command containing the tag of the
                            Cardholder Fingerprints data object
                      5. Repeat step 1 with
                         • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 10 00'
                      6. Repeat steps 3 and 4
 Expected Result(s)   1. The command returns the application property template with the
                         status word '90 00' at the end.
                      2. The command returns the status word '90 00'.
                      3. The command returns '6A 82' (application not found)
                      4. The command returns the Cardholder Fingerprints object with
                         the status word '90 00' at the end.
                      5. The command returns the application property template with the
                         status word '90 00' at the end.
                      6. The commands return the same results as in steps 3 and 4.
 Postcondition(s)     The PIV Card Application continues to be the currently selected
                      application and the application security status of the PIV Card
                      Application remains unchanged.


C.1.1.3        Contactless Interface
 Purpose              Validates conformance of the SELECT card command through the
                      contactless interface.
 Reference(s)         1. SP 800-73-4 Part 2, Table 2
                      2. AS05.01, AS05.05, AS05.07, AS05.08, AS05.10
 Precondition(s)      1. The IUT is placed within the reading range of the contactless
                          reader.
                      2. There exists a valid PC/SC connection between the test system
                          and the contactless reader.
                      3. No other contactless card is within the proximity of the reader.
 Test Scenario        1. Send SELECT card command with
                         • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 10 00 01 00'
                      2. Send SELECT card command without the version number
                         • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 10 00'
                      3. Repeat step 1 with
                         • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 00 00' (invalid AID)
