                                                               Guideline for Identifying an Information
                                                               System as a National Security System




1.0 Introduction
This document provides guidelines developed in conjunction with the Department of
Defense, including the National Security Agency, for identifying an information system
as a national security system. The basis for these guidelines is the Federal Information
Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA, Title III, Public Law 107-347, December 17,
2002), which provides government-wide requirements for information security,
superseding the Government Information Security Reform Act and the Computer
Security Act.

FISMA both provides a framework for ensuring the effectiveness of information security
controls over information resources that support Federal operations and assets and
provides for the maintenance of minimum controls required to protect Federal
information and information systems. Federal agencies are responsible for providing
information security protection of information collected or maintained by or on behalf of
the agency and information systems used or operated by or on behalf of the agency. The
head of each Federal agency is also responsible for (1) assessing the risk and magnitude
of the harm that could result from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption,
modification, or destruction of information or information systems that support
operations or assets under their control; (2) determining the levels of information
security appropriate to protect such information and information systems; (3)
implementing policies and procedures to cost-effectively reduce risks to an acceptable
level; and (4) periodically testing and evaluating information security controls and
techniques to ensure that they are effectively implemented.

Except for national security systems as defined by FISMA, the Secretary of Commerce is
responsible for prescribing standards and guidelines pertaining to Federal information
systems on the basis of standards and guidelines developed by NIST. The Committee on
National Security Systems (CNSS) along with Federal agencies that operate systems
falling within the definition of national security systems provide security standards and
guidance for national security systems. In addition to defining the term national security
system FISMA amended the NIST Act, at 15 U.SC. 278g-3(b)(3), to require NIST to
provide guidelines for identifying an information system as a national security system. As
stated in the House Committee report, “This guidance is not to govern such systems, but
rather to ensure that agencies receive consistent guidance on the identification of systems
that should be governed by national security system requirements.” Report of the
Committee on Government Reform, U. S House of Representatives, Report 107-787,
November 14, 2002, p. 85.

The Department of Defense and the Director, Central Intelligence have authority to
develop policies, guidelines, and standards for national security systems. The Director,
Central Intelligence is responsible for policies relating to systems processing intelligence
information. The Committee for National Security Systems, whose executive agent is the
National Security Agency, was established to develop operating policies, procedures,
guidelines, instructions and standards as necessary to implement provisions of the
National Policy for the Security of National Security Telecommunications and
