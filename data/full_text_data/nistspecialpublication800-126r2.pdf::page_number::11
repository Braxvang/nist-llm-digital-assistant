This document assumes that readers already have general knowledge of SCAP and reasonable familiarity
with the SCAP component specifications that their content, products, or services use. Individuals without
this level of knowledge who would like to learn more about SCAP should consult NIST Special
Publication (SP) 800-117, Guide to Adopting and Using the Security Content Automation Protocol.7

1.5     Document Conventions
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”,
“SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be
interpreted as described in Request for Comment (RFC) 2119 [RFC2119]. When these words appear in
regular case, such as “should” or “may”, they are not intended to be interpreted as RFC 2119 key words.
When a single term within a sentence is italicized, this indicates that the term is being defined. These
terms and their definitions also appear in Appendix C.
Some of the requirements and conventions used in this document reference Extensible Markup Language
(XML) content [XMLS]. These references come in two forms, inline and indented. An example of an
inline reference is: a <cpe2_dict:cpe-item> may contain <cpe2_dict:check> elements that
reference OVAL Definitions.
In this example the notation <cpe2_dict:cpe-item> can be replaced by the more verbose
equivalent “the XML element whose qualified name is cpe2_dict:cpe-item”.
An example of an indented reference is:
          References to OVAL Definitions are expressed using the following format:
          <cpe2_dict:check system=
          "http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5"
          href="Oval_URL">[Oval_inventory_definition_id]
