GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



pre-defined objectives. One commonly used methodology for planning and performing tabletop exercise
events has the following phases:

     Design. The TT&E program coordinator works with a tabletop exercise design team to design
      the event. The design phase is often the most time-consuming, and planning for exercises
      typically starts at least one month in advance (three months for large, complex exercises). The
      major steps in the event design process are as follows:

        –   Determine the exercise topic based on the focus of the plan being exercised

        –   Determine the exercise scope based on the target audience

        –   Identify the objectives of the exercise

        –   Identify the individuals that should participate in the exercise and invite them to the event

        –   Identify the staff for the exercise, including a facilitator and a data collector

        –   Coordinate the logistics for the exercise event.
     Development. The design team creates the documentation to be used before, during, and after
      the exercise event. Typical documentation includes a briefing, a facilitator guide, a participant
      guide, and an after action report.
     Conduct. In this phase, the IT plan is actually exercised. Tabletop exercises are usually
      conducted in a classroom-type setting. The facilitator provides a briefing to the participants, then
      walks them through the scenario and initiates a group discussion using a question from the
      facilitator guide. As the discussion continues, the facilitator may inject additional questions
      periodically. The data collector documents issues to be included in the after action report.
      Immediately following the facilitated discussion, the facilitator and data collector conduct an
      exercise debrief, in which they ask the participants in which areas they excel, in which areas they
      could use additional training, and which areas of the IT plan should be updated.
     Evaluation. The comments from the debrief, along with lessons learned during the exercise,
      should be captured in an after action report. The report should include background information
      about the exercise, documented observations made by the facilitator and data collector, and
      recommendations for enhancing the IT plan that was exercised. Outcomes of the evaluation
      could include updating the IT plan or other security-related documents, briefing managers on the
      results, and performing other actions.
