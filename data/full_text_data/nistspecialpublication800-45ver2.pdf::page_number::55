messages. 36 HTML-based messages also frequently contain other undesirable content, such as spam
messages and phishing attempts. 37 Phishing refers to use of deceptive computer-based means to trick
individuals into disclosing sensitive personal information. For example, an attacker could send victims an
email message that looks as if it were sent from a well-known organization, such as an online business,
credit card company, or financial institution. The email is intended to deceive users into responding to
the email and disclosing personal data.

If a mail server does not have malware scanning software installed (e.g., anti-virus software, anti-spyware
software), or the software is ineffective, the potential security threat posed by malware increases for end
users. Some popular mail clients have default configurations that are used by malware to infect client
hosts and transmit malware to other users. Section 8 contains additional information on configuring mail
clients to improve their security. In addition to mail client configuration, it is important that the mail
client hosts use anti-virus software and possibly other security technologies as well to protect them from
email-borne threats.

Section 6.2.1 discusses the need for malware scanning for both individual mail clients and the mail
infrastructure. Sections 6.2.2 discusses content filtering technologies that can also be helpful at stopping
email-borne threats. In addition to deploying and configuring technologies, an organization should also
conduct training and awareness activities for users, particularly telecommuters using computers outside
the organization’s control, so that users can better recognize malicious email messages and attachments
and handle them appropriately. This is discussed in Section 6.2.3.

6.2.1    Malware Scanning

To protect against viruses, worms, and other forms of malware, it is necessary to implement scanning at
one or more points within the email delivery process. Malware scanning can be implemented on the
firewall, mail relay, or mail gateway appliance as the email data enters the organization’s network, on the
mail server itself, and/or on the end users’ hosts. Each option has its own strengths and weaknesses,
which are discussed below. Generally, organizations should implement at least two levels of malware
scanning—one at the end users’ host level and one at the mail server or the firewall/mail relay/mail
gateway level—and should consider implementing malware scanning at all three levels.

When providing multiple layers of malware protection, organizations should consider choosing products
from different manufacturers. Diversity increases the chances of blocking the latest threats, because the
response time of individual manufacturers to new threats varies. This means that when the newest threats
appear, one product can often detect them earlier than another over some period of time (typically hours,
perhaps a few days). Since each manufacturer uses different detection methods, some products are also
better able to detect certain types of new threats than other products.

6.2.1.1 Scanning at the Firewall, Mail Relay, or Mail Gateway Appliance

The first option is scanning for malware at the firewall (application proxy), mail relay (see Figure 6.1), or
mail gateway appliance, which can intercept messages before they reach the organization’s mail server.
The device listens on TCP port 25 for SMTP connections, scans each message, then forwards the

     Limiting the use of HTML within email, such as requiring users to send and view emails in plaintext only, has security
     benefits but can seriously impact functionality for users, such as causing graphics, hyperlinks, and other HTML-based
     content to be disabled or suppressed altogether. Some organizations choose to block all HTML-based email because they
     have decided the security benefits outweigh the loss of functionality.
