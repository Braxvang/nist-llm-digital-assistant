NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

Firewalls are commonly used to support network isolation and employed as boundary protection
devices to control connections and information flows between network segments. Firewalls may
be deployed as network devices or directly run on some hosts. Firewalls are very flexible
isolation devices and typically constitute the primary mechanism for protecting OT devices.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Appropriate firewall configuration is essential to properly securing the
            network segments. Firewall rulesets should be established to only permit
            connections between adjacent levels, tiers, or zones. For example,
            organizations that utilize a Purdue model architecture should implement
            firewall rules and connection paths that prevent Level 4 devices from
            directly communicating with Level 2, 1, or 0 devices. A similar concept
            would be applied to ISA/IEC 62443 and IIC architectures.
            One area of considerable variation in practice associated with firewall
            rules is the control of outbound traffic from the control network.
            Allowing outbound connections from lower levels, tiers, or zones could
            represent a significant risk if unmanaged. Organizations should consider
            making outbound rules as stringent as inbound rules to reduce these
            risks.
            An alternative to firewalls is a unidirectional gateway or data diode that
            permits authorized communication in only one direction. The use of
            unidirectional gateways may provide additional protections associated
            with system compromises at higher levels or tiers within the
            environment. For example, a unidirectional gateway deployed between
            Layers 2 and 3 may protect Layer 0, 1, and 2 devices from a
            cybersecurity event that occurs at Layers 3, 4, or 5.

5.2.3.2.       Centralized Logging
Network and computing devices (e.g., routers, gateways, switches, firewalls, servers, and
workstations) should be configured to log events to support monitoring, alerting, and incident
response analysis. Logging capabilities are typically available for recording events in
applications, OSs, and network communications. A centralized log management platform can
assist organizations with supporting log retention, monitoring, and analysis efforts.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should review their available logging capabilities and
            configure them to record the operational and cybersecurity events that
            are appropriate for their environment.
            Organizations should establish how long event logs should be retained
            and ensure that adequate storage is available to support log retention
            requirements.
