647   3.1.9. System Use Notification
648           REQUIREMENT: 03.01.09

649           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
650           Determine if:
651           A.03.01.09: a system use notification message with privacy and security notices consistent with

653           ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
654           Examine
655           [SELECT FROM: access control policy and procedures; privacy and security policies, procedures
656           for system use notification; documented approval of system use notification messages; system
657           audit records; user acknowledgements of system use notification messages; system design
658           documentation; system configuration settings; system use notification messages; system security
659           plan; other relevant documents or records]
660           Interview
661           [SELECT FROM: personnel with information security responsibilities; legal counsel; system

667   3.1.10. Device Lock
668             REQUIREMENT: 03.01.10

669             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
670             Determine if:
671             A.03.01.10.ODP[01]: one or more of the following parameter values is/are selected:
672             {initiating a device lock after <A.03.01.10.ODP[02] time period> of inactivity; requiring the
673             user to initiate a device lock before leaving the system unattended}.
674             A.03.01.10.ODP[02]: time period of inactivity after which a device lock is initiated is
675             defined (if selected).
676             A.03.01.10.a: access to the system is prevented by <A.03.01.10.ODP[01]: selected parameter
677             value(s)>.
678             A.03.01.10.b: the device lock is retained until the user reestablishes access using established
679             identification and authentication procedures.
680             A.03.01.10.c: information previously visible on the display is concealed via device lock with a
681             publicly viewable image.
