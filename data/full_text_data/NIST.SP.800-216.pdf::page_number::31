NIST SP 800-216                                                                 Federal Vulnerability
May 2023                                                                        Disclosure Guidelines

       Management Considerations
This section describes management considerations for creating one or more VDPOs.

3.3.1. Leadership Support
Support from leadership is critical in this endeavor and should include communications about the
importance of the program. Top management should ensure that the vulnerability handling
program’s objectives are compatible with the organization’s strategic direction and integrated
into the organization’s existing processes. Roles should be assigned along with resources to
empower the implementation of the program. Communication from leadership should emphasize
support for a continuous improvement process and include a mechanism to report progress to
upper management.
Agency reporting of their cybersecurity status to leadership should include metrics related to the
VDPO. This will keep leadership aware of progress with the agency’s vulnerability disclosure
and remediation process.

3.3.2. Staffing Needs
The use of existing information security operations and compliance staff is strongly encouraged.
The VDPO’s staff need to have a strong grasp of the nature of reported vulnerabilities to
coordinate with appropriate parties, handle sensitive information, and confidentially interact with
partners and stakeholders. Management should designate roles and assign appropriate
authorization to allow for accountability and enable the program’s successful implementation.
These positions may include a champion to act as a change agent to foster communication and
promote stakeholder buy-in at all levels.

3.3.3. Leveraging Existing Processes
Existing operational processes across multiple programs can be leveraged to support the
vulnerability process, though they may vary and need to be aligned. A gap analysis may be
necessary to identify essential policy components to enable intra-agency and inter-agency
programs to share and collaborate. As part of the effort for continual improvement, a mechanism
should be implemented to allow for regular assessment and feedback on the effectiveness of the
developed process, as well as provide data for insights, improvements, and lessons learned.

3.3.4. Integration of Contractor Support into the VDPO
Policy considerations pertaining to the handling, resolution, and correction of vulnerability
disclosure information should be included in any contracts that support a federal information
system in order to mitigate or resolve the vulnerability.

3.3.5. Customer Support and Public Relations
Handling vulnerabilities requires a holistic approach that engages aspects beyond engineering
and technology. Customer service and public relations are equally important. If a disclosed
