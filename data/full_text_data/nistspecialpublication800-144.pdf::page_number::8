that a non-negotiable service agreement brings to public cloud computing, however, making a
negotiated agreement less cost effective. As an alternative, the organization may be able to
employ compensating controls to work around identified shortcomings in the public cloud
service. Other alternatives include cloud computing environments with a more suitable
deployment model, such as an internal private cloud, which can potentially offer an organization
greater oversight and authority over security and privacy, and better limit the types of tenants
that share platform resources, reducing exposure in the event of a failure or configuration error in
a control.

With the growing number of cloud providers and range of services from which to choose,
organizations must exercise due diligence when selecting and moving functions to the cloud.
Decision making about services and service arrangements entails striking a balance between
benefits in cost and productivity versus drawbacks in risk and liability. While the sensitivity of
data handled by government organizations and the current state of the art make the likelihood of
outsourcing all information technology services to a public cloud low, it should be possible for
most government organizations to deploy some of their information technology services to a
public cloud, provided that all requisite risk mitigations are taken.

Ensure that the client-side computing environment meets organizational security and privacy
requirements for cloud computing.
Cloud computing encompasses both a server and a client side. With emphasis typically placed
on the former, the latter can be easily overlooked. Services from different cloud providers, as
well as cloud-based applications developed by the organization, can impose more exacting
demands on the client, which may have implications for security and privacy that need to be
taken into consideration.

Because of their ubiquity, Web browsers are a key element for client-side access to cloud
computing services. Clients may also entail small lightweight applications that run on desktop
and mobile devices to access services. The various available plug-ins and extensions for Web
browsers are notorious for their security problems. Many browser add-ons also do not provide
automatic updates, increasing the persistence of any existing vulnerabilities. Similar problems
exist for other types of clients.

Maintaining physical and logical security over clients can be troublesome, especially with
embedded mobile devices such as smart phones. Their size and portability can result in the loss
of physical control. Built-in security mechanisms often go unused or can be overcome or
circumvented without difficulty by a knowledgeable party to gain control over the device.
Moreover, cloud applications are often delivered to them through custom-built native
applications (i.e., apps) rather than a Web browser.

The growing availability and use of social media, personal Webmail, and other publicly available
sites are a concern, since they increasingly serve as avenues for social engineering attacks that
can negatively impact the security of the client, its underlying platform, and cloud services
accessed. Having a backdoor Trojan, keystroke logger, or other type of malware running on a
client device undermines the security and privacy of public cloud services as well as other
Internet-facing public services accessed. As part of the overall cloud computing security
