   and certain aspects of denial of service (DoS) and distributed DoS (DDos) detection and
   mitigation. Many of the recommendations in this publication focus on the Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP). Technologies recommended in this document for securing the interdomain
   routing control traffic include Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), BGP origin validation,
   and prefix filtering. Additionally, technologies recommended for mitigating DoS/DDoS attacks
   focus on preventing IP address spoofing using source address validation with access control
   lists and unicast reverse-path forwarding. Other technologies – such as remotely triggered
   black hole filtering, flow specification, and response rate limiting – are also recommended as
   part of the overall security mechanisms.

• SP 800-189 is referenced in NIST SP 800-53, Revision 5, as the technical basis for new
  boundary protection security controls (SC-7) that are focused on DDoS mitigation and the
  prevention of unauthorized control traffic. The guidance also fulfills a significant deliverable
  described in Executive Order 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks
  and Critical Infrastructure.

Zero Trust Networks

Zero Trust is the term for a set of cybersecurity paradigms to move network defenses from
static, physical, network-based perimeters to software-defined security mechanisms based on
users, assets, and resources. A zero trust architecture (ZTA) uses zero trust principles to plan
enterprise infrastructure and workflows.

Zero trust assumes that there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely
on their physical or network location (i.e., a local corporate network versus the Internet). It is a
response to enterprise network trends, including remote users and cloud-based assets that are
not located within an enterprise-owned network boundary. Zero trust focuses on protecting
resources rather than network segments, as the network location is no longer considered the
prime component to the security posture of the resource.

NIST SP 800-207, Zero Trust Architecture, was published in August 2020 and discusses the core
principles and logical components that make up a ZTA. SP 800-207 contains a ZTA definition
and describes general deployment models and use cases where zero trust could improve an
enterprise’s overall information technology security posture. Following the publication of SP
800-207, the NCCoE initiated a new ZTA building block demonstration project that is planned
to start in FY 2021.

NIST’s Software Defined and Virtual Networks Project advances the state of the art in
network virtualization, network service function chaining, software-defined networks (SDN),
technologies, and techniques to address the robustness and security of virtualized network
services. Recent work explores novel applications of network function virtualization (NFV)
and SDN to practices such as network security and intrusion detection, cloud computing,
machine-to-machine communications, and advanced mobility. A key research component is the
development of programmable measurement techniques that efficiently operate at the scale
and speed of advanced networks.
