     AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT
     Properly managing access to systems, processes, and information is central to managing
     cybersecurity risks and a priority for NIST’s cybersecurity and privacy program. NIST
     engages and collaborates with standards bodies and consortia such as the International
     Organization for Standardization (ISO),5 the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),6 the
     Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Alliance,7 the Open Identity Federation (OIF), and the Kantara
     Initiative8 to document and advance the various methods for ensuring reliable and secure
     identity and access management. NIST began the development of the Identity and Access
     Management Resource Center in FY 2019. This virtual resource center was designed to
     share NIST’s efforts to strengthen the security, privacy, usability, and interoperability of
     identity and access management solutions and includes convenient links and details
     relative to NIST identity projects across the entire organization.
