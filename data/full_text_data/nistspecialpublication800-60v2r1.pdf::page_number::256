should consider the Military Operations information type as delivery mechanisms of the mission-
based services information types [e.g., Catastrophic Defense, Emergency Response, Key Asset
and Critical Infrastructure Protection] described heretofore.

D.26.2 Civilian Operations Information Type

Civilian Operations describes the direct provision of a non-military service for the citizen by
government employees.

The BRM provided in the FEA Consolidated Reference Model Document, Version 2.3, October
2007 specifies Civilian Operations as a Mode of Delivery business area or a vehicle by which the
federal government delivers it services to citizens. Therefore, agency personnel should consider
the Civilian Operations information type as delivery mechanisms of the mission-based services
information types [e.g., Health Care, Emergency Response, and Environmental Remediation]
described heretofore.
