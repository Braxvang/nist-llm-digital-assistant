As shown in Table 2-2, there are no standards that protect against DoS attacks. While the OASIS WS-
Reliability standard and the work produced by the OASIS WS-RX technical committee address message
reliability, ensuring the availability of Web services remains a hard problem. Many of the availability
techniques used by high volume Web applications, such as load balancing, clustering and replication, can
be used to aid in preserving availability.

Web services also face threats associated with all software: defects in a Web service implementation may
lead to exploitable vulnerabilities. Web services, like Web applications, are remotely accessible, so
attackers can take advantage of the Web service’s availability to probe it for potential exploits. As with
any remotely accessible service, it is important that Web services be implemented securely and that
traditional network security tools and techniques be used to limit access to the Web service to only those
networks and systems that should have legitimate access. Some aspects of secure Web service
development are discussed in Section 6.

2.7   Common Risks Facing Web Services

As a software-based service that is network-enabled, Web services are at risk for many of the same
security exploits that target any other software. An extensive listing and descriptions of common attacks
targeting Web services appear in Appendix A.

Traditional security technologies are by and large inadequate to secure Web services. Perimeter-based
network security technologies (e.g., firewalls, IDS) are inadequate because Web services are transmitted
using HTTP, which is usually given free reign by firewalls, and SOAP may not be supported by an
organization’s IDS. While certain types of firewalls support filtering HTTP content, and some can
