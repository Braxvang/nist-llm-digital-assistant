SP 800-89                                                                 November 2006



               (see Section 6.3.1.1).
            d. The owner shall sign the assurance message using the private key for
               which assurance is to be obtained, thus generating an assurance signature.
            e. The owner shall provide the assurance message, the assurance signature
               and any other necessary data to the TTP.
            f. The TTP shall verify the assurance signature using the public key that
               corresponds to the owner’s private key.
            g. If verification is successful:
               •   The owner shall be notified of the successful verification.
               •   The owner and/or the TTP shall determine a value for t2 that is trusted
                   by the owner (see Sections 6.2 and 6.3.1.2).
               •   Provided that t1 ≤ t2 ≤ t1+d, either the owner or the TTP shall assign
                   the assurance_time and the initial assurance level (see Sections 6.3.1.2
                   and 6.3.1.3).
                   The party who assigns the assurance_time must know the value of d,
                   as well as the values of t1 and t2; the party who assigns the initial
                   assurance level must also be aware of the method(s) used to determine
                   t1 and t2.
               •   The owner shall record the assurance_time and the initial level of
                   assurance.

   3. Owner self-assurance via the regeneration of key(s).
      The owner shall:
            a. Determine the appropriate value of d. For example, d may be selected in
               accordance with the assurance of possession model described in Section
               6.2, along with appropriate values of a, b and c.
            b. Determine a trusted value for t1 (see Sections 6.2 and 6.3.2.1).
            c. Perform one of the following:
               •   Regenerate the entire key pair corresponding to the private key in
                   question, or
               •   Regenerate one key of the key pair corresponding to the private key in
                   question from the currently-held value of the other key of that pair.
            d. Compare the value(s) of the regenerated key(s) with those currently held.
            e. If the regenerated and currently-held keys match:
               •   Determine a trusted value for t2 (see Sections 6.2 and 6.3.2.1).
               •   Provided that t1 ≤ t2 ≤ t1+d, assign and record the assurance_time and
                   the initial assurance level (see Sections 6.3.2.1 and 6.3.2.2).
