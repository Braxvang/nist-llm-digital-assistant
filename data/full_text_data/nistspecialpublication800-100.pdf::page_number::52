                          Figure 5-6. Joint Prioritization with Costs

   Drawn from the perspective of the enterprise, Figure 5-6 plots agency-
determined security controls importance along the vertical axis and corrective action
impact along the horizontal axis. The numbers (1-17) represent the seventeen NIST
SP 800-53 security control areas used for this example. Security control area 12
ranked “high” in importance but had a “basic” corrective action impact.
    The dollar figures in Figure 5-6 represent the total cost to implement all
corrective actions within that cell. For example, looking at cell HG, it would cost the
agency $85,961 to implement corrective actions for systems “N” and “F” and topic
area “4.” After plotting all of its systems, the agency should perform executive
validation of the placement of the various systems to ensure that stakeholders’
priorities are met.
    Agency information security stakeholders should review the prioritization results
to ensure that the prioritization is appropriate and given the opportunity to
reprioritize their inputs if the results of the process are found to be unsatisfactory.
Assuming the agency stakeholders agree that all prioritized corrective actions are
appropriate, as displayed in Figure 5-6, the analysis can proceed accordingly. As
indicated by the axes, the implementation of corrective actions should begin with cell
HG and proceed diagonally down to cell LB to ensure that the agency implements the
most cost-effective, high-impact corrective actions.
    To continue with the example, assume the notional agency has a $2,000,000
budget to implement information security corrective actions. As Figure 5-6
demonstrates, adding the three highest priority cells together (HG, HA, and MG)
brings a total of $891,775, which is nearly half of the corrective action budget. The
agency would then move to the next tier of prioritization, or cells HB, MA, and LG.
Totaling these cells yields a total of $503,350, which combined with the previous
