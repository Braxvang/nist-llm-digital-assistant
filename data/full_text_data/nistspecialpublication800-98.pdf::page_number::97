                                                                                     SECTION 6: RFID PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS



dissemination of personal information about US citizens or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent
residence. The Privacy Act applies only to records about individuals maintained by agencies in the
executive branch of the government. It also only covers information filed within a system of records,
which is a group of files that:

 Contain an individual's name, Social Security Number (SSN), or some other unique personal
  identifier (such as employee number) AND at least one other element of personal information about
  the individual (such as date of birth); and
 Are retrieved by an individual's name, SSN, or personal identifier.
6.4.2     E-Government Act of 2002

Title II, Section 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002 (“Section 208”) prescribes the establishment of a
privacy framework for agencies to manage compliance with privacy mandates passed since 1974. The
Act contains several provisions likely to apply to RFID systems, including requirements to:

 Perform a privacy impact assessment (PIA), 73
 Ensure employees, business partners and contractors are informed and educated of their responsibility
  to protect PII (if the RFID system manages or generates PII),
 Evaluate IT system and business model privacy risks for program activities and their information
  systems, and
 If the RFID system contains an inter-enterprise subsystem that enables external parties to access
  RFID information through a Web site, then the RFID system manager may also be required to:

          –    Ensure Web site privacy policies and notices adhere to Federal requirements,

          –    Comply with Web site tracking technology requirements, and

          –    Develop and implement a machine-readable privacy policy plan.
The Act also requires that agencies designate a point of contact for privacy compliance and related
matters. This official should be consulted throughout the life cycle of the RFID system.

     The PIA requirement applies to systems involving data collection from 10 or more members of the general public when one
     or more of the following "PIA triggers" occurs: (1) conversions - when converting paper-based records to electronic
     systems; (2) anonymous to non-anonymous - when functions applied to an existing information collection change
     anonymous information into information in identifiable form; (3) significant system management changes - when new uses
     of an existing IT system, including application of new technologies, significantly change how information in identifiable
     form is managed in the system: (4) significant merging - when agencies adopt or alter business processes so that government
     databases holding information in identifiable form are merged, centralized, matched with other databases or otherwise
     significantly manipulated: (5) new public access - when user-authenticating technology (e.g., password, digital certificate,
     biometric) is newly applied to an electronic information system accessed by members of the public; (6) commercial sources
     - when agencies systematically incorporate into existing information systems databases of information in identifiable form
     purchased or obtained from commercial or public sources. (Merely querying such a source on an ad hoc basis does not
     trigger the PIA requirement); (7) new interagency uses - when agencies work together on shared functions involving
     significant new uses or exchanges of information in identifiable form, such as the cross-cutting E-Government initiatives; in
     such cases, the lead agency should prepare the PIA; (8) internal flow or collection - when alteration of a business process
     results in new uses or disclosures of information or incorporation into the system of additional items of information in
     identifiable form; and (9) alteration in character of data - when new information in identifiable form is added to a collection
     raises the risks to personal privacy (for example, the addition of health or financial information).
