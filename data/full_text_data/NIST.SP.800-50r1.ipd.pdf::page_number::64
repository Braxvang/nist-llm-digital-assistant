1956   5.3.3. Review of the CPLP Assessment Report With Senior Leadership
1957   As a final step, the Learning Program Manager will meet with the Senior Leadership Committee
1958   to review the performance of the program, address new organizational risks or concerns to
1959   include in the training program content, and identify any areas for significant improvement. This
1960   phase helps to ensure that the cyclical approach depicted in Fig. 1 is an ongoing and continual
1961   effort.

1962          Continuous Monitoring and Improvement
1963   NIST SP 800-53, section 1.3, includes the organizational responsibility of “[c]ontinuous
1964   monitoring of information systems and organizations to determine the ongoing effectiveness of
1965   controls, changes in information systems and environments of operation, and the state of security
1966   and privacy organization-wide.” In this context, the continuous monitoring and improvement
1967   refers to the iterative nature of reviewing, updating, and maintaining the program in alignment
1968   with requirements and best practices. Based on the CPLP Assessment Report and any new
1969   requirements (e.g., legislative, organizational, system changes, risk-related, etc.), the Learning
1970   Program Manager will be able to identify opportunities for improvement. As part of the iterative
1971   nature of a CPLP, the assessment and continual improvement process can happen during any
1972   phase of the CPLP. Continual improvement is simply the concept of periodically revisiting each
1973   step of planning, design, development, and implementation to ensure that the CPLP meets the
1974   identified goals and requirements in the strategic plan. The continual improvement process does
1975   not imply inherent shortfalls in the program. Rather, it acknowledges the constantly shifting
1976   needs of an organization to manage resources and risks.
1977   Ultimately, the goal of the CPLP is to enable the organization to withstand cybersecurity and
1978   privacy-related risks to information and assets. The personnel of the organization are a crucial
1979   part of creating the positive cultural norms that will both support the aims of the CPLP and
1980   contribute to greater success in changing behaviors. Avoid efforts to penalize those who do not
1981   adapt to the culture as well as others. Rather, shine a light on teams and departments that
1982   improve performance or establish best practices. Find ways to celebrate personnel who are
1983   building the organization’s CPLP culture, and share information about the CPLP’s performance
1984   when appropriate. If feedback indicates that a change is required to the training because
1985   something is not working, ensure that the program is nimble enough for that adjustment to be
1986   implemented. Do not wait for the end of the year or another arbitrary time period.
1987   The goals of continual improvement do not need to be built on the ashes of past failures but
1988   should be seen as an opportunity to grow and strengthen a critical program. A positive
1989   cybersecurity and privacy culture celebrates successes while acknowledging the ever-present
1990   risks to the organization.
