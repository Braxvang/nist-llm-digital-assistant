                                                       nature could greatly undermine the efficacy of RSN

              Configure a maximum GMK                  The GMK is used to protect multicast traffic. Setting a
      42      lifetime on the AP, preferably not       maximum GMK lifetime reduces the exposure of data if the                     AP

                                                       In the IEEE 802.11i RSN framework, the PMK is used to

                                                       If both the STA and AS allow EAP methods other than those

                                                       If a STA connects to an unauthorized AS, that AS will be

          Some organizations may operate mission-critical applications that require real-time responsiveness, and therefore cannot tolerate even small delays associated with rekeying
          or reauthentication transactions. In this relatively rare situation, organizations may wish not to set a PMK lifetime, effectively making it infinite, and make PMK changes
          during scheduled maintenance downtime.
