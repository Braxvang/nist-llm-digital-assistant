NIST SP 800-58                                              Voice Over IP Security

5. Evaluate costs for additional power backup systems that may be
required to ensure continued operation during power outages.

      A careful assessment must be conducted to ensure that sufficient backup power is
      available for the office VOIP switch, as well as each desktop instrument. Costs
      may include electrical power to maintain UPS battery charge, periodic
      maintenance costs for backup power generation systems, and cost of UPS battery
      replacement. If emergency/backup power is required for more than a few hours,
      electrical generators will be required. Costs for these include fuel, fuel storage
      facilities, and cost of fuel disposal at end of storage life.


6. VOIP-ready firewalls and other appropriate protection mechanisms
should be employed. Agencies must enable, use, and routinely test the
security features that are included in VOIP systems.

      Because of the inherent vulnerabilities (e.g. susceptibility to packet sniffing) when
      operating telephony across a packet network, VOIP systems incorporate an array
      of security features and protocols. Organization security policy should ensure that
      these features are used. Additional measures, described in this document, should
      be added. In particular, firewalls designed for VOIP protocols are an essential
      component of a secure VOIP system.

7. If practical, “softphone” systems, which implement VOIP using an
ordinary PC with a headset and special software, should not be used where
security or privacy are a concern.

      Worms, viruses, and other malicious software are extraordinarily common on PCs
      connected to the internet, and very difficult to defend against. Well-known
      vulnerabilities in web browsers make it possible for attackers to download
      malicious software without a user’s knowledge, even if the user does nothing
      more than visit a compromised web site. Malicious software attached to email
      messages can also be installed without the user’s knowledge, in some cases even
      if the user does not open the attachment. These vulnerabilities result in
      unacceptably high risks in the use of “softphones”, for most applications. In
      addition, because PCs are necessarily on the data network, using a softphone
      system conflicts with the need to separate voice and data networks to the greatest
      extent practical.

8. If mobile units are to be integrated with the VOIP system, use products
implementing WiFi Protected Access (WPA), rather than 802.11 Wired
Equivalent Privacy (WEP).

      The security features of 802.11 WEP provide little or no protection because WEP
      can be cracked with publicly available software. The more recent WiFi Protected
      Access (WPA), a snapshot of the ongoing 802.11i standard, offers significant
      improvements in security, and can aid the integration of wireless technology with
