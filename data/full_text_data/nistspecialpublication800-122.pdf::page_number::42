                       GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



own templates that provide the basis for conducting a PIA. The E-Government Act of 2002 requires
Federal agencies to conduct PIAs when:

 Developing or procuring information technology that collects, maintains, or disseminates
  information that is in an identifiable form; or
 Initiating a new collection of information that—

    –   Will be collected, maintained, or disseminated using information technology; and

    –   Includes any information in an identifiable form permitting the physical or online contacting
        of a specific individual, if identical questions have been posed to, or identical reporting
        requirements imposed on, 10 or more persons, other than agencies, instrumentalities, or
        employees of the Federal Government.
The E-Government Act authorized OMB to provide Federal agencies with guidance on conducting
PIAs, which resulted in OMB Memorandum 03-22. The Memorandum provided examples of system
changes that create new privacy risks and trigger the requirement for a new PIA:
 Conversions—when paper-based records are to be converted to electronic systems
 De-Identified to Identifiable—when functions applied to an existing information collection
  change de-identified information into information in identifiable form
 Significant System Management Changes—when new uses of an existing information system,
  including application of new technologies, significantly change how information in identifiable
  form is managed in the system
 Significant Merging—when agencies adopt or alter business processes so that government
  databases holding information in identifiable form are merged, centralized, matched with other
  databases, or otherwise significantly manipulated
 New Public Access—when user-authenticating technology (e.g., password, digital certificate,
  biometric) is newly applied to an information system accessed by members of the public
 Commercial Sources—when agencies systematically incorporate into existing information
  systems databases of information in identifiable form purchased or obtained from commercial or
  public sources
 New Interagency Uses—when agencies work together on shared functions involving significant
  new uses or exchanges of information in identifiable form, such as the cross-cutting E-
  Government initiatives
 Internal Flow or Collection—when alteration of a business process results in significant new
  uses or disclosures of information or incorporation into the system of additional items of
  information in identifiable form
 Alteration in Character of Data—when new information in identifiable form added to a
  collection raises the risks to personal privacy (for example, the addition of health or financial
  information)
