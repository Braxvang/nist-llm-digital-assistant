such as OS patches and antivirus updates. When the host attempts to connect to the network, a network
device such as a router requests information from the host’s agent. If the host does not respond to the
request or the response indicates that the host is insecure, the network device causes the host to be placed
onto a separate VLAN. The same technique can be used with hosts that are already on the organization’s
regular networks, allowing infected hosts to be moved automatically to a separate VLAN.

Having a separate VLAN for infected hosts also helps organizations to provide antivirus signature updates
and OS and application patches to the hosts while severely restricting what they can do. Without a
separate VLAN, the organization might need to remove infected hosts’ network access entirely, which
necessitates transferring and applying updates manually to each host to contain and eradicate the malware
and mitigate vulnerabilities. A variant of the separate VLAN strategy that can be effective in some
situations is to place all hosts on a particular network segment in a VLAN and then move hosts to the
production network as each is deemed to be clean and remediated.

4.3.5    Containment Recommendations

Containment can be performed through many methods in the four categories described above (users,
automated detection, loss of services, and loss of connectivity). Because no single malware containment
category or individual method is appropriate or effective in every situation, incident handlers should
select a combination of containment methods that is likely to be effective in containing the current
incident while limiting damage to hosts and reducing the impact that containment methods might have on
other hosts. For example, shutting down all network access might be very effective at stopping the spread
of malware, but it would also allow infections on hosts to continue damaging files and would disrupt
many important functions of the organization.

The most drastic containment methods can be tolerated by most organizations for only a brief period of
time. Accordingly, organizations should support sound containment decisions by having policies that
clearly state who has authority to make major containment decisions and under what circumstances
various actions (e.g., disconnecting subnets from the Internet) are appropriate.

4.4     Eradication

Although the primary goal of eradication is to remove malware from infected hosts, eradication is
typically more involved than that. If an infection was successful because of a host vulnerability or other
security weakness, such as an unsecured file share, then eradication includes the elimination or mitigation
of that weakness, which should prevent the host from becoming reinfected or becoming infected by
another instance of malware or a variant of the original threat. Eradication actions are often consolidated
with containment efforts. For example, organizations might run a utility that identifies infected hosts,
applies patches to remove vulnerabilities, and runs antivirus software that removes infections.
Containment actions often limit eradication choices; for example, if an incident is contained by
disconnecting infected hosts from the primary network, the hosts should either be connected to a separate
VLAN so that they can be updated remotely, or patched and reconfigured manually. Because the hosts are
disconnected from the primary network, the incident handlers will be under pressure to perform
eradication actions on the hosts as quickly as possible so that the users can regain full use of their hosts.

Different situations necessitate various combinations of eradication techniques. In cases where
disinfection is possible, the most common tools for eradication are antivirus software, vulnerability
management technologies, network access control software, and other tools designed to remove malware
and correct vulnerabilities. Automated eradication methods, such as triggering antivirus scans remotely,
are much more efficient than manual methods, such as visiting infected hosts in person and running
disinfection software from a CD. As described in Section 4.3.1, some situations necessitate user
