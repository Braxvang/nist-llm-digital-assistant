with respect to meeting the security requirements for information systems and their environments
of operation.56 Developers and implementers can increase the assurance in security functionality
by employing well-defined security policies and policy models, structured and rigorous hardware
and software development techniques, and sound system/security engineering principles.

Assurance for information technology products and systems is commonly based on the
assessments conducted (and associated assessment evidence produced) during the initiation,
acquisition/development, implementation, and operations/maintenance phases of the system
development life cycle. For example, developmental evidence may include the techniques and
methods used to design and develop security functionality. Operational evidence may include
flaw reporting and remediation, the results of security incident reporting, and the results of
ongoing security control monitoring. Independent assessments by qualified assessors may include
analyses of the evidence as well as testing, inspections, and audits of the implementation of the
selected security functionality.57

The concepts of assurance and trustworthiness are closely related. Assurance contributes to the
trustworthiness determination relative to an information technology product or an information
system. Developers/implementers of information technology products or systems may provide
assurance evidence by generating appropriate artifacts (e.g., the results of independent testing and
evaluation, design documentation, high-level or low-level specifications, source code analysis).
Organizations using information technology products or systems may perform, or rely on others
to perform, some form of assessment on the products or systems. Organizations may also have
direct experience with the product or system, or may receive information about the performance
of the product or system from third parties. Organizations typically evaluate all of the available
assurance evidence, often applying different weighting factors as appropriate, to determine the
trustworthiness of the product or system relative to the circumstances.

Information technology products and systems exhibiting a higher degree of trustworthiness (i.e.,
products/systems having appropriate functionality and assurance) are expected to exhibit a lower
rate of latent design and implementation flaws and a higher degree of penetration resistance
against a range of threats including sophisticated cyber attacks, natural disasters, accidents, and
intentional/unintentional errors. The susceptibility of missions/business functions of organizations
to known threats, the environments of operation where information systems are deployed, and the
maximum acceptable level of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
organizations, or the Nation, guide the degree of trustworthiness needed.


     Trustworthiness is a key factor in the selection and wise use of information technology products
     used in organizational information systems. Insufficient attention to trustworthiness of information
     technology products and systems can adversely affect an organizationâ€™s capability to successfully
     carry out its assigned missions/business functions.

  For other than national security systems, organizations meet minimum assurance requirements specified in NIST
Special Publication 800-53, Appendix E.
