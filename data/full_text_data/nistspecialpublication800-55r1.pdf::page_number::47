      •   Inefficient processes—Inefficient planning and implementation processes that influence
          measures, including the communication processes necessary to direct organizational
          actions.

6.3       Identify Corrective Actions

Phase 3 of the information security measurement program implementation process, Identify
Corrective Actions, involves development of a plan to serve as the roadmap for closing the
implementation gap identified in Phase 2. It includes the following activities:

      •   Determine range of corrective actions—Based on results and causation factors, identify
          potential corrective actions for each performance issue. These may include changing
          information system configurations; training information security staff, information
          system administrator staff, or regular users; purchasing information security tools;
          changing information system architecture; establishing new processes and procedures;
          and updating information security policies.

      •   Prioritize corrective actions based on overall risk mitigation goals—Several corrective
          actions may apply to a single performance issue; however, some may be inappropriate if
          they are too costly or are inconsistent with the magnitude of the problem. Applicable
          corrective actions should be prioritized for each performance issue in ascending order of
          cost and descending order of impact. The risk management process described in NIST
          SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems, or the
          corrective action prioritization process described in NIST SP 800-65, Integrating IT
          Security into the Capital Planning and Investment Control Process, should be used to
          prioritize corrective actions. If weights were assigned to measures in the Prepare for
          Data Collection phase, they should be used to prioritize corrective actions. Alternatively,
          priorities may be assigned in the Identify Corrective Actions phase based on the criticality
          of implementing specific corrective actions, cost of the actions, and the magnitude of
          their impact on the organization’s information security posture. Corrective actions
          should be documented in the POA&M for the corresponding information system or
          organization and tracked as a part of the continuous monitoring process.

      •   Select most appropriate corrective actions—Viable corrective actions from the top of the
          prioritized list should be selected for use in a full cost-benefit analysis.

6.4       Develop Business Case and Obtain Resources

Phase 4 of the information security measurement program implementation process, Develop
Business Case, and Phase 5, Obtain Resources, address the budgeting cycle for acquiring
resources needed to implement remediation actions identified in Phase 3. The steps involved in
developing a business case are based on industry practices and mandatory guidelines, including
OMB Circular A-11, the Clinger-Cohen Act, and GPRA. Results of the prior three phases will
be included in the business case as supporting evidence.
