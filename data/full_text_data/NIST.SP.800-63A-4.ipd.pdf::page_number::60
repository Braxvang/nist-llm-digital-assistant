       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                             Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                               Enrollment and Identity Proofing


1573       • Information on the allowed and required identity evidence and attributes, whether
1574         each piece is voluntary or mandatory, and the consequences for not providing the
1575         complete set of identity evidence. Users need to know the specific combinations of
1576         identity evidence, including requirements specific to a piece of identity evidence
1577         (e.g., a raised seal on a birth certificate). This is especially important due to
1578         potential difficulties procuring the necessary identity evidence.
1579            – Where possible, implement tools to make it easier to obtain the necessary
1580              identity evidence.
1581            – Inform users of any special requirements for minors and people with unique
1582              needs. For example, provide users with the information on whether applicant
1583              reference and/or trusted referee processes are available and information
1584              necessary to use those processes (see Sec. 5.1.9).
1585            – If forms are required:
1586                * Provide fillable forms before and at the enrollment session. Do not
1587                  require users to have access to a printer.
1588                * Minimize the amount of information users must enter on a form, as users
1589                  are easily frustrated and more error-prone with longer forms. Where
1590                  possible, pre-populate forms.

1591   9.3. Enrollment and Prooﬁng Session
1592   Usability considerations specific to the enrollment session include:
1593       • At the start of the identity proofing session, remind users of the procedure. Do
1594         not expect them to remember the procedures described during the pre-enrollment
1595         preparation step. If the enrollment session does not immediately follow pre-
1596         enrollment preparation, it is especially important to clearly remind users of the
1597         typical timeframe to complete the proofing and enrollment phase.
1598       • Provide rescheduling options for in-person or in-person over remote channels.
1599       • Provide a checklist with the allowed and required identity evidence to ensure
1600         users have the requisite identity evidence to proceed with the enrollment session,
1601         including enrollment codes, if applicable. If users do not have the complete set of
1602         identity evidence, they must be informed regarding whether they can complete a
1603         partial identity proofing session.
1604       • Notify users regarding what information will be destroyed, what, if any, information
1605         will be retained for future follow-up sessions, and what identity evidence they will
1606         need to bring to complete a future session. Ideally, users can choose whether they
1607         would like to complete a partial identity proofing session.
