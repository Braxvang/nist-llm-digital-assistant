               The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



3.    SCAP Content Requirements and Recommendations

This section defines the content syntax, structure, and development requirements that products and
content authors and editors MUST follow to produce valid SCAP 1.1 content. This section also provides
recommendations that are not mandatory; organizations are encouraged to adopt them to promote stronger
interoperability and greater consistency. The first part of the section discusses SCAP source data stream
requirements. The rest of the section groups requirements and recommendations by specification:
XCCDF, OVAL, OCIL, CPE, CCE, CVE, and CVSS, in that order.

3.1   SCAP Source Data Streams

An SCAP data stream is a collection of XML instance documents, also called stream components. The
required XML content composing an SCAP data stream depends on the use case and is designed to satisfy
specific policy or situational awareness objectives. There are two types of SCAP data streams: source and
result. Section 4.6 discusses SCAP result data streams, which contain the results that are generated during
processing.

An SCAP source data stream is the expression of content for a specific use case using one or more stream
components. For its filenames, every SCAP source data stream SHALL use a common locator prefix that
is appended to the URL base of the deployed data source. Every SCAP source data stream component
SHALL have a filename comprised of the locator prefix (including a trailing hyphen) followed by the
appropriate component suffix, as listed in Table 2.

                                Table 2. SCAP Source Data Stream Conventions

                  Component           Component Suffix               Document Element
               XCCDF Benchmark      xccdf.xml                <xccdf:Benchmark>
               OVAL Compliance      oval.xml                 <oval-def:oval_definitions>
               OVAL Patch           patches.xml              <oval-def:oval_definitions>
               OVAL Vulnerability   oval.xml                 <oval-def:oval_definitions>
               OCIL Questionnaire   ocil.xml                 <ocil:ocil>
               CPE Dictionary       cpe-dictionary.xml       <cpe-dict:cpe-list>
               CPE Inventory        cpe-oval.xml             <oval-def:oval_definitions>


For example:

        file:///c:/content/example-winxp-xccdf.xml

        The URL base is: file:///c:/content/
        The locator prefix is: example-winxp-
        The stream component is: xccdf.xml

Table 2 also lists document elements. Each SCAP source data stream component SHALL use the
specified element as its document element.

Each SCAP source data stream component SHALL validate against the corresponding schema and, if
applicable, associated Schematron stylesheet. Each SCAP source data stream component SHOULD NOT
use any constructs that are deprecated in its associated specification. Validation of each component
SHALL be done in accordance with the portions of this document that define requirements for the
