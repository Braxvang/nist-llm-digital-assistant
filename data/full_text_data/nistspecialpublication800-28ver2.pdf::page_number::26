                                                                            GUIDELINES ON ACTIVE CONTENT AND MOBILE CODE

or referral links to malicious sites) and the confidentiality of any information submitted (e.g., sensitive
personal data) would be at risk.

3.3.3     Network-Oriented Attacks

Attacks can be launched against the network infrastructure used to communicate between the browser and
server. An attacker can gain information by masquerading as a Web server using a man-in-the-middle
attack, whereby requests and responses are conveyed via the imposter as a watchful intermediary. Such a
Web spoofing attack allows the impostor to shadow not only a single targeted server, but also every
subsequent server accessed [Fel97]. Other attack methods lie outside the browser-server framework and
involve targeting the communications or the supporting platforms. For example, at a level of protocol
below HTTP, an entity may eavesdrop on messages in transit between a browser and server to glean
information. Many diagnostic tools, such as packet sniffers, can reconstruct HTTP traffic from captured
IP packets. An attacking entity may also intercept messages in transit and modify their contents,
substitute other contents, or simply replay the transmission dialogue later in an attempt to disrupt the
synchronization or integrity of the information. For example, an attacker may modify the DNS
mechanisms used by a computer to direct it to a false Web site. These techniques are often used to
perform pharming attacks, where users may divulge sensitive information. Denial of service attacks
through available network interfaces are another possibility, as well as exploits involving any existing
platform vulnerability.

3.3.4     User-Oriented Attacks

Increasingly, attackers use social engineering combined with other techniques to target Web users. Often,
these attacks occur in the form of phishing attacks, where attackers try to trick users into accessing a fake
Web site and divulging personal information. In some phishing attacks, users receive a legitimate-
looking email asking them to update their information on the company’s Web site. Instead of legitimate
links, however, the URLs in the email actually point to a rogue Web site. 5 Other phishing attacks are
more advanced and take advantage of vulnerabilities in the legitimate Web site’s application. For
example, a security flaw in the PayPal web site was exploited to steal credit card numbers and other
personal information belonging to its users. Visiting users were presented with a message that had been
injected into the site that said, "Your account is currently disabled because we think it has been accessed
by a third party. You will now be redirected to Resolution Center.” and then redirected to the attacker’s
Web site [Net06].

3.4     Threat Summary

This section discussed the threats facing organizations and individuals due to increasing reliance on
mobile code in Web applications. Many of these threats are a result of security issues that were not
addressed when Internet protocols were developed. Although these omissions contribute to the threats
facing Web users, they are exacerbated by the scale of the Internet, the complexity of software, and the
prevalence of mobile code. Many Web interactions rely on mobile code, either running on a Web server
or Web browser. As such, Web interactions are susceptible to threats facing mobile code as well. These
factors cause organizations to face four classes of attacks: browser-oriented, server-oriented, network-
oriented, and user-oriented. Section 5 provides information about mitigating the threats posed by each
class of attack.
