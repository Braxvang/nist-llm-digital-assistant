         launch successful targeted electronic mail attacks against consumers of the cloud service
         [Kre07, Mcm07]. The incident illustrates the need for cloud providers to protect and
         report promptly security breaches occurring not only in the data the cloud provider holds
         for its consumers, but also in the data it holds about its consumers, regardless of whether
         the data is held within or separately from the cloud infrastructure.

         Other types of ancillary data that exists involve information the cloud provider collects or
         produces about customer-related activity in the cloud. They include data collected to
         meter and charge for consumption of resources, logs and audit trails, and other such
         metadata that is generated and accumulated within the cloud environment. Unlike
         organizational data, a cloud provider may be more inclined to claim ownership over the
         operational and other types of metadata it collects. Such data, if sold, released, or leaked
         to a third party, however, is a potential threat to an organization’s privacy, since the data
         could be used to infer the status and outlook of an organization’s initiative (e.g., the
         activity level or projected growth of a startup company). Several points to consider
         clarifying in a service contract are the types of metadata collected by the cloud provider,
         the protection afforded the metadata, and the organization’s rights over metadata,
         including ownership, opting out of collection or distribution, and fair use.

        Risk Management. With cloud-based services, some subsystems or subsystem
         components fall outside of the direct control of a client organization. Many organizations
         are more comfortable with risk when they have greater control over the processes and
         equipment involved. At a minimum, a high degree of control provides the option to
         weigh alternatives, set priorities, and act decisively in the best interest of the organization
         when faced with an incident. Risk management is the process of identifying and
         assessing risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals resulting
         from the operation of an information system, and taking the necessary steps to reduce it
         to an acceptable level [Sto02]. The process includes the conduct of a risk assessment, the
         implementation of a risk mitigation strategy, and the employment of techniques and
         procedures for the continuous monitoring of the security state of the information
         system.12 Public cloud-based systems, as with traditional information systems, require
         that risks are managed throughout the system lifecycle.

         Assessing and managing risk in systems that use cloud services can be a challenge.
         FISMA and OMB policy require external providers handling federal information or
         operating information systems on behalf of the federal government to meet the same
         security requirements as federal agencies [JTF10]. To the maximum extent practicable,
         organizations should ensure that privacy and security controls are implemented correctly,
         operate as intended, and meet its requirements. Organizations should understand the
         privacy and security controls of the cloud service, establish adequate arrangements in the
