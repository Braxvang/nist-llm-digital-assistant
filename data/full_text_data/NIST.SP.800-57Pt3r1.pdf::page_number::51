7 Over-The-Air Rekeying (OTAR) Key Management Messages
  (KMMs)
7.1 Description
A key management protocol has been specified for over-the-air rekeying of digital radios
(OTAR) [OTAR]. This protocol has been designed to handle several types of
cryptographic security, one of which, Type 3, has been designed for unclassified,
sensitive communications and is discussed herein. The only differences between the
security types are the cryptographic algorithms used and the security requirements. The
Type 3 algorithms and security requirements are addressed in both OTAR and OTAR1
[OTAR1]32.

For key management, a secure mobile system consists of Key Management Facilities
(KMFs) and mobile radios that are subordinate to each KMF. Key Management
Messages (KMMs) are exchanged between each KMF and its subordinate mobile radios
(see Figure 7-1). Cryptographic keys are transferred from a KMF to a mobile radio and
protected using a key-wrapping algorithm and key wrapping key; many of the KMMs are
protected by encrypting the data in the messages; the integrity of the messages is
protected using a Message Authentication Code (MAC).

  Reference [OTAR] provides an overview of the key management techniques and the protocol. Reference
[OTAR1] specifies the general security requirements for transmitting Type 3 key management messages
(KMMs), the requirements for wrapping the keys, the techniques used for KMM integrity and the
mechanism used to protect against replay of the KMMs.
