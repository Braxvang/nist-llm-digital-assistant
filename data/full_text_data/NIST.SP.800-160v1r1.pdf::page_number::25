•    Interoperating systems interact with the system of interest for the purpose of jointly
     performing a function.

Figure 3 illustrates the relationship between the system of interest and its interfacing systems in
both operational and non-operational (external) environments.

           Systems Engineering Foundations
Systems engineering is a transdisciplinary 12 and integrative approach to enabling the successful
realization, use, and retirement of engineered systems. It employs systems principles and
concepts, as well as scientific, technological, and management methods to achieve such systems
[12]. Systems engineering is system-holistic in nature, whereby the contributions across multiple
engineering and specialty disciplines are evaluated and balanced to produce a coherent system
capability. Systems engineering applies systems science and systems thinking 13 to satisfy the
often-conflicting needs and priorities of stakeholders within the constraints of cost, schedule,

   As noted in [11], transdisciplinary approaches reach “beyond disciplines to find and exploit connections to solve complex problems.
Transdisciplinary thinking encourages thinking in terms of new relationships among traditionally distinct disciplines and focusing on new
concepts that might arise from such thinking.”

   Systems science is an interdisciplinary field that studies complex systems in nature, society, and science. It aims to develop interdisciplinary
foundations that are applicable in a variety of areas, such as social sciences, engineering, biology, and medicine. Systems thinking is a discipline
of examining wholes, interrelationships, and patterns [13].
