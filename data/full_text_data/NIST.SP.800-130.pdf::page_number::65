             Figure 11: Sample Key Management Function Control Logic

FR: 6.88 The CKMS design shall specify the topology of the CKMS by indicating the
locations of the entities, the ACS, the function logic, and the connections between them.

FR: 6.89 The CKMS design shall specify the constraints on the key management
functions that are implemented to assure proper operation.

FR: 6.90 The CKMS design shall specify how access to the key management functions
is restricted to authorized entities.

FR: 6.91 The CKMS design shall specify the ACS and its policy for controlling access to
key management functions.

FR: 6.92 The CKMS design shall specify at a minimum:
       a) The granularity of the entities (e.g., person, device, organization),
       b) If and how entities are identified,
       c) If and how entities are authenticated,
       d) If and how the entity authorizations are verified, and
       e) The access control on each key management function.

FR: 6.93 The CKMS design shall specify the capabilities of its ACS to accommodate,
implement, and enforce the CKMS Security Policy.
