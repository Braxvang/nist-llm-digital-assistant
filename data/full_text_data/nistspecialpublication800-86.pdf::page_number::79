                                        GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



! Analysts should have reasonably comprehensive technical knowledge. Because current tools
  have rather limited analysis abilities, analysts should be well-trained, experienced, and
  knowledgeable in networking principles, common network and application protocols, network
  and application security products, and network-based threats and attack methods.
! Analysts should consider the fidelity and value of each data source. Analysts should have
  more confidence in original data sources than in data sources that receive normalized data from
  other sources. The analysts should validate any unusual or unexpected data that is based on
  interpretation of data, such as IDS and SEM alerts.
! Analysts should generally focus on the characteristics and impact of the event. Determining
  the identity of an attacker and other similar actions are typically time-intensive and difficult to
  accomplish, and do not aid the organization in correcting operational issues or security
  weaknesses. Establishing the identity and intent of an attacker may be important, especially if a
  criminal investigation will ensue, but should be weighed against other important goals, such as
  stopping an attack and recovering systems and data.
