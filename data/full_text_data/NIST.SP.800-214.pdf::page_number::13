Throughout FY 2020, NIST has made significant progress in advancing methods and guidelines
for managing enterprise risk related to cybersecurity, systems engineering, and privacy. NIST is
leading a multi-year effort to produce a cohesive portfolio of complementary risk management
resources that can be used individually or together to help public and private organizations
better manage cybersecurity and privacy risk at all levels of the enterprise.
Risk management has been a fundamental driver for organizations for as long as there has
been information to protect. Today's proliferation of risk management resources, combined
with advances in technology, increasingly call for a collaborative approach to managing
discipline-specific risks within the enterprise. This includes the need to ensure that managers,
risk professionals, developers, and designers work together to implement secure engineering
practices. These practices will help to ensure more secure systems, including those managed
by external partners, and expanded risk management applications for an evolving range of
products.
Risk Management Framework Updates
The Risk Management Framework (RMF) is one of NIST’s most popular and widely used
products. Initially created for federal agencies, organizations around the globe use the RMF
because it provides a structured and flexible process for managing security and privacy risk.
In FY 2020, NIST published SP 800–53, Revision 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information
Systems and Organizations, which is the first and only comprehensive catalog of information
security and privacy countermeasures that provide a foundation for protecting organizations,
systems, and the personal privacy of individuals. The update represents a multi-year effort that
supports a proactive and systematic approach to ensuring that critical systems, components, and
