Annex B.          Selection of iris camera
This document does not establish certification criteria for iris cameras used in PIV. The motivation for this is that a
formal certification procedure is not yet ready (see below) and, that as an Agency-optional biometric, iris certification
costs are not warranted given the wide availability of high-performing cameras. Instead, Agencies might reasonably
consider evidence of deployed track record, prior test or operational results, standards-compliance, and the guidance
of the following Sub-sections.

B.1 Modes of use
For collection of images suitable for enrollment, retention, and preparation of the
specialized PIV Card images, an iris camera should routinely collect sharp, well
focused, well exposed, 640x480 images in which the iris is looking at the camera
directly (frontal gaze), closely centered, minimally occluded by the eyelid. One such
image appears at right. Such cameras have long been available, and used for
enrollment and access control.
Agencies might plan for, and select, different cameras for authentication
transactions. The reason for this is that specific iris cameras are available in at least five categories: wall mounted,
desktop mounted, handheld (tethered and not), stand-off, and outdoor (binocular). These variously will image just
one or both eyes. Some of these specifically implement tradeoffs of speed-of-capture for image quality so that
authentication can proceed more quickly than enrolment, where capture of a pristine image is needed for use over
future years.

B.2 Imaging capability
Fingerprint sensors are often selected on the basis of [APP/F] or [SINGFING] certification. These are optical imaging
                                                                                                                      29
tests designed to show that a sensor has the ability to collect fingerprint images that are faithful to the source . An
analogous specification for iris camera was circulated for public comment in May 2013. A joint NIST DHS S&T Special
Publication titled Iris Device Qualification Test [IDQT] will result. It will define both optical imaging specifications and
test methods for iris cameras. Its procedures constitute a repeatable, laboratory-based test of a camera's peak
imaging capability. It is conceived of as a necessary precursor to human-in-the-loop trials that may be used to
measure other performance parameters (e.g., accuracy and speed, see Section B.4).
Agencies might adopt this specification to support procurement of equipment for enrolment and authentication. It
might do so by running an actual certification program, or by requiring providers to formally attest that a camera
meets particular criteria.

B.3 Image quality
The ISO/IEC 29794-6 iris image quality standard is approaching completion [IRISQUAL]. That standard is likely to
establish requirements on images and, separately, on iris cameras. Image quality assessment algorithms can serve as
in a quality control role during applicant enrolment.
Agencies could elect to base camera selection decisions on this standard, by measuring whether a camera produces
enough images of sufficiently high quality, according to the standard's metrics. This would involve capture of images
from a representative human (volunteer) population. Additionally, Agencies could require that the standard's
imaging specifications are met. These are a subset of the [IDQT] specifications.

B.4 Recognition performance
Agencies might elect to select cameras on the basis of a performance and usability test. Such tests are conducted to
measure recognition accuracy (error rates), speed, and ease-of-use. Such tests recruit a test population to use
cameras; the tests may be conducted in the laboratory or in an operational "pilot" setting. The use of a human
population means the tests may be expensive to conduct, and will not be exactly repeatable.

     The [APP/F] certification originates in the need to ensure images are suitable from criminal forensic examination.
