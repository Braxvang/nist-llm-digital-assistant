H.14. Disposal
The purpose of the Disposal process is to end the existence of a system element or system for a
specified intended use, appropriately handle replaced or retired elements and any waste products,
and properly attend to identified critical disposal needs (e.g., per an agreement, per
organizational policy, or for environmental, legal, safety, or security aspects).

H.14.1.            Security Purpose
-   Provide the aspects needed to securely end the existence of a system element or system for a
    specified use, and securely preserve or destroy the associated data and information.

H.14.2.            Security Outcomes
-   Secure disposal constraints that influence system requirements, architecture, design, and
    implementation are identified.
-   Enabling systems or services for the security aspects of disposal are available.
-   System elements are destroyed, stored, reclaimed, or recycled in accordance with safety and
    security requirements.
-   The environment is securely returned to its original secure or an agreed-upon secure state.
-   Records of the security aspects of disposal actions and analysis are available.

H.14.3.            Security Activities and Tasks
DS-1     PREPARE FOR DISPOSAL
         DS-1.1 Define the security aspects of the disposal strategy.
         Note: The security aspects address securely terminating system functions and services,
         transforming the system and environment into an acceptable secure state, addressing security
         concerns, and transitioning the system and system elements for future use. The disposal
         strategy determines approaches, schedules, resources, specific considerations of secure
         disposal, and the effectiveness and completeness of secure disposal and disposition actions.
