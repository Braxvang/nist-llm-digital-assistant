3.3         Operations and Functions

Examples of most of the following operations and functions are provided in Sec. 4.2.

BYTELEN(X)             The number of bytes in a byte string, X.

                       The output of the designated cipher function of the block cipher under the key
CIPHK (X)
                       K applied to the block X.

LEN(X)                 The number of numerals [or bits] in a numeral string [or bit string] X.

LOG(x)                 The base 2 logarithm of the real number x > 0.

                       The integer that a bit string X represents when the bits are valued in
NUM(X)
                       decreasing order of significance.

                       The number that the numeral string X represents in base radix when the
NUMradix (X)
                       numerals are valued in decreasing order of significance.

                       The output of the function PRF applied to the block X; PRF is defined in terms
PRF(X)
                       of a given designated cipher function.

                       Given a numeral string, X, the numeral string that consists of the numerals of
REV(X)
                       X in reverse order.

                       Given a byte string, X, the byte string that consists of the bytes of X in reverse
REVB(X)
                       order.

        m              Given a nonnegative integer x less than radixm, the representation of x as a
STR radix (x)
                       string of m numerals in base radix, in decreasing order of significance.

⌊x⌋                    The greatest integer that does not exceed the real number x.

⎡x⎤                  The least integer that is not less than the real number x.

                       Given a nonnegative integer x less than	   256 s, the representation of x as a
[x]s
                       string of s bytes.

[i .. j]               The set of integers between two integers i and j, including i and j.
