      NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                     Cloud Computing Forensic
      February 2023                                                                     Reference Architecture



104   Abstract
105   This document summarizes research performed by the members of the NIST Cloud Computing
106   Forensic Science Working Group and presents the NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Reference
107   Architecture (CC FRA, also referred to as FRA for the sake of brevity), whose goal is to provide
108   support for a cloud system’s forensic readiness. The CC FRA is meant to help users understand
109   which cloud forensic challenges might exist for an organization’s cloud system. It identifies
110   challenges that require at least partial mitigation strategies and how a forensic investigator would
111   apply that to a particular forensic investigation. The CC FRA presented here is both a
112   methodology and an initial implementation. Users are encouraged to customize this initial
113   implementation for their specific situations and needs.

117   Reports on Computer Systems Technology
118   The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
119   Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
120   leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
121   methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
122   the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
123   development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
124   the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
125   federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
126   guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
127   with industry, government, and academic organizations.
