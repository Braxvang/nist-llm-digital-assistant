SP 800-152                                              A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


Key-recovery agent       An FCKMS role that assists in the key-recovery/metadata-
                         recovery process.
Message Authentication   A cryptographic checksum on data that uses a symmetric key
Code (MAC)               to detect both accidental and intentional modifications of data.
Malware                  Software designed and operated by an adversary to violate the
                         security of a computer (includes spyware, virus programs,
                         root kits, and Trojan horses).
Message authentication   A process that provides assurance of the integrity of
                         messages, documents or stored data.
Metadata (explicit)      Parameters used to describe the properties associated with a
                         cryptographic key that are explicitly recorded, managed, and
                         protected by the CKMS.
Metadata (implicit)      Information about a cryptographic key that may be inferred
                         (i.e., by context), but is not explicitly recorded, managed, or
                         protected by the CKMS.
Metadata (bound)         Metadata that has been cryptographically combined with the
                         associated key to produce a MAC or digital signature that can
                         be used to verify that the key and metadata are indeed
                         associated with each other.
Metadata                 Sensitive metadata that has been disclosed to or modified by
(compromised)            an unauthorized entity.
Multi-level security     A security domain that supports information protection at
domain                   more than one impact-level.
NIST-allowed             Specified in a list of allowed security functions (e.g., in an
                         annex to [FIPS 140]).
NIST-approved            FIPS-approved or NIST-Recommended.
Operating system         A collection of software that manages computer hardware
                         resources and provides common services for computer
                         programs.
Operational storage      Storage within an FCKMS where the key can be accessed to
                         perform cryptographic functions during normal operations.
Operator                 An FCKMS role that is authorized to operate an FCKMS
                         (e.g., initiate the FCKMS, monitor performance, and perform
                         backups), as directed by the system administrator.
Parameter                A value that is used to control the operation of a function or
                         that is used by a function to compute one or more outputs.
Party                    See Entity.
