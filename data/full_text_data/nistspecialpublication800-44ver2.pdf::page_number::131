     Completed                                             Action
                 Define a complete Web content access matrix. Identify which folders and files within
                 the Web server document should be restricted and which should be accessible (and
                 by whom)
                 Check the organization’s password policy and set account passwords appropriately
                 (e.g., length, complexity)
                 Use the robots.txt file, if appropriate
                 Configure anti-spambot protection, if appropriate (e.g., CAPTCHAs, nofollow, or
                 keyword filtering)
