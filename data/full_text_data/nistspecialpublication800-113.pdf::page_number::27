Knowing the needs and requirements for the SSL VPN solution, such as the types of users and the reasons
they will use the SSL VPN, will help organizations choose a product with the appropriate level of access
control capability. These needs and requirements will also help organizations determine the level of
granularity needed for access controls.

3.3.7   Endpoint Security Controls

Some SSL VPNs provide endpoint security controls that include host integrity checking and security
protection mechanisms. Host integrity checks help ensure that the client system is in compliance with an
organization’s security policy. These checks are performed before a session is begun and may be
periodically rechecked during the session.

Endpoint security controls are sometimes tightly integrated with access control to analyze the client
system and apply access controls based on the results. For example, an up-to-date company-issued laptop
that is connecting from a remote site might be allowed full access. Another example is a personal laptop
that complies with the standard firewall and antivirus checks but is attempting access from an untrusted
wireless hotspot, and thus is granted only limited access. Endpoint security controls also include security
protection mechanisms, such as Web browser cache cleaners that remove temporary files, cookies, and
other session information from the Web browser used for SSL VPN access. This supports the use of the
SSL VPN from public locations.

Endpoint security controls can be implemented in a variety of ways, and this often differentiates products.
Endpoint security starts with a policy definition. The policy definition includes what the host integrity
checker should look for and the actions to take depending on what it finds. If host integrity checkers are
used, they should be configured to execute before the logon process to look for malware such as
keystroke loggers. Typical host integrity checks may look for operating system type and version,
antivirus and personal firewall status and configurations, or a specific file, registry key, or running
process. Depending on the product, checking for running processes may be as simple as looking for the
process name or as elaborate as verifying the actual validity of the process.

Some SSL VPN products include their own integrated endpoint security software. This software may be
part of the SSL VPN product or an add-on for an additional cost. Other SSL VPN products rely on third-
party software for endpoint security. This allows organizations to leverage their existing products, such
as cache cleaning tools, malware scanners, and compliance checking software, with their SSL VPNs.
Some of these SSL VPNs can only integrate with a single specific third-party product, while others can
integrate with a variety of third-party products.
