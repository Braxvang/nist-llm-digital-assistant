                                                                                             GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



Certificates are signed with keys of a specified length. The security of the authentication is linked to the
length of the key that is protecting the identity in the certificate. If an SSL server uses a key of
insufficient length to protect its identity, the Web client might not want to trust the identity at all. In most
Web browsers, there are mechanisms to check the length of the key that was used by the SSL server after
the browser has successfully made an SSL connection.

3.5   SSL VPN Challenges

SSL VPNs are rapidly maturing technologies. Nevertheless, they still face several challenges:

 Application and client interoperability. This is the biggest challenge for SSL VPNs. SSL VPNs
  must be able to export a large variety of applications to remote connections of various types. There
  are many factors that can affect interoperability, including operating system type and version, browser
  type and version, device type (e.g., laptop, PDA, smart phone), location (e.g., home or public kiosk),
  and the specifics of the applications and protocols to be accessed. For example, some SSL VPN
  products offer support for PDAs, but most offer limited (if any) support for smart phones. Some SSL
  VPN devices support phones via a browser, for web-based access, but few support them from an
  agent perspective, allowing access to client/server applications.
 Client/server application support. SSL VPNs are also still struggling with client/server
  applications. Some VPNs use application translation and network extension, along with special
  clients, to establish the appropriate access. Each SSL VPN product that uses network extension tends
  to have a unique solution to client/server applications. In addition, not all SSL VPN products support
  the same applications; some support more than others and each has niche areas.
 Network extension. Although the network extension function is a core part of SSL tunnel VPNs, it
  still presents several challenges. Network extension requires a client to be installed on the end user’s
  system. Installing this client on a public kiosk or on a PC that has policies against downloading
  programs and plug-ins may not be possible due to insufficient privileges. Because network extension
  gives a remote user complete access to internal systems, specific per-application access controls may
  be difficult to enforce.
 Endpoint security. Endpoint security for unmanaged PCs and public computers also remains a
  challenge. Two issues are trusting the endpoint responses to the host integrity checks and performing
  proper sanitization of sensitive information from the client system when the session is terminated.
  Unmanaged public client systems are less likely to have antivirus and firewall software enabled and
  up-to-date. A compromised public computer could trick the host integrity checks by circumventing
  them or by simulating firewalls, antivirus software, and other required security controls. The systems
  are also more likely to be infected with malware, such as Trojan horses and keystroke loggers, that
  could gain access to passwords and other sensitive information. In addition, proper sanitization of
  these systems after the session terminates often requires elevated privileges.
 Clientless operation. SSL VPNs are often described as being clientless, which is used as a selling
  point over traditional IPsec VPNs. For Web-enabled applications, the Web browser is the only client
  piece needed to connect to them via an SSL portal VPN. In other cases, dynamically downloaded
  agents, which may require software installation, are needed to provide access to legacy and
  client/server applications and network layer connections to non-Web enabled applications; these are
  the hallmarks of SSL tunnel VPNs. Proper privileges are needed to install the software and make
  appropriate system configurations. This has caused much debate in the security community over the
  marketing of SSL tunnel VPNs as clientless. In the cases where dynamic agents are necessary, some
  systems and locations, such as public kiosks, may be unable to install the appropriate software or use
  the SSL VPN.
