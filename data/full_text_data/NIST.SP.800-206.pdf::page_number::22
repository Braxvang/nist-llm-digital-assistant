                       IMPERATIVE 4 – Advancing Cybersecurity Research And Applications Development



          able to receive sensor data from devices located 5 miles away from the receptor.
          Potential security weaknesses and possible mitigations arising out of this
          experience with LPWAN technology are now being investigated. Researchers
          have learned that WiFi and Bluetooth do not naturally apply to some IoT/CPS
          deployment scenarios, particularly when deployment is outside, requires battery
          operation for extended periods, or must operate over a long range. In FY18, the
          team also deployed an LPWAN Infrastructure that was integrated with NIST’s
          internal network, NIST-Net, satisfying all security policies required by NIST. In
          FY19, the NIST Engineering Laboratory (EL), NIST/ITL, and National Institute of
          Metrology, Standardization and Industrial Quality (INMETRO) team will study
          the implementation of LPWAN on the Smart Grid and investigate LPWAN in the
          context of Smart Grid cybersecurity guidelines.
     •    Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL). Today, concepts like
          security controls and profiles are largely represented in proprietary ways, making
          it more difficult for many organizations to move forward as quickly as they need
          to in order to take advantage of these approaches. Organizations also often
          struggle with information systems that have many different components. To help
          address these problems, NIST is developing OSCAL—a standard for representing
          different categories of information about the publication, implementation, and
          assessment of security controls. In FY18, NIST completed a control catalog
          and profile schemas and began developing an implementation schema for
          representing system security plans (SSP) in OSCAL. The team validated the
          approach with several use cases. In FY19, NIST will continue to develop other
          approaches involving the Cybersecurity Framework as well as assessments and
          assessment results.
     •    Combating Ransomware. NIST has placed a high priority on identifying and
          demonstrating tools for identifying, protecting against, detecting, responding
          to, and recovering from ransomware attacks and other events that are
          destructive to systems and operations. In FY18, NIST released Data Integrity:
          Recovering from Ransomware and Other Destructive Events (SP 1800-11)25 for
          public comment and initiated two other ransomware projects, Data Integrity:
          Identifying and Protecting Against Ransomware and Other Destructive
          Events26 and Detecting and Responding to Ransomware and Other Destructive
          Events.27 Finalization of SP 1800-11 and development of practice guides for
          the identification and protection and the detection and response projects are
          planned for FY 2019.
