Some techniques that lend themselves to dissemination of a single message are the use of awareness tools,
posters, access lists, screensavers and warning banners, desk-to-desk alerts, agency wide e-mail messages,
brown bag seminars, and awards programs.

Techniques that can more easily include a number of messages include “do and don’t lists,” newsletters,
videotapes, web-based sessions, computer-based sessions, teleconferencing sessions, in-person instructor-
led sessions, and brown bag seminars.

Techniques that can be fairly inexpensive to implement include messages on awareness tools, posters,
access lists, “do and don’t lists,” checklists, screensavers and warning banners, desk-to-desk alerts,
agency wide e-mail messages, in-person instructor-led sessions, brown bag seminars, and rewards
programs. Appendix D contains sample awareness posters.

Techniques that can require more resources include newsletters, videotapes, web-based sessions,
computer-based sessions, and teleconferencing sessions.

In addition to making awareness material interesting and current, repeating an awareness message and
using a variety of ways of presenting that message can greatly increase users’ retention of awareness
lessons or issues. For example, discussion in an instructor-led session about avoiding being a victim of a
social engineering attack can be reinforced with posters, periodic agency wide e-mail messages, and
messages on awareness tools that are distributed to users.
