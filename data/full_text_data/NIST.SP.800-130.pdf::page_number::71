hardware and/or software of the module. The module should be returned to a secure state
before the module is returned to normal operation. Following repair or replacement, a
module must be tested for its operational capability, as well as its security status.

To provide protection against non-invasive attacks on a cryptographic module, either the
use of the module should be restricted to only trusted users, or the module should be
designed to prevent this specific type of attack. In the first case, there is always the threat
that a module will be lost or stolen or that a trusted user will become dishonest. In the
second case, it can become very costly to protect against every possible type of non-
invasive attack. An attacker might determine information about a cryptographic key used
by the module by examining the detailed power consumption patterns of the module
during the cryptographic processing. Other potential non-invasive attacks are based on
carefully analyzing the amount of time certain cryptographic functions take to execute, or
the emanations given off by the module during its normal operation.

FR:6.109 The CKMS design shall specify how physical and logical access to the
cryptographic module contents is restricted to authorized entities.

FR:6.110 The CKMS design shall specify the approach to be used to recover from a
cryptographic module compromise.

FR:6.111 The CKMS design shall describe what non-invasive attacks are mitigated by
the cryptographic modules used by the system and provide a description of how the
mitigation is performed.

FR:6.112 The CKMS design shall identify any cryptographic modules that are
vulnerable to non-invasive attacks.

FR:6.113 The CKMS design shall provide the rationale for accepting the vulnerabilities
caused by possible non-invasive attacks.

6.8.5 Computer System Compromise Recovery
The unauthorized modification of CKMS software or major portions of a computer
operating system can be detected using tools that run on a separate secure platform and
monitor any modification to a file, changes to the hash value of a file’s contents, or
changes to a file’s attributes (e.g., who the owner is, or who is on the ACL) (see Section
8.2.4). Alternatively, a layered system of protections is often built into a CKMS. When
protective mechanisms are built into the system, they need to be protected from the same
threats as the system itself. When critical files undergo unauthorized modifications that
are detected by the monitoring utility or indicated in the event log, these files should be
replaced using known valid and secure files located in secure storage.

If pervasive, unauthorized changes to software are made, the software should be
recovered as described in Section 10.5.
