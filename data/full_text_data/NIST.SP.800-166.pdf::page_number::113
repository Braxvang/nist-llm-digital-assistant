NIST SP 800-166                                                   DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                  DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

 Issuer Documentation    None.

 Precondition(s)         •    A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                              appropriate token reader.
                         •    Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                              an instance of the reader.
                         •    A Derived PIV Authentication certificate is present within the
                              Derived PIV Application.
 Test Scenario           1. Send the SELECT command with
                               • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                         2. Send the GET DATA command with
                               • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                  ('5FC105') of the X.509 Certificate for
                                  Derived PIV Authentication data object
                         3. Extract the the value of the authorityInfoAccess
                            extension from the certificate.
 Expected Result(s)      1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                            template with the status word '90 00'.
                         2. From Step 2, the command the requested data object along with
                            the returns status word '90 00'.
                         3. From Step 3, an accessMethod containing id-ad-ocsp
                            (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1) is present that contains an accessLocation
                            of type uniformResourceIdentifier where the scheme is “http”
                            (not “https”). An id-ad-caIssuers (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2)
                            accessMethod is also present where the accessLocation is of
                            type uniformResourceIdentifier and the scheme is “http.”

9.3.1.7 Asymmetric Key Pair

 Test Assertion          TA-09.03.01.07
 Purpose                 Verifies that the public key that exists in the Derived PIV
                         Authentication certificate corresponds to the private key located in
                         the Derived PIV Application.

                         • The Derived PIV Application Password is recorded.
                         • The Derived PIV Application Password’s retry counter is not 0.
 Test Scenario           1. Send the SELECT command with
