Special Publication 800-85B                                PIV Data Model Testing Specification


This document provides technical guidance on the methodology to be used during testing applicable
components, but does not provide normative guidance on which entities will execute the tests. Also,
the test methodologies defined in this document are not designed to test business processes or to verify
compliance with external applicable standards. For example, this document does not provide test
guidance to determine how good a userâ€™s Personal Identification Number (PIN) choice is or how
access rights are granted to employees.


1.3   Audience and Assumptions
This document is targeted at vendors and integrators of PIV components, as well as the entities that
will conduct tests on such components. Readers are assumed to have a working knowledge of FIPS201,
PIV guidance, and applicable technologies.

This document will:

Enable developers of PIV components to develop their modules to be testable for requirements
specified in FIPS201, SP80073, SP80076, and SP80078.
Enable developers of PIV components to develop self-tests as part of the development effort.
Enable testers to develop tests that cover the test suite provided in this document.
