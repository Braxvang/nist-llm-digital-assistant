SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



run under security policy that is different from that of an authoritative name server. Hence, a name server
instance should always be configured as either an authoritative name server or a resolving name server.

An authoritative name server is only intended to provide name resolution for the zones for which it has
authoritative information. Hence, the security policy should have recursion turned off for this type of
name server. Disabling recursion prevents an authoritative name server from sending queries on behalf of
other name servers and building up a cache using responses. Disabling this function eliminates the cache
poisoning threat on authoritative serves and prevents their use as reflectors for DDoS attacks [BCP140].
In BIND, recursion is disabled by using the options statement in the BIND configuration file as follows:

        options {
             recursion no;
        };

NSD can only operate as an authoritative only server. NSD cannot act as a recursive resolver and
therefore does not have a comparable option, as it is NSD’s default behavior.

A resolving name server is only intended to provide resolving services (processing resolving queries on
behalf of clients) for internal clients. Thus, protection of resolving name servers can be ensured by
restricting their types of interactions (also called transactions) to designated hosts through various
configuration options in the configuration file of the name server software.

7.2.6   Removing Name Server Software from Nondesignated Hosts

DNS software should not be running or present in hosts that are not designated as name servers. The
possibility arises in the case of DNS BIND software because of the fact that many versions of Unix
(including Solaris and Linux versions) come installed with BIND as default. Hence, while taking an
inventory of software in workstations and servers of the enterprise as part of the security audit, it is
necessary to look for BIND installations and remove them from hosts that are not functioning as name
servers.

7.2.7   Network and Geographic Dispersion of Authoritative Name Servers

Most enterprises have an authoritative primary server and a host of authoritative secondary name servers.
It is essential that these authoritative name servers for an enterprise be located on different network
segments. This dispersion ensures the availability of an authoritative name server not only in situations in
which a particular router or switch fails but also during events involving an attack on an entire network
segment. In addition to network-based dispersion, authoritative name servers should be dispersed
geographically as well. In other words, in addition to being located on different network segments, the
authoritative name servers should not all be located within the same building. One approach that some
organizations follow is to locate some authoritative name servers in their own premises and others in their
ISPs’ data centers or in partnering organizations.

Additionally, a network administrator may choose to use a “hidden” master authoritative server and only
have secondary servers visible on the network. A hidden master authoritative server is an authoritative
DNS server whose IP address does not appear in the name server set for a zone. All of the name servers
that do appear in the zone database as designated name servers all get their zone data from the hidden
master via a zone transfer request. In effect, all visible name servers are actually secondary slave servers.
This prevents potential attackers from targeting the master name server, as its IP address may not appear
in the zone database. A hidden master only accepts zone transfer requests from the set of valid
secondaries and refuses all other DNS queries.
