       NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1
       September 2023                                 PIV Card Application Namespace, Data Model, and Representation



1051   Appendix A. PIV Data Model
1052   The PIV data model number is 0x10, and the data model version number is 0x01.
1053   The SP 800-73-5 specification does not provide mechanisms to read partial contents of a PIV
1054   data object. Individual access to the TLV elements within a container is not supported. For each
1055   container, compliant cards SHALL return all TLV elements of the container in the order listed in
1056   this appendix.
1057   Both single-chip/dual-interface and dual-chip implementations are feasible. In the single-
1058   chip/dual-interface configuration, the PIV Card Application SHALL be provided with
1059   information regarding which interface is in use. In the dual-chip configuration, a separate PIV
1060   Card Application SHALL be loaded on each chip.

          The values in this column denote the guaranteed minimum capacities of the on-card storage containers in bytes. Cards with larger containers
       may be produced and determined conformant.
