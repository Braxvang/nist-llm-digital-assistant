2.      Background to Web Services and Their Relationship to Security

Organizations are adopting SOA to support their mission critical applications. SOA is a computing
paradigm emphasizing dynamic service discovery, composition, and interoperability. Web services are a
technology that can be used to implement SOA and are increasingly becoming the SOA implementation
of choice. 6 For a SOA to truly meet its goals, applications must be secure and reliable. A large number
of security standards have been proposed for Web services by a number of different organizations. This
section provides an overview of Web services, the associated security challenges, and the standards
available for securing Web services.

2.1     Introducing Web Services

There are various aspects of Web services: messaging, discovery, portals, roles, and coordination. This
section uses an example Web service to illustrate the use of each aspect in developing a SOA application.
The example consists of a loan processing Web service which relies on two other Web services: an
interest rate service and a credit check service.

2.1.1     Web Service Discovery

To define the format of each SOAP message, W3C developed the WSDL. WSDL interfaces are created
by each Web service and can be shared to allow dynamic binding. Through dynamic binding, Web
services can communicate with newly added services without any additional programming or
configuration changes. To facilitate the discovery of Web services, a discovery standard called UDDI
was developed. UDDI allows Web services to search for one another dynamically. When combined with
WSDL, Web services can easily discover and use new services at run-time without human intervention.

In the bank loan example, the loan service needs to discover the rate service before using it. The rate
Web service is listed in the UDDI registry as a Web service capable of providing information about the
bank’s rates. When the loan service is initiated, the UDDI registry is accessed and searched for a Web
service capable of providing the bank’s rate information. The UDDI registry returned the rate service’s
Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and details about how to access the rate service, which are derived
from the WSDL interface. Figure 2-1 illustrates the discovery process.

      A SOA can be implemented using a number of other technologies, such as Representational State Transfer (REST) or
      Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA). This guidance is limited to SOAP-based Web Services, but much
      of the guidance in this document may be applicable to other SOA technologies.
