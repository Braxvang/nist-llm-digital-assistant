                                 GUIDE TO MALWARE INCIDENT PREVENTION AND HANDLING FOR DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS


Other examples are the frequent use of spear phishing attacks, which are targeted phishing attacks, and
whaling attacks, which are spear phishing attacks targeted at executives and other individuals with access
to information of particular interest or value.

Malware customization causes significant problems for malware detection, because it greatly increases
the variety of malware that antivirus software and other security controls need to detect and block. When
attackers are capable of sending a unique attack to each potential victim, it should not be surprising that
largely signature-based security controls, such as antivirus software, cannot keep up with them.
Mitigation involves a defense in depth approach, using several different detection techniques to increase
the odds that at least one of them can detect the malicious behavior of the customized malware.

In addition to customization, another important characteristic of today’s malware is its stealthy nature.
Unlike most malware several years ago, which tended to be easy to notice, much of today’s malware is
specifically designed to quietly, slowly spread to other hosts, gathering information over extended periods
of time and eventually leading to exfiltration of sensitive data and other negative impacts. The term
advanced persistent threats (APTs) is generally used to refer to such types of malware. The attack
scenario outlined in the above box could be an example of an advanced persistent threat if it was stealthy.
APTs may conduct surveillance for weeks, months, or even years, potentially causing extensive damage
to an organization with just one compromise. APTs are also notoriously difficult to remove from hosts,
often requiring the host’s operating system and applications to be reinstalled and all data restored from
known good backups.

In summary, today’s malware is often harder to detect, more damaging, and harder to remove than
previous generations of malware. And there is no indication that this evolution is at an end. When today’s
hardest malware problems become routine to address, expect new challenges to emerge.
