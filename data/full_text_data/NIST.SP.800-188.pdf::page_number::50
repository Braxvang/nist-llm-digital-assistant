NIST SP 800-188

DRBs should be governed by a written mission statement and charter (or equivalent doc-
ument) that are ideally approved by the same mechanisms that the organization uses to
approve other organization-wide policies.
The DRB should have a mission statement that guides its activities. For example, the U.S.
Department of Education’s DRB has the mission statement:
      The Mission of the Department of Education Disclosure Review Board (ED-
      DRB) is to review proposed data releases by the Department’s principal offces
      (POs) through a collaborate technical assistance, aiding the Department to re-
      lease as much useful data as possible, while protecting the privacy of individ-
      uals and the confdentiality of their data, as required by law. [54]
Most DRBs are established to weigh the interests of data release against those of individual
privacy protection. However, a DRB may also be chartered to consider group harms [66,
p. 13] that can result from the release of a dataset. Such harms go beyond the harm to the
privacy interests of a specifc individual.
The DRB charter specifes the mechanics of how the mission is implemented. A formal,
written charter promotes transparency in the decision-making process and ensures con-
sistency in the application of its policies. The DRB charter should frame the DRB’s re-
sponsibilities in reference to existing organizational policies and components, as well as
applicable regulations and laws. Some agencies may balance these concerns by employing
data use models other than de-identifcation (e.g., by establishing data enclaves where a
limited number of vetted researchers can access sensitive datasets in a way that provides
data value while minimizing the possibility for harm or by authorizing the use of secure
multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption, or other privacy-preserving data ana-
lytics to compute various statistics). In those agencies, a DRB would be empowered to
approve the use of such mechanisms.
Certain agencies may engage in data disclosure on a routine basis (e.g., research and eval-
uation agencies), in which case it may be benefcial for the DRB to establish policies and
procedures for de-identifcation rather than being responsible for every review. The DRB
charter should clearly specify how the group will provide oversight and ensure organiza-
tional accountability to the agreed-upon policies.




 the Information Quality Act (IQA), record disclosure laws and policy, and the Paperwork Reduction Act
 (PRA).” (p. 23) The memo’s further states that an agency’s Annual Evaluation Plans will discuss how infor-
 mation will be disseminated and used while taking into account “applicable law and policies governing the
 collection, use, and disclosure of data and information.” (p. 35) Footnote 34 on p. 22 cites section 202(e)
 of the evidence act noting that the Chief Data Offcer “shall be designated on the basis of demonstrated
 training and experience in data management, governance (including creation, application, and maintenance
 ofdata standards), collection, analysis, protection, use, and dissemination, including with respect to any
 statistical and related techniques to protect and de-identify confdential data.”
