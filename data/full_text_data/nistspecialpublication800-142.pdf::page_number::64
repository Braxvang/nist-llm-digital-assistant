Practical Combinatorial Testing
________________________________________________________________
 1 because “a && b” evaluates to 1, but p(0,1,1,1,0) will detect the error. A complete 3­
way covering test set will detect the error because it must include at least one test with
values 0,1,1,1,. and one with 1,0,1,1,. . Figure 31 shows tests for this example for t = 2, 3,
and 4. Failing tests are underlined.

         A 2-way test may detect the error, since “c && d” is the condition necessary, but
this will only occur if line 3 is reached, which requires either a=0 or b=0. In the example
test set this occurs with the second test. So in this case, a full 2-way test set has detected
the error, and the heuristics above for 2-way combinations will find that tests with c=1 and
d=1 occur in both P and F. In this case, debugging may identify c=1, d=1 as a combination
that triggers the failure, but automated analysis using the heuristics will find two 3-way
combinations that occur in failing tests but not passing tests: a=0, c=1, d=1 and b=0, c=1,
d=1. As Figure 32 illustrates, in most cases we will find more than one combination
identified as possible causes of failure.

The heuristics above can be applied to combinations in the failed tests to identify possible
failure-triggering combinations, shown in Figure 32.

     •   The 1-way tests do not detect any failures, but the 2-way tests do, so t=2 is a lower
         bound for the interaction level needed to detect a failure.

     •   The value dependence rule applies to combination “be” – since all four possible
         values for this combination occur in failing tests, failure must be independent of
         combination be. In other words, we do not consider the pair be to be a cause of
