NIST SP 800-219r1                                                      Automated Secure Configuration
July 2023                                                                   Guidance from the mSCP



   Introduction
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has traditionally published secure
configuration guides for Apple desktop/laptop operating system versions as prose-based Special
Publications (SPs), such as NIST SP 800-179, Revision 1, Guide to Securing Apple macOS 10.12
Systems for IT Professionals: A NIST Security Configuration Checklist. In order to provide
security configuration guidance to organizations more quickly and in a machine-consumable
format, NIST established the open-source macOS Security Compliance Project (mSCP). NIST
no longer produces SP guidance documents for each macOS release; instead, the mSCP
continuously curates and updates machine-consumable macOS guidance. The latest macOS
security baseline content is maintained and updated on the mSCP GitHub page [1].
Security baselines are groups of settings used to configure a system to meet a target level or set
of requirements or to verify that a system complies with requirements. The mSCP seeks to
simplify the macOS security development cycle by reducing the amount of effort required to
implement security baselines. This collaboration between federal agencies minimizes duplicate
effort that would otherwise be needed for these agencies to administer individual security
baselines. Additionally, the secure baseline content provided is easily extensible by other parties
to implement their own security requirements.
Organizations using mSCP content, particularly security baseline examples, should take a risk-
based approach for selecting the appropriate settings and defining values that consider the
context under which the baseline will be utilized.

       Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this document is to introduce the mSCP to broader audiences. This document
provides a high-level overview of the mSCP, its components, and some common use cases. It
refers readers to the online project documentation for in-depth technical information and use
instructions. This document is intended to be independent of macOS version releases; updates
will be released as needed when there are substantial changes to the mSCP. Updates from the
previous release of this document mainly involve the new mSCP capability to create a custom
benchmark by tailoring a baseline.
The information in this document regarding the details of the mSCP GitHub site is accurate as of
the time of publication. Readers seeking the latest detailed information on mSCP content or the
content itself should visit the mSCP GitHub page and wiki.
Organizations that need to reference a NIST SP to demonstrate how they are complying with
United States Government mandates for adopting secure configurations for their macOS devices
may reference this SP instead of its deprecated predecessors, such as SP 800-179 or SP 800-179,
Revision 1.

       Audience
This document and the mSCP GitHub site are intended for system administrators, security
professionals, policy authors, privacy officers, and auditors who have responsibilities involving
