ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



9.3     Case Study 3: Supporting Users Who Are Not Employees

The General Regulatory Commission (GRC) was proud of the openness of its proceedings and had
successfully used technology to improve its accessibility to the public. Last year, it won an award for its
Web site that allows remote users to search through electronic records in its online docket. Recently, it
decided to use technology to improve the experience of visitors to its headquarters in Washington, D.C.
At the top of its list of project ideas was the installation of new WLAN technology.

GRC’s Associate CIO for network engineering and operations had been considering deployment of IEEE
802.11 RSN technology, but was not certain it was best-suited for all of GRC’s desired applications. He
realized that cyber security threats were real and growing. While the commission embraced technology
tools that help it to perform its public service mission, senior staff also knew they needed to balance
public access and security. A significant security breach could undermine years of trust the commission
had built with its stakeholders.

9.3.1    Phase 1: Initiation

The Associate CIO tasked his IT services contractor to develop a high-level strategy for the WLAN
project, in particular analyzing what types of security controls were appropriate for its various
components. A few days later, the contractor presented some preliminary ideas, which are shown in
Table 9-5.
