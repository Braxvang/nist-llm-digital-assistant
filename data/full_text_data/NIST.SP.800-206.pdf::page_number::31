     IMPERATIVE 7 – Bolstering Infrastructure Protection




              DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM-BASED ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY
              NIST’s Special Publication 1800-6, Domain Name System-Based Electronic
              Mail Security, was published in January 2018. This publication documents the
              use of products that improve security and integrity for electronic mail users by
              employing the DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) protocol
              to authenticate domain addresses (e.g., @nist.gov) for electronic mail and
              STARTTLS protocol, which provides a way to take an existing insecure connection
              and upgrade it to a secure connection using secure transmission protocols. Since
              its publication, there has been a sharp increase in the number of internet domains
              that deploy DANE (608 % from February 2018 to February 2019). Moreover, the
              Department of Homeland Security’s Binding Operational Directive 18-01 now
              provides compulsory direction to federal executive branch departments and
              agencies to employ email authentication and specifies that all internet-facing
              email servers offer the STARTTLS protocol.


              •   Energy Infrastructure Cybersecurity. Under the Energy Independence and
                  Security Act (EISA),63 NIST has a leading role in collaborating with the private
                  sector to coordinate and accelerate smart grid64 interoperability and security
                  standards. Multiple NIST laboratories are involved in this effort to advance
                  measurement science, leading to better utilization of assets, improved grid
                  reliability, and greater use of renewable energy sources in the grid. This is
                  accomplished through a combination of research, standardization, testing and
                  implementation of the NIST Smart Grid Interoperability Framework.65 In FY18, NIST:
                  •   Conducted a grid edge experiment to understand the performance impact of
                      cybersecurity capabilities on resource-constrained components of the grid;
                  •   Published SP 1800-2,66 a guide that shows how organizations can more
                      securely and effectively manage access to networked operational technology
                      (OT) devices and systems on which their operations depend; and
                  •   Revised SP 1800-7,67 Smart Grid Cybersecurity Committee, a guide that
                      explains how energy companies can capture, transmit, analyze, and store real-
                      time or near real-time data for their systems to detect, analyze, and remediate
                      anomalous conditions.
