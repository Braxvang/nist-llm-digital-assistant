NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                         GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


3.4.2.7 Encrypt-then-MAC

Applies to TLS versions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2

Several attacks on CBC cipher suites have been possible due to the MAC-then-encrypt order of
operations used in TLS versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. The Encrypt-then-MAC extension alters the
order that the encryption and MAC operations are applied to the data. This is believed to provide
stronger security and mitigate or prevent several known attacks on CBC cipher suites. Servers
that are configured to negotiate CBC cipher suites shall support this extension as described in
[33].

3.4.2.8 Truncated HMAC

Applies to TLS versions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2

The Truncated HMAC extension allows a truncation of the HMAC output to 80 bits for use as a
MAC tag. An 80-bit MAC tag complies with the recommendations in SP 800-107 [20] but
reduces the security provided by the integrity algorithm. Because forging a MAC tag is an online
attack, and the TLS session will terminate immediately when an invalid MAC tag is encountered,
the risk introduced by using this extension is low. However, truncated MAC tags shall not be
used in conjunction with variable-length padding due to attacks described by Paterson et al. [53].
This extension is only applicable when cipher suites that use CBC modes are supported.

3.4.2.9 Pre-Shared Key

Applies to TLS version 1.3

The Pre-Shared Key (PSK) extension (pre_shared_key), available in TLS 1.3, is used to indicate
the identity of the pre-shared key to be used for PSK key establishment. In TLS 1.3 pre-shared
keys may either be established out-of-band, as in TLS 1.2 or below, or in a previous connection,
in which case they are used for session resumption. Servers that support TLS 1.3 may be
configured to support this extension in order to support session resumption or to support the use
of pre-shared keys that are established out-of-band.

3.4.2.10 Pre-Shared Key Exchange Modes

Applies to TLS version 1.3

A TLS 1.3 client must send the Pre-Shared Key Exchange Modes extension
(psk_key_exchange_modes) if it sends the Pre-Shared Key extension. TLS 1.3 servers use the
list of key exchange modes present in the extension to select an appropriate key exchange
method. TLS servers that support TLS 1.3 and the Pre-Shared Key extension shall support this
extension.
