                        DATA command with
                        • Data field of the command containing the tag of the
                          Discovery Object data object
                    14. If retired keys are supported on card:
                       A) Send GET DATA command with
                           • Data field of the command containing the tag of the
                              Key History Object data object
                       B) For each implemented (up to twenty) Retired X.509
                          Certificate for Key Management
                           • Send GET DATA command with the data field of the
                              command containing the tag of a Retired X.509
                              Certificate for Key Management data object
                    15. If OCC is supported, send GET DATA command with
                        • Data field of the command containing the tag of the
                          Biometric Information Templates Group Template data
                          object
                    16. If secure messaging for non-card-management opertions is
                        supported, send GET DATA command with
                        • Data field of the command containing the tag of the
                          Secure Messaging Certificate Signer data object
                    17. If the virtual contact interface is supported, send GET
                        DATA command with
                        • Data field of the command containing the tag of the
                          Pairing Code Reference Data Container data object
                    18. Send VERIFY card command with
                        • P2, key reference value is set to '80'
                        • Data field of the command will contain the PIN value
                          obtained from the vendor, padded with 'FF' to complete
                          the total length of the value to 8 bytes
                        • This command (and steps 19 – 23) shall additionally be
                          executed with: 1) P2 = '00' if the card supports the
                          Global PIN (as indicated by the PIN Usage Policy within
                          the Discovery Object) and 2) P2='96' and '97' if the
                          card supports OCC and it satisfies the PIV ACRs. For
                          key reference '00' the subsequent steps have the same
                          expected result as when the key reference '80' is used.
