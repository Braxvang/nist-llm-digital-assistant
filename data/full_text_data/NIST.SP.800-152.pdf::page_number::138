SP 800-152                                              A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


Cryptographic module      The set of hardware, software, and/or firmware that
                          implements security functions (including cryptographic
                          algorithms), holds plaintext keys and uses them for
                          performing cryptographic operations, and is contained within
                          a cryptographic module boundary. This Profile requires the
                          use of a validated cryptographic module as specified in [FIPS
                          140].
Cryptographic module      A cryptographic module whose keys and/or metadata have
(compromised)             been subjected to unauthorized access, modification, or
                          disclosure while contained within the cryptographic module.
Cryptographic Module      A specification of the security rules under which a
Security Policy           cryptographic module is designed to operate.
Cryptographic officer     An FCKMS role that is responsible for and authorized to
                          initialize and manage all cryptographic services, functions,
                          and keys of the FCKMS.
Cryptographic operation   The execution of a cryptographic algorithm. Cryptographic
                          operations are performed in cryptographic modules.
Cryptoperiod              The time span during which a specific key is authorized for
                          use or in which the keys for a given system or application may
                          remain in effect.
Deactivated state         A lifecycle state of a key whereby the key is no longer to be
                          used for applying cryptographic protection. Processing
                          already protected information may still be performed.
Destroyed state           A lifecycle state of a key whereby the key is no longer
                          available and cannot be reconstructed.
Device                    A combination of components that function together to serve a
                          specific purpose.
Digital signature         The result of a cryptographic transformation of data that,
                          when properly implemented with a supporting infrastructure
                          and policy, provides the services of:
                            1. Origin authentication,
                            2. Data integrity, and
                            3. Signer non-repudiation.
Domain authority          An FCKMS role that is responsible for determining whether
                          another domainâ€™s FCKMS Security Policy is equivalent to or
                          compatible with its own domain policy. The FCKMS system
                          authority often performs this role.
Downgrading               An authorized reduction in the level of protection to be
                          provided to specified information, e.g., from a Moderate
                          impact-level down to a Low impact-level.
