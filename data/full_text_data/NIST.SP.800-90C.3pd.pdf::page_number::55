       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                        Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

1517       6. The entropy sources used for the instantiation and reseeding of an RBG2(NP) construction
1518          shall include one or more validated non-physical entropy sources; the inclusion of one or
1519          more validated physical entropy sources is optional. A bitstring containing entropy shall
1520          be assembled and the entropy in that bitstring determined as specified in Method 2 of
1521          Section 2.3 (i.e., the entropy provided by both validated non-physical entropy sources and
1522          any validated physical entropy sources included in the implementation shall be counted
1523          toward fulfilling the requested amount of entropy).
1524       7. The DRBG shall be capable of being instantiated and reseeded at the maximum security
1525          strength (s) for the DRBG design (see [SP800-90A]).
1526       8. A specific entropy-source output (or portion thereof) shall not be reused (e.g., it is
1527          destroyed after use).
1528       9. When instantiating and reseeding a CTR_DRBG without a derivation function, (s + 128)
1529          bits with full entropy shall be obtained either directly from the entropy source or from the
1530          entropy source via an external vetted conditioning function (see Section 3.3).
1531       10. For a Hash_DRBG, HMAC_DRBG or CTR_DRBG (with a derivation function), a
1532           bitstring with at least 3s/2 bits of entropy shall be obtained from the entropy source to
1533           instantiate the DRBG at a security strength of s bits. When reseeding is performed, a
1534           bitstring with at least s bits of entropy shall be obtained from the entropy source.
1535       11. The DRBG shall be instantiated before first use (i.e., before providing output for use by a
1536           consuming application) and reseeded using the validated entropy sources used for
1537           instantiation.
1538       12. When health tests detect the failure of a validated entropy source, the failure shall be
1539           handled as discussed in Section 7.1.2.1.
1540   A non-testable requirement for the RBG (not testable by the validation labs) is:
1541       13. The RBG must not be used by applications that require a higher security strength than
1542           has been instantiated in the DRBG.
