NIST SP 800-125A REV. 1                                                    SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
                                                                       SERVER-BASED HYPERVISOR PLATFORMS

 •   Hypervisor host user account management
 •   Hypervisor host authentication and access control
 •   Routine administration of Host OS (e.g., keeping patches current)
 •   Routine administration of Guest OS
 •   Security of Guest OSs running on VMs
 •   Security of Applications/Services running on VMs


1.3 Target Audience

The target audience for the security recommendations in this document is the following:
• The Chief Security Officer (CSO) or the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of an Enterprise IT department
    in a private enterprise or government agency who wants to develop a virtualization infrastructure to host
    various Line of Business (LOB) application systems on Virtual Machines (VM)
• Managers of data centers who want to offer virtualization infrastructure for hosting secure cloud
    services, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), for cloud service customers.

1.4 Relationship to other NIST Guidance Documents

 In terms of technology area, the NIST Guidance document that is related to this document is NIST
 Special Publication (SP) 800-125, Guide to Security for Full Virtualization Technologies. Consistent with
 the state of technology adoption at that time (SP 800-125 was published in January 2011), SP 800-125
 provided higher-level security recommendations for use of components in two applications of virtualization
 paradigm: Server Virtualization and Desktop Virtualization. Since then, Server Virtualization has found
 widespread adoption in IT data centers both for hosting in-house or on-premises (enterprise) applications as
 well as for hosting applications and providing computing units for cloud services.

 Accompanying this technology adoption trend is the increase in feature sets of hypervisors, as well as market
 availability of the set of tools used for configuration and administration of the virtualized infrastructure
 spawned by the hypervisor. The objective of this document is to focus on the development of a set of
 security recommendations for deployment of the hypervisor (with all of its constituent modules) including
 the steps involved in the creation and provisioning of VMs. The distinguishing features of the set of security
 recommendations provided in this document in the context of similar NIST Guidance documents are
 given below:

 •   A focused set of security recommendations that are architecture agnostic for the deployment of
     hypervisors is provided.
 •   Since real world deployment includes provisioning of VMs, all VM life-cycle operations, from creation
     and management of VM images to their administration using granular privileges, is covered.
 •   Recognizing that the hypervisor is a purpose-built Operating System (OS) kernel and t h a t the
     security of a server OS depends upon its weakest link regardless of the distribution (e.g., driver
     software), security recommendations relating to these components have been provided as well.
 •   Recognizing that the hypervisor performs certain privileged operations without interference from any
     other entity in the virtualized host and that leveraging hardware support for these operations will make
     a significant difference to the overall security of hypervisor deployment, the security recommendations
     also improve performance when virtualization-specific functions (e.g., memory tables for multiple
     VMs) are offloaded (leveraged) to the processor instead of through software functions.
 •   All security recommendations are intended to provide assurance against exploitation of threats to tasks
     involved in the hypervisor’s baseline functions.
