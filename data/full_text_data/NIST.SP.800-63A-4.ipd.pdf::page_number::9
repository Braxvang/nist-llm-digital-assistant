225   Call for Patent Claims

226   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims
227   whose use would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this
228   Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or
229   requirements may be directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another
230   publication. This call also includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending
231   U.S. or foreign patent applications relating to this ITL draft publication and of any
232   relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.
233   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its
234   behalf, in written or electronic form, either:
235      a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not
236         hold and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
237     b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available
238        to applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the
239        guidance or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:
240            i. under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
241               discrimination; or
242           ii. without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
243               demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.
244   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make
245   assurances on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents
246   subject to the assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the
247   assurance are binding on the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include
248   appropriate provisions in the event of future transfers with the goal of binding each
249   successor-in-interest.
250   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
251   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.
252   Such statements should be addressed to: mailto:dig-comments@nist.gov.
