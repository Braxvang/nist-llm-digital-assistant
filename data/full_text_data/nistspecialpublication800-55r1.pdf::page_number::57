Measure 6: Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments (CA) (program-level)
          Field                                               Data
 Measure ID       C&A Completion Measure 1 (or a unique identifier to be filled out by the organization)
 Goal             •   Strategic Goal: Ensure an environment of comprehensive security and accountability
                      for personnel, facilities, and products.
                  •   Information Security Goal: Ensure all information systems have been certified and
                      accredited as required.
 Measure          Percentage (%) of new systems that have completed certification and accreditation
                  (C&A) prior to their implementation
                  NIST SP 800-53 Control: CA-6: Security Accreditation
 Measure Type     Effectiveness/Efficiency
 Formula          (Number of new systems with complete C&A packages with Authorizing Official [AO]
                  approval prior to implementation)/(total number of new systems) *100
 Target           This should be a high percentage defined by the organization.
 Implementation   1. Does your agency (or agency component, if applicable) maintain a complete and up-to-
 Evidence         date system inventory?

                        Yes                     No

                  2. Is there a formal C&A process within your agency (CA-1)?

                        Yes                     No

                  3. If the answer to Question 2 is yes, are system development projects required to
                  complete C&A prior to implementation (CA-1)?

                        Yes                     No

                  4. How many new systems have been implemented during the reporting period? _____
                  5. How many systems indicated in Question 4 have received an authority to operate prior
                  to implementation (CA-6)? _____
