   â€¢   a microphone for voice recognition.
Individual sensors of the same type can be of varying quality and, ultimately, more or less secure
than a similar component. Some sensors are not directly exposed to developers, and access
decisions are made in proprietary security environments. Although these sensors are most often
used for local device authentication, they can also be used for remote authentication to enterprise
resources. Another mechanism that can be used for remote authentication is a derived Personal
Identity Verification (PIV) credential. This is where a mobile device leverages certificate-based
authentication through a token that is associated with a PIV credential. Additional information
can be found in NIST SP 800-63-3, Digital Identity Guidelines [4], and NIST SP 800-157,
Guidelines for Derived Personal Identity Verification [40].

       Enterprise Mobile Security Technologies
Technology to manage smartphones and tablets can be used to control organization-issued and
personally owned devices. This technology can take many forms, such as a management tool for
device configuration, an application management tool, or a mobile threat defense (MTD) tool.
MTD is a category of technology that defends devices from a variety of threats posed to the
devices themselves and any connected networks. Other products such as mobile identity
management, mobile content management, and mobile data management also exist but are not
covered in this publication. This section provides an overview of the current state and use of
these technologies, focusing on their components and security capabilities. These technologies
form the foundation for the recommended technical threat mitigations and countermeasures in
Section 4.3.

4.2.1. Enterprise Mobility Management
EMM, which is sometimes referred to as UEM (unified endpoint management), is a solution
used to deploy, configure, and actively manage mobile devices in an enterprise environment. An
EMM suite may encompass mobile device management (MDM), mobile application
management (MAM), MTD, and other management technologies. These management systems
are developed by a variety of organizations, including mobile device manufacturers, mobile OS
developers, and independent third-party development organizations. EMMs rely on the MDM
APIs and protocols described in Section 4.1.3 and employ technologies to monitor mobile
devices, deploy device policies, and configure device-side security technologies (e.g., secure
containers).
The rest of this subsection contains a list of security capabilities that may be provided by EMMs
or any of their supporting systems. Most organizations will not need all of the security
capabilities listed in this subsection. Organizations that deploy mobile devices should consider
the merits of each security capability, determine which services are needed for their
environment, and design and acquire one or more solutions that collectively provide the
necessary services for their needs. Additional guidance for implementing these technologies can
be found in Section 5.
