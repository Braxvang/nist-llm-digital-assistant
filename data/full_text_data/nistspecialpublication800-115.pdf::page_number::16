(POP). Servers that are externally accessible are tested for vulnerabilities that might allow access to
internal servers and private information. External security testing also concentrates on discovering access
method vulnerabilities, such as wireless access points, modems, and portals to internal servers.

For internal security testing, assessors work from the internal network and assume the identity of a trusted
insider or an attacker who has penetrated the perimeter defenses. This kind of testing can reveal
vulnerabilities that could be exploited, and demonstrates the potential damage this type of attacker could
cause. Internal security testing also focuses on system-level security and configuration—including
application and service configuration, authentication, access control, and system hardening.

Assessors who perform internal testing are often granted some level of access to the network, normally as
general users, and are provided with information that users with similar privileges would have. This level
of temporary access depends on the goals of the test, and can be up to and including the privileges of a
system or network administrator. Working from whatever level of access they have been granted,
assessors attempt to gain additional access to the network and systems through privilege escalation—i.e.,
increasing user-level privileges to administrator-level privileges, or increasing system administrator
privileges to domain administrator privileges.

Internal testing is not as limited as external testing because it takes place behind perimeter defenses, even
though there may be internal firewalls, routers, and switches in place that pose limitations. Examination
techniques such as network sniffing may be used in addition to testing techniques.

If both internal and external testing is to be performed, the external testing usually takes place first. This
is particularly beneficial if the same assessors will be performing both types of testing, as it keeps them
from acquiring insider information on network architecture or system configuration that would not be
available to an adversary—an advantage that would reduce the validity of the test.

2.4.2   Overt and Covert

Overt security testing, also known as white hat testing, involves performing external and/or internal
testing with the knowledge and consent of the organization’s IT staff, enabling comprehensive evaluation
of the network or system security posture. Because the IT staff is fully aware of and involved in the
testing, it may be able to provide guidance to limit the testing’s impact. Testing may also provide a
training opportunity, with staff observing the activities and methods used by assessors to evaluate and
potentially circumvent implemented security measures. This gives context to the security requirements
implemented or maintained by the IT staff, and also may help teach IT staff how to conduct testing.

Covert security testing, also known as black hat testing, takes an adversarial approach by performing
testing without the knowledge of the organization’s IT staff but with the full knowledge and permission
of upper management. Some organizations designate a trusted third party to ensure that the target
organization does not initiate response measures associated with the attack without first verifying that an
attack is indeed underway (e.g., that the activity being detected does not originate from a test). In such
situations, the trusted third party provides an agent for the assessors, the management, the IT staff, and the
security staff that mediates activities and facilitates communications. This type of test is useful for testing
technical security controls, IT staff response to perceived security incidents, and staff knowledge and
implementation of the organization’s security policy. Covert testing may be conducted with or without
warning.

The purpose of covert testing is to examine the damage or impact an adversary can cause—it does not
focus on identifying vulnerabilities. This type of testing does not test every security control, identify each
vulnerability, or assess all systems within an organization. Covert testing examines the organization from
