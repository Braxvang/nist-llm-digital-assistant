provide. A security policy specifies the aspects that a mechanism must enforce to achieve
organizational objectives. This means that a secure system cannot be achieved if the security
requirements do not fully specify the minimal capability necessary to enforce the security policy.
It also means that the satisfaction of requirements alone does not result in a secure system.
Verification and validation activities must be done separately and coordinated to ensure the
individual and combined correctness and effectiveness of the requirements and policy.

Figure 14 illustrates the significance of the consistency relationship that must be maintained
across interacting security requirements, security policy, and security mechanisms.




             Fig. 14. Relationship between Mechanisms and Security Policy Enforcement

Note that a security mechanism that fully satisfies its system security requirements may be
deemed capable of enforcing the security policy that is defined for two different organizations.
Each organization will use the same mechanism and configure it to behave in a manner that
enforces the rules of their organizational security policy. However, if the organizations were to
switch mechanisms and keep the same configuration of the mechanism, they would achieve
uncertain results (unless their security policy objectives required the exact same configuration of
the mechanism). From this, the following conclusions may be drawn:
•   Requirements express both the security protections to be provided by security mechanisms
    and the security-informed constraints to be enforced by security mechanisms.
•   Security policy determines the behavior and outcomes that are deemed secure.
•   For a mechanism to be deemed secure, the mechanism’s capability requirements must be
    consistent with security policy enforcement rules; the mechanism must satisfy the security
    requirements; and the mechanism must be configured to behave in a manner defined by the
    organizational security policy.
