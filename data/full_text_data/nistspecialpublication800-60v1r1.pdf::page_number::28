4.2.2     Common Factors for Selection of Impact Levels

Where an agency determines security impact levels and security categorization based on local
application of FIPS 199 criteria, it is recommended that the following factors be considered with
respect to security impacts for each information type.
4.2.2.1        Confidentiality Factors
Using the FIPS 199 potential impact criteria summarized in Table 7, each information type
should be evaluated for confidentiality with respect to the impact level associated with
unauthorized disclosure of (i) each known variant of the information belonging to the type and
(ii) each use of the information by the system under review. Answers to the following questions
will help in the evaluation process:
    •     How can a malicious adversary use the unauthorized disclosure of information to do
          limited/serious/severe harm to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals?
    •     How can a malicious adversary use the unauthorized disclosure of information to gain
          control of agency assets that might result in unauthorized modification of information,
          destruction of information, or denial of system services that would result in
          limited/serious/severe harm to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals?
