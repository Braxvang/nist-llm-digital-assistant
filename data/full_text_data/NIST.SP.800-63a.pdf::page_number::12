                                                                                             applicant is appropriately associated with this real-world identity. IAL2 introduces the need for
                                                                                             either remote or physically-present identity proofing. Attributes could be asserted by CSPs to
                                                                                             RPs in support of pseudonymous identity with verified attributes. A CSP that supports IAL2 can
                                                                                             support IAL1 transactions if the user consents.

                                                                                             IAL3: Physical presence is required for identity proofing. Identifying attributes must be verified
                                                                                             by an authorized and trained CSP representative. As with IAL2, attributes could be asserted by
                                                                                             CSPs to RPs in support of pseudonymous identity with verified attributes. A CSP that supports
                                                                                             IAL3 can support IAL1 and IAL2 identity attributes if the user consents.

                                                                                             At IAL2 and IAL3, pseudonymity in federated environments is enabled by limiting the number
                                                                                             of attributes sent from the CSP to the RP, or the way they are presented. For example, if a RP
                                                                                             needs a valid birthdate but no other personal details, the RP should leverage a CSP to request just
                                                                                             the birthdate of the subscriber. Wherever possible, the RP should ask the CSP for an attribute
                                                                                             reference. For example, if a RP needs to know if a claimant is older than 18 they should request a
                                                                                             boolean value, not the entire birthdate, to evaluate age. Conversely, it may be beneficial to the

                                                                                             transactions.

                                                                                             Since the individual will have undergone an identity proofing process at enrollment, transactions
