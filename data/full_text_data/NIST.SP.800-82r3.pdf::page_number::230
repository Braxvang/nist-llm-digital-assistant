Appendix F. OT Overlay
            Note to Readers
            The OT overlay is a partial tailoring of the controls and control baselines
            in NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 and adds supplementary guidance specific to
            OT. The concept of overlays is discussed in Appendix C of NIST SP
            800-53B. The OT overlay is intended to be applicable to all OT systems
            in all industrial sectors. Further tailoring can add specificity to a
            particular sector (e.g., pipeline, energy). Ultimately, an overlay may be
            produced for a specific system (e.g., the XYZ company).
            This OT overlay constitutes supplemental guidance and tailoring for
            NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5. Duplicating Appendix F of NIST SP 800-53
            would increase the size of this publication significantly, so it is not
            included here.
            The authoring team also considered that this OT overlay may serve as a
            model for other overlays. Feedback on this appendix’s structure would
            be appreciated, especially on the level of abstraction and whether the
            examples provided in the supplemental guidance are sufficient and
            beneficial for implementation.
Overlays provide a structured approach to help organizations tailor control baselines and develop
specialized security plans that can be applied to specific mission and business functions,
environments of operation, and/or technologies. This specialization approach is important as the
number of threat-driven controls and control enhancements in the catalog increases and
organizations develop risk management strategies to address their specific protection needs
within defined risk tolerances.
A repository of overlays may be found at https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/sp800-
53-controls/overlay-repository. This overlay may be referenced as the NIST SP 800-82, Rev. 3
Operational Technology Overlay (“NIST SP 800-82 Rev 3 OT Overlay”). It is based on NIST SP
800-53, Rev. 5 [SP800-53r5].
NIST developed this overlay in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal
Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014 (Public Law 113-283) [FISMA],
Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21) [PPD-21], and Executive Order 13636 [EO13636].
NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements,
for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets, but such
standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems without the express
approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems.

F.1.   Overlay Characteristics
OT encompasses a broad range of programmable systems and devices that interact with the
physical environment (or manage devices that interact with the physical environment). These
systems and devices detect or cause a direct change through the monitoring and/or control of
devices, processes, and events. Examples include industrial control systems, building automation
