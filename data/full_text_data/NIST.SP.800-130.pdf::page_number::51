addition to a security-issue-related revocation (since suspension is nothing but
revocation, albeit reversible), the security of re-activating a suspended key is also critical.

If a suspension is to apply to remote entities holding the key, as well as the local calling
entity, then provisions must be made for notifying the other entities of the suspension and
also the re-activation.

FR:6.29 The CKMS design shall specify how, and under what circumstances, a key is
suspended.

FR:6.30 The CKMS design shall specify how suspension information is made available
to the relying or communicating parties.

FR:6.31 The CKMS design shall specify how, and under what circumstances, a
suspended key is re-activated.

FR:6.32 The CKMS design shall specify how the suspended key is prevented from
performing security services.

FR:6.33 The CKMS design shall specify how re-activation information is made available
to the relying or communicating parties.

6.4.7 Renew a Public Key
Public key certificates contain a public key of an asymmetric key pair (i.e., the subject
key) and a validity period for that certificate. It may be desirable to have a public key
validity period that is shorter than the subject key’s cryptoperiod. This reduces the size of
revocation lists and revocation information, but requires certificates to be issued more
frequently. Renewal establishes a new validity period for an existing subject public key
beyond its previous validity period by issuing a new certificate containing the same
public key with a new validity period. The sum of the renewal periods for a given public
key must not exceed the cryptoperiod of the key.

Advance notification is useful for continuity of operations and mission so that the
appropriate set of new keys and associated metadata can be issued to appropriate parties.
For example, upon the expiration of an entity’s current public key certificate, the entity
may need to request either the renewal of the existing public key or the establishment of a
new public key.

FR:6.34 The CKMS design shall specify how and the conditions under which a public
key can be renewed.

FR:6.35 For each key type, the CKMS design shall specify requirements for advance
notification of the renewal of the key type, including which parties are notified, how they
are notified, what security services are applied to the notification, and the time-frames for
notification(s).
