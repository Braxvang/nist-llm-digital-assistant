information are unlikely to have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, the exceptions
can have catastrophic consequences.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The consequences of unauthorized
disclosure of citizen protection information could be severe. If detailed intelligence information
regarding a planned terrorist act was disclosed, the terrorists might succeed in countering the
protection measures and carry out a devastating attack. The confidentiality impacts associated
with information concerning defensive dispositions would be high. While the adverse effects of
unauthorized disclosure of some citizen protection information on law enforcement operations,
assets, and individuals are limited; the stakes are usually higher. Federal citizen protection
activities often seek to protect the public against life-threatening situations or against loss of
major assets.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most citizen protection information is moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of citizen protection information may
pose a potential threat to public safety particularly if the protective measures are compromised.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In some cases (e.g., terrorist threats),
unauthorized modification or destruction of citizen protection information can result in loss of
human life - a high-impact potential.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
citizen protection information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to citizen protection information. Many
citizen protection missions are usually tolerant of reasonable delays. Most criminal activity
against citizen protection information is not life threatening but can result in serious property
loss.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Emergency situations or elevated
terrorist threat conditions are not tolerant of delays. Where systems support time-sensitive
operations for life-threatening situations, the availability impact level for citizen protection
information is high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: In the case of most systems that support delivery of citizen
protection services, the provisional availability impact level recommended for citizen protection
information is moderate.
