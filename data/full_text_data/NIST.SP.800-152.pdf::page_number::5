SP 800-152                                                    A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS



Executive Summary
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cryptographic Key Management
project covers major aspects of managing the cryptographic keys that protect sensitive,
unclassified federal information. Associated with each key is specific information (e.g., the
identifier associated with its owner, its length, and acceptable uses) called metadata. The
computers, software, modules, communications, and roles assumed by one or more authorized
individuals when managing and using cryptographic key management services are collectively
called a Cryptographic Key Management System (CKMS).

This Profile for U. S. Federal Cryptographic Key Management Systems (FCKMSs) has been
prepared to assist CKMS designers and implementers in selecting the features to be provided in
their “products,” and to assist federal organizations and their contractors when procuring,
installing, configuring, operating, and using FCKMSs. Other organizations may use this Profile
as desired.

An FCKMS can be owned and operated by a federal organization or by a private contractor that
provides key management services for federal organizations or other contractors performing
federal information-processing services.

This Profile can also be used by agencies and organizations to understand their FCKMSs, and to
adopt, adapt and migrate their FCKMSs to comply with the Profile requirements over time.
NIST does not expect that these requirements would be implemented immediately, but that
agencies would use these requirements when creating or procuring FCKMSs or FCKMS services
for their Enterprise Architectures.

This Profile is based on NIST Special Publication 800-130, A Framework for Designing
Cryptographic Key Management Systems. The Framework specifies topics that should be
considered by a CKMS designer when selecting the capabilities that a CKMS will have and the
cryptographic key management services it will support. This Profile replicates all of the
Framework requirements that must be satisfied in a CKMS and its design documentation, and
includes additional information about installing, configuring, operating and maintaining an
FCKMS.

The Framework and this Profile could be used by other organizations that have security
requirements similar to those specified in these documents or could be used as a model for the
development of other profiles.
