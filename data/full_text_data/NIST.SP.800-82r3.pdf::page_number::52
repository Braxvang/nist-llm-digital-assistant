       far beyond the systems that sustain direct and physical damage. These effects could
       negatively impact the local, regional, national, or possibly global economy.
   •   Social impacts. Another second-order effect is the loss of national or public confidence
       in an organization.
Additional examples of the potential consequences of an OT incident are listed below. Note that
items in this list are not independent. For example, the release of hazardous material could lead
to injury or death.
   •   Impact on national security (e.g., facilitate an act of terrorism)
   •   Reduction or loss of production at one site or multiple sites simultaneously
   •   Injury or death of employees
   •   Injury or death of persons in the community
   •   Damage to equipment
   •   Release, diversion, or theft of hazardous materials
   •   Environmental damage
   •   Violation of regulatory requirements
   •   Product contamination
   •   Criminal or civil legal liabilities
   •   Loss of proprietary or confidential information
   •   Loss of brand image or customer confidence
Safety and security incidents can have negative impacts that last longer than other types of
incidents on all stakeholders, including employees, shareholders, customers, and the
communities in which an organization operates. Senior management should identify and evaluate
the highest priority items to estimate the annual business impact (e.g., in financial terms).

3.2.2. Building an OT Cybersecurity Business Case
A well-defined business case for an OT cybersecurity program is essential for management buy-
in to ensure the long-term commitment of the organization and the allocation of resources needed
for the development, implementation, and maintenance of the program. The first step in
developing an OT security program is to identify the organization’s business objectives and
missions, as well as how the cybersecurity program can lower risk and protect the organization’s
ability to perform those objectives and missions. The business case should capture the business
concerns of senior management and provide the business impact and financial justification for
creating an integrated organizational cybersecurity program. It should include detailed
information about the following:
   •   Benefits of creating an integrated security program
   •   Potential costs and failure scenarios if an OT cybersecurity program is not implemented
