CHAPTER 5                                            Capital Planning and Investment Control


    NIST SP 800-55, Security Metrics Guide for Information Technology Systems,
provides guidance on developing and implementing an information security metrics
program. Metrics can provide baseline compliance percentages that indicate the
existence of adequate security controls, highlight current weaknesses, and identify
gaps between actual and desired implementation status of information security
controls. The goal of the security baseline establishment exercise is to provide
agency officials an understanding of the strengths, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities
that exist within the agency’s security controls and to help identify investments that
are required to mitigate weaknesses. The resulting vulnerabilities and weaknesses
then serve as inputs into the next step of the CPIC process: identifying prioritization
criteria.

5.5 Identify Prioritization Criteria
    Available funding does not always allow all security needs identified in the
baseline assessment to be addressed immediately. Therefore, requirements must be
prioritized to address the most pressing security investment needs first. Specific
prioritization criteria will vary from agency to agency depending on specific agency
mission and goals and applicable legislation and regulations. Examples of
information security priorities include:
       • Complying with statutory requirements in Clinger-Cohen Act, FISMA, and OMB
         Circular A-130 guidance;
       • Implementing a risk-based security program (FISMA, Executive Orders, and
         supporting NIST standards and guidance); for example, implementing the
         security controls outlined in NIST SP 800-53;
       • Safeguarding national and agency mission-critical assets (Homeland Security
         Presidential Directives);
       • Improving information security program status; and
       • Completing a security certification and accreditation of all systems in
         accordance with NIST SP 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and
         Accreditation of Federal Information Systems.
   A variety of taxonomies can be used to organize prioritization criteria, including
FIPS 200 security control families or other agency-specific categories.

5.6 Conduct System- and Enterprise-Level Prioritization 38
    Once agency management and stakeholders agree on the prioritization of
investments, the agency can begin the prioritizing process by rank-ordering
requirements against the prioritization criteria. The objective of this activity is to
fund first the most critical security investment. The next layer of funding should
then be applied to the next critical security investment and so forth, until the
security budget is entirely expended, or priorities met, whichever comes first.
   Before conducting corrective action prioritization, the agency should allocate the
funding necessary to mitigate significant deficiencies and other needs that obviously
require attention. These initiatives should then be removed from the prioritization
process to avoid duplication of effort.
    After identifying the security baseline and prioritization criteria, an agency can
prioritize corrective actions at two levels:
