1099       RBG1 Constructions Based on RBGs with Physical Entropy Sources
1100   An RBG1 construction provides a source of cryptographic random bits from a device that has no
1101   internal randomness source. Its security depends entirely on being instantiated securely from an
1102   RBG with access to a physical entropy source that resides outside of the device.
1103   An RBG1 construction is instantiated (i.e., seeded) only once before its first use by an RBG2(P)
1104   construction (see Section 5) or an RBG3 construction (see Section 6). Since a randomness source
1105   is not available after DRBG instantiation, an RBG1 construction cannot be reseeded and, therefore,
1106   cannot provide prediction resistance.
1107   An RBG1 construction may be useful for constrained devices in which an entropy source cannot
1108   be implemented or in any device in which access to a suitable source of randomness is not available
1109   after instantiation. Since an RBG1 construction cannot be reseeded, the use of the DRBG is limited
1110   to the DRBGâ€™s seedlife (see [SP800-90A]).
1111   Subordinate DRBGs (sub-DRBGs) may be used within the security boundary of an RBG1
1112   construction (see Section 4.3). The use of one or more sub-DRBGs may be useful for
1113   implementations that use flash memory, such as when the number of write operations to the
1114   memory is limited (resulting in short device lifetimes) or when there is a need to use different
1115   DRBG instantiations for different purposes. The RBG1 construction is the source of the
1116   randomness that is used to (optionally) instantiate one or more sub-DRBGs. Each sub-DRBG is a
1117   DRBG specified in SP 800-90A and is intended to be used for a limited time and a limited purpose.
1118   A sub-DRBG is, in fact, a different instantiation of the DRBG design implemented within the
1119   RBG1 construction (see Section 2.4.1).

1120           RBG1 Description
1121   As shown in Figure 12, an RBG1 construction consists of a DRBG contained within a DRBG
1122   security boundary in one cryptographic module and an RBG (serving as a randomness source)
1123   contained within a separate cryptographic module from that of the RBG1 construction. Note that
1124   the required health tests are not shown in the figure.
