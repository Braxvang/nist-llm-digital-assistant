    instance, if a specific product manufacturer provides software patches monthly, an
    organization might consider conducting vulnerability scans on that product at least that often.
•   Risk assessment results. Results from organizational and/or system-specific assessments of
    risk (either formal or informal) are examined and taken into consideration when establishing
    monitoring frequencies. For instance, if a system-specific risk assessment identifies potential
    threats and vulnerabilities related to nonlocal maintenance (NIST SP 800-53, MA-4), the
    organization considers more frequent monitoring of the records kept on nonlocal maintenance
    and diagnostic activities. If a risk scoring scheme is in place at the organization, the risk
    scores may be used as justification to increase or decrease the monitoring frequencies of
    related controls.
•   Output of monitoring strategy reviews. Review and adjustment of the monitoring strategy
    is covered in detail in Section 3.6.

•   Reporting requirements. Reporting requirements do not drive the ISCM strategy but may
    play a role in the frequency of monitoring. For instance, if OMB policy requires quarterly
    reports on the number of unauthorized components detected and corrective actions taken, the
    organization would monitor the system for unauthorized components at least quarterly.
Organizations focus on obtaining the data required at the determined frequencies and deploy their
human and capitol resources accordingly. As automation capability or resources are added,
organizations may consider increasing affected monitoring frequencies. Similarly, if resource
availability decreases, the organization considers adjusting affected monitoring frequencies to
ensure that security-related information is appropriately analyzed while continuing to meet
organizational risk management requirements.

Many security controls in the NIST SP 800-53 catalog have multiple implementation
requirements along with control enhancements that may also have multiple implementation
requirements. It may be necessary to assess or monitor individual control requirements and/or
control enhancements within a given control with differing frequencies. For instance, the control
AC-2, Account Management, has ten separate requirements (a. through j.) within the base control
and four control enhancements [(1) through (4)]. The monitoring frequency may vary for each
requirement in accordance with the considerations discussed. For example, AC-2a involves the
identification of account types. For a typical information system, once the account types have
been identified and documented, they are not likely to change very often. For this reason, AC-2a
is a candidate for relatively infrequent assessment. AC-2h involves the deactivation of temporary
accounts and accounts of terminated or transferred users. Since personnel regularly come and go,
a typical organization would most likely assess AC-2h on a more frequent basis than AC-2a. AC-
2 (3) requires that the system automatically disable accounts after a specified time period of
inactivity. As an automated control and one with typically high volatility, AC-2 (3) is a candidate
for relatively frequent monitoring and also may serve to automate some of the base control
requirements so that they can be monitored more frequently in accordance with the organizational
ISCM strategy.
