                                       GUIDE TO MALWARE INCIDENT PREVENTION AND HANDLING FOR DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS


1.      Introduction

1.1     Purpose and Scope

This publication is intended to help a wide variety of organizations understand the threats posed by
malware and mitigate the risks associated with malware incidents. In addition to providing background
information on the major categories of malware, it provides practical, real-world guidance on preventing
malware incidents and responding to malware incidents in an effective, efficient manner. The information
presented in this publication is intended to be used as data points entered into a much larger risk
management process. See the latest version of NIST SP 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk Management
Framework to Federal Information Systems for information on the basics of risk management. 1

This publication is based on the assumption that the organization already has a general incident response
program and capability in place. See the latest version of NIST SP 800-61, Computer Security Incident
Handling Guide for more information on general incident response.2 NIST SP 800-61 serves as the
foundation for this publication.

1.2     Audience

This document has been created for computer security staff and program managers, technical support staff
and managers, computer security incident response teams, and system and network administrators, who
are responsible for preventing, preparing for, or responding to malware incidents.

1.3     Document Structure

The remainder of this guide is divided into three major sections. Section 2 defines, discusses, and
compares the various categories of malware. Section 3 provides recommendations for preventing malware
incidents through several layers of controls. Section 4 explains the malware incident response process,
focusing on practical strategies for detection, containment, eradication, and recovery.

The guide also contains several appendices with supporting material. Appendices A and B contain a
glossary and an acronym list, respectively. Appendix C lists resources that can help readers gain a better
understanding of malware, malware incident prevention, and malware incident handling.
