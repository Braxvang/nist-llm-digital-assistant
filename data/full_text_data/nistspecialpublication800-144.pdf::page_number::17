3.      Public Cloud Services
The outlook on cloud computing services can vary significantly among organizations, because of
inherent differences in such things as the intended purpose, assets held, legal obligations,
exposure to the public, threats faced, and tolerance to risk. For example, a government
organization that predominantly handles data about individual citizens of the country has
different privacy and security objectives from a government organization that does not.
Similarly, the security objectives of a government organization that prepares and disseminates
information for public consumption are different from one that deals mainly with classified
information for its own internal use. From a risk perspective, determining the suitability of cloud
services for an organization is not possible without understanding the context in which the
organization operates and the consequences from the plausible threats it faces.

The set of security and privacy objectives of an organization, therefore, is a key factor for
decisions about outsourcing information technology services and, in particular, for decisions
about transitioning organizational resources to a public cloud and a specific provider’s services
and service arrangements. What works for one organization may not necessarily work for
another. In addition, practical considerations apply—most organizations cannot afford
financially to protect all computational resources and assets at the highest degree possible and
must prioritize available options based on cost as well as criticality and sensitivity. When
considering the potential benefits of public cloud computing, it is important to keep the
organizational security and privacy objectives in mind and to act accordingly. Ultimately, a
decision on cloud computing rests on a risk analysis of the tradeoffs involved.2

3.1     Service Agreements
Specifications for public cloud services and service arrangements are generally called service
agreements or service contracts. A service agreement defines the terms and conditions for access
and use of the services offered by the cloud provider. It also establishes the period of service,
conditions for termination, and disposition of data (e.g., preservation period) upon termination.
The complete terms and conditions for a cloud service agreement are usually stipulated in
multiple documents, which can typically include a Service Level Agreement (SLA), privacy
policy, acceptable use policy, and terms of use [Bra10]. An SLA represents the understanding
between the cloud consumer and cloud provider about the expected level of service to be
delivered and, in the event that the provider fails to deliver the service at the level specified, the
compensation available to the cloud consumer. The privacy policy documents information
handling practices and the way consumer information is collected, used, and managed by the
cloud provider, while the acceptable use policy identifies prohibited behaviors by cloud
consumers. The terms of use cover other important details such as licensing of services,
