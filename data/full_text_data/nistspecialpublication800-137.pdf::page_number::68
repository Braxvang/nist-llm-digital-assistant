threats of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security
practices. Intrusion prevention is the process of performing intrusion detection and attempting to
stop possible incidents as they are detected. Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSs) 48
are focused primarily on identifying possible incidents, logging information about them,
attempting to stop them, and reporting them to security administrators for further analysis and
action.

IDPSs typically are used to record information related to observed events, notify security
administrators of important observed events, and automatically generate reports, with remediation
actions performed manually after human review of the report. Many IDPSs can also be
configured to respond to a detected threat using a variety of techniques, including changing
security configurations or blocking the attack.

Within the context of an ISCM program, IDPSs can be used to supply evidence of the
effectiveness of security controls (e.g., policies, procedures, and other implemented technical
controls), document existing threats, and deter unauthorized use of information systems. The
implementation and effective use of IDPSs can also assist organizations in automating the
implementation, assessment, and continuous monitoring of several NIST SP 800-53 security
controls including AC-4, Information Flow Enforcement; AC-17, Remote Access; AC-18,
Wireless Access; AU-2, Auditable Events; AU-6, Audit Review, Analysis, and Reporting; AU-
12, Audit Generation; AU-13, Monitoring for Information Disclosure; CA-2, Security
Assessments; CA-7, Continuous Monitoring; IR-5, Incident Monitoring; RA-3, Risk Assessment;
SC-7, Boundary Protection; SI-3, Malicious Code Protection; SI-4, Information System
Monitoring; and SI-7, Software and Information Integrity. IDPSs may also provide supporting
data to assist organizations in meeting US-CERT incident reporting requirements and in
responding to OMB and agency CIO reporting requirements in the areas of system and
connections inventory, security incident management, boundary protections, and configuration
management.

D.1.3 MALWARE DETECTION
Malware detection49 provides the ability to identify and report on the presence of viruses, Trojan
horses, spyware, or other malicious code on or destined for a target system. Organizations
typically employ malware detection mechanisms at information system entry and exit points (e.g.,
firewalls, email servers, Web servers, proxy servers, remote access servers) and at endpoint
devices (e.g., workstations, servers, mobile computing devices) on the network to detect and
remove malicious code transported by electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, Web accesses,
removable media or other means, or inserted through the exploitation of information system
vulnerabilities.

Malware detection mechanisms can be configured to perform periodic scans of information
systems, as well as real-time scans of files from external sources as the files are downloaded,
opened, or executed in accordance with organizational security policy. Malware detection
mechanisms can frequently take a predetermined action in response to malicious code detection.
