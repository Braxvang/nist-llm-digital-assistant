Special Publication 800-157                                                              Guidelines for Derived PIV Credentials


           The token containing the private key corresponding to the Derived PIV Credential is transferred
            to another individual, including when a mobile device with an embedded cryptographic module is
            transferred to another individual.

           The department or agency that issued the credential determines that the Subscriber is no longer
            eligible to have a PIV Card (i.e., PIV Card is terminated7).

           The department or agency that issued the credential determines that the Subscriber no longer
            requires a Derived PIV Credential, even if the Subscriber’s PIV Card is not being terminated.
            This may happen, for example, when the Subscriber’s role in the agency changes such that he/she
            no longer has the need to access agency resources from a mobile device using a Derived PIV
            Credential.

If the Derived PIV Authentication private key was created and stored on a hardware cryptographic token
that does not permit export of the private key and the token was collected and either zeroized or
destroyed, then revocation of the Derived PIV Authentication certificate is optional. In all other cases,
revocation of the Derived PIV Authentication certificate is mandatory.
The Derived PIV Credential is unaffected when the Subscriber replaces his/her PIV Card (reissuance)
with a new PIV Card, including when the PIV Card is lost, stolen, or damaged.8,9 The ability to use the
Derived PIV Credential is especially useful in such circumstances because the PIV Card is unavailable,
yet, while waiting to be issued a new PIV Card, the Subscriber is able to use the Derived PIV Credential
to gain logical access to remote Federally controlled information systems from his/her mobile device.
Similarly, the Derived PIV Credential is not necessarily affected by the revocation of the PIV
Authentication certificate. Some maintenance activities for the Subscriber’s PIV Card may trigger
corresponding maintenance activities for the Derived PIV Credential, since the Derived PIV Credential
will need to be reissued if any information about the Subscriber that appears in the credential changes. For
example, if the Subscriber’s PIV Card is reissued as a result of the Subscriber’s name changing and the
Subscriber’s name appears in the Derived PIV Authentication certificate, a new Derived PIV
Authentication certificate with the new name will also need to be issued.

2.4        Linkage with PIV Card

A Derived PIV Credential issuer shall only issue a Derived PIV Credential to an Applicant if it has access
to information about the Applicant’s PIV Card from the issuer of the PIV Card. In particular the Derived
PIV Credential issuer shall have a mechanism to periodically check with the PIV Card issuer to determine
if the PIV Card has been terminated or if information about the individual that will appear in the Derived
PIV Credential (e.g., name) has changed, as these would require revocation or modification of the
Derived PIV Credential.

Section 2.9.4 of FIPS 201-2 requires PIV Card termination to be performed within 18 hours for cases
where the PIV card cannot be collected. To maintain up-to-date status of the PIV Card, it is recommended
that a Derived PIV Credential issuer check every 18 hours on the termination status. The periodic
checking requirement can also be met if: 1) a notification mechanism is in place between the PIV Card
issuer and Derived PIV Credential issuer or 2) the PIV Card record and the Derived PIV Credential

7 Section 2.9.4 of [FIPS201] provides a list of circumstances that require PIV Card termination.
8 Departments and agencies may adopt a more stringent approach and revoke any Derived PIV Credential when the associated

    PIV Card is being replaced.
9
    In the case of a lost or stolen PIV Card there is the risk that the PIV Card could be used to obtain a fraudulently issued Derived
    PIV Credential. If the issuer of the PIV Card also issues Derived PIV Credentials then when a PIV Card is reported lost or
    stolen the issuer should investigate whether any fraudulent Derived PIV Credentials might have been issued.
