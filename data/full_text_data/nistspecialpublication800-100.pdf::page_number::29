    Once these tasks have been completed and a need has been recognized for a
new or enhanced IT product or service, several processes must take place before the
project is approved, to include clearly defining project goals and defining high-level
information security requirements. Typically, during this phase, the organization
defines high-level information security policy requirements as well as the enterprise
security system architecture.

3.2 Development/Acquisition Phase
    During this phase, the system is designed, purchased, programmed, developed,
or otherwise constructed. This phase often consists of other defined cycles, such as
the system development cycle or the acquisition cycle.
    During the first part of the development/acquisition phase, the organization
should simultaneously define the systemâ€™s security and functional requirements.
These requirements can be expressed as technical features (e.g., access control),
assurances (e.g., background checks for system developers), or operational practices
(e.g., awareness and training). During the last part of this phase, the organization
should perform developmental testing of the technical and security
features/functions to ensure that they perform as intended prior to launching the
implementation and integration phase.

3.3 Implementation Phase
    In the implementation phase, the organization configures and enables system
security features, tests the functionality of these features, installs or implements the
system, and finally, obtains a formal authorization to operate the system. Design
reviews and system tests should be performed before placing the system into
