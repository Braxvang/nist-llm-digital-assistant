                                                                                                 properly, and weaken the computer’s security. When enabling a firewall, teleworkers should verify that
                                                                                                 the firewall’s functionality is enabled for every network interface on the PC, including VPNs and wired,

                                                                                                 Many personal firewalls offer additional security features. For example, some firewalls offer the ability to

                                                                                                 protects the configuration from being inadvertently or purposely altered by a user.

                                                                                                 Teleworkers should be aware that most firewalls are frequently stopping unwanted activity. For example,

                                                                                                 notices from their firewall that indicate that incoming connections were blocked or that a specific attack
