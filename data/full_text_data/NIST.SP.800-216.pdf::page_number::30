NIST SP 800-216                                                                  Federal Vulnerability
May 2023                                                                         Disclosure Guidelines

3.2.5.4.          Oversight and Support for the Remediation of Verified Vulnerabilities
Once the vulnerability has been verified, the VDPO will ensure that the system owner has
mitigated or remediated the discovered vulnerability. As with the verification step, if the VDPO
or an associated FCB member has technical resources to assist with vulnerability remediation,
they may be deployed upon request by the system owner.
In some cases, it may be effective to develop short-term mitigations (e.g., recommended
configuration changes) to be followed by more thorough mitigations or a remediation. A
mitigation or remediation approach may involve a patch, fix, upgrade, or configuration change to
reduce exploitation of the vulnerability and should include appropriate documentation. A series
of early communications may be necessary to alert the user base while the full solution is being
developed and tested for all of the affected platforms and services. Subsequent monitoring and
testing will also be needed to ensure that the solution resolved the vulnerability issue in a manner
acceptable to stakeholders without impacting the productâ€™s functionality or introducing new
vulnerabilities. The VDPO should ensure that lessons learned are incorporated into the
development process to reduce future vulnerabilities.
The VDPO should also notify the FCB if a vulnerability is found in an information system,
product, or service used by others (e.g., other agencies, organizations, or the general public).
Remediating such vulnerabilities typically requires the involvement of the product or service
owner (e.g., vendor, supplier, provider) to produce and distribute a patch or update. VDPOs may
also notify the product or service owner directly through existing support channels. In turn, the
product or service owner should assist stakeholders in dealing with vulnerabilities until a product
has reached the end of service. If the product or service owner chooses not to remediate all
supported versions, a reasonable upgrade path to a version that has remediations should be
provided.
After the vulnerability remediation release, monitoring of the stability of the product or service
should continue. The responsible VDPO should update remediations as appropriate until further
updates are no longer needed. The information gained during the root cause analysis should be
used to update development life cycle elements to prevent similar vulnerabilities in new or
updated products or services.
Proposed remediations and communications may need consultation from legal review to ensure
that the responsible agency complies with internal policies, laws, and existing contracts.

3.2.5.5.          Publication of Vulnerability Advisories
Section 2.7 provides guidance on whether or not an advisory should be produced for a
remediated vulnerability. The owner of the system that contained the vulnerability should make
the determination in coordination with the VDPO. If the vulnerability involves multiple
government systems (e.g., because they all used the same vulnerable library), then the applicable
FCB member should make the decision. Advisories published only to the users of a system can
be made at the system level with the support of the VDPO. Public advisories should be made
using an established FCB advisory service. Advisories that only target the user base of a system
might be made by the system owner within the system itself (coordinated with the VDPO to
whom that system is assigned).
