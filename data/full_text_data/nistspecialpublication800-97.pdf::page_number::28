ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



gain physical access to the LAN or remotely compromise systems on the LAN; in a wireless LAN, an
attacker simply needs to be within range of the WLAN infrastructure. In addition, an attacker can have
the advantage of using highly sensitive directional antennas, which can greatly extend the effective range
of the wireless LAN beyond the standardized range.

     Threat Category                                                    Description
 Denial of Service           Attacker prevents or prohibits the normal use or management of networks or network
                             devices.
 Eavesdropping               Attacker passively monitors network communications for data, including authentication
                             credentials.
 Man-in-the-Middle           Attacker actively intercepts the path of communications between two legitimate parties,
                             thereby obtaining authentication credentials and data. Attacker can then masquerade as
                             a legitimate party. In the context of a WLAN, a man-in-the-middle attack can be achieved
                             through a bogus or rogue AP, which looks like an authorized AP to legitimate parties.
 Masquerading                Attacker impersonates an authorized user and gains certain unauthorized privileges.
 Message Modification        Attacker alters a legitimate message by deleting, adding to, changing, or reordering it.
 Message Replay              Attacker passively monitors transmissions and retransmits messages, acting as if the
                             attacker were a legitimate user.
 Traffic Analysis            Attacker passively monitors transmissions to identify communication patterns and
                             participants.




3.2     History of Pre-RSN IEEE 802.11 Security

Prior to the IEEE 802.11i amendment and its RSN framework, IEEE 802.11 had a number of serious
security weaknesses. 15 Many vendors have added proprietary features to their IEEE 802.11
implementations to compensate for security flaws in the standard, but proprietary features often prevent
interoperability. This section explains pre-RSN security features and shortcomings as a basis for
understanding the motivation behind RSN. Sections 3.2.1 through 3.2.5 discuss pre-RSN IEEE 802.11
access control and authentication, encryption, data integrity, replay protection, and availability,
respectively.

3.2.1     Access Control and Authentication

The original IEEE 802.11 specification defines two means to validate the identities of wireless devices
attempting to gain access to a WLAN, open system authentication and shared key authentication; neither
of these alternatives is secure. 16 IEEE 802.11 implementations are required to support open system
authentication; shared key authentication support is optional. Open system authentication is effectively a
null authentication mechanism that does not provide true identity verification. In practice, a STA is
authenticated to an AP simply by providing the following information:



15
      Also, many pre-RSN IEEE 802.11 products have security features disabled by default, so they provide little or no protection
      for wireless communication until they are reconfigured.
16
      The shared key authentication scheme based on a unilateral challenge-response mechanism is typically referred to as WEP
      because it uses the WEP encryption for response computation. However, shared key authentication is actually a simple
      authentication scheme independent of WEP. Also, it does not work. WEP encrypts the response by XORing the challenge
      with a pseudo-random key stream generated using a WEP key. The attacker can XOR the challenge and the response to
      expose the key stream, which can subsequently be used to authenticate.
