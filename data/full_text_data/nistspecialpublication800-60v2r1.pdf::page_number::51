Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction of
information affecting external communications that tax and fiscal policy information (e.g., web
pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but
the damage to the mission would usually be limited. Public confidence consequences will be
more serious for agencies that have national defense, intelligence, or information security
missions. In such cases, the impact may be at least moderate.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for tax
and fiscal policy information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to tax and fiscal policy information. Tax
and fiscal policy processes are usually tolerant of delays.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended tax
and fiscal policy information is low.

C.2.4 Internal Risk Management and Mitigation

Internal risk management and mitigation involves all activities relating to the processes of
analyzing exposure to risk and determining appropriate counter-measures. Note that risks to
information and information systems associated with internal risk management and
mitigation activities may inherently affect the resistance to compromise/damage and recovery
from damage with respect to a broad range of critical infrastructures and key national assets.
C.2.4.1 Contingency Planning Information Type

Contingency planning involves the actions required to plan for, respond to, and mitigate
damaging events. The recommended provisional security categorization for the contingency
planning information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Moderate)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of contingency planning
information on the ability of responsible agencies to plan for, respond to, and mitigate damaging
events. Unauthorized disclosure of contingency planning information may equip an adversary
with the information necessary to attack a system so that recovery is impaired.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of
background information that supports development of Federal contingency plans can reveal
sensitive vulnerabilities, capabilities, intelligence assessments, intelligence sources, or methods
employed in anti-terrorism, law enforcement, or national security activities. Depending on the
information in question, the confidentiality impact can be moderate, high, or involve national
security information (outside the scope of this guideline). Also, some contingency plans are
themselves national security information. However, the purpose of most contingency planning
information is to protect against inadvertent or accidental damaging events rather than against
