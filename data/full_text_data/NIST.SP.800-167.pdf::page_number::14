     Anti-malware technology integration; for example, attempting to identify known malicious content by
      running graylisted files through an online scanner with many antivirus scanning engines or other
      types of malware analysis products. Malware analysis products can inform application whitelisting
      decision making processes.
2.5     Operational Environment Differences

As discussed in NIST SP 800-70 Revision 2, National Checklist Program for IT Products—Guidelines
for Checklist Users and Developers,8 there are significant differences among operational environments.
These differences are important in terms of selecting and deploying application whitelisting technologies.
The major categories of operational environments are as follows:

     Standalone. Also referred to as Small Office/Home Office (SOHO), a Standalone environment
      refers to a small, informal computer installation that is used for home or business purposes. For
      technical and business (economic) reasons, Standalone environment hosts are generally not managed
      remotely. Standalone environments are typically the least secured.
     Managed. The Managed environment, also called an Enterprise environment, typically contains
      large organizational systems with defined suites of hardware and software configurations, usually
      consisting of centrally managed IT products (e.g., workstations and servers). The managed nature of
      these environments gives administrators centralized control over various settings on IT products.
      Because of the supported and largely homogeneous nature of the Managed environment, it is typically
      easier to use more functionally restrictive settings in Managed environments than in Standalone
      environments.
     Specialized Security-Limited Functionality (Custom). A Custom environment contains systems in
      which the functionality and degree of security do not fit the Standalone or Managed environments.
      Specialized Security-Limited Functionality (SSLF) is a Custom environment that is highly restrictive
      and secure; it is usually reserved for hosts that have the highest threats and associated impacts.
      Because hosts in an SSLF environment are at high risk of attack or data exposure, security takes high
      precedence over functionality.
2.6     Evaluating Application Whitelisting Solutions

The first step in evaluating the possibility of deploying an application whitelisting solution should be an
analysis of the environment or environments in which the hosts will be running. Generally it is not
feasible to implement whitelisting on Standalone environment hosts because of the lack of centralized
management. Application whitelisting solutions are generally strongly recommended for hosts in SSLF
environments because of the high risks that they face. Suitability for Managed environments depends on
how tightly the hosts are managed and the extent of the risks that they face; organizations considering
application whitelisting deployment in a Managed environment should perform a risk assessment to
determine whether the security benefits provided by application whitelisting outweigh its possible
negative impact on operations. Organizations should also be mindful that they will need dedicated staff
managing and maintaining the application whitelisting solution, similar to handling an enterprise antivirus
or intrusion detection solution.

Once it has been determined that application whitelisting technologies are merited for a particular
environment, the next step is to consider which technologies might be feasible. Organizations should
consider application whitelisting technologies already built into the operating system, particularly for
centrally managed hosts (e.g., desktops, laptops, servers), because of the relative ease and minimal
