CHAPTER 3                                                             System Development Life Cycle


clearing, purging, and destroying. 21 Because different kinds of sanitization provide
different levels of information protection, organizations should use information
security requirements as a guide for selecting the sanitization method that best suits
their needs.

3.6 Security Activities within the SDLC
    Security activities must be integrated into the SDLC to ensure proper
identification, design, integration, and maintenance of applicable security controls
throughout an information system’s life cycle as summarized in Table 3-1.

                             Table 3-1. Security Activities in the SDLC

  SDLC Activities                                  Security Activities and Definitions
A. Initiation Phase
Needs                   Define a problem that might be solved through product acquisition. Traditional components
Determination            of needs determination are establishing a basic system idea, defining preliminary
                         requirements, assessing feasibility, assessing technology, and identifying a form of approval
                         to further investigate the problem.
                        Establish and document need and purpose of the system.
Security                Identify information that will be transmitted, processed, or stored by the system and define
Categorization           applicable levels of information categorization according to NIST SP 800-60 and FIPS
                         199. 22 The handling and safeguarding of personally identifiable information should be
                         considered.
Preliminary Risk        Establish an initial description of the basic security needs of the system. A preliminary risk
Assessment 23            assessment should define the threat environment in which the system or product will operate.

B. Development/Acquisition Phase
Requirements            Conduct a more in-depth study of the need that draws on and further develops the work
Analysis/                performed during the initiation phase.
Development             Develop and incorporate security requirements into specifications.
                        Analyze functional requirements that may include system security environment (e.g.,
                         enterprise information security policy and enterprise security architecture) and security
                         functional requirements.
                        Analyze assurance requirements that address the acquisition and product integration
                         activities required and assurance evidence needed to produce the desired level of confidence
                         that the product will provide required information security features correctly and effectively.
                         The analysis, based on legal, regulatory, protection, and functional security requirements, will
                         be used as the basis for determining how much and what kinds of assurance are required.
Risk Assessment 24      Conduct formal risk assessment to identify system protection requirements. This analysis
                         builds on the initial risk assessment performed during the initiation phase, but will be more in-
                         depth and specific. Security categories derived from FIPS 199 are typically considered during
                         the risk assessment process to help guide the initial selection of security controls for an
                         information system.
