Figure 2 shows the components and general configuration of a SCADA system. The control
center at the top of the diagram houses a control server and the communications routers. Other
control center components include the HMI, engineering workstations, and the data historian,
which are all connected by a local area network (LAN). The control center collects and logs
information gathered by the field sites, displays information to the HMI, and may generate
actions based on detected events. The control center is also responsible for centralized alarming,
trend analyses, and reporting.
The field sites at the bottom of Fig. 2 locally control actuators and monitor sensors. Field sites
are often equipped with a remote access capability to allow operators to perform remote
diagnostics and repairs, usually over a separate dial-up modem or wide area network (WAN)
connection. Standard and proprietary communication protocols that run over serial and network
communications are used to transport information between the control center and field sites
using telemetry techniques, such as telephone line, cable, fiber, and radio frequencies (e.g.,
broadcast, microwave, satellite).
