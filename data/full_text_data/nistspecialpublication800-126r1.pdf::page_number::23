                  The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1




For example:

<Rule id="security_patches_up_to_date" selected="false">
   <title>Security Patches Up-To-Date</title>
   <description>Keep systems up to current patch levels</description>
   <check system="http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5">
      <check-content-ref href="scap-win2000-patches.xml"/>
   </check>
</Rule>

3.2.6.5 CVSS Scores

SCAP 1.0 required the inclusion of static CVSS scores in XCCDF vulnerability-related rules. However,
CVSS base scores sometimes change over time, such as when more information is available about a
particular vulnerability, and CVSS temporal and environmental scores are intended to change to reflect
current threats, security controls, and other factors. Current CVSS scores acquired dynamically, such as
from a data feed, SHOULD be used in place of static CVSS scores in the @weight attribute within
XCCDF vulnerability-related rules. Section 3.8 contains additional requirements for CVSS usage.

3.3     Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL)

While the default version17 of OVAL used in SCAP 1.1 SHALL be OVAL version 5.8, content authors
SHOULD utilize the earliest SCAP-supported version of OVAL (5.3 at minimum) that includes all
required tests and is necessary to properly address the content's purpose or use case. This approach, often
referred to as the ―least-version-principle‖, allows for SCAP content to remain viable over a longer period
of time by allowing for the broadest support within products, while reducing the content maintenance
burden that would be required to maintain revisions of content for multiple specification versions.

All of the OVAL content MUST contain an <oval:generator> element. The version of any
particular document instance SHALL be specified using the <oval:schema_version> content
element of the <oval:generator> as in this example:

     <oval:generator>
       <oval:product_name>The OVAL Repository</oval:product_name>
       <oval:schema_version>5.8</oval:schema_version>
     </oval:generator>

The version of an <oval-var:oval_variables> document SHALL be the same as that of the
<oval-def:oval_definitions> document whose external variables are bound by the variables
document.

The following requirements apply to particular classes of OVAL definitions:

      1. For compliance class definitions:
          a. If an OVAL compliance class definition maps to one or more CCE identifiers, the definition
             SHOULD include <oval-def:reference> elements that reference those identifiers
             using the following format:
