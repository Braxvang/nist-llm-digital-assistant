      NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                       Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
      November 2023

160           DISCUSSION
161           This requirement focuses on account management for systems and applications. The definition
162           and enforcement of access authorizations other than those determined by account type (e.g.,
163           privileged access, non-privileged access) are addressed in requirement 03.01.02. System account
164           types include individual, group, temporary, system, guest, anonymous, emergency, developer,
165           and service. Users who require administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional
166           scrutiny by organizational personnel responsible for approving such accounts and privileged
167           access. Types of accounts that organizations may prohibit due to increased risk include group,
168           emergency, guest, anonymous, and temporary.
169           Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, type of
170           account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include
171           restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes,
172           organizations consider system requirements (e.g., system upgrades, scheduled maintenance) and
173           mission and business requirements (e.g., time zone differences, remote access to facilitate travel
174           requirements).
175           Users who pose a significant security risk include individuals for whom reliable evidence
176           indicates either the intention to use authorized access to the system to cause harm or that
177           adversaries will cause harm through them. Close coordination among human resource managers,
178           mission/business owners, system administrators, and legal staff is essential when disabling
179           system accounts for high-risk individuals. Time periods for the notification of organizational
180           personnel or roles may vary.

186   3.1.2. Access Enforcement
187           REQUIREMENT: 03.01.02
188           Enforce approved authorizations for logical access to CUI and system resources.

189           DISCUSSION
190           Access control policies control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or system
191           processes acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (i.e., devices, files, records,
192           domains) in organizational systems. Types of system access include remote access and access to
193           systems that communicate through external networks, such as the internet. Access enforcement
194           mechanisms can also be employed at the application and service levels to provide increased
195           protection for CUI. This recognizes that the system can host many applications and services in
196           support of mission and business functions.
