   5. For citizen-to-government applications with limited security requirements (e.g.
      Level 2 e-Authentication requirements as specified in [OMB 04-04]) and high
      interoperability requirements, agency applications may use the pre-installed trust
      anchors provided in COTS products.

   6. Path validation modules:
       a) For end-user applications and applications with minimal security
          requirements, path validation modules should be configured to accept any
          valid path.
       b) For systems with more significant security requirements (e.g., systems using
          PKI to satisfy Level 3 or Level 4 e-Authentication), path validation modules
          should be configured to only accept paths that are valid under appropriate
          policies.

2.5 User Guidance (Subscribers)
In a PKI, the subject is the identity of the user associated with a public key. The subject
may be a person or a device. For the purposes of this section, the term “user” is means
either the person associated with a public key, or the administrator of a device associated
with a public key.

   1. Users should generate their own key pairs for digital signatures and
      authentication.

   2. Users may generate their own key pairs for key establishment, or the key
      establishment key pairs may be imported from a trusted source.

   3. Users shall protect the authenticators (e.g., the PIN or password) that control
      access to their private keys.

   4. Users shall request the revocation of their certificates if they believe the
      authenticator or cryptographic module has been stolen, copied or compromised.

   5. Users shall control the disposition of “old” key pairs after certificates expire
      unless otherwise controlled in accordance with federal agency policy and
      procedures.
       a) Private signature keys should be destroyed after the corresponding
          certificate(s) expire.
       b) Private key establishment keys need not be destroyed after the corresponding
          certificate(s) expire. The user should not destroy the private key
          establishment key until all symmetric keys established using this key have
          been recovered or otherwise protected (e.g., by encrypting under a different
          key). Premature destruction of private key establishment keys may prevent
          recovery of the subscriber’s plaintext data.
