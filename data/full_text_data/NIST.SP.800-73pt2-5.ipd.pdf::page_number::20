469   3.1.2. GET DATA Card Command
470   The GET DATA card command retrieves the data content of the single data object whose tag is
471   given in the data field. 5
472   Command Syntax
                    CLA                      '00' or '0C' for secure messaging
                    INS                      'CB'
                    P1                       '3F'
                    P2                       'FF'
                    Lc                       Length of data field
                    Data Field               See Table 6
                    Le                       '00'

473   The L c value is '05' for all PIV data objects except for the 0x7E interindustry tag (Discovery
474   Object), which has an L c value of '03', and the 0x7F61 interindustry tag (Biometric Information
475   Templates (BIT) Group Template), which has an L c value of '04'.
476                          Table 6. Data objects in the data field of the GET DATA card command

                   Name         Tag     M/O                            Comment
                  Tag list     '5C'     M   BER-TLV tag of the data object to be retrieved. See Table 3, Part 1.

477   Response Syntax
478   For the 0x7E Discovery Object (if present) and the 0x7F61 BIT Group Template (if present):
                                             - BER-TLV of the 0x7E Discovery data object (see Section 3.3.2,
                                             Part 1 for a description of the Discovery Objectâ€™s structure returned

                                             - BER-TLV of the 0x7F61 BIT Group Template (see Table 7 of SP
                                             800-76)

479   For all other PIV data objects (if present):
                                             BER-TLV with the tag '53' containing in the value field of the
                    Data Field

         The GET RESPONSE command is used in conjunction with GET DATA to read larger PIV data objects. The GET RESPONSE command is
      illustrated in Appendix A.4.1 (Command 3).
