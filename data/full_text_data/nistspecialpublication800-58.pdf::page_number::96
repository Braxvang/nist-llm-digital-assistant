     11. What size PC is required to operate a softphone?

            A high-end PC is not needed. Most systems require only 64MB of RAM and
            a 200 MHz or faster processor. VOIP software is available for all popular
            operating systems.

     12. Will a VOIP system continue to function during a power failure or cable outage?

            If all components have an uninterruptible power supply, the system should
            continue to function as long as the UPS batteries last. However, if the VOIP
            system is implemented on a cable modem, phone service will not be available
            during a cable outage. Similarly, if DSL is used, an outage of the DSL line
            will interrupt phone service. A conventional phone connection or mobile
            phones can serve as a backup.
