                           A Federal CKMS-using organization shall identify the
PR:3.4
                           maximum required design capacity (e.g., the maximum
                           number of users, the number of FKCMS computers or mobile
                           devices, the communications bandwidth, and the applications
                           to be supported by its FCKMS and its associated
                           communication mechanisms).

3.6   Intellectual Property Rights

A goal of designing, implementing, and operating any system is to avoid complex and
expensive litigation. Intellectual property rights, such as copyrights, trademarks, and patents
should be respected as required by law. Therefore, it is best to identify and resolve possible
legal issues as soon as possible.

                           Federal CKS service-providing organizations should identify
PA:3.4
                           intellectual-property rights that apply to the design,
                           procurement, implementation, and operation of a new or
                           upgraded FCKMS.
