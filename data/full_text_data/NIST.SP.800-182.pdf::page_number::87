of these guidelines, SP 800-147, BIOS Protection Guidelines,
was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC27 for standardization as
ISO/IEC 19678:2015.
    In FY 2016, CSD will continue to work with the computer
industry on the use of roots of trust to improve the security
of BIOS and other firmware. As part of this effort, CSD is
researching techniques and requirements for securing
firmware throughout the platform. This effort will consider
methods to protect this firmware from unauthorized
changes, detect accidental or malicious corruption, and
recover from destructive attacks.
