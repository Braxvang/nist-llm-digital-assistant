NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                   Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

The reference monitor concept (Section D.4.2) is a foundational access control concept for secure system
design. It is defined as a trustworthy abstract machine that mediates all accesses to objects by subjects
[38]. As a concept for an abstract machine, the reference monitor does not address any specific
implementation. A reference validation mechanism, which is a combination of hardware and software,
realizes the reference monitor concept to provide the access mediation foundation for a secure system
[37].
The reference monitor concept has several criteria that provide design assurance of its realization as a
reference validation mechanism:
-   The reference validation mechanism must be tamper-proof to ensure that its integrity and validity are
    not destroyed.
-   The reference validation mechanism must always be invoked, and if it cannot be, then the group of
    programs for which it provides validation services must be considered part of the reference validation
    mechanism and be subject to the first and third requirements.
-   The reference validation mechanism must be subject to rigorous analysis and tests, the completeness
    of which can be assured (with the purpose of ascertaining that the reference validation mechanism
    works correctly in all cases).
For trustworthy system control, a fourth criterion of non-bypassability is added (Section D.4.2).
Successful achievement of these criteria will prevent the interference of outside entities on a protection
mechanism or controller. Specifically:
-   A protection mechanism or feature should not be circumventable (i.e., the mechanism should be non-
    bypassable).
-   A protection mechanism or feature should be evaluatable (i.e., sufficiently small and simple enough
    to be assessed to produce adequate confidence in the protection provided, the constraint or control
    objective enforced, and the correct implementation of the mechanism [Reduced Complexity]).
-   A protection mechanism or feature is always invoked, providing continuous protection.
-   A protection mechanism or feature must be tamper-proof (i.e., neither the protection functions nor the
    data that the functions depend on can be modified without authorization).
Trustworthy system control also encompasses control, safety, and security concepts to establish a system
capability that sufficiently:
-   Enforces constraints to achieve only the authorized and intended system behaviors and outcomes
-   Provides self-protection against targeted attacks on the system
-   Is absent of self-induced emergent, erroneous, unsafe, and non-secure control actions
Such a system capability underlies the loss control objectives and transforms the approach for design to
not rely on having detailed knowledge of the capability, means, and methods of an adversary. This design
approach can be employed in attack-dependent or attack-independent manners based on the limits of
certainty for what is known with confidence about the adversary.
Trustworthy system control serves well as the design basis for individual system elements, collections of
elements, networks, and systems where intentional and unintentional adversity can prevent the
achievement of the loss control objectives. The principle also drives the need for rigor in engineering
activities commensurate to the trust placed in the system elements.
