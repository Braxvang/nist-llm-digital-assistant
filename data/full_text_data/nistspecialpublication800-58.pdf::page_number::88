       fewer points of access than VOIP systems. With VOIP, opportunities for
       eavesdroppers increase dramatically, because of the many nodes in a packet
       network.

Switch Default Password Vulnerability

        It is common for switches to have a default login/password set, e.g.,
        admin/admin, or root /root. This vulnerability also allows for wiretapping
        conversations on the network with port mirroring or bridging. An attacker with
        access to the switch administrative interface can mirror all packets on one port to
        another, allowing the indirect and unnoticeable interception of all
        communications. Failing to change default passwords is one of the most
        common errors made by inexperienced users. If possible, remote access to the
        graphical user interface should be disabled to prevent the interception of
        plaintext administration sessions. Some devices provide the option of a direct
        USB connection in addition to remote access through a web browser interface.
        Disabling port mirroring on the switch should also be considered.

Classical Wiretap Vulnerability

        Attaching a packet capture tool or protocol analyzer to the VOIP network
        segment makes it easy to intercept voice traffic.

         A good physical security policy for the deployment environment is a general first
        step to maintaining confidentiality. Disabling the hubs on IP Phones as well as
        developing an alarm system for notifying the administrator when an IP Phone has
        been disconnected will allow for the possible detection of this kind of attack.

ARP Cache Poisoning and ARP Floods

        Because many systems have little authentication, an intruder may be able to log onto
        a computer on the VOIP network segment, and then send ARP commands corrupting
        ARP caches on sender(s) of desired traffic, then activate IP. An ARP flood attack on
        the switch could render the network vulnerable to conversation eavesdropping.
        Broadcasting ARP replies blind is sufficient to corrupt many ARP caches.

        Corrupting the ARP cache makes it possible to re-route traffic to intercept voice and
        data traffic. Use authentication mechanisms provided wherever possible and limit
        physical access to the VOIP network segment.


Web Server interfaces
       Both VOIP switches and voice terminals are likely to have a web server interface
       for remote or local administration. An attacker may be able to sniff plaintext
       HTTP packets to gain confidential information. This would require access to the
       local network on which the server resides. If possible, do not use an HTTP
