APPENDIX E: LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE SOURCES ESTABLISHING
    SENSITIVITY/CRITICALITY

Some information has been established in law, by Executive Order, or by agency regulation as
requiring protection from disclosure. Those information types that are national security
information are outside the scope of this guideline. Each individual responsible for security
categorization of an organization’s information or information system should search his own
department or agency’s regulations for specific information protection requirements.

E.1 Legislative Mandates
Some legislatively mandated prohibitions against disclosure of information (other than national
security information) are identified in Table 6. The table gives the title or subject of the section
in the United States Code (U.S.C.) in which the prohibition occurs, the U.S.C. citation for the
prohibition, and the Department, agency, or generic information type to which the law applies,
and the legal source. Note that the information contained in the table is intended only as an aid
and will not always be current. Independent law searches by analysts will generally be
necessary.
