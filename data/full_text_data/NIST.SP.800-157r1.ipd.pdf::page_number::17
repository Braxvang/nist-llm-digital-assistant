      NIST SP 800-157r1 ipd                           Derived PIV Credentials (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


409   already in the subscriber’s possession. Appendix C provides sample issuance processes
410   for derived PIV credentials.
411   Derived PIV credentials SHALL be issued only by the home agency of the associated
412   PIV identity account. Derived PIV credentials SHALL be issued only to devices (such as
413   mobile devices) or authenticators that are approved by the home agency. Agencies MAY
414   establish blanket approvals for particular device types or MAY individually authorize
415   specific devices or authenticators for issuance and use by a cardholder. Authorization
416   policies for issuance SHALL be documented by each issuer.
417   Derived PIV credentials MAY be issued remotely or in person. At the time of issuance,
418   the applicant SHALL authenticate to the derived PIV credential issuer using their PIV
419   Card. This authentication SHALL be performed using the PKI-AUTH authentication
420   mechanism described in Sec. 6.2.3.1 of [FIPS201]. This authentication MAY be
421   performed remotely. In addition to authenticating the cardholder, performing the PKI-
422   AUTH authentication mechanism verifies that the applicant is currently eligible to
423   possess a PIV Card. All derived PIV credentials SHALL be issued in accordance with
424   [SP800-63B] Sec. 6.1.2.1.
425   All derived PIV credentials for use at AAL3 SHALL be issued in accordance with the
426   following additional requirements. The applicant SHALL identify themself using a
427   biometric sample that can be verified against their PIV Card or against the biometric
428   information in their enrollment record. If the issuance process consists of two or more
429   transactions, the applicant SHALL identify themself using a biometric sample that can
430   be verified against either their PIV Card or against a biometric that was recorded in a
431   previous transaction. The issuer SHALL retain the biometric sample used to verify the
432   applicant for future reference.
433   After the applicant has been authenticated, a derived PIV credential MAY be issued and
434   associated with the cardholder’s PIV identity account. The newly issued derived PIV
435   credential SHALL be represented in the cardholder’s PIV identity account.
436   When a new derived PIV credential is associated with a PIV identity account, the issuer
437    SHALL promptly notify the PIV cardholder of the binding of a derived PIV credential
438   through an independent means that would not afford an attacker the opportunity to
439   interfere with the notification. More than one independent notification method MAY
440   be used to ensure prompt receipt by the cardholder.
441   Derived PIV credentials SHALL meet the requirements for authentication assurance
442   level (AAL) 2 or 3 specified in [SP800-63B]. Derived PIV credentials that meet AAL3
443   requirements also fulfill the requirements of AAL2 and can be used in circumstances that
444   require authentication at AAL2. All derived PIV credentials at both AAL2 and AAL3
445    SHALL meet the requirements for phishing resistance defined in [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.2.5.

446   This guideline does not preclude the issuance of multiple derived PIV credentials to the
447   same applicant on the basis of the same PIV Card. This could increase the risk that one of

                                                  7
