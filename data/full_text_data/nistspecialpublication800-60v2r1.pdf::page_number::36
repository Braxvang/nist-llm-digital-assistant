modification or destruction of program monitoring information may have consequent serious
adverse effects on agency operations or public confidence in the agency.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: The consequences can be particularly
serious if the destruction or modification of monitoring information invalidates evaluation results
concerning major programs or concerning threats to human safety. The integrity impact
resulting from unauthorized modification or deletion of program monitoring information depends
in part on the nature of the laws or policies with which compliance is being determined and in
part on the criticality of the processes being monitored. For example, in the case of safety
regulations affecting manned space flight, the integrity impact level may be high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: There are some regulatory environments in which a high or
moderate impact level is appropriate. For most compliance monitoring information, the
recommended provisional integrity impact level is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the program monitoring information.
Although there may be time-sensitive program monitoring situations, more typically, disruption
of access to program monitoring information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: There are a limited number of compliance
monitoring operations for which temporary loss of availability is likely to significantly degrade
mission capability, place the agency at a significant disadvantage, result in loss of major assets,
or pose a threat to human life. This can result in assignment of a moderate impact level to such
information.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
program monitoring information is low.

C.2.2 Regulatory Development

Regulatory Development involves activities associated with providing input to the
lawmaking process in developing regulations, policies, and guidance to implement laws.
C.2.2.1 Policy and Guidance Development Information Type

Policy and Guidance Development involves the creation and dissemination of guidelines to assist
in the interpretation and implementation of regulations. In most cases, the effect on public
welfare of a loss of policy and guidance development mission capability can be expected to be
delayed rather than immediate. As a result, the potential for consequent loss of human life or of
major national assets is relatively low, since these most catastrophic consequences of impairment
to mission capability can, in most cases, be corrected before they are fully realized. The
recommended security categorization for the policy and guidance development information type
is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}
