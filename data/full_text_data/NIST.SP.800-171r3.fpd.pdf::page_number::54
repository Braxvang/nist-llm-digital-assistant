       NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                         Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information

1423           application software, and licenses. User-level information includes information other than
1424           system-level information. Hardware-enabled security technologies (e.g., hardware security
1425           modules [HSM]) can be used to enhance cryptographic protection for backup information. HSM
1426           devices safeguard and manage cryptographic keys and provide cryptographic processing.
1427           Cryptographic operations (e.g., encryption, decryption, and signature generation/verification) are
1428           typically hosted on the HSM device, and many implementations provide hardware-accelerated
1429           mechanisms for cryptographic operations. This requirement is related to 03.13.11.

1434   3.9.1. Personnel Screening
1435           REQUIREMENT: 03.09.01
1436           a. Screen individuals prior to authorizing access to the system.
1437           b. Rescreen individuals in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined conditions
1438              requiring rescreening].

1439           DISCUSSION
1440           Personnel security screening activities involve the assessment of an individual’s conduct,
1441           integrity, judgment, loyalty, reliability, and stability (i.e., the individual’s trustworthiness) prior to
1442           authorizing access to the system or when elevating system access. The screening and rescreening
1443           activities reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and
1444           criteria established for the level of access required for the assigned position.

1448   3.9.2. Personnel Termination and Transfer
1449           REQUIREMENT: 03.09.02
1450           a. When individual employment is terminated:
1451               1. Disable system access within [Assignment: organization-defined time period];
1452               2. Terminate or revoke authenticators and credentials associated with the individual; and
1453               3. Retrieve security-related system property.
1454           b. When individuals are reassigned or transferred to other positions in the organization:
1455               1. Review and confirm the ongoing operational need for current logical and physical access
1456                  authorizations to the system and facility;
1457               2. Initiate [Assignment: organization-defined transfer or reassignment actions] within
1458                  [Assignment: organization-defined time period following the transfer or reassignment
1459                  action]; and
