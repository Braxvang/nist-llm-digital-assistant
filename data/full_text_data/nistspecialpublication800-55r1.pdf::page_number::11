contributes to accomplishing agency strategic goals and objectives. Performance measures
developed according to this guide will enhance the ability of agencies to respond to a variety of
federal government mandates and initiatives, including FISMA.

This publication uses the security controls identified in NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security
Controls for Federal Information Systems, as a basis for developing measures that support the
evaluation of information security programs. In addition to providing guidelines on developing
measures, the guide lists a number of candidate measures that agencies can tailor, expand, or use
as models for developing other measures. 1 While focused on NIST SP 800-53 security controls,
the process described in this guide can be applied to develop agency-specific measures related to
security controls that are not included in NIST SP 800-53.

The information security measurement program described in this document can be helpful in
fulfilling regulatory requirements. The program provides an underlying data collection, analysis,
and reporting infrastructure that can be tailored to support FISMA performance measures,
Federal Enterprise Architecture’s (FEA) Performance Reference Model (PRM) requirements,
and any other enterprise-specific requirements for reporting quantifiable information about
information security performance.

1.2         Audience

This guide is written primarily for Chief Information Officers (CIOs), Senior Agency
Information Security Officers (SAISOs)—often referred to as Chief Information Security
Officers (CISOs)—and Information System Security Officers (ISSOs). It targets individuals
who are familiar with security controls as described in NIST SP 800-53. The concepts,
processes, and candidate measures presented in this guide can be used within government and
industry contexts.

1.3         History

The approach for measuring security control effectiveness has been under development for
several years. NIST SP 800-55, Security Metrics Guide for Information Technology Systems, and
NIST Draft SP 800-80, Guide to Developing Performance Metrics for Information Security, both
addressed information security measurement. This document supersedes these publications by
building upon them to align this approach with security controls provided in NIST SP 800-53,
Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems. The document also expands
on concepts and processes introduced in the original version of NIST SP 800-55 to assist with
the assessment of information security program implementation.

Security control implementation for information systems and information security programs is
reviewed and reported annually to OMB in accordance with the Electronic Government Act of
2002, which includes FISMA. The Act requires departments and agencies to demonstrate that
