GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



Benefits: Having an MOA or MOU significantly reduces the potential for subsequent misunderstandings
and security breaches. They enable signatories to communicate their respective security requirements
while also realizing the benefits of the business partnership that led them to collaborate in the
development and use of the RFID system.

Weaknesses: Monitoring an external organization’s enforcement of an agreement is difficult without full
access to its systems and personnel, which is unlikely. As a result, violations may occur without
detection. This risk can be mitigated with independent audits if signatories agree to hire third-parties to
conduct such audits.

5.1.4    Minimizing Sensitive Data Stored on Tags

Control: Instead of placing sensitive data on tags, the data could be stored in a secure enterprise
subsystem and retrieved using the tag’s unique identifier.

Applicability: Applications that use tags with on-board memory and process data that is either
considered sensitive or that could be combined with other data to infer sensitive information.

Benefits:

 Adversaries cannot obtain information from the tag through rogue scanning or eavesdropping.
 Data encryption and access control is often more cost-effectively performed in the enterprise
  subsystem than in the RF subsystem.
Weaknesses:

 Adversaries can often obtain valuable information from the identifier alone. For example, knowledge
  of the EPC manager ID and object class bits in certain EPC formats may reveal the make and model
  of a tagged object concealed in a container. An adversary might target containers based on the
  perceived worth of their contents.
 Placing data in the enterprise subsystem makes the availability of that data contingent on the
  availability of the network. Retrieving data over a network also introduces a small delay, which
  could be unacceptable for some applications. Section 3.3.3 discusses why organizations might
  choose to store data on tags even after taking into consideration the risks of doing so.
5.2     Operational Controls

There are several types of operational controls:

 Physical access controls restrict access to authorized personnel where the RFID systems are deployed.
 Proper placement of RF equipment helps avoid interference and reduce hazards from electromagnetic
  radiation.
 Organizations can destroy tags after they are no longer useful to prevent adversaries from gaining
  access to their data.
 Operator training can help ensure that personnel using the system follow appropriate guidelines and
  policies.
