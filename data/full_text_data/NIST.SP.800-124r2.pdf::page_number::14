   •   Section 2 provides an overview of mobile devices that focuses on what makes them
       different from other computing devices, particularly in terms of security.
   •   Section 3 discusses threats to an enterprise’s use of mobile devices.
   •   Section 4 presents an overview of mobile security technologies and discusses mitigations
       and countermeasures to the threats listed in Section 3.
   •   Section 5 discusses security throughout the mobile device life cycle. Examples of topics
       addressed in this section include mobile device security policy creation, design and
       implementation considerations, and operational processes that are particularly helpful for
       security.

       Overview of Mobile Devices
This section defines what a modern mobile device is, outlines the characteristics of mobile
devices, and discusses their underlying architecture. Understanding the full composition of a
mobile device is useful in defining the threats facing these information systems. This section also
provides an overview of built-in security capabilities, such as isolation, communication, and
authentication mechanisms.

       Mobile Device Definition
Mobile devices are essentially general-purpose computing platforms. They are not restricted to
performing one operation and can instead be used in many different domains, including medical,
industrial, and entertainment. NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 [1] defines a mobile device as:
            A portable computing device that has a small form factor such that it can
            easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a
            physical connection (e.g., wirelessly transmit or receive information);
            possesses local, non-removable data storage; and is powered on for
            extended periods of time with a self-contained power source. Mobile
            devices may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board
            sensors that allow the device to capture (e.g., photograph, video, record,
            or determine location) information, and/or built-in features for
            synchronizing local data with remote locations.
