      NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                         Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
      November 2023

780           configurations serve as a basis for future builds, releases, or changes to the system and include
781           information about system components, operational procedures, network topology, and the
782           placement of components in the system architecture. Maintaining baseline configurations requires
783           creating new baselines as the system changes over time. Baseline configurations of the system
784           reflect the current enterprise architecture.

788   3.4.2. Configuration Settings
789           REQUIREMENT: 03.04.02
790           a. Establish, document, and implement the following configuration settings for the system that
791              reflect the most restrictive mode consistent with operational requirements: [Assignment:
792              organization-defined configuration settings].
793           b. Identify, document, and approve any deviations from established configuration settings.

794           DISCUSSION
795           Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in hardware, software, or
796           firmware components of the system and that affect the security posture or functionality of the
797           system. Security-related configuration settings can be defined for computing systems (e.g.,
798           servers, workstations), input and output devices (e.g., scanners, copiers, printers), network
799           components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data switches, wireless access points,
800           network appliances, sensors), operating systems, middleware, and applications.
801           Security parameters are those parameters that impact the security state of the system, including
802           the parameters required to satisfy other security requirements. Security parameters include
803           registry settings; account, file, and directory permission settings (i.e., privileges); and settings for
804           functions, ports, protocols, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide
805           configuration settings and subsequently derive specific configuration settings for the system. The
806           established settings become part of the systemâ€™s configuration baseline.
807           Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown
808           and hardening guides, security reference guides, and security technical implementation guides)
809           provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration
810           settings for specific information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring
811           those system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can
812           be developed by a variety of organizations, including information technology product developers,
813           manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and other organizations
814           in the public and private sectors.
