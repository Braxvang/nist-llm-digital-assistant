1 Purpose

This publication is the fifth Part in a series of Recommendations regarding modes of operation of
symmetric key block ciphers.

2 Authority

This publication has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347. NIST is responsible for developing
standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements for federal information systems, but
such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems without the express
approval of appropriate federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems. This
guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
Circular A-130, Clause 8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as analyzed in Circular A-
130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Clauses. Supplemental information is provided in A-130,
Appendix III.

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made
mandatory and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory
authority. Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing
authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.

3 Introduction

The XTS-AES algorithm is a mode of operation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [1]
algorithm. The Security in Storage Working Group (SISWG) of the P1619 Task Group of the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc (IEEE) developed and specified XTS-AES
in IEEE Std. 1619-2007 [2]. This Recommendation approves the XTS-AES mode as specified in
that standard, subject to one additional requirement on the lengths of the data units, which is
discussed in Section 4 below.

The XTS-AES mode was designed for the cryptographic protection of data on storage devices
that use of fixed length “data units,” as defined in Ref. [2]. Note that other approved
cryptographic algorithms continue to be approved for such devices. The XTS-AES mode was
not designed for other purposes, such as the encryption of data in transit.

The XTS-AES mode is an instantiation of Rogaway’s XEX (XOR Encrypt XOR) tweakable
block cipher [3], supplemented with a method called “ciphertext stealing” to extend the domain
of possible input data strings. In particular, XEX can only encrypt sequences of complete
blocks, i.e., any data string that is an integer multiple of 128 bits; whereas for XTS-AES, the data
string may also consist of one or more complete blocks followed by a single, non-empty partial
