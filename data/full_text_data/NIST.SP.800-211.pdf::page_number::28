     AWARENESS, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION AND
     WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT
     People are often the most underappreciated ingredient in the people, process, and
     technology formula that determines an organizationâ€™s readiness to understand and deal
     with cybersecurity challenges. This includes gaps in user and provider awareness about
     how to access cybersecurity guidelines and tools that apply to their own operations
     and environments along with a shortage of people who have the needed cybersecurity
     education, training, and experience.


     National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE)
     Led by NIST, NICE seeks to equip, promote, and
     energize a robust network of organizations that
     address cybersecurity education, training, and
     workforce development. In FY 2019, the NICE
     program celebrated its 10th anniversary. Efforts to
     achieve this goal include: 1) accelerating learning and
     skills development, 2) nurturing a diverse learning
     community, and 3) guiding career development and
     workforce planning to achieve each of the objectives
     identified in the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce
