      NIST SP 800-73pt2-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                    Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 2
      September 2023                                                                       PIV Card Application Card Command Interface

559   Application SHALL return the status word '6A 80'. The security status and the retry counter of
560   the key reference SHALL remain unchanged.
561   If the authentication data in the command data field is properly formatted (see previous
562   paragraph) and does not match the reference data associated with the key reference, then the card
563   command SHALL fail, the PIV Card Application SHALL return the status word '63 CX', the
564   security status of the key reference SHALL be set to FALSE, and the retry counter associated
565   with the key reference SHALL be decremented by one.
566   If the card command succeeds, then the security status of the key reference SHALL be set to
567   TRUE, and the retry counter associated with the key reference SHALL be set to the reset retry
568   value associated with the key reference. The initial value of the retry counter and the reset retry
569   value associated with the key reference (i.e., the number of successive failures/retries before the
570   retry counter associated with the key reference reaches zero) are 10 or less in accordance with
571   FIPS 201 Section 2.9.3.

572   3.2.1.3.              Pairing Code
573   If the key reference is '98' and the authentication data in the command data field does not match
574   the reference data associated with the key reference, the command SHALL fail, and the PIV
575   Card Application SHALL return the status word '63 00'. If the authentication data in the
576   command data field does not satisfy the criteria in Section 2.4.3, then the PIV Card Application
577   MAY return the status word '6A 80' instead of '63 00'. If status word '6A 80' is returned, the
578   security status of the key reference SHALL remain unchanged. If status word '63 00' is returned,
579   the security status of the key reference SHALL be set to FALSE.
580   If the card command succeeds, then the security status of the key reference SHALL be set to
581   TRUE.
582   Command Syntax

                  CLA
                                             '0C' or '1C' for secure messaging
                  INS                        '20'
                  P1                         '00' or 'FF'
                  P2                         Key reference. See Part 1, Table 4.
                                             Absent 8 – for absent command data field
                  Lc                         '08' – for PIV Card Application PIN, Global PIN, or pairing code
                                             3N – for OCC data (where N is the number of minutiae)
                                             Absent,7 PIV Card Application PIN, Global PIN, pairing code
                  Data Field                 authentication data as described in Section 2.4.3, or OCC data as
                                             described in Section 5.5.2 of [SP800-76]

583   Response Syntax
                    SW1           SW2                                       Meaning
                  '63'          '00'         Verification failed
                  '63'          'CX'         Verification failed, X indicates the number of further allowed retries

      8
        If P1='00' and Lc and the command data field are absent, the command can be used to retrieve the number of further retries allowed ('63 CX') or
      to check whether verification is not needed ('90 00').
