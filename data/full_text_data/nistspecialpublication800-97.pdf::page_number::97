                                         ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



7.      FIPS and WLAN Product Certifications

Federal agencies are required to use FIPS-approved cryptographic algorithms that are contained in FIPS-
validated cryptographic modules. As mentioned in Section 2.1.2, Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and
WPA2 are security specifications developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance, a consortium of wireless product
vendors that certifies the interoperability of WLAN products through its Wi-Fi CERTIFIEDTM testing and
branding program. This section describes FIPS 140-2 certification as it applies to 802.11 wireless
networks. It also provides an overview of the Wi-Fi Alliance certification programs, with an emphasis on
WPA and WPA2. Organizations planning to deploy RSNs should understand the FIPS requirements and
the WPA and WPA2 certifications so that they can procure products with the certification levels that best
match their WLAN requirements.

7.1     FIPS 140-2 Certification

If a Federal Government wireless network requires security protection, then the data traversing the
network must be protected in one of two ways:

       The wireless equipment (APs and STAs) must be FIPS 140-2 certified and must operate in FIPS
        mode.
       The data on the wireless network must be protected by a VPN. The most common choice is an
        IPsec VPNs. The VPN’s crypto modules must be FIPS 140-2 certified.
In circumstances in which a wired network would not require security protection, a wireless network can
also operate without the required security protections. Some examples of this are:

       A wireless network in a conference room that is not connected to either the agency’s internal
        network or to the Internet, which is provided to enable conference participants to communicate
        with each other.
       A wireless network, connected to the Internet outside of the agency’s firewall. Unprotected
        clients that connect to the wireless network would be able to access the Internet, but accessing the
        agency’s internal network would require security protection.
The above requirements cover protection of the data traversing a wireless network. Authenticating to the
network using 802.1X and EAP is somewhat more complicated since EAP standardization is in a state of
flux. The IETF’s EAP Method Update (emu) working group is working to standardize EAP-TLS and to
extend it so that it will meet the needs of today’s wireless and other applications but still be backward-
compatible with EAP-TLS as defined in RFC 2716. NIST has not standardized on a particular EAP
method, so there is no EAP-related FIPS. NIST’s Implementation Guidance for FIPS PUB 140-2 92 allows
the use of EAP methods based on the TLS protocol (or on SSL v3.1, but not on previous versions of SSL)
or on EAP-TLS. Thus, EAP methods that satisfy that requirement and are accepted as secure by the
wireless industry may be used by government agencies. Since the RADIUS server is responsible for many
of the cryptographic security operations in 802.11i, government agencies are required to purchase
RADIUS servers whose crypto modules are FIPS-validated.
