NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                          GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


The following examples illustrate how to interpret the cipher suite names:

      •   TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256: Ephemeral DH is used for the key
          exchange. The server’s ephemeral public key is authenticated using the server’s RSA
          public key. Once the handshake is completed, the messages are encrypted using AES-256
          in CBC mode. SHA-256 is used for both the PRF and HMAC computations.

      •   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384: Ephemeral ECDH is used for
          the key exchange. The server’s ephemeral public key is authenticated using the server’s
          ECDSA public key. Once the handshake is completed, the messages are encrypted and
          authenticated using AES-256 in GCM mode, and SHA-384 is used for the PRF. Since an
          authenticated encryption mode is used, messages neither have nor require an HMAC
          message authentication code.

B.2            Interpreting Cipher Suites Names in TLS 1.3

As shown in Section 3.3.1, these cipher suites have the following form:

                 TLS_AEAD_HASH

AEAD indicates the AEAD algorithm that is used for confidentiality, integrity, and message
authentication. The NIST-approved TLS 1.3 AEAD algorithms comprise a NIST-recommended
block cipher and NIST-recommended AEAD mode.

HASH indicates the hashing algorithm that is used with the HKDF during key derivation.

The following examples illustrate how to interpret TLS 1.3 cipher suite names:
      •   TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384: Messages are encrypted and authenticated with AES-
          256 in GCM mode, and SHA-384 is used with the HKDF.
      •   TLS_AES_128_CCM_SHA256: Messages are encrypted and authenticated with AES-
          128 in CCM mode, and SHA-256 is used with the HKDF.

The negotiation of the key exchange method is handled elsewhere in the TLS handshake.
