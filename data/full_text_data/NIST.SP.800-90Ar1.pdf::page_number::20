7 Functional Model of a DRBG
 Figure 1 provides a functional model of a DRBG (i.e., one type of RBG). A DRBG shall
 implement an approved DRBG mechanism from SP 800-90A and at least one approved
 randomness source (see Section 8.6.5), and may include additional optional sources, including
 sources for nonces, personalization strings, and additional input. The components of this model
 are discussed in the following subsections. DRBG constructions are also discussed in [SP 800-
 90C].

7.1 Entropy Input

Entropy input is provided to a DRBG mechanism for the seed (see Section 8.6) using a
randomness source. The entropy input and the seed shall be kept secret. The secrecy of this
information provides the basis for the security of the DRBG. At a minimum, the randomness
source shall provide input that supports the security strength requested by the DRBG mechanism.
Appropriate randomness sources are discussed in Section 8.6.5.
Ideally, the entropy input would have full entropy; however, the DRBG mechanisms have been
specified so that input with full entropy is not required. This is accommodated by allowing the
length of the entropy input to be longer than the required entropy (expressed in bits), as long as
the total entropy meets the requirements of the DRBG mechanism. The entropy input can be
defined to be of variable length (within specified limits), as well as fixed length. In all cases, the
DRBG mechanism expects that when entropy input is requested, the returned bitstring will
contain at least the requested amount of entropy. Additional entropy beyond the amount requested
is not required, but is desirable.
