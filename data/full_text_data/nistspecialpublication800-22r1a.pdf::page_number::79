                                                                                        .

    So the P-value corresponding to the observed value Tobs can be evaluated in the following way. Let
    κ = [ Tobs ] + 1. Then the P-value is

€   In view of the discrete nature of this distribution and the impossibility of attaining the uniform
    distribution for P-values, the same strategy can be used that was used with other tests in this situation.
    Namely, partition the string€of length n, such that that n = MN, into N substrings each of length M. For the
    test based on the linear complexity statistic (6), evaluate TM within the j-th substring of size M, and
    choose K+1 classes (depending on M.) For each of these substrings, the frequencies, ν0, ν1, …, νK, of
    values of TM belonging to any of K+1 chosen classes, ν0 + ν1 + … + νK = N, are determined. It is
    convenient to choose the classes with end-points at semi-integers.

    The theoretical probabilities π0, π1, …, πK of these classes are determined from (8) and (9). For this
    purpose, M has to be large enough for the limiting distribution given by (8) and (9) to provide a
    reasonable approximation. M should exceed 500. It is recommended that M be chosen so that 500 ≤ M ≤
    5000.

    The frequencies are conjoined by the Χ 2 -statistic

                                                                  K                   2

                                                         Χ2 = ∑
                                                                          (ν i − Nπ i ) .

    which, under the randomness hypothesis, has an approximate Χ 2 -distribution with K degrees of freedom.
    The reported P-value is

                                                                   K Χ 2 (obs) 

    As before, a conservative condition for the use of the Χ 2 -approximation is that

                                                              N min π i ≥ 5 .
                                                                      i

    For reasonably large values of M and N, the following classes (K=6) seem to be adequate: {T ≤ -2.5},
    {-2.5 < T ≤ -1.5}, {-1.5 < T ≤ -0.5}, {-0.5 < T ≤ 0.5}, {0.5 < T ≤ 1.5}, {-1.5 < T ≤ 2.5}, {T > 2.5}.
                                           €
    The probabilities of these classes are π0=0.010417, π1=0.03125, π2=0.125, π3=0.5, π4=0.25, π5=0.0625,
    π6=0.020833. These probabilities are substantially different from the ones obtained from the normal
    approximation for which their numerical values are: 0.0041, 0.0432, 0.1944, 0.3646, 0.2863, 0.0939,
    0.0135.
