                                                                            NIST Special Publication 800-50



APPENDIX B—SAMPLE AWARENESS AND TRAINING METRIC

Critical Element   13.1 Have employees received adequate training to fulfill their security
                   responsibilities?
Subordinate        13.1.2 Are employee training and professional development documented and
Question           monitored?
Metric             The percentage of employees with significant security responsibilities who have
                   received specialized training
Purpose            To gauge the level of expertise among designated security roles and security
                   responsibilities for specific systems within the agency
Implementation     1. Are significant security responsibilities defined, with qualifications criteria, and
Evidence           documented? ‫ ڤ‬Yes ‫ ڤ‬No
                   2. Are records kept of which employees have specialized security responsibilities?
                   ‫ ڤ‬Yes            ‫ ڤ‬No
                   3. How many employees in your agency (or agency component, as applicable) have
                   significant security responsibilities? _____
                   4. Are training records maintained? (Training records indicate the training that
                   specific employees have received.)
                      Yes                No
                   5. Do training plans state that specialized training is necessary?
                   ‫ ڤ‬Yes            ‫ ڤ‬No
                   6. How many of those with significant security responsibilities have received the
                   required training stated in their training plan? _____
                   7. If all personnel have not received training, state all reasons that apply:
                     Insufficient funding
                   ‫ ڤ‬Insufficient time
                   ‫ ڤ‬Courses unavailable
                   ‫ ڤ‬Employee has not registered
                   ‫ ڤ‬Other (specify) ______________
Frequency          Annually, at a minimum
Formula            Number of employees with significant security responsibilities who have received
                   required training (Question 6) / Number of employees with significant security
                   responsibilities (Question 3)
Data Source        Employee training records or database; course completion certificates
Indicators         The target for this measure is 100 percent. If security personnel are not given
                   appropriate training, an organization may not be equipped to combat the latest threats
                   and vulnerabilities. Specific security control options and tools are rapidly changing
                   and evolving. Continued training enforces the availability of necessary security
                   information.
