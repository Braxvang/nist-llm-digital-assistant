Appendix B                                             Frequently Asked Questions


   MOU/MOA documents the terms and conditions for sharing data and information
   resources and should be signed by an organizational official.

Q. What are the components of MOU/MOA?
A. Each organization may use its own MOU/MOA format, if appropriate, while
   keeping in mind that the MOU/MOA is a management document and should not
   contain technical details of the interconnection. Each section should contain
   general information. Those details should be addressed separately in the ISA. An
   MOU/MOA should contain a dated cover sheet with both participating
   organizations listed. In addition to the cover sheet, the MOU/MOA should contain
   the following sections:
   • Section 1: Supersession
     – If there is a superseded document, the title and date of the document is
       listed.
   • Section 2: Introduction
     – The introduction states the purpose of the memorandum between the parties
       and what the agreement will govern (e.g., the relationship between
       “Organization A” and “Organization B”).
   • Section 3: Authorities
     – An example for this section would be: “The authority for this agreement is
       based on "Proclamation A" issued by the Agency Head on (date).”
   • Section 4: Background
     – In the background, the parties should state the intent of the agreement
       (e.g., “it is the intent of both parties to this agreement to interconnect the
       following information systems…”).
   • Section 5: Communications
     – Frequent formal communications are essential to ensure the successful
       management and operation of the interconnection. In this section, the
       parties agree to maintain open lines of communication among designated
       staff at both the managerial and technical levels.
   • Section 6: Purpose of the ISA
     – This section states the purpose of the ISA.
   • Section 7: Security Requirement
     – Both parties agree to work together to ensure the joint security of the
       connected systems and the data they store, process, and transmit, as
       specified in the ISA. Each party should have identified security controls that
       apply to the interconnection based on each system’s information security
       categorization and impact level and agree on a mutual set of applicable
       controls.
   • Section 8: Cost Considerations
     – This section describes the terms and conditions of the associated costs of the
       interconnecting mechanism and/or media.
   • Section 9: Timeline
     – This section states the agreement’s timeline (e.g., “This agreement will
       remain in effect for one (1) year after the last date on either signature in the
       signature block below. After one (1) year, this agreement will expire…”).
