                                  GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



sanitized before disposal (e.g., no disk images contain PII, the hard drive has been properly sanitized). 51
The effective management and prompt disposal of PII, in accordance with NARA-approved disposition
schedules, will minimize the risk of unauthorized disclosure.

4.2.2     Conducting Privacy Impact Assessments

PIAs are structured processes for identifying and mitigating privacy risks, including risks to
confidentiality, within an information system. According to OMB, PIAs are ―structured reviews of how
information is handled: (i) to ensure handling conforms to applicable legal, regulatory, and policy
requirements, (ii) to determine the risks and effects of collecting, maintaining and disseminating
information in identifiable form52 in an electronic information system, and (iii) to identify and evaluate
protections and alternative processes for handling information to mitigate potential privacy risks.‖ 53 If
used effectively, a PIA should address confidentiality risks at every stage of the system development life
cycle (SDLC). Many organizations have established their own templates that provide the basis for
conducting a PIA. The following are some topics that are commonly addressed through the use of a PIA:

 What information is to be collected
 Why the information is being collected
 The intended use of the information
 With whom the information will be shared
 How the information will be secured
 What choices the agency made regarding an IT system or collection of information as a result of
  performing the PIA.


4.2.3     De-Identifying Information

Full data records are not always necessary, such as for some forms of research, resource planning, and
examinations of correlations and trends. The term de-identified information is used to describe records
that have had enough PII removed or obscured, also referred to as masked or obfuscated, such that the
remaining information does not identify an individual and there is no reasonable basis to believe that the
information can be used to identify an individual.54 De-identified information can be re-identified


     appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies,
     decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Government or because of the informational value of the data in
     them.‖ Agencies are required to create and maintain ―adequate and proper documentation‖ of their organization, mission,
     functions, etc., and may not dispose of records without the approval of the Archivist of the United States. This approval is
     granted through the General Records Schedules (GRS) and agency specific records schedules.

     For the purpose of analysis, the definition for de-identified information used in this document is loosely based on the
     requirements for de-identified data defined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule, and it is generalized to apply to all PII. This
     definition differs from the HIPAA definition in that it is applied to all PII and does not specifically require the removal of all
     18 data elements described by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The HIPAA Privacy Rule recognizes two ways to de-identify data
     such that it is no longer considered to be protected health information (PHI). First, 18 specific fields can be removed, such
     as name, SSN, and phone number. Second, a person with appropriate knowledge and experience in statistical methods
