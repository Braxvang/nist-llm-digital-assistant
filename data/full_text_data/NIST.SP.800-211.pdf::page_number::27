Secure Blockchain Technologies and Algorithms
While many individuals recognize blockchain technology by its role in enabling
cryptocurrency (a digital form of currency protected through cryptographic
mechanisms), the technology has many applications and can be used to help protect
information, enable identity management, and enable purchasing supply chain
improvements. In FY 2019, NIST continued to discover and document ways in which
the secure use of blockchain technology can enable new applications and capabilities.
Publications that NIST developed as technical foundations to advance blockchain
research and use included:
  •   NISTIR 8202, Blockchain Technology Overview [19]
  •   Smart Contract Federated Identity Management without Third-Party
      Authentication Services
  •   Augmenting Fiat Currency with an Integrated Managed Cryptocurrency
  •   Implementing a Protocol Native Managed Cryptocurrency
  •   Draft Publication: A Taxonomic Approach to Understanding Emerging Blockchain
      Identity Management Systems
The team also developed new hardware for a blockchain researcher workbench and an
additional blockchain system for deployment. Areas that NIST continues to investigate in
the blockchain technology area include:
  •   Use of a taxonomy for blockchain systems for decentralized identity
  •   Use of tokens on blockchain systems
  •   Creation of tools to enable blockchain technology research
  •   Use of blockchain technology to publicly generate trustworthy random numbers
  •   Development of an architecture to enable the creation of managed
      cryptocurrencies that incorporate security features from consensus currencies
  •   Application of a methodology for securely storing and monitoring the use of
      federally owned crypto-assets on existing cryptocurrency systems
  •   Continued exploration of emerging topics and newly developed and released
      blockchain systems
