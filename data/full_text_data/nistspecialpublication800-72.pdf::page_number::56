                                                                     Guidelines on PDA Forensics


be found, recovered, and reported, and the amount of effort needed. Areas of variability
include the search and recovery of deleted information, information on reset devices, or
information within compressed file archives or files with misnamed extensions [Aye04]. For
example, some tools used to search for evidence may identify files by file extension where
others use a file signature database. The latter feature is preferable since it eliminates the
possibility of masking data based upon an inconsistent file extension. This is especially true
for graphics files of various types, since by their very nature they generally are shrouded from
textual searches.

The search engine plays a significant role in the discovery of information used for the creation
of bookmarks and final reporting. Searching data for positive results on incriminating
evidence takes patience and can be time consuming. Some tools have a simple search engine
that matches an input text string exactly, allowing only for elementary searches to be
performed. Other tools house more intelligent and feature rich search engines, allowing for
grep (generalized regular expression patterns) type searches, including wildcard matches;
filtering of files by extension, directory, etc.; and batch scripts that search for specific types of
content (i.e., e-mail addresses, URLs, etc.). Similarly, the ability to find and gather images
automatically into a common graphics library facility can differ among tools. The greater the
tool’s capabilities, the more the experience with and knowledge of the tool become valuable
for the forensic examiner.

To uncover evidence, specialists must first gain a background of the suspect and offense and
determine a set of terms for the examination. Search expressions should be developed in a
systematic fashion, such as using contact names that may be relevant. By doing this, the
specialist creates a profile for potential leads that may unveil valuable findings. To eliminate
all possibility of omitting valuable evidence, the data should be thoroughly looked through
from beginning to end in a memory window provided by either the tool or a hex editor.
Additionally, specialists should have a database of file signatures to locate the headers and
footers of specific files that may lead to further evidence such as: graphics files, avi files, etc.

Once the data has been thoroughly searched and relevant items bookmarked, it is time to create
a report. Many forensic applications come with a built-in reporting facility that imports
bookmarked data, allowing the specialist to organize the report, choose its style, and customize
other aspects of the report. Reports may include the following: Specialists Name, Case
Number, Date, Title, Suspect Name, Categories for evidence, and relevant evidence found.
The software-generated report is only a small part of the overall final report. The final report
contains the software-generated report alongside the documentation accumulated throughout
the entire cycle, which summarizes the actions of the forensic examination and presents the
results of the analysis, including any evidence uncovered.

The following criteria have been suggested as a fundamental set of requirements for forensic
tools [Car02], and should be considered when a choice of tools is available:

         Usability – the ability to present data in a form that is useful to an investigator.

         Comprehensive – the ability to present all data to an investigator so that both
         inculpatory and exculpatory evidence can be identified.

         Accuracy – the quality that the output of the tool has been verified and a margin of
         error ascertained.
