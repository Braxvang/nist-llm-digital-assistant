2.       Security Testing and Examination Overview

An information security assessment is the process of determining how effectively an entity being assessed
(e.g., host, system, network, procedure, person—known as the assessment object) meets specific security
objectives. Three types of assessment methods can be used to accomplish this—testing, examination, and
interviewing. Testing is the process of exercising one or more assessment objects under specified
conditions to compare actual and expected behaviors. Examination is the process of checking, inspecting,
reviewing, observing, studying, or analyzing one or more assessment objects to facilitate understanding,
achieve clarification, or obtain evidence. Interviewing is the process of conducting discussions with
individuals or groups within an organization to facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or identify
the location of evidence. Assessment results are used to support the determination of security control
effectiveness over time.

This publication addresses technical testing and examination techniques that can be used to identify,
validate, and assess technical vulnerabilities and assist organizations in understanding and improving the
security posture of their systems and networks. Security testing and examination is required by FISMA 1
and other regulations. It is not meant to take the place of implementing security controls and maintaining
system security, but to help organizations confirm that their systems are properly secured and identify any
organization security requirements that are not met as well as other security weaknesses that should be
addressed.

This section provides an overview of information security assessment methodologies and technical testing
and examination techniques.

2.1      Information Security Assessment Methodology

A repeatable and documented security assessment methodology is beneficial in that it can:

       Provide consistency and structure to security testing, which can minimize testing risks
       Expedite the transition of new assessment staff
       Address resource constraints associated with security assessments.
Because information security assessment requires resources such as time, staff, hardware, and software,
resource availability is often a limiting factor in the type and frequency of security assessments.
Evaluating the types of security tests and examinations the organization will execute, developing an
appropriate methodology, identifying the resources required, and structuring the assessment process to
support expected requirements can mitigate the resource challenge. This gives the organization the ability
to reuse pre-established resources such as trained staff and standardized testing platforms; decreases time
required to conduct the assessment and the need to purchase testing equipment and software; and reduces
overall assessment costs.

A phased information security assessment methodology offers a number of advantages. The structure is
easy to follow, and provides natural breaking points for staff transition. Its methodology should contain
at minimum the following phases:

      Section 3544 requires the “periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information security policies, procedures,
      and practices, to be performed with a frequency depending on risk, but no less than annually.” FISMA is available at
