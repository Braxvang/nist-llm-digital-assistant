Special Publication 800-73-4         Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification â€“ Part 1: PIV
                                  Card Application Namespace, Data Model and Representation

3.4.2    Cardholder UUID

As defined in Section 3.1.2, the CHUID may optionally include a Cardholder UUID. When present,
the Cardholder UUID shall be a 16-byte binary representation of a valid UUID, and it shall be version
1, 4, or 5, as specified in [RFC4122, Section 4.1.3].

3.5     Data Object Containers and associated Access Rules and Interface Modes

Table 2 defines a high level view of the data model. Each on-card storage container is labeled either
as Mandatory (M), Optional (O), or Conditional (C). The conditional data objects are the digital
signature key and the key management key, which are mandatory if the cardholder has a government-
issued email account at the time of credential issuance. This data model is designed to enable and
support dual interface cards. For dual chip implementations, for any container that can be accessed
over both the contact interface and the contactless interface (including the virtual contact interface)
the data object shall be copied into the corresponding containers on both chips. 11

11 As a consequence of this requirement, any keys that have to be generated on card cannot be made available over the

contactless interface (including the virtual contact interface) in a dual chip implementation. In addition, the asymmetric
CAK needs to be generated off-card and loaded onto both chips for dual chip implementations.
12 The term virtual contact interface (VCI) is used in this document as a shorthand for the following security condition:

     (command is submitted over secure messaging) AND (the Discovery Object is present) AND (Bit 4 of the first byte of
     the PIN Usage Policy is one) AND ((the security status indicator associated with the pairing code is TRUE) OR (Bit 3
     of the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy is one))
