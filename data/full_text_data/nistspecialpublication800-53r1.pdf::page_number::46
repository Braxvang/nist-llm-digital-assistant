________________________________________________________________________________________________


 Non-repudiation                     Assurance that the sender of information is provided with proof
 [CNSS Inst. 4009]                   of delivery and the recipient is provided with proof of the
                                     senderâ€™s identity, so neither can later deny having processed the
                                     information.
 Operational Controls                The security controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) for an
 [FIPS 200]                          information system that are primarily implemented and executed
                                     by people (as opposed to systems).
 Organization                        A federal agency or, as appropriate, any of its operational
 [FIPS 200]                          elements.
 Plan of Action and                  A document that identifies tasks needing to be accomplished. It
 Milestones                          details resources required to accomplish the elements of the plan,
 [OMB Memorandum 02-01]              any milestones in meeting the tasks, and scheduled completion
                                     dates for the milestones.
 Potential Impact                    The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be
 [FIPS 199]                          expected to have: (i) a limited adverse effect (FIPS 199 low); (ii)
                                     a serious adverse effect (FIPS 199 moderate); or (iii) a severe or
                                     catastrophic adverse effect (FIPS 199 high) on organizational
                                     operations, organizational assets, or individuals.
 Privacy Impact                      An analysis of how information is handled: (i) to ensure handling
 Assessment                          conforms to applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements
 [OMB Memorandum 03-22]              regarding privacy; (ii) to determine the risks and effects of
                                     collecting, maintaining, and disseminating information in
                                     identifiable form in an electronic information system; and (iii) to
                                     examine and evaluate protections and alternative processes for
                                     handling information to mitigate potential privacy risks.
 Privileged Function                 A function executed on an information system involving the
                                     control, monitoring, or administration of the system.
 Privileged User                     Individual who has access to system control, monitoring, or
 [CNSS Inst. 4009]                   administration functions (e.g., system administrator, information
                                     system security officer, maintainer, system programmer).
 Protective Distribution             Wire line or fiber optic system that includes adequate safeguards
 System                              and/or countermeasures (e.g., acoustic, electric, electromagnetic,
                                     and physical) to permit its use for the transmission of unencrypted
                                     information.
 Records                             The recordings (automated and/or manual) of evidence of
                                     activities performed or results achieved (e.g., forms, reports, test
                                     results), which serve as a basis for verifying that the organization
                                     and the information system are performing as intended. Also used
                                     to refer to units of related data fields (i.e., groups of data fields
                                     that can be accessed by a program and that contain the complete
                                     set of information on particular items).
 Remote Access                       Access to an organizational information system by a user (or an
                                     information system) communicating through an external, non-
                                     organization-controlled network (e.g., the Internet).
