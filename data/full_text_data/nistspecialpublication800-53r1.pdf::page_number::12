Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1                Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


appropriately modify the controls based on specific organizational policy and requirements,
particular conditions and circumstances, known threat and vulnerability information, and
tolerance for risk to the organization’s operations, assets, or to individuals.

Building a more secure information system is a multifaceted undertaking that involves the use of:
(i) well-defined system-level security requirements and security specifications; (ii) well-designed
information technology products; (iii) sound systems/security engineering principles and
practices to effectively integrate information technology products into the information system;
(iv) appropriate methods for product/system testing and evaluation; and (v) comprehensive
system security planning and life cycle management. 16 From a systems engineering viewpoint,
security is just one of many required capabilities for an organizational information system—
capabilities that must be funded by the organization throughout the life cycle of the system.
Realistically assessing the risks to an organization’s operations and assets or to individuals by
placing the information system into operation or continuing its operation is of utmost importance.
Addressing the information system security requirements must be accomplished with full
consideration of the risk tolerance of the organization in light of the potential impacts, cost,
schedule, and performance issues associated with the acquisition, deployment, and operation of
the system.

1.5 ORGANIZATION OF THIS SPECIAL PUBLICATION
The remainder of this special publication is organized as follows:
•    Chapter Two describes the fundamental concepts associated with security control selection
     and specification including: (i) the structural components of security controls and how the
     controls are organized into families; (ii) minimum (baseline) security controls; (iii) the use of
     common security controls in support of organization-wide information security programs;
     (iv) security controls in external environments; (v) assurance in the effectiveness of security
     controls; and (vi) the commitment to maintain currency of the individual security controls and
     the control baselines.
•    Chapter Three describes the process of selecting and specifying security controls for an
     information system including: (i) defining the organization’s overall approach to managing
     risk; (ii) categorizing the system in accordance with FIPS 199; (iii) selecting and tailoring the
     initial set of minimum (baseline) security controls; (iv) supplementing the tailored security
     control baseline, as necessary, based upon risk assessment results; and (v) updating the
     controls as part of a comprehensive continuous monitoring process.
•    Supporting appendices provide more detailed security control selection and specification-
     related information including: (i) general references; (ii) definitions and terms; (iii) acronyms;
     (iv) baseline security controls for low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact information
     systems; (v) minimum assurance requirements; (vi) a master catalog of security controls; (vii)
     mapping tables relating the security controls in this publication to other standards and control
     sets; (viii) crosswalks of NIST security standards and guidelines with associated security
     controls; and (ix) guidance on the application of security controls to industrial control
     systems.

  Successful life cycle management depends on having qualified personnel to oversee and manage the information
systems within an organization. The skills and knowledge of organizational personnel with information systems (and
information security) responsibilities should be carefully evaluated (e.g., through performance, certification, etc.).
