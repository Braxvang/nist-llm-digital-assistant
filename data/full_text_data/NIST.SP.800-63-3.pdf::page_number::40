                                                                                               intended to look at the potential impacts of an identity proofing failure to determine if IAL2 or

                                                                                               encounter is accepting a falsified identity as true, therefore providing a service or benefit to the
                                                                                               wrong or ineligible person. In addition, proofing, when not required, or collecting more
                                                                                               information than needed is a risk in and of itself. Hence, obtaining verified attribute
                                                                                               information when not needed is also considered an identity proofing failure. This step should
                                                                                               identify if the agency answered Step 1 and 2 incorrectly, realizing they do not need personal

                                                                                               identity of the subject accessing the digital service, and pseudonymous access, even with a few

                                                                                               subject, the process can end. However, the agency should consider if Step 5 is of value to
                                                                                               them, as the acceptance of claims will reduce exposure to the risk of over collecting and
