                                                                           CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible
exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.

Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud
infrastructure consumer-created or -acquired applications created using programming languages and tools
supported by the provider. 3 The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure
including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications
and possibly application hosting environment configurations.

Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The capability provided to the consumer is to provision
processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to
deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer
does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems,
storage, deployed applications; and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host
firewalls).

Deployment Models:

Private cloud. The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization
comprising multiple consumers (e.g., business units). It may be owned, managed, and operated by the
organization, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.

Community cloud. The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of
consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and
compliance considerations). It may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations
in the community, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.

Public cloud. The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public. It may be owned,
managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government organization, or some combination of
them. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider.

Hybrid cloud. The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures
(private, community, or public) that remain unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or
proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load
balancing between clouds)."

Throughout this document, any general use of the term “cloud” or “cloud system” should be assumed to
apply to each of the four deployment models. Care is taken to specify a specific deployment model when
a statement is not applicable to all four models.

To add clarity, this document uses the following terms consistently:

            cloud consumer or customer: a person or organization that is a customer of a cloud; note that a
                   cloud customer may itself be a cloud and that clouds may offer services to one another;
            client: a machine or software application that accesses a cloud over a network connection,
                     perhaps on behalf of a consumer; and
            cloud provider or provider: an organization that provides cloud services.

    This capability does not necessarily preclude the use of compatible programming languages, libraries, services, and tools from
       other sources.
