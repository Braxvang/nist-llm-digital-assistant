________________________________________________________________________________________________


Risk assessments address the potential adverse impacts to organizational operations and assets,
individuals, other organizations, and the economic and national security interests of the United
States, arising from the operation and use of information systems and the information processed,
stored, and transmitted by those systems. Organizations conduct risk assessments to determine
risks that are common to the organization’s core missions/business functions, mission/business
processes, mission/business segments, common infrastructure/support services, or information
systems. Risk assessments can support a wide variety of risk-based decisions and activities by
organizational officials across all three tiers in the risk management hierarchy including, but not
limited to, the following:
• Development of an information security architecture;
• Definition of interconnection requirements for information systems (including systems
  supporting mission/business processes and common infrastructure/support services);
• Design of security solutions for information systems and environments of operation including
  selection of security controls, information technology products, suppliers/supply chain, and
  contractors;
• Authorization (or denial of authorization) to operate information systems or to use security
  controls inherited by those systems (i.e., common controls);
• Modification of missions/business functions and/or mission/business processes permanently,
  or for a specific time frame (e.g., until a newly discovered threat or vulnerability is addressed,
  until a compensating control is replaced);
• Implementation of security solutions (e.g., whether specific information technology products
  or configurations for those products meet established requirements); and
• Operation and maintenance of security solutions (e.g., continuous monitoring strategies and
  programs, ongoing authorizations).

Because organizational missions and business functions, supporting mission/business processes,
information systems, threats, and environments of operation tend to change over time, the validity
and usefulness of any risk assessment is bounded in time.

2.3 KEY RISK CONCEPTS
Risk is a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or
event, and is typically a function of: (i) the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance
or event occurs; and (ii) the likelihood of occurrence. Information security risks are those risks
that arise from the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or information
systems and reflect the potential adverse impacts to organizational operations (i.e., mission,
functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the
Nation. Risk assessment is the process of identifying, estimating, and prioritizing information
security risks. Assessing risk requires the careful analysis of threat and vulnerability information
to determine the extent to which circumstances or events could adversely impact an organization
and the likelihood that such circumstances or events will occur.

A risk assessment methodology typically includes: (i) a risk assessment process (as described in
Chapter Three); (ii) an explicit risk model, defining key terms and assessable risk factors and the
relationships among the factors; (iii) an assessment approach (e.g., quantitative, qualitative, or
semi-qualitative), specifying the range of values those risk factors can assume during the risk
assessment and how combinations of risk factors are identified/analyzed so that values of those
