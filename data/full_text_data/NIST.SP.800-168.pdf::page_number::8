Introduction

 1.1   Purpose and Scope

       Approximate matching is a promising technology designed to identify similarities between two
       digital artifacts. It is used to find objects that resemble each other or to find objects that are
       contained in another object. This can be very useful for filtering data for security monitoring,
       digital forensics, or other applications. The purpose of this document is to provide a definition
       and terminology to describe approximate matching in order to promote discussion, research,
       tool development and tool acquisition. Approximate matching has the potential to provide
       valuable filtering in a world inundated with information, but the technique is not widely used.
       The goal of the document is to provide infrastructure to support advances in approximate
       matching and its use in forensics and security.

 1.2   Audience

       The intended audience of this document is security digital forensics programmers and other
       technical professionals with a need to determine, build, or use technology to identify similarity.
