Bearing in mind the metrics and full cost of a service, the decision makers begin to consider opportunities
and barriers. The IT security service issues mentioned in Section 3.4 provide a framework for analyzing
opportunities and barriers, as well as external factors, such as the marketplace and the customers. Finally,
the existing environment and the opportunities and barriers will provide managers with options and risks.
From these options, managers will choose a solution in Phase 3.

4.2.1   Baseline Existing Environment

Once managers have initiated the IT security services life cycle, they must establish a baseline
understanding of the current environment. This baseline will demonstrate to managers how well the
current arrangement meets the security requirement and at what cost. Managers will need these two
measurements to compare the benefits of various service arrangements or the proposals of various service
providers.

The scope of this effort will depend on the nature of the security control or the specific mix of controls.
All related areas of the control or the mix of controls should be included; for example, if an organization
is evaluating its firewall services, it should evaluate its firewall policies and other policies, the
effectiveness of the firewall architecture, and other issues specific to the study.

Data for constructing the baselines should be collected in an objective, impartial, and comprehensive
manner. Stakeholders in the current environment will often be required to provide data or assist with
