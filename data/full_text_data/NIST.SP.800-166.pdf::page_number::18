NIST SP 800-166                                                         DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                        DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

5.       Test Documentation

There are two sets of documentation that are part of the compliance testing process:
vendor/issuer provided and testing entity generated. These documentations apply to both: (i)
Derived PIV Application tests and (ii) Data Model of the Derived PIV Application tests.

The vendor/issuer documentation consists of the following:

     +    Technical documentation: Technical details for the Derived PIV Application and its
          data model (as implemented). It includes, at a minimum, all the required information
          necessary to meet individual test assertions as documented in Section 8 (Test Assertions
          for the Derived PIV Application) or Section 9 (Test Assertions for the Data Model of the
          Derived PIV Application) of this document, depending on which tests are being
          performed; and

     +    Security-related information: (a) Derived PIV Application Password, (b) Password
          Unblocking Key (PUK), (c) cryptographic algorithms supported by the application, and
          (d) the number of unsuccessful attempts using: (i) wrong Derived PIV Application
          Password and (ii) wrong PUK.

The testing entity documents are generated during testing and report test results. They include:

     +    Test logs: A test log is kept for each test run on any component and is used to summarize
          the results of all the tests run; and

     +    Test reports: These provide the background (environmental information) for each of the
          test assertions as well as summary of outcomes from test runs (from test logs) associated
          with each test assertion.
