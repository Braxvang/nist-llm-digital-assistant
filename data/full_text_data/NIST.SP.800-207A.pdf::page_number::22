       Policy Deployment for Reference Application Infrastructure
Connectivity (between network elements) and access policies (between service instances) are
network-tier policies and identity-tier policies, respectively.
Consider the following example set of policies that contain a combination of network-tier and
identity-tier policies. Network-tier policies can be further categorized into coarse-grained and
fine-grained policies.
   •   Coarse-grained network-tier policies — These perimeter control policies are informally
       called firewall rules and are mostly static as they specify:
           o The network location of the egress gateway from which the network edge element
             at the exit point of a cloud network (e.g., outbound firewall, such as the one at the
             edge of a cloud) can receive traffic
           o The network location of the ingress gateway to which the incoming traffic that
             lands at the entry point of the on-premises network edge (e.g., inbound firewall at
             the entry point to an on-premises network) should be routed:
                       Firewall: allow 10.100.2.3/30 15443 to 10.1.2.3/30:15443
   •   Fine-grained network-tier policies — This category of policies is also called
       microsegmentation policies, and they specify the pathways for traffic flowing into and
       out of the services located within the network subnets at the cloud location or on-
       premises location.
           o Specify the path on which the outbound traffic from a service or an application
             (e.g., App 1 in Fig. 2) can flow. The elements in the path that are specified
             include the egress gateway at the edge of the cluster and, subsequently, the
             outbound firewall for the network (cloud network in this example).
           o Specify the path for the inbound traffic into the on-premises network to reach the
             target application. The elements in the path start from the inbound firewall at the
             edge of the on-premises network to the ingress gateway in an on-premises cluster
             to the network subnet where the target service is located.
           o Notably, they specify how traffic can flow “east-west” (i.e., inside of the
             perimeter). This is in contrast to coarse-grained policies, which specify how
             traffic can flow “north-south” (i.e., from an external to internal network).
   •   Identity-tier policies — These are also called mesh-level policies as they are deployed
       and enforced at the data plane of the service mesh in the reference platform. Figure 4
