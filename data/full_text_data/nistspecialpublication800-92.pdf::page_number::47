              aggressive trade-offs in favor of security outweigh the potential negative consequences to
              other useful system attributes such as interoperability with other systems. Some Specialized
              Security-Limited Functionality systems might have a limited ability to participate in a log
              management infrastructure because of the potential security risks of doing so (e.g., running
              additional network services, transmitting unprotected sensitive information over networks).
              It might be necessary to design a log management infrastructure so that these systems have all
              log management performed locally or that their logs are transferred to the infrastructure
              through out-of-band means such as removable media.

          –   Legacy. A Legacy environment contains older systems or applications that may use older,
              less secure communication mechanisms. Other machines operating in a Legacy environment
              may need less restrictive security settings so that they can communicate with legacy systems
              and applications. Some Legacy systems might not be able to participate in a log management
              infrastructure because the necessary software cannot be installed or configured properly on
              them. It might be necessary to design a log management infrastructure so that these systems
              have all log management performed locally or that their logs are transferred to the
              infrastructure through out-of-band means such as removable media.
4.4     Design Log Management Infrastructures

After establishing an initial policy and identifying roles and responsibilities, an organization should next
design one or more log management infrastructures that effectively support the policy and roles. If the
organization already has a log management infrastructure, then the organization should first determine if
it can be modified to meet the organization’s needs. If the existing infrastructure is unsuitable, or no such
infrastructure exists, then the organization should either identify its infrastructure requirements, evaluate
possible solutions, and implement the chosen solution (hardware, software, and possibly network
enhancements), or reevaluate its needs and modify its policy. Organizations may wish to create a draft
policy, attempt to design a corresponding log management infrastructure, and determine what aspects of
the policy make that infeasible. The organization can then revise its policies so that the infrastructure
implementation will be less resource-intensive, while ensuring that all legal and regulatory requirements
are still met. Because of the complexities of log management, it may take a few cycles of policy
modification, infrastructure design, and design assessment to finalize the policy and design.

When designing a log management infrastructure, organizations should consider several factors related to
the current and future needs of both the infrastructure and the individual log sources throughout the
organization. Major factors include the following:

       The typical and peak volume of log data to be processed per hour and day. The typical volume of
        log data tends to increase over time for most log sources. The peak volume should include
        handling extreme situations, such as widespread malware incidents, vulnerability scanning, and
        penetration tests that may cause unusually large numbers of log entries to be generated in a short
        period of time. If the volume of log data is too high, a logging denial of service may result.
        Many logging products rate their capacity for processing log data by the volume of events they
        can process in a given time, most often in events per second (EPS).
       The typical and peak usage of network bandwidth.
       The typical and peak usage of online and offline (e.g., archival) data storage. This should include
        an analysis of the time and resources needed to perform backups and archival of log data, as well
        as disposing of the data once it is no longer needed.
