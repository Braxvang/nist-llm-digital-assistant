NIST SP 800-166                                                   DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                  DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

                             • Data field of the command will contain the
                               correct PUK value (PUK 1) concatenated without
                               delimitation with an arbitrary new PUK value (PUK
                               2) that is less than 8 bytes in length
                      7. Send the CHANGE REFERENCE DATA command with
                            • P2, key reference value, is set to '81'
                            • Data field of the command will contain the
                               correct PUK (PUK 1) concatenated without
                               delimitation with an arbitrary new PUK (PUK 3)
                               that is greater than 8 bytes in length
 Expected Result(s)   1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property template
                         with the status word '90 00'.
                      2. From Step 2, the command returns status word '6A 80' (incorrect
                         parameter in command data field).
                      3. From Step 3, the command returns status word '6A 80' (incorrect
                         parameter in command data field).
                      4. From Step 4, the command returns status word '6A 80' (incorrect
                         parameter in command data field).
                      5. From Step 5, the command returns status word '6A 80' (incorrect
                         parameter in command data field).
                      6. From Step 6, the command returns status word '6A 80' (incorrect
                         parameter in the command data field).
                      7. From Step 7, the command returns status word '6A 80' (incorrect
                         parameter in the command data field).
 Postcondition(s)     Neither the password nor the PUK value has changed.

8.3.5.4 Change Reference Data with an Incorrect Format for the New Password

 Test Assertion       TA-08.03.05.04
 Purpose              Verifies that the Derived PIV Application responds appropriately to the
                      CHANGE REFERENCE DATA command when the new password
                      does not satisfy the format requirements.

 Precondition(s)      •   A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                          appropriate token reader.
                      •   Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and an
                          instance of the reader.
                      •   The Derived PIV Application Password is recorded.
