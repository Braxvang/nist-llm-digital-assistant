      NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1
      September 2023                                 PIV Card Application Namespace, Data Model, and Representation

283           Effective Date
284   These recommendations become effective upon final publication. New optional PIV Card
285   features and deprecated PIV card features shall be phased in as part of new card stock
286   acquisitions by federal department and agencies.
287   FIPS 201 compliance of PIV components and subsystems is provided in accordance with OMB
288   [M-19-17] through products and services from the U.S. General Services Administration’s
289   (GSA) Interoperability Test Program and Approved Products and Services List.

290           Audience and Assumptions
291   This document is intended for federal agencies and implementers of PIV systems. Readers are
292   assumed to have a working knowledge of smart card standards and applications.

293           Document Overview and Structure
294   All sections in this document are normative (i.e., mandatory for compliance) unless specified as
