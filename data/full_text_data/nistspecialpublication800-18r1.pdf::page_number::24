                    Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


   •   The agency has developed, documented, and communicated its specific guidance
       on identifying common security controls;

   •   The agency has assigned the responsibility for coordinating common security
       control identification and review and obtaining consensus on the common control
       designations, to a management official with security program responsibilities such
       as the CIO or SAISO;

   •   System owners have been briefed on the system security planning process
       including use of common controls; and

   •   Agency experts in the common control areas identified have been consulted as
       part of the process.

An agency may also assign a hybrid status to security controls in situations where one
part of the control is deemed to be common, while another part of the control is deemed
to be system-specific. For example, an agency may view the IR-1 (Incident Response
Policy and Procedures) security control as a hybrid control with the policy portion of the
control deemed to be common and the procedures portion of the control deemed to be
system-specific. Hybrid security controls may also serve as templates for further control
refinement. An agency may choose, for example, to implement the CP-2 (Contingency
Plan) security control as a master template for a generalized contingency plan for all
agency information systems with individual information system owners tailoring the
plan, where appropriate, for system-specific issues.

Information system owners are responsible for any system-specific issues associated with
the implementation of an agency's common security controls. These issues are identified
and described in the system security plans for the individual information systems. The
SAISO, acting on behalf of the CIO, should coordinate with agency officials (e.g.,
facilities managers, site managers, personnel managers) responsible for the development
and implementation of the designated common security controls to ensure that the
required controls are put into place, the controls are assessed, and the assessment results
are shared with the appropriate information system owners.

Partitioning security controls into common security controls and system-specific security
controls can result in significant savings to the agency in control development and
implementation costs. It can also result in a more consistent application of the security
controls across the agency at large. Moreover, equally significant savings can be realized
in the security certification and accreditation process. Rather than assessing common
security controls in every information system, the certification process draws upon any
applicable results from the most current assessment of the common security controls
performed at the agency level. An agency-wide approach to reuse and sharing of
assessment results can greatly enhance the efficiency of the security certifications and
accreditations being conducted by an agency and significantly reduce security program
costs.
