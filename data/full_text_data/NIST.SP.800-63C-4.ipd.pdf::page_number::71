1830   can assist the agency in determining what additional requirements apply. Moreover, a
1831   thorough understanding of the individual components of digital authentication will enable
1832   the SAOP to thoroughly assess and mitigate privacy risks either through compliance
1833   processes or by other means.

1834 9.5. Blinding in Proxied Federation
1835 While some proxy structures — typically those that exist primarily to simplify integration
1836 — may not offer additional subscriber privacy protection, others offer varying levels of

1837 privacy to the subscriber through a range of blinding technologies. Privacy policies may
1838 dictate appropriate use of the subscriber attributes and authentication transaction data
1839 (e.g., identities of the ultimate IdP and RP) by the IdP, RP, and the federation proxy.
1840   Technical means such as blinding can increase effectiveness of these policies by making
1841   the data more difficult to obtain. A proxy-based system has three parties, and the proxy
1842   can be used to hide information from one or more of the parties, including itself. In
1843   a double-blind proxy, the IdP and RP do not know each other’s identities, and their
1844   relationship is only with the proxy. In a triple-blind proxy, the proxy additionally does not
1845   have insight into the data being passed through it. As the level of blinding increases, the
1846   technical and operational implementation complexity may increase. Since proxies need to
1847   map transactions to the appropriate parties on either side as well as manage the keys for
1848   all parties in the transaction, fully triple-blind proxies are very difficult to implement in
1849   practice.
1850   Even with the use of blinding technologies, a blinded party may still infer protected
1851   subscriber information through released attribute data or metadata, such as by analysis of
1852   timestamps, attribute bundle sizes, or attribute signer information. The IdP could consider
1853   additional privacy-enhancing approaches to reduce the risk of revealing identifying
1854   information of the entities participating in the federation.
1855   The following table illustrates a spectrum of blinding implementations used in proxied
1856   federation. This table is intended to be illustrative, and is neither comprehensive nor
1857   technology-specific.
