                                                               Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

      Mobile devices may be found in a compromised state that may complicate seizure, such as
      immersion in a liquid. In these situations, forensic examiners should adhere to agency specific
      procedures. One method involves removal of the battery preventing electrical shorting, while
      the remainder of the mobile device is sealed in an appropriate container filled with the same
      liquid for transport to the lab, provided the liquid is not caustic. Some compromised states,
      such as blood contamination or use with explosives (i.e., as a bomb component) can pose a
      danger to the technician collecting evidence. In such situations, a specialist should be consulted
      for specific instructions or assistance.

      Mobile devices and associated media may be found in a damaged state, caused by accidental
      or deliberate action. Devices or media with visible external damage do not necessarily prevent
      the extraction of data. Damaged equipment should be taken back to the lab for closer
      inspection. Repairing damaged components on a mobile device and restoring the device to
      working order for examination and analysis may be possible.

      Undamaged memory components may also be removed from a damaged device and their
      contents recovered independently. This method should be used with caution, as it is not
      possible with all devices.

4.2   Documenting the Scene

      Evidence must be accurately identified and accounted for. Non-electronic materials such as
      invoices, manuals, and packaging material may provide useful information about the
      capabilities of the device, the network used, account information, and unlocking codes for the
      PIN. Photographing the crime scene in conjunction with documenting a report on the state of
      each digital device and all computers encountered may be helpful in the investigation, if
      questions arise later about the environment.

      A record of all visible data should be created. All digital devices, including mobile devices,
      which may store data, should be photographed along with all peripherals cables, power
      connectors, removable media, and connections. Avoid touching or contaminating the mobile
      device when photographing it and the environment where found. If the device’s display is in a
      viewable state, the screen’s contents should be photographed and, if necessary, recorded
      manually, capturing the time, service status, battery level, and other displayed icons.

4.3   Isolation

      Many mobile devices offer the user with the ability to perform either a remote lock or remote
      wipe by simply sending a command (e.g., text message) to the mobile device.

      Additional reasons for disabling network connectivity include incoming data (e.g., calls or text
      messages) that may modify the current state of the data stored on the mobile device. Outgoing
      data may also be undesirable as the current GPS location may be delivered to an advisory
      providing the geographic location of the forensic examiner.

      Therefore, forensic examiners need to be aware and take precautions when securing mobile
      devices mitigating the chance of data modification. The Scientific Working Group on Digital
      Evidence’s (SWGDE) “Best Practices for Mobile Phone Forensics” document covers best
      practice for the proper isolation of mobile devices [SWG13]. Some key implications for proper
      collection are summarized below.
