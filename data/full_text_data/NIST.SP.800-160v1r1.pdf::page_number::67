NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                           Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems

behavior
The way that an entity functions as an action, reaction, or interaction.
How a system element, system, or system of systems acts, reacts, and interacts. [75]

body of evidence
The totality of evidence used to substantiate trust, trustworthiness, and risk relative to the system.

breakdown structure
Framework for efficiently controlling some aspect of the activities for a program or project. [76]
         Note: Examples include work breakdown structure, the decomposition of the defined scope of a project into
         progressively lower levels consisting of elements of work, and product breakdown structure (i.e.,
         decomposition of a product into its components).

claim
A true-false statement about the limitations on the values of an unambiguously defined property called the claim’s
property; and limitations on the uncertainty of the property’s values falling within these limitations during the
claim’s duration of applicability under stated conditions. [61]

complex system
A system in which there are non-trivial relationships between cause and effect: each effect may be due to multiple
causes; each cause may contribute to multiple effects; causes and effects may be related as feedback loops, both
positive and negative; and cause-effect chains are cyclic and highly entangled rather than linear and separable. [3]

component
See system element.

concept of operations
Verbal and graphic statement, in broad outline, of an organization’s assumptions or intent in regard to an operation
or series of operations of new, modified, or existing organizational systems. [77]
         Note 1: The concept of operations is frequently embodied in long-range strategic plans and annual
         operational plans. In the latter case, the concept of operations in the plan covers a series of connected
         operations to be conducted simultaneously or in succession to achieve an organizational performance
         objective.
         Note 2: The concept of operations provides the basis for bounding the operating space, system capabilities,
         interfaces, and operating environment.

concept of secure function
A strategy for the achievement of secure system function that embodies the preemptive and reactive protection
capabilities of the system.
         Note 1: This strategy strives to prevent, minimize, or detect the events and conditions that can lead to the
         loss of an asset and the resultant adverse consequences; prevent, minimize, or detect the loss of an asset or
         adverse asset consequences; continuously deliver system capability at some acceptable level despite the
         impact of threats or uncertainty; and recover from adverse asset consequences to restore full system
         capability or recover to some acceptable level of system capability.
         Note 2: The concept of secure function is adapted from historical and other secure system concepts, such as
         the Philosophy of Protection, the Theory of Design and Operation, and the Theory of Compliance.

concern
Matter of interest or importance to a stakeholder. [71]

concern (system)
Interest in a system relevant to one or more of its stakeholders. [71]
