       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                         Authentication and Lifecycle Management


1280   The biometric system SHALL operate with a false-match rate (FMR) [ISO/IEC2382-37]
1281   of 1 in 10000 or better. This FMR SHALL be achieved under conditions of a conformant
1282   attack (i.e., zero-effort impostor attempt) as defined in [ISO/IEC30107-1].
1283   The biometric system SHOULD implement presentation attack detection (PAD). Testing
1284   of the biometric system to be deployed SHOULD demonstrate at least 90% resistance
1285   to presentation attacks for each relevant attack type (i.e., species), where resistance is
1286   defined as the number of thwarted presentation attacks divided by the number of trial
1287   presentation attacks. Testing of presentation attack resistance SHALL be in accordance
1288   with Clause 12 of [ISO/IEC30107-3]. The PAD decision MAY be made either locally on
1289   the claimant’s device or by a central verifier.
1290   The biometric system SHALL allow no more than 5 consecutive failed authentication
1291   attempts or 10 consecutive failed attempts if PAD, meeting the above requirements, is
1292   implemented. Once that limit has been reached, the biometric authenticator SHALL
1293   impose a delay of at least 30 seconds before each subsequent attempt, with an overall
1294   limit of no more than 50 consecutive failed authentication attempts (100 if PAD is
1295   implemented). Once the overall limit is reached, the biometric system SHALL disable
1296   biometric user authentication and offer another factor (e.g., a different biometric modality
1297   or an activation secret if it is not already a required factor) if such an alternative method is
1298   already available.
1299   The verifier SHALL make a determination of sensor and endpoint performance, integrity,
1300   and authenticity. Acceptable methods for making this determination include, but are not
1301   limited to:
1302       • Authentication of the sensor or endpoint
1303       • Certification by an approved accreditation authority
1304       • Runtime interrogation of signed metadata (e.g., attestation) as described in
1305         Sec. 5.2.4.
1306   Biometric comparison can be performed locally on the claimant’s device or at a central
1307   verifier. Since the potential for attacks on a larger scale is greater at central verifiers,
1308   comparison SHOULD be performed locally.
1309   If comparison is performed centrally:
1310       • Use of the biometric as an authentication factor SHALL be limited to one or
1311         more specific devices that are identified using approved cryptography. Since the
1312         biometric has not yet unlocked the main authentication key, a separate key SHALL
1313         be used for identifying the device.
1314       • Biometric revocation, referred to as biometric template protection in
1315         [ISO/IEC24745], SHALL be implemented.
