4.    Target Identification and Analysis Techniques

This section addresses technical target identification and analysis techniques, which focus on identifying
active devices and their associated ports and services, and analyzing them for potential vulnerabilities.
The assessor uses this information to continue to explore devices that will validate existence of the
vulnerabilities. Organizations often use non-technical techniques in addition or instead of technical
techniques to identify the assets to be analyzed. For example, organizations may have existing asset
inventories or other lists of assets to be targeted; another example is assessors performing a walkthrough
of a facility to identify assets that were not found by technical techniques, such as hosts that were shut off
or disconnected from the network when the technical techniques were used.

Target identification and analysis techniques for application security examination are briefly discussed in
Appendix C.

4.1   Network Discovery

Network discovery uses a number of methods to discover active and responding hosts on a network,
identify weaknesses, and learn how the network operates. Both passive (examination) and active (testing)
techniques exist for discovering devices on a network. Passive techniques use a network sniffer to
monitor network traffic and record the IP addresses of the active hosts, and can report which ports are in
use and which operating systems have been discovered on the network. Passive discovery can also
identify the relationships between hosts—including which hosts communicate with each other, how
frequently their communication occurs, and the type of traffic that is taking place—and is usually
performed from a host on the internal network where it can monitor host communications. This is done
without sending out a single probing packet. Passive discovery takes more time to gather information
than does active discovery, and hosts that do not send or receive traffic during the monitoring period
might not be reported.

Active techniques send various types of network packets, such as Internet Control Message Protocol
(ICMP) pings, to solicit responses from network hosts, generally through the use of an automated tool.
One activity, known as OS fingerprinting, enables the assessor to determine the system’s OS by sending it
a mix of normal, abnormal, and illegal network traffic. Another activity involves sending packets to
common port numbers to generate responses that indicate the ports are active. The tool analyzes the
responses from these activities, and compares them with known traits of packets from specific operating
systems and network services—enabling it to identify hosts, the operating systems they run, their ports,
and the state of those ports. This information can be used for purposes that include gathering information
on targets for penetration testing, generating topology maps, determining firewall and IDS configurations,
and discovering vulnerabilities in systems and network configurations.

Network discovery tools have many ways to acquire information through scanning. Enterprise firewalls
and intrusion detection systems can identify many instances of scans, particularly those that use the most
suspicious packets (e.g., SYN/FIN scan, NULL scan). Assessors who plan on performing discovery
through firewalls and intrusion detection systems should consider which types of scans are most likely to
provide results without drawing the attention of security administrators, and how scans can be conducted
in a more stealthy manner (such as more slowly or from a variety of source IP addresses) to improve their
chances of success. Assessors should also be cautious when selecting types of scans to use against older
systems, particularly those known to have weak security, because some scans can cause system failures.
Typically, the closer the scan is to normal activity, the less likely it is to cause operational problems.

Network discovery may also detect unauthorized or rogue devices operating on a network. For example,
an organization that uses only a few operating systems could quickly identify rogue devices that utilize
