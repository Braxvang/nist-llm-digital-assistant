           be possible to reduce the scope of the outsourcing effort to deal exclusively with less
           sensitive data. During a risk assessment, it also may become clear that some other model
           of deployment would be more suitable than a public cloud for the service model and
           application under analysis.

          Assess the Competency of the Cloud Provider. Before awarding a contract for
           outsourced services, the organization should evaluate the cloud provider’s ability and
           commitment to deliver the services over the target timeframe and meet the security and
           privacy levels stipulated. The cloud provider can be asked to demonstrate its capabilities
           and approach to security and privacy enforcement or to undergo an independent
           evaluation of its installation and systems [All88]. Contacting current clients of the cloud
           provider’s services, either identified independently (e.g., other government agencies) or
           provided as references by the cloud provider, and assessing their level of satisfaction in
           areas of security and privacy that are of concern to the organization can also provide
           insight into the competency of the cloud provider. In addition to evaluating thoroughly
           the privacy and security levels of the services to be provided, consideration should be
           given to such items as the following [Len03]:

                   Experience and technical expertise of personnel
                   The vetting process personnel undergo
                   Quality and frequency of security and privacy awareness training provided
                    to personnel
                   Account management practices and accountability
                   The type and effectiveness of the security services provided and
                    underlying mechanisms used
                   The adoption rate of new technologies
                   Change management procedures and processes
                   The cloud provider’s track record
                   The ability of the cloud provider to meet the organization’s security and
                    privacy policy, procedures, and regulatory compliance needs.

5.3       Initiating and Coincident Activities
The organization has a number of activities to carry out in the second stage of outsourcing, when
awarding a contract to a cloud provider and overseeing the terms of the contract throughout its
duration.

          Establish Contractual Obligations. The organization should ensure that all contractual
           requirements are explicitly stated in the service agreement, including privacy and security
           provisions [Gra03, Len03].25 The agreement should include definitions of both the
           organization’s and the cloud provider’s roles and responsibilities. The organization
           should also make certain that any compensating controls it needs to reduce risk to an
