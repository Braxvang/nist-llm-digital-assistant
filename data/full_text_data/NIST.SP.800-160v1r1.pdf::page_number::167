I.2.        Project Assessment and Control
The purpose of the Project Assessment and Control process is to assess if the plans are aligned
and feasible; determine the status of the project, technical, and process performance; and direct
execution to help ensure that the performance is within projected budgets according to plans and
schedules to satisfy technical objectives.

I.2.1. Security Purpose
-      Assess whether the security aspects of plans and security plans are aligned and feasible.
-      Determine the state of the project, technical, and process security performance.
-      Direct execution to help ensure that the security performance is within projected budgets
       according to plans and schedules to satisfy security and other technical objectives.

I.2.2. Security Outcomes
-      Security aspects of performance measures or assessment results are available.
-      Security-relevant roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, authorities, and resources are
       assessed for adequacy.
-      Security aspects of technical progress reviews are performed.
-      Deviations in the security aspects of project performance from plans are analyzed.
-      Affected stakeholders are informed of the security aspects of the projectâ€™s status.
-      Corrective action is directed when project performance or achievement does not meet
       security-relevant targets.
-      Security aspects of project replanning are initiated, as necessary.
-      Security aspects of project action to progress (or not) from one scheduled milestone or event
       to the next are authorized.

I.2.3. Security Activities and Tasks
PA-1      PLAN FOR PROJECT ASSESSMENT AND CONTROL
          PA-1.1 Define the security aspects of the project assessment and control strategy.
          Note 1: This includes the planned security assessment methods and time frames, as well as
          necessary security management and technical reviews.
