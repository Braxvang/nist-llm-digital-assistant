D.1.7 LICENSE MANAGEMENT
Similar to systems and network devices, software and applications are also a relevant data source
for ISCM. Software asset and licensing information may be centrally managed by a software
asset management tool to track license compliance, monitor usage status, and manage the
software asset life cycle. License management tools offer a variety of features to automate
inventory, utilization monitoring and restrictions, deployment, and patches for software and
applications.

The implementation and effective use of license management technologies can assist
organizations in automating the implementation, assessment, and continuous monitoring of
several NIST SP 800-53 security controls including CA-7, Continuous Monitoring; CM-8,
Information System Component Inventory; and SA-6, Software Usage Restrictions.

D.1.8 INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
There are vast quantities of digital information stored across the myriad of systems, network
devices, databases, and other assets within an organization. Managing the location and transfer of
information is essential to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data.

Data loss is the exposure of proprietary, sensitive, or classified information through either data
theft or data leakage. Data theft occurs when data is intentionally stolen or exposed, as in cases of
espionage or employee disgruntlement. Data leakage is the inadvertent exposure of data, as in the
case of a lost or stolen laptop, an employee storing files using an Internet storage application, or
an employee saving files on a USB drive to take home.

An effective data loss prevention (DLP) strategy includes data inventory and classification; data
metric collection; policy development for data creation, use, storage, transmission, and disposal;
and tools to monitor data at rest, in use, and in transit. There are a variety of tools available for
DLP. Typical network and security tools such as network analysis software, application firewalls,
and intrusion detection and prevention systems can be used to monitor data and its contents as it
is transmitted. Specially purposed DLP software also exists with features such as port and
endpoint control, disk and file encryption, and database transaction monitoring. These tools may
be specialized network traffic monitors or software agents installed on desktops, laptops, and
servers. DLP tools have built-in detection and mitigation measures such as alerting via email,
logging activities, and blocking transmissions.

The implementation and effective use of DLP technologies can assist organizations in automating
the implementation, assessment, and continuous monitoring of several NIST SP 800-53 security
controls including AC-4, Information Flow Enforcement; AC-17, Remote Access; CA-3,
Information System Connections; CA-7, Continuous Monitoring; CM-7, Least Functionality; SC-
9, Transmission Confidentiality; and SI-12, Information Output Handling and Retention.

D.1.9 SOFTWARE ASSURANCE
The NIST Software Assurance Metrics and Tool Evaluation (SAMATE) project defines software
assurance as the â€œplanned and systematic set of activities that ensures that software processes and
products conform to requirements, standards, and procedures from NASA Software Assurance
Guidebook and Standard to help achieve:
