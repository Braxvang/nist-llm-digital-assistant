APPENDIX D: IMPACT DETERMINATION FOR MISSION-BASED
    INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS

In general, individual agencies should identify the mission information types processed by their
systems. This Appendix identifies some information types that might be processed by Federal
government organizations. The material includes mission information and potential impacts of
unauthorized disclosure, modification, or unavailability of mission information.

The primary purpose for Federal government information systems is to support provision of
basic services to U.S. citizens and residents. This section addresses information types
associated with both services provided by the Federal government to citizens and mechanisms
used to achieve the purposes of government or deliver services for citizens. Delivery
mechanisms include financial vehicles, direct government delivery, and indirect government
delivery. Federal government missions or delivery mechanisms distributed among 26 mission
areas and modes of delivery are identified in Table D-1. Each mission area and delivery mode
corresponds to a Services to Citizens or Mode of Delivery business area as defined in the BRM
described in the FEA Consolidated Reference Model Document Version 2.3. There is not a one-
to-one mapping of services and delivery modes to government departments and agencies. Some
departments and agencies focus on a single mission. Others support multiple missions within a
mission area. Still others provide services associated with several different mission areas.

An information type is associated with each Federal government mission and delivery mode.
The identity of each information type is defined by the mission with which it is associated.
Some of the management and support functions executed to support delivery of services or
manage government resources are also executed by some agencies in delivering services to
citizens. (See especially the “General Government” functions in Section C.2.8. of Appendix C)
Most of these information types could be included in Appendix D as mission-based information
types. Because the BRM categorizes them as services delivery support functions, they are
included in Volume I, Section 4.1.2 and Appendix C and are not repeated in Appendix D.

The common impact determination factors described in Volume I, Section 4.2.3 and 4.4, also
apply to mission-based information.
