      NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1
      September 2023                                 PIV Card Application Namespace, Data Model, and Representation

559   mandatory BER-TLV structured interindustry data elements: 1) tag 0x4F contains the AID of the
560   PIV Card Application, and 2) tag 0x5F2F lists the PIN Usage Policy.
561          •    Tag 0x4F encodes the PIV Card Application AID as follows:
562                   {'4F 0B A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 10 00 01 00'}
563
564          •    Tag 0x5F2F encodes the PIN Usage Policy in two bytes:
565                   First byte:        Bit 7    is set to 1 to indicate that the mandatory PIV Card Application
566                                               PIN satisfies the PIV Access Control Rules (ACRs) for
567                                               command execution 3 and data object access.
568                                      Bit 6    indicates whether the optional Global PIN satisfies the PIV
569                                               ACRs for command execution and PIV data object access.
570                                      Bit 5    indicates whether the optional OCC satisfies the PIV ACRs for
571                                               command execution and PIV data object access.
572                                      Bit 4    indicates whether the optional VCI is implemented.
573                                      Bit 3    is set to zero if the pairing code is required to establish a VCI
574                                               and is set to one if a VCI is established without a pairing code.
575                                      Bits 8, 2, and 1 of the first byte SHALL be set to zero.
576                   Table 1 lists the acceptable values for the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy and
577                   summarizes the meaning of each value.
578                   The second byte of the PIN Usage Policy encodes the cardholder’s PIN preference for
579                   PIV Cards with both the PIV Card Application PIN and the Global PIN enabled.
580                   Second byte: 0x10 indicates that the PIV Card Application PIN is the primary PIN
581                                     used to satisfy the PIV ACRs for command execution and
582                                     object access.
583                                      0x20     indicates that the Global PIN is the primary PIN used to satisfy
584                                               the PIV ACRs for command execution and object access.
585                   Note: If Bit 6 of the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy is set to zero, then the second
586                   byte is RFU and SHALL be set to 0x00.
587                   PIV Card Applications that implement the VCI or for which the Global PIN or OCC
588                   satisfy the PIV ACRs for PIV data object access and command execution SHALL
589                   implement the Discovery Object.

          Command execution pertains to the VERIFY APDU and, optionally, to the CHANGE REFERENCE DATA APDU.
