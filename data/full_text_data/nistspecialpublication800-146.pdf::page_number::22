                                                                        CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



Although the general implications remain true with an on-site private cloud, the on-site-private scenario
allows for additional and more detailed implications that organizations considering the use of an on-site
private cloud should consider:

 Network dependency (on-site-private). Depending on the configuration (e.g., single physical site,
  protected cloud network), the network dependency for an on-site private cloud may be limited to
  dependence on networking resources over which a consumer has control (e.g., local area networking).
  In this scenario, larger-scale network problems, such as Internet congestion or communications with
  remote Internet Domain Name Servers (DNS) [Moc87-1, Moc87-2] may be avoided.
       If a consumer organization spans multiple physical sites and wishes different sites to access the same
       private cloud, however, the consumer must either provision a controlled inter-site communications
       media, such as an encrypted leased line, or must use cryptography (e.g., with a VPN) over less
       controlled communications media such as the public Internet. Both of these options introduce risks to
       a private cloud's networking availability and security because performance dependencies are
       established to resources that exist off of the consumer's site and that are not directly under the
       consumer's control, and because any failure to implement and configure cryptographic mechanisms
       could allow outsiders access. The consumer organization must also ensure that remote sites are
       maintained at an appropriate security level for the private cloud or that boundary devices are installed
       to prevent inconsistencies in security levels.

 Consumers still need IT skills (on-site-private). Consumer organizations will need the traditional
  IT skills required to manage user devices that access the private cloud, and will require cloud IT skills
  as well. Early in the rollout of an on-site private cloud, consumer organizations may wish to maintain
  parallel cloud and non-cloud operations for an evaluation period. During any such evaluation period,
  traditional IT skills will be required. Even after an evaluation period, however, traditional IT staff
  will be needed (perhaps at reduced levels) to manage legacy licensing agreements, special hardware
  or system requirements, unique security needs for special projects, and legacy investments in
  equipment and training.
       In addition, new skills for working in clouds may be required. For example, an organization that
       performs compute-intensive jobs may need to eventually reorganize those jobs so that they can run
       using a higher level of parallelism on the cloud's resources [Dea04]; an organization that processes
       large data sets in the cloud will need to develop skills with cloud-based storage [Cha06, Ghe03,
       Ama06, SNI10, Msf11]. 9

 Workload locations are hidden from clients (on-site-private). As in the general case, to manage a
  cloud's hardware resources, a private cloud must be able to migrate workloads between machines
  without inconveniencing clients, i.e., without the clients being aware. In some situations, to avoid
  creating a single point of failure, it may also be necessary to provision and operate redundant cloud
  facilities at geographically diverse locations. With an on-site private cloud, however, a consumer
  organization chooses the physical infrastructure in which the private cloud operates, and hence
  determines the possible geographical locations of workloads. While individual clients still may not
  know where their workloads physically exist within the consumer organization's infrastructure at any
  given time, the consumer organization has both visibility and control over where workloads are
  allowed to reside.
 Risks from multi-tenancy (on-site-private). As in the general case, the workloads of different
  clients may reside concurrently on the same systems and local networks, separated only by access
  policies implemented by a cloud provider's software. A flaw in the implementation or in the
