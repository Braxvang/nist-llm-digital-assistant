6.3   Cost and Practical Considerations

    An important cost advantage introduced by coverage measurement is the ability to use
existing test sets, identify particular combinations that may be missing, and supplement
existing tests. In some cases, as in the example of Figure 18, it may be discovered that the
existing test set is already strong with respect to a particular strength t (in this case 2-way),
and tests for t+1 generated. The tradeoff in cost of applying coverage measurement is the
need to map existing tests into discrete numerical values that can be analyzed by the
coverage measurement tools (see Appendix C). For example, the days of the week in the
example of Figure 10 would have to be mapped into 0 - 6 or 1 - 7. Future versions of the
coverage measurement tools may include more flexibility in handling parameter values.

6.4   Chapter Summary

    1. Many coverage measures have been devised for code coverage, including
statement, branch or decision, condition, and modified condition decision coverage. These
measures are based on aspects of source code and are not suitable for combinatorial
coverage measurement.

    2. Measuring configuration-spanning coverage can be helpful in understanding state
space coverage. If we do use combinatorial testing, then configuration-spanning coverage
will be 100% for the level of t that was selected, but we may still want to investigate the
coverage our test set provides for t+1 or t+2. Calculating this statistic can help in choosing
between t-way covering arrays generated by different algorithms. As seen in the examples
above, it may be relatively easy to produce tests that provide a high degree of spanning
coverage, even if not 100%. In many cases it may be possible to generate additional tests
to boost the coverage of a test set.
