Appendix B                                             Frequently Asked Questions


Q. What is the compliance gap?
A. The compliance gap is the difference between the desired and actual compliance
   with the security requirements. For example, if an information system has
   completed 80 percent of certification and accreditation (C&A) activities, that
   investment would have a C&A compliance gap of 20 percent. The actual
   compliance of 80 percent is subtracted from the desired compliance of 100
   percent to yield a 20 percent compliance gap. The smaller the compliance gap,
   the more compliant the system or enterprise control. For key information
   security activities, this information is part of the FISMA report.

Q. What is the corrective action impact?
A. Corrective action impact is the ratio of compliance gap to corrective action cost.
   It is calculated by dividing the compliance gap percentage by the cost to
   implement the corresponding corrective action(s). This ratio provides a
   proportion of result to cost. The higher the impact proportion, the more “bang
   for the buck” the corrective action will provide. The resulting proportion is
   multiplied by 100,000 to facilitate further calculations.




Q. What is the Exhibit 300?
A. The Exhibit 300 is the capture mechanism for all of the analyses and activities
   required for full internal (investment review board [IRB], Office of the Chief
   Information Officer [OCIO]) review. More importantly, the Exhibit 300 is the
   document that OMB uses to assess investments and ultimately make funding
   decisions. This document provides OMB with a robust assessment of the
   investment and is the vehicle for IT investments to justify life cycle and annual
   funding requests to OMB.

Q. What is the Exhibit 53?
A. The Exhibit 53 provides an overview of the agency’s entire IT portfolio by listing
   every IT investment, life cycle, and budget-year cost information. In addition to
   containing all investments with Exhibit 300s, the Exhibit 53 contains other IT
   investments that do not have Exhibit 300s (for example, legacy systems with
   costs below agency thresholds).

Q. What is the relationship between Exhibit 53 and Exhibit 300?
A. OMB evaluates an agency’s Exhibit 53 and Exhibit 300s and determines
   appropriate funding amounts for the budget year based on the justification
   articulated. Even though the Exhibit 53 and Exhibit 300s are submitted to OMB
   each September, the budgeting process is not confined to the late summer
   months. Planning, acquiring, and executing information security budgets are
   year-round activities.
