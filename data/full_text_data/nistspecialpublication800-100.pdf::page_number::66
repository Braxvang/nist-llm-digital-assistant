CHAPTER 6                                                                   Interconnecting Systems


Annex 6.B ISA Checklist
   This annex provides a generic checklist that agencies may use in developing their
ISAs to ensure that they have discussed requirements covered in this section.


                                      ISA CHECKLIST                                             YES        NO
1   ISA Requirements:
A   Is there a formal requirement and justification for connecting two systems?
B   Are there two systems being interconnected?
           If YES, have the systems been specified?
           If NO, the two systems need to be specified.
C   Is there a list of benefits of required interconnection(s)?
D   Is the agency name or organization that initiated the requirement listed?
2   System Security Considerations:
A   Has a security certification and accreditation of the system been completed?
B   Has the security certification and accreditation status been verified?
C   Are there security features in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and
    availability of the data and the systems being interconnected?
D   Has each systemâ€™s security categorization been identified per FIPS 199?
E   Have minimum controls been identified for each system in accordance with
    NIST SP 800-53?
F   Have both parties answered each subject item regardless if the subjected item only
    affects one party?
    If No, both parties must go back and answer each item.
G   Is there a general description of the information/data being made available, exchanged,
    or passed?
H   Is there a description of the information services (e.g., e-mail, file transfer protocol,
    database query, file query, general computational services) offered over the
    interconnected system by each participating organization?
I   Have system users been identified and has an approval been put in place?
J   Is there a description of all system security technical services pertinent to the secure
    exchange of information/data among and between the systems in question?
K   Are there documented rules of behavior for users of each system in the
    interconnection?
L   Are there titles of the formal security policy(ies) that govern each system?
M   Are there procedures for incidents related to the interconnection?
N   Are there audit requirements?
3   Topological Drawing:
A   Is there a descriptive technical specification for the connections?
4   Signatory Authority: ISA is valid for one year after the last date on either
    signature below. At that time, it will be reviewed, updated if necessary, and
    revalidated. This agreement may be terminated upon 30 days advanced notice
    by either party or in the event of a security exception that would necessitate an
    immediate response.
