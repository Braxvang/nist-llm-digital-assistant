NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            A general personnel security program should address policy, position
            risk designations, personnel screening, terminations, transfers, access
            agreements, and third-party roles and responsibilities. OT personnel
            should communicate with human resources, IT, and physical security to
            ensure that personnel security requirements are being met.
            An organization should consider establishing an access agreement and
            request form for managing physical and/or logical access to OT
            equipment. Organizations should also screen the personnel assigned to
            critical positions who control and maintain the OT.
            Additionally, each employee should receive training that is relevant to
            and necessary for their job functions. Employees should demonstrate
            competence in their job functions to retain physical and logical access to
            OT. Organizations should consider adopting a framework, such as the
            National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Framework, for
            training their OT personnel.

6.2.9. Wireless Communications
Wireless communications utilize radio frequency (RF) to support data transmission. This can
include a Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) local area network communication based on IEEE 802.11
protocols and may also include cellular or other radio-based communications. RF-based
communications provide enhanced flexibility over traditional physical (i.e., wired)
communication capabilities. However, RF communications are also more susceptible to
interference and may allow unauthorized personnel to eavesdrop.
Supplemental guidance for wireless communications can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-97, Establishing Wireless Robust Security Networks: A Guide to IEEE
       802.11i
   •   NIST SP 800-121, Rev. 2, Guide to Bluetooth Security
   •   NIST SP 800-153, Guidelines for Securing Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)
   •   NIST SP 800-187, Guide to LTE Security
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            The use of temporary or permanent wireless communication within an
            OT is a risk-based decision determined by the organization. Generally,
            devices that utilize wireless communication should be placed in a
            separate network segment and only be deployed where the residual risks
            to health, safety, the environment, and finances are low.
            Prior to installation, a wireless survey should be performed to identify
            antenna locations and signal strength for adequate coverage and to
            minimize the exposure of the wireless network to interference from OT
            environmental factors and eavesdropping. Attackers typically use
