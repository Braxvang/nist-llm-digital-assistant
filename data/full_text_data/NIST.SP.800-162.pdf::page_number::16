                                                                                             certain RBAC architectures where dynamic access control decisions are required. Trying to implement
                                                                                             these kinds of access control decisions would require the creation of numerous roles that are ad hoc and
                                                                                             limited in membership, leading to what is often termed “role explosion”.

                                                                                             A method is needed to make AC decisions without previous knowledge of the object by the subject or

                                                                                             be directly assigned to individual subjects prior to a request to perform an operation on the object.

                                                                                             roles and groups would be time consuming and complex. Leveraging consistently defined attributes that
                                                                                             span both subjects and objects, authentication and authorization activities can be executed and
                                                                                             administered in the same or separate infrastructures, while maintaining appropriate levels of security.

                                                                                             ABAC has been described in various ways. For example, one early paper on web services states that
                                                                                             ABAC “grants accesses to services based on the attributes possessed by the requester” [WWJ04], while a
                                                                                             discussion of security in geographic information systems describes ABAC as an approach in which
                                                                                             “attribute values associated with users determine the association of users with privileges” [CGLO09].

                                                                                             Still another paper summarizes ABAC as a model that is “based on subject, object, and environment
                                                                                             attributes and supports both mandatory and discretionary access control needs” [YT05]. In these and other
