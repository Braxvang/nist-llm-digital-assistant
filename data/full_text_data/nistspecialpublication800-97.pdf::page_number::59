                                           ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I

5.3.1    Establishing a Security Policy

During the discovery phase, STAs and APs negotiate the following key security capabilities:

      Confidentiality and integrity protocols for protecting unicast traffic
      Authentication method for mutual authentication of the AP and AS
      Cryptographic key management approach
      Pre-authentication capabilities (described in more detail in Section 5.4.4).
Confidentiality and integrity protocols for protecting multicast/broadcast traffic are dictated by the AP,
since all STAs in a multicast group must use the same cipher suite.

The specification of the confidentiality and integrity protocol, along with the chosen key length (if
variable), is known as the cipher suite. The same cipher suite options are available for protecting unicast
traffic and multicast and broadcast traffic. 52 The possible cipher suites allowed by the IEEE 802.11i
amendment are as follows:

      WEP, with either a 40-bit or 104-bit key
      TKIP
      CCMP, which is the default choice according to the 802.11i standard. In practice, many existing
       devices default to TKIP.
52
     The WEP cipher suites are only valid as a group cipher suite in a Transition Security Network to allow pre-RSNA devices to
     join a BSS. They are not valid in an RSN.
