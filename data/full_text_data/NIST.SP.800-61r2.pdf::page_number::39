                                                                                 COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE



 Keep All Host Clocks Synchronized. Protocols such as the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
  synchronize clocks among hosts.35 Event correlation will be more complicated if the devices reporting
  events have inconsistent clock settings. From an evidentiary standpoint, it is preferable to have
  consistent timestamps in logs—for example, to have three logs that show an attack occurred at
  12:07:01 a.m., rather than logs that list the attack as occurring at 12:07:01, 12:10:35, and 11:07:06.
 Maintain and Use a Knowledge Base of Information. The knowledge base should include
  information that handlers need for referencing quickly during incident analysis. Although it is
  possible to build a knowledge base with a complex structure, a simple approach can be effective. Text
  documents, spreadsheets, and relatively simple databases provide effective, flexible, and searchable
  mechanisms for sharing data among team members. The knowledge base should also contain a
  variety of information, including explanations of the significance and validity of precursors and
  indicators, such as IDPS alerts, operating system log entries, and application error codes.
 Use Internet Search Engines for Research. Internet search engines can help analysts find
  information on unusual activity. For example, an analyst may see some unusual connection attempts
  targeting TCP port 22912. Performing a search on the terms “TCP,” “port,” and “22912” may return
  some hits that contain logs of similar activity or even an explanation of the significance of the port
  number. Note that separate workstations should be used for research to minimize the risk to the
  organization from conducting these searches.
 Run Packet Sniffers to Collect Additional Data. Sometimes the indicators do not record enough
  detail to permit the handler to understand what is occurring. If an incident is occurring over a
  network, the fastest way to collect the necessary data may be to have a packet sniffer capture network
  traffic. Configuring the sniffer to record traffic that matches specified criteria should keep the volume
  of data manageable and minimize the inadvertent capture of other information. Because of privacy
  concerns, some organizations may require incident handlers to request and receive permission before
  using packet sniffers.
 Filter the Data. There is simply not enough time to review and analyze all the indicators; at
  minimum the most suspicious activity should be investigated. One effective strategy is to filter out
  categories of indicators that tend to be insignificant. Another filtering strategy is to show only the
  categories of indicators that are of the highest significance; however, this approach carries substantial
  risk because new malicious activity may not fall into one of the chosen indicator categories.
 Seek Assistance from Others. Occasionally, the team will be unable to determine the full cause and
  nature of an incident. If the team lacks sufficient information to contain and eradicate the incident,
  then it should consult with internal resources (e.g., information security staff) and external resources
  (e.g., US-CERT, other CSIRTs, contractors with incident response expertise). It is important to
  accurately determine the cause of each incident so that it can be fully contained and the exploited
  vulnerabilities can be mitigated to prevent similar incidents from occurring.
3.2.5     Incident Documentation

An incident response team that suspects that an incident has occurred should immediately start recording
all facts regarding the incident.36 A logbook is an effective and simple medium for this,37 but laptops,


35
     More information on NTP is available at http://www.ntp.org/.
36
     Incident handlers should log only the facts regarding the incident, not personal opinions or conclusions. Subjective material
     should be presented in incident reports, not recorded as evidence.
37
     If a logbook is used, it is preferable that the logbook is bound and that the incident handlers number the pages, write in ink,
     and leave the logbook intact (i.e., do not rip out any pages).
