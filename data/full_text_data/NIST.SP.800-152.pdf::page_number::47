6 Cryptographic Algorithms, Keys, and Metadata
6.1    Cryptographic Algorithms and Keys

Cryptographic algorithms and their keys can be categorized according to their properties and
uses. Algorithms and keys can be categorized as being symmetric (with secret keys) or
asymmetric (with key pairs, one being public and the other private). Keys can be static (i.e.,
long term) or ephemeral (i.e., typically used only for a single secure session or key
management transaction). Cryptographic algorithms can be used for signature generation,
signature verification, data integrity, entity identity verification, information encryption and
decryption, and random number generation (RNG). Each type of cryptographic algorithm
requires a type of key appropriate for that algorithm and its current application. Key uses
include signature, authentication, encryption/decryption, key wrapping, random number
generation (RNG), master key, key transport, key agreement, and authorization. General
requirements relating to cryptographic algorithms and key strengths have been addressed in
Section 2.1.

The Framework provides a list of twenty-one key types (shown below in Table 1) and a short
description of each key type.
