management console. This information is reviewed by security staff to determine if a valid security
breach has taken place. An IDS performs a variety of functions:

  Monitor user and system activity
  Audit system configuration and vulnerabilities
  Assess integrity of critical system and data files
  Recognize activity patterns reflecting known attacks
  Perform statistical analyses for abnormal activity patterns
  Provide operating system audit trail management, with recognition of user activity reflecting policy
   violations
  Provide customized reports.
This ongoing monitoring and assessment is a necessary part of an overall security architecture. IDSs
generally improve the integrity of other parts of the information security infrastructure by identifying
specific indications of a possible attack and causing a reexamination of defenses. They can often trace
user activity from the point of entry into the network to point of exit. IDSs can recognize specific types
of attacks and alert appropriate staff (if configured to do so).

Intrusion Detection Services

To be effective, intrusion detection requires a robust knowledge base of attack signatures against which
the IDS can tally its findings. Threats and vulnerabilities are not static in nature and are continuously
changing and evolving. The attack signatures database should be updated frequently for the IDS to be
able to detect the most recent threats. Service providers may have greater leverage to accomplish this at
less cost because several customers can share the overhead of maintaining the database for a single IDS
product. IDSs require a high level of expertise to operate and manage. If the nature of the intrusion is
such that the IDS or the service provider is incapable of resolving the matter or the contract does not
require the service provider to resolve the problem, the service provider can contact the organization,
which in turn escalates the case for resolution.

5.3.3    Public Key Infrastructure

Modern security architectures protect and distribute information that is needed in a widely distributed
environment, where the users, resources, and stakeholders may all be in different places at different
      10
times. PKI is an approach (consisting of products, services, facilities, policies, procedures, agreements,
and people) that addresses these security needs and makes use of the scalable and distributed
characteristics of PKI. PKI allows organizations to conduct business electronically with the confidence
that:

  The person or process identified as sending the transaction is actually the originator (nonrepudiation)
  The person or process receiving the transaction is the intended recipient (identification and
   authentication)
  Data integrity has not been compromised (integrity).
