NIST SP 800-85A-4                                       PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                 INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

C.3.1.2        Contactless Interface
 Purpose              Validates that the PUT DATA command cannot be issued through
                      the contactless interface.
 Reference(s)         1. SP 800-73-4 Part 2, Table 2
                      2. AS05.03
 Precondition(s)      1. The existing values of all data objects have been recorded.
                      2. The IUT is placed within the reading range of the contactless
                          reader.
                      3. There exists a valid PC/SC connection between the test system
                          and the contactless reader.
                      4. No other contactless card is within the proximity of the reader.
 Test Scenario        1. Send SELECT card command with
                         • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 10 00 01 00'
                      2. Repeat steps 1-17 of C.3.1.1
 Expected Result(s)   1. The command returns the application property template with the
                         status word '90 00' at the end.
                      2. The commands return an error status word for referenced steps
                         1-17.
 Postcondition(s)     The data container values remain unchanged.

C.3.1.3        Secure Messaging Interface
 Purpose              Validates that the PUT DATA command cannot be issued through
                      the secure messaging interface.
 Reference(s)         1. SP 800-73-4 Part 2, Table 2
                      2. AS05.03
 Precondition(s)      1. The existing values of all data objects have been recorded.
                      2. The IUT is placed within the reading range of the contactless
                         reader.
                      3. There exists a valid PC/SC connection between the test system
                         and the contactless reader.
                      4. No other contactless card is within the proximity of the reader.
                      5. Secure messaging session keys have been established and secure
                         messaging is used in the test scenario.
 Test Scenario        1. Send SELECT card command without secure messaging with
                         • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 10 00 01 00'
                      2. Repeat steps 1-17 of C.3.1.1 using the '0C' CLA byte
 Expected Result(s)   1. The command returns the application property template with the
                         status word '90 00' at the end.
                      2. The commands return an error status word for referenced steps
                         1-17.
 Postcondition(s)     The data container values remain unchanged.
