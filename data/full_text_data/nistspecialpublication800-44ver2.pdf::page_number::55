                                                                 GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



 Identify who should be responsible for creating, publishing, and maintaining this particular
  information

 Create or format information for Web publishing

 Review the information for sensitivity and distribution/release controls (including the sensitivity of
  the information in aggregate)

 Determine the appropriate access and security controls

 Publish information

 Verify published information

 Periodically review published information to confirm continued compliance with organizational
  guidelines.

Any policy or process for determining and approving the information to be published on a Web server can
benefit from the use of automated tools. Tools can scan incoming content for keywords, formatting, or
metadata, and flag it for review, easing the burden of those required to verify content. Similarly, an
internal automated system that allows users to post potential material to an internal Web site and notifies
approving personnel (possibly via e-mail) of the posting allows material to be reviewed and posted to the
public Web site more quickly through a repeatable process. Using an automated system also aids
accountability because logs track who submitted the document and who approved it.

An often-overlooked area of Web content is the information sometimes hidden within the source code of
a Web page. This information can be viewed from any Web browser using the “view source code” menu
option. The source code can, for example, contain points of contact and reveal portions of the directory
structure of the Web server. Organizations often do not pay attention to the contents of the source code
on their Web sites, even though this code may contain sensitive information. Attackers scour not only the
obvious content of the Web site but also details within the source code. Thus, Web administrators or
Webmasters should periodically review code on their public Web server.

6.2   Observing Regulations about the Collection of Personal Information

Federal and state laws and regulations apply to the collection of user information on publicly accessible
government Web sites. In addition, many government agencies have privacy guidelines that address the
type of information that could be collected about users. Governmental organizations with Web sites
should be aware of the appropriate and applicable laws, regulations, and agency guidelines. Private
organizations may wish to use these guidelines and examples of sound security practices but should
consult appropriate legal counsel and their privacy officials for the applicable legal and policy
implications. However, Federal laws, regulations, and applicable agency guidelines do apply to
commercial organizations that operate Web sites on behalf of Federal agencies. Organizations should be
aware of changes to legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements and seek advice from knowledgeable
legal and policy experts.

Federal agencies that collect PII must do so in accordance with Federal law and the Constitution. The
Privacy Act, for example, requires agencies to minimize the information collected to that which is
