                                 GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



Appendix A—Scenarios for PII Identification and Handling

Exercises involving PII scenarios within an organization provide an inexpensive and effective way to
build skills necessary to identify potential issues with how the organization identifies and safeguards PII.
Individuals who participate in these exercises are presented with a brief PII scenario and a list of general
and specific questions related to the scenario. After reading the scenario, the group then discusses each
question and determines the most appropriate response for their organization. The goal is to determine
what the participants would really do and to compare that with policies, procedures, and generally
recommended practices to identify any discrepancies or deficiencies and decide upon appropriate
mitigation techniques.

The general questions listed below are applicable to almost any PII scenario. After the general questions
are scenarios, each of which is followed by additional scenario-specific questions. Organizations are
encouraged to adapt these questions and scenarios for use in their own PII exercises. Also, additional
scenarios and questions specific to PII incident handling are available from NIST SP 800-61 Revision 1,
Computer Security Incident Handling Guide.80

A.1       General Questions

     1. What procedures are in place to identify, assess, and protect the PII described in the scenario?

     2. Which individuals have designated responsibilities within the organization to safeguard the PII
        described in the scenario?

     3. To which people and groups within the organization should questions about PII or the possible
        misuse of PII be reported?

     4. What could happen if the PII described in the scenario is not safeguarded properly?

A.2       Scenarios

Scenario 1: A System Upgrade

An organization is redesigning and upgrading its physical access control systems, which consist of entry-
way consoles that recognize ID badges, along with identity management systems and other components.
As part of the redesign, several individual physical access control systems are being consolidated into a
single system that catalogues and recognizes biometric template data (a facial image and fingerprint),
employee name, employee identification number (an internal identification number used by the
organization) and employee SSN. The new system will also contain scanned copies of ―identity‖
documentation, including birth certificates, driver‘s licenses, and/or passports. In addition, the system
will maintain a log of all access (authorized or unauthorized) attempts by a badge. The log contains
employee identification numbers and timestamps for each access attempt.

     1. What information in the system is PII?

     2. What is the PII confidentiality impact level? What factors were taken into consideration when
        making this determination?
