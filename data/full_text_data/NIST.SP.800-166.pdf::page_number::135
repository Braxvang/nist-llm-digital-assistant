                          3. From Step 4, the certificatePolicies extension asserts the id-

9.3.4.6 Extended Key Usage

 Test Assertion           TA-09.03.04.06
 Purpose                  Verifies the Derived PIV Credential Issuer’s (content signing)
                          certificate asserts the appropriate OID in the extended key usage
                          extension.
 DTR(s)                   • DTR-07.03.04.07
 Issuer Documentation     None.

 Precondition(s)          •   A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                              appropriate token reader.
                          •   Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                              an instance of the reader.
                          •   A Security Object is present within the Derived PIV
                              Application.
 Test Scenario            1. Send the SELECT command with
                                • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                          2. Send the GET DATA command with
                                • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                   ('5FC106') of the Security Object
                          3. Extract and parse the certificates field contents
                             from the Security Object.
                          4. Extract the value of the extKeyUsage extension from
                             the certificate.
 Expected Result(s)       1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                             template with the status word '90 00'.
                          2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                             along with the status word '90 00'.
                          3. From Step 4, the extended key usage extension asserts the id-
                             PIV-content-signing OID, indicating that the certificate is
                             authorized to sign PIV data objects.

9.3.4.7 Authority Information Access Extension

 Test Assertion           TA-09.03.04.07
 Purpose                  Verifies the authority information access extension in the Derived
                          PIV Credential Issuer’s (content signing) certificate is populated
                          appropriately and contains the id-ad-caIssuers (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2)
                          accessMethod, which points to the location where the certificates
                          issued to the issuer of this certificate can be found.
