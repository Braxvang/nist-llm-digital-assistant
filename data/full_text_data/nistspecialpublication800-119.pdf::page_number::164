                                                                GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


Another area the pilot should address is the validation of tunnel performance. A mixed IPv4/IPv6
environment uses tunnels to connect the islands of similar protocol equipment. The performance of these
tunnels affects the user experience, availability, and scalability of the network. Each transition
mechanism has different performance characteristics. Before the pilot begins, the enterprise architecture
team should select the appropriate mechanism based on functionality, performance, and the capabilities of
the communicating peers. The testing of tunnels requires a realistic environment.

The final area the pilot should address is baseline transition mechanisms. Translation is performed in
software and incurs a performance penalty.

In addition to developing the ―to be‖ and transition enterprise architectures and running the IPv6 pilot, the
other activities of the acquisition and development phase include:

        Developing a risk assessment.
        Developing a sequencing plan for IPv6 implementation.
        Developing IPv6 related policies and enforcement mechanisms.
        Developing training material for stakeholders.
        Developing and implementing a test plan for IPv6 compatibility/interoperability.
IPv6 Enterprise Architecture introduces new risks into the current environment. These risks can be the
result of many different factors, including reduced security coverage, new IPv6 features, lack of IPv6
experience, degraded performance, and dual operations. A formal risk assessment must be performed
with a risk mitigation strategy to address the identified risks. The risk assessment drives several other
deliverables, including the security plan and certification and accreditation.

The transition to IPv6 offers a clean slate in implementing ingress and egress firewall rules.
Organizations should have few IPv6 source or destination addresses that traverse the perimeter.
Organizations, at this point, should be able to implement a deny all, permit by exception IPv6 firewall
policy. In the future, as new external connections are required, either in bound or out bound, they can be
documented and allowed by exception.



As the transition enterprise architecture is developed, a transition plan must also be developed. The
transition plan details which equipment and servers are to be transitioned and in which order. The
transition plan, which includes a coexistence plan, drives the project plan. The coexistence plan
documents the type of transition mechanism used to connect islands of like protocol hosts and will also
document the translation mechanisms for enterprise services.

Existing policies must be reviewed to determine whether they provide adequate coverage for IPv6. New
policies should be developed to address IPv6 specific areas or areas where IPv6 has a significant impact.
Senior leadership should support the new policies and sign off on them. Once policies are established,
standards, procedures, and guidelines can be developed to provide guidance for equipment configuration
and operation. The procurement policies should be amended early in the transition to require that all new
equipment introduced to the environment support IPv6. This requirement should include both equipment
that is lifecycle replacement and equipment introducing new capabilities. In many cases, existing policies
can simply be amended.

IPv6 affects a broad range of support and operations personnel. During the acquisition and development
