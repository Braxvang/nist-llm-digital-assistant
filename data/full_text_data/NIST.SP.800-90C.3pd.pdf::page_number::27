      NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                                                          Recommendation for RBG Constructions

729   The Instantiate_function (shown in Figure 4) is used to instantiate a DRBG at the
730   requested_instantiation_security_strength using the output of a randomness source 5 and an
731   optional personalization_string to create seed material. A prediction_resistance flag may be used
732   to indicate whether subsequent Generate_function calls may request prediction resistance. As
733   stated in Section 2.4.1, a personalization_string is optional but strongly recommended. (Details
734   about the Instantiate_function are provided in [SP800-90A].)
735   If the returned status code for the Instantiate_function indicates a success (i.e., the DRBG has
736   been instantiated at the requested security strength), a state handle may 6 be returned to indicate the
737   particular DRBG instance. When provided, the state handle will be used in subsequent calls to the
738   DRBG (e.g., during a Generate_function call) to identify the internal state information for the
739   instantiation. The information in the internal state includes the security strength of the instantiation,
740   the number of times that the instantiation has produced output, and other information that changes
741   during DRBG execution (see [SP800-90A] for each DRBG design).
742   When the DRBG has been instantiated at the requested_instantiation_security_strength, the
743   DRBG will operate at that security strength even if the requested_security_strength in subsequent
744   Generate_function calls (see Section 2.8.1.2) is less than the instantiated security strength.
745   If the status code indicates an error and an implementation is designed to return a state handle, an
746   invalid (e.g., Null) state handle shall be returned.

747   2.8.1.2.                 DRBG Generation Request
748   Pseudorandom bits are generated after DRBG instantiation using the following call:
749             (status, returned_bits) = Generate_function(state_handle, requested_number_of_bits,
750                 requested_security_strength, prediction_resistance_request, additional_input).




      5
          The randomness source provides the randomness input required to instantiate the security strength of the DRBG.
      6
          In cases where only one instantiation of a DRBG will ever exist, a state handle need not be returned since only one internal state will be created.
