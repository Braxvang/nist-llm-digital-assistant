Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of disaster repair and
restoration information on the ability of responsible agencies to conduct cleanup and restoration
activities that take place after a disaster. This involves the cleanup and rebuilding of any homes,
buildings, roads, environmental resources, or infrastructure that may be damaged due to a
disaster. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most disaster repair and restoration
information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for disaster repair and restoration information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of disaster repair and restoration
information depends on whether the information is time-critical.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications
(e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the
agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most disaster repair and restoration information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to disaster repair and restoration
information. Generally, missions supported by disaster repair and restoration information are
tolerant of delay.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
disaster repair and restoration information is low.

D.4.4 Emergency Response Information Type

Emergency Response involves the immediate actions taken to respond to a disaster (e.g., wildfire
management). These actions include providing mobile telecommunications, operational support,
power generation, search and rescue, and medical life saving actions. Impacts to emergency
response information and the information systems that process and store emergency response
information could result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within the
critical emergency services infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations tasked
with emergency response missions. The recommended provisional categorization of the
emergency response information type follows:
