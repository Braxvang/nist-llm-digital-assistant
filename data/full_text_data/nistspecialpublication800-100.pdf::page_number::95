step process, whereby Steps 4, 5, and 6 of the process are combined to create the
Risk Analysis step (see Figures 10-2 and 10-3). Depicted in Figure 10-2, below, is a
high-level depiction of risk assessment process.
    The likelihood of a given threat successfully exploiting a given vulnerability is
estimated by evaluating the threat source’s motivation, opportunity, and methods for
conducting such an exploitation. The impact of a successful exploitation is estimated
through an analysis of the effect the exploitation can have on the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of the system and the data it processes. The determination
of the criticality and sensitivity of the system, in terms of its confidentiality, integrity,
and availability, is found by applying the concepts and processes discussed in detail
within FIPS 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and
Information Systems.
   As mandated by OMB Circular A-130, the risk assessment process is usually
repeated at least every three years for federal agencies. However, risk assessments
should be conducted and integrated into the SDLC for information systems, not
because it is required by law or regulation, but because it is a good practice and
supports the organization’s business objectives or mission.

10.1.1 Step 1 – System Characterization
   Characterizing an information system establishes the scope of the risk
assessment effort, delineates the operational authorization (or accreditation)
boundaries, and provides information (e.g., hardware, software, system connectivity,
and responsible division or support personnel). This step begins with the
identification of the information system boundaries, resources, and information.
    When characterizing the system, the mission criticality and sensitivity (as
previously identified using FIPS 199 to determine the system’s appropriate security
categorization) are described in sufficient terms to form a basis for the scope of the
risk assessment. The level of effort and the granularity (i.e., the level of depth to
which the assessment investigates the security of the system) of the risk assessment
are based on the FIPS 199 security categorization. For example, a system
determined to be of low impact may not require hands-on security testing and
evaluation. Various techniques, such as questionnaires, interviews, documentation
reviews, and automated scanning tools, can be used to collect the information
