       NIST SP 800-157r1 ipd                             Derived PIV Credentials (Initial Public Draft)
       January 2023


989    C.2. Example Binding of a Derived PIV Credential at AAL3
990    An employee requires a derived PIV credential to access a relying party using one or
991    more endpoints that do not accommodate the direct use of a PIV Card. The employee
992    requests a non-PKI-based authenticator capable of authentication at AAL3 and approval
993    to use that authenticator as a derived PIV credential. The request is approved by the
994    agency’s approval authority.
995    After receiving the approval and authenticator, the employee starts the binding process
996    by authenticating with their PIV Card at a derived PIV credential website operated by
997    or on behalf of the PIV cardholder’s home agency. The employee additionally provides
998    a biometric sample that can be verified against their PIV Card. The website requires
999    TLS client authentication using the PIV authentication certificate on the employee’s PIV
1000   Card. The employee then inserts (connects) the authenticator to be used as a derived
1001   PIV credential and registers (binds) that credential, including establishing a second
1002   authentication factor (activation secret or biometric characteristic) if that has not already
1003   been done. The website determines whether the authenticator meets AAL3 requirements.
1004   Upon successful registration, the subscriber’s key and appropriate metadata are stored
1005   for use by the home agency’s endpoint for non-PKI-based PIV authentication. The PIV
1006   Card issuer enters information about the new derived PIV credential into the subscriber’s
1007   PIV identity account. The cardholder is notified of the binding of the new derived PIV
1008   credential.
1009   If the authenticator uses verifier name binding as described in [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.2.5.2,
1010   the website used to register the authenticator has to share the same domain name as will
1011   be used by the home agency to authenticate the subscriber so that the same keys are used
1012   for registration and authentication.
