       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                          Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

2619   If status â‰  SUCCESS (e.g., the entropy source has failed), entropy_bitstring is an empty (e.g., null)
2620   bitstring, the DRBG is not reseeded, and a FAILURE status is returned from Reseed_function to
2621   the calling application (e.g., the Generate_function).

2623   Appendix C. Addendum to SP 800-90A: Instantiating and Reseeding a CTR_DRBG

2624   C.1.         Background and Scope
2625   The CTR_DRBG, specified in [SP800-90A], uses the block cipher AES and has two versions that
2626   may be implemented: with or without a derivation function.
2627   When a derivation function is not used, SP 800-90A requires the use of bitstrings with full entropy
2628   for instantiating and reseeding a CTR_DRBG. This addendum permits the use of an RBG
2629   compliant with SP 800-90C to provide the required seed material for the CTR_DRBG when
2630   implemented as specified in SP 800-90C (see Appendix C.2).
2631   When a derivation function is used in a CTR_DRBG implementation, SP 800-90A specifies the
2632   use of the block cipher derivation function. This addendum modifies the requirements in SP 800-
2633   90A for the CTR_DRBG by specifying two additional derivation functions that may be used
2634   instead of the block cipher derivation function (see Appendix C.3).

2635   C.2.         CTR_DRBG without a Derivation Function
2636   When a derivation function is not used, SP 800-90A requires that seedlen full-entropy bits be
2637   provided as the randomness input (e.g., from an entropy source that provides full-entropy output),
2638   where seedlen is the length of the key to be used by the CTR_DRBG plus the length of the output
2639   block. 39 SP 800-90C includes an approved method for externally conditioning the output of an
2640   entropy source to provide a bitstring with full entropy when using an entropy source that does not
2641   provide full-entropy output.
2642   SP 800-90C also permits the use of seed material from an RBG when the DRBG to be instantiated
2643   and reseeded is implemented and used as specified in SP 800-90C.

2644   C.3.         CTR_DRBG using a Derivation Function
2645   When a derivation function is used within a CTR_DRBG, SP 800-90A specifies the use of the
2646   Block_cipher_df included in that document during instantiation and reseeding to adjust the length
2647   of the seed material to seedlen bits, where
2648                             seedlen = the security strength + the block length.
2649   For AES, seedlen = 256, 320 or 384 bits (see [SP800-90A], Rev. 1). During generation, the length
2650   of any additional input provided during the generation request is adjusted to seedlen bits as well
2651   (see SP 800-90A).

            128 bits for AES.
