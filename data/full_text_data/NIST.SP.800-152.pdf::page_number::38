SP 800-152                                                  A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


   c) Unobservability assures that an attacker is unable to identify or infer the existence of
      a transaction and the identities of the entities that initiate or participate in the
      transaction.
FR:4.7 The CKMS design shall specify the anonymity, unlinkability, and unobservability
policies that can be supported by the CKMS.

4.9.1 Anonymity
An FCKMS often requires information about the identity of entities participating in FCKMS
transactions (e.g., to determine the keys to be used); an entity assuming the audit role may
also require this information. However, an FCKMS could protect the anonymity of the
entities operating in the user role when viewed by entities assuming non-audit roles and
entities not involved in the transactions. Since personal accountability is required at the
Moderate and High impact-levels, anonymity can only be provided at the Low impact-level.

FR:4.8 The CKMS design shall specify which CKMS transactions have or can be provided
with anonymity protection.

FR:4.9 The CKMS design shall specify how CKMS transaction anonymity is achieved when
anonymity assurance is provided.

                           A Federal CKMS shall not provide anonymity for Moderate
PR:4.13
                           or High impact-level data.
                           When anonymity is provided, a Federal CKMS shall assure
PR:4.14
                           that a key ownerâ€™s true identity cannot be determined when
                           viewed by entities assuming non-audit roles and entities not
                           involved in the transactions.

4.9.2 Unlinkability
An FCKMS may need to link FCKMS transactions together, e.g., a transaction that requests
the generation of a key, and another that uses it; an entity assuming the audit role may also
require this information. However, an FCKMS could provide unlinkability protection of
FCKMS transactions such that entities cannot be linked to initiating or participating in an
FCKMS transaction when viewed from outside the FCKMS or by entities assuming non-
audit roles within the FCKMS that are not involved in those transactions.

FR:4.10 The CKMS design shall specify which CKMS transactions have or can be provided
with unlinkability protection.

FR:4.11 The CKMS design shall specify how CKMS transaction unlinkability is achieved.

                           When unlinkability is required, a Federal CKMS shall assure
PR:4.15
                           that unauthorized entities within the system cannot link two
                           or more transactions with each other or with the participants
                           in the transactions.
