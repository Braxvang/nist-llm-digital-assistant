NIST SP 800-156                                              REPRESENTATION OF PIV CHAIN-OF-TRUST
                                                                           FOR IMPORT AND EXPORT


1     Introduction

1.1   Background

The Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 [HSPD12] called for a common
identification standard to be adopted governing the interoperable use of identity
credentials to allow physical and logical access to federal government locations and
systems. The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201 [FIPS201], “Personal
Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors,” was developed as the
standard for the identity credentials hosted on a smart card called the PIV Card.
[FIPS201] defines the identity proofing, registration, and issuance requirements for
issuing PIV Cards to Federal Government employees and contractors.

Data collected during identity proofing, registration, and issuance may be maintained in a
chain-of-trust record. As per FIPS 201-2, “a card issuer may optionally maintain, for each
PIV Card issued, a documentary chain-of-trust for the identification data it collects. The
chain-of-trust is a sequence of related enrollment data records that are created and
maintained through the methods of contemporaneous acquisition of data within each
enrollment data record, and biometric matching of samples between enrollment data
records.”

The chain-of-trust offers process efficiencies because a PIV Card can be re-issued based
on the most current chain-of-trust record, and more importantly, can avoid having to
repeat the identity proofing and re-registration (re-enrollment) process. Departments and
agencies that implement a chain-of-trust will also be able to transfer the record to another
agency or to a service provider, so that the receiving agency or service provider can use
the record to issue a PIV Card rather than re-enroll an applicant. This Special Publication
provides the representation of a chain-of-trust for import and export between PIV Card
issuers.

1.2   Purpose and Scope

[FIPS201] describes three use cases for a chain-of-trust: 1) to extend enrollment, 2) to re-
issue a PIV Card, and 3) to transfer PIV Card enrollment records to another federal issuer
or to a service provider. The purpose of this document is to provide the data
representation of a chain-of-trust record for the transferal use case. The data
representation is based on a common XML (Extensible Markup Language) schema to
facilitate interoperable information sharing and data exchange. The sending and receiving
federal agencies will be able to exchange the chain-of-trust data according to the
specifications provided in this document. Similarly, a service provider will be able to
receive chain-of-trust records from different client agencies that are based on a common
XML schema specified in this document. This document also provides support for data
integrity through digital signatures and for confidentiality through encryption of chain-of-
trust data, in transit and at rest.
