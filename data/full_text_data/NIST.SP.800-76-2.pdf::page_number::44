                             When multiple views or samples of a biometric are contained in the record the largest (i.e., best) value should be
                             reported. For all biometric data, whether stored on a PIV Card or otherwise, the quality value shall be a signed integer
                             between -2 and 100 per the text of INCITS 358.

NORMATIVE NOTES TO Table 14 AND Table 15.
1.      Unsigned integers are denoted by UINT. Signed integers are denoted by SINT. Multi-byte integers shall be in Big
        Endian byte order.
2.      The security options field has two acceptable values. The value b00001101 indicates that the biometric data block
        is digitally signed but not encrypted; the value b00001111 indicates the biometric data block is digitally signed and
        encrypted. For the mandatory [MINUSTD] elements on the PIV Card the value shall be b00001101.
        The fourth bit (mask 0x08) is set per prior versions of this document. The third bit (mask 0x04), which in each
        case is set, implements the [CBEFF, 5.2.1.2] requirement that digital signature is differentiated from message
        authentication code. The second bit (mask 0x02) indicates the use of encryption. The first bit (mask 0x01)
        indicates the use of a digital signature. See [FIPS, 800-78] for specifications on digital signatures.
3.      The signature shall be computed over the concatenated CBEFF_HEADER and CBEFF_BIOMETRIC_RECORD in
        Table 13. The CBEFF_HEADER is given in Table 14. This includes the signature block length (on line 4) which may
        not be known before the signature is computed. This problem may be solved by conducting a two phase
        computation: 1) a dummy SB length value is inserted, the signature is computed (and discarded), the signature
        length is written into the SB length field, and 2) the signature is recomputed. For some signing algorithms an
        iterative procedure may be necessary.
4.      This date shall be the date the biometric sample was acquired from the subject. For processed samples
        (e.g.,templates) this date should be the date of acquisition of the parent sample. Creation Date shall be encoded
        in eight bytes using a binary representation of "YYYYMMDDhhmmssZ". Each pair of characters (for example,
        "DD") is coded in 8 bits as an unsigned integer. Thus 17:35:30 December 15, 2005 is represented as: 00010100
        00000101 00001100 00001111 00010001 00100011 00011110 01011010 where the last byte is the binary
        representation of the ASCII character Z which is included to indicate that the time is represented in Coordinated
        Universal Time (UTC). The field "hh" shall code a 24 hour clock value.
