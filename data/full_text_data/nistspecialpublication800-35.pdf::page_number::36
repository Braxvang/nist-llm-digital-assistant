                                                                                NIST Special Publication 800-35



4.3.3    Develop the Implementation Plan

At this time, the parties should determine the budget and scope of the service arrangement and begin to
develop the implementation plan. The implementation plan provides a roadmap for the organization on
moving from the current environment to the desired future environment. The implementation plan should
address the following:

 Project Management Roles and Responsibilities—the implementation plan should identify the
  roles and responsibilities of individuals with project management roles and responsibilities for both
  the implementation and operations phases.
 Budget and Scope—IT security managers should identify the budgets and scope of the service
  arrangement. This effort will be important for identifying, soliciting, and assessing service providers
  in the next phase.
 Implementation Process—the program managers should begin to articulate their vision for
  implementing the IT security service. For example, if the program managers want to start with a test
  group or pilot program and/or establish a transition period for the service, the process for
  accomplishing this effort should be detailed here.
 Risk Mitigation Plans—IT security program managers should specify their plans for mitigating each
  risk identified throughout the assessment and solution phases.
 Exit Strategies—exit strategies will need to be developed to ensure the organization exits a service
  arrangement without disrupting other operations within the organization. The exit strategy should
  provide action plans for normal, planned exits, such as service agreement expiration; unexpected
  terminations, such as service provider bankruptcy; and potentially tension-filled exits, such as poor
  service provider performance.
 Transition Management—transition management plans should document the organization’s efforts
  to manage the transition from the current to the desired future environment. Managers should
  develop plans for addressing displaced employees, handling resistance to change, shifting the
  organizational focus, and communicating clearly with employees about the changes. In both the
  transition from one service arrangement to another, there will be transition costs, perhaps significant
  costs. These costs should be figured into the life-cycle costs and alternatives analysis. These costs
  should be considered when transition plans are developed.
4.4     Phase 4: Implementation

Selecting the service arrangement and service provider may actually be the easy part of the IT security
life cycle. Creating metrics and gathering data may require considerable work, especially if a metrics
program is not already in place. Although the multitude of service arrangements may seem
overwhelming, the objective data and methodical analysis will likely make clear the best path.
Implementing those decisions requires preparation and care. Managers should develop explicit service
agreements and ensure careful execution of the implementation plan. Careful planning and execution will
increase the chance of success, but as the service moves to the operations phase, the leadership should
manage expectations. No service arrangement will fix a problem overnight and no service provider can
be expected to debut perfectly. Figure 4-5 illustrates Phase 4, Implementation, of the IT security services
life cycle.
