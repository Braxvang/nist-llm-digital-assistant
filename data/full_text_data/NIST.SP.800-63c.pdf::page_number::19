                                                                                             those authority decisions to an external party as in Section 5.1.3.

                                                                                             In the dynamic registration model of federation, it is possible for relationships between members
                                                                                             of the federation to be negotiated at the time of a transaction. This process allows IdPs and RPs
                                                                                             to be connected together without manually establishing a connection between them using manual
                                                                                             registration (see Section 5.1.1). IdPs that support dynamic registration SHALL make their

                                                                                             As shown in Figure 5-3, dynamic registration involves four steps:

                                                                                                1. Discover. The RP goes to a well-known location at the IdP to find the IdP’s metadata.
                                                                                                2. Validate. The RP and IdP determine each other’s validity. This can be accomplished
                                                                                                   through keying information, metadata, software statements, or other means.
                                                                                                3. Register RP attributes. The RP sends its attributes to the IdP, and the IdP associates those
                                                                                                   attributes with the RP.
                                                                                                4. Federation Protocol. The IdP and RP then communicate using a standard federation
                                                                                                   protocol.
