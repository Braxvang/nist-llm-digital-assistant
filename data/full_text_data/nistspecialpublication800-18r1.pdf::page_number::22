Scalability-related considerations—

-        Security controls will be scalable by the size and complexity of the particular
         agency implementing the controls and the impact level of the information system.
         Scalability addresses the breadth and depth of security control implementation.
         Discretion is needed in scaling the security controls to the particular environment
         of use to ensure a cost-effective, risk-based approach to security control
         implementation.13

Risk-related considerations—

-        Security controls that uniquely support the confidentiality, integrity, or
         availability security objectives can be downgraded to the corresponding control in
         a lower baseline (or appropriately modified or eliminated if not defined in a lower
         baseline) if, and only if, the downgrading action: (i) is consistent with the FIPS
         199 security categorization for the corresponding security objectives of
         confidentiality, integrity, or availability before moving to the high watermark;14
         (ii) is supported by an agency’s assessment of risk; and (iii) does not affect the
         security-relevant information within the information system.15

2.5.2 Compensating Controls
Compensating security controls are the management, operational, or technical controls
employed by an agency in lieu of prescribed controls in the low, moderate, or high
security control baselines, which provide equivalent or comparable protection for an
information system. Compensating security controls for an information system will be
employed by an agency only under the following conditions: (i) the agency selects the
compensating controls from the security control catalog in NIST SP 800-53; (ii) the
agency provides a complete and convincing rationale and justification for how the
compensating controls provide an equivalent security capability or level of protection for
the information system; and (iii) the agency assesses and formally accepts the risk
associated with employing the compensating controls in the information system. The use

   For example, a contingency plan for a large and complex organization with a moderate-impact or high-
impact information system may be quite lengthy and contain a significant amount of implementation detail.
In contrast, a contingency plan for a smaller organization with a low-impact information system may be
considerably shorter and contain much less implementation detail.
14
   When employing the “high watermark” concept, some of the security objectives (i.e., confidentiality,
integrity, or availability) may have been increased to a higher impact level. As such, the security controls
that uniquely support these security objectives will have been upgraded as well. Consequently,
organizations must consider appropriate and allowable downgrading actions to ensure cost-effective, risk-
based application of security controls.
15
   Information that is security-relevant at the system level (e.g., password files, network routing tables,
cryptographic key management information) must be distinguished from user-level information within an
information system. Certain security controls within an information system are used to support the security
objectives of confidentiality and integrity for both user-level and system-level information. Organizations
must exercise caution in downgrading confidentiality or integrity-related security controls to ensure that the
downgrading action does not affect the security-relevant information within the information system.
