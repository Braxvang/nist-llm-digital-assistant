                 Password.”

            o    The first byte of the PIN Usage Policy shall be set to 0x40. (This means that neither the
                 Global PIN nor On-Card Biometric Comparison (OCC) satisfy the access control rules
                 for command execution and data object access within the Derived PIV Application.)

       Key History Object—Up to 20 retired key management private keys may be stored in the
        Derived PIV Application. The Key History object shall be present in the Derived PIV Application
        if the Derived PIV Application contains any retired key management private keys, but may be
        present even if no such keys are present in the Derived PIV Application. The requirements for the
        Key History object are as described in Section 3.3.3 of [SP800-73Part1] except for the following:

            o    References to “keysWithOnCardCerts” should be interpreted as keys for which the
                 corresponding certificate is populated within the Derived PIV Application.

            o    References to “keysWithOffCardCerts” should be interpreted as keys for which the
                 corresponding certificate is not populated within the Derived PIV Application.

            o    References to “offCardCertURL” should be interpreted as a URL that points to a file
                 containing the certificates corresponding to all of the retired key management private
                 keys within the Derived PIV Application including those for which the corresponding
                 certificate is stored within the Derived PIV Application.

       Retired X.509 Certificates for Key Management—The read access control rules for the Retired
        X.509 Certificates for Key Management and PKI cryptographic function access rules for
        corresponding private keys are as described in Section 3.3.4 of [SP800-73Part1] .

       Security Object—The Security Object shall be present in the Derived PIV Application if either
        the Discovery Object or the Key History object is present, and shall be absent otherwise. The
        requirements for the Security Object are as described in Section 3.1.7 of [SP800-73Part1] , except
        for the following:

            o    The Security Object for a Derived PIV Application is signed using a private key whose
                 corresponding public key is contained in a PIV content signing certificate that satisfies
                 the requirements for certificates used to verify signatures on Cardholder Unique
                 Identifiers (CHUID), as specified in Section 4.2.1 of [FIPS201].

            o    The signature field of the Security Object, tag 0xBB, shall include the Derived PIV
                 Credential Issuer’s certificate.

            o    All unsigned data objects (i.e., the Discovery Object and the Key History object) within
                 the Derived PIV Application shall be included in the Security Object.

B.1.2.1      Derived PIV Application Data Object Containers and associated Access Rules

Section 3.5 of [SP800-73Part1] provides the container IDs and Access Rules for the mandatory and
optional data objects for a Derived PIV Application with the following mappings:
