1.3 Principles of the New Approach: Results-Based Learning


The learning approach presented in this document is designed on the following principles to
facilitate results-based learning.


    •   Focuses on job functions, or roles and responsibilities speciHc to individuals, not job
        titles,   and recognizes that individuals have unique backgrounds, and therefore,
        different levels of understanding.


        The earlier 500-172 focused on various categories of employees. This new approach
        recognizes that an individual may have more than one organizational role, and will need
        rr security training which satisfies the specific responsibilities of each role. In addition,
        because it is not focused on job titles, this approach facilitates more consistent
        interpretation of training criteria across organizations.


        Everyone needs basic training in IT security concepts and procedures. Beyond the basics,
        this new approach establishes three distinct levels of IT security training: Beginning,
        Intermediate, and Advanced.     Each level is then linked to roles and responsibilities.
        Because individuals may perform more than one role within the organization, they may
        need intermediate or advanced level IT security training in their primary ']6b role, but
        only the beginning level in a secondary or tertiary role. The new concept facilitates
        training tailored to individual employee needs and career mobility, and to an
        organization's evolving or changing mission and mix of job functions. Thus, the concept
        of refresher training (traditionally viewed as repetitive learning) gives way to the "just-in-
        time" learning approach, as an individual's or organization's FT security training needs
        evolve or change.


    •   Delineates the differences among awareness, training, and education.


        First, this approach considers awareness programs (which are generally well established

        in Federal agencies/organizations) as a pre-requisite to FT security training. This
        document defines the term "IT Security Basics and Literacy," as the transitional learning
        activity between "Awareness" and "Training." IT Security Basics and Literacy
        comprises relatively generic concepts, terms, and associated learning modules that do not
        significantly differ among categories of employees or organizations. Thus, this approach
        eliminates redundancies across audience categories and establishes a baseline of FT
        security knowledge across government which all employees can reasonably be expected
        to have as they change jobs and organizations. This baseline is independent of specific
        rr systems.
