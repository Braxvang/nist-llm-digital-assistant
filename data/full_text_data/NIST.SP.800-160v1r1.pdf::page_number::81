•       System Security Policy: A policy that specifies the system security capability. It is the set of
        restrictions and properties that specifies how a system enforces or contributes to enforcing
        organizational security policy.
•       Personnel Security Policy: A policy that defines the expectations of personnel. 60 These
        include the behaviors of the personnel using or sustaining the system.

Security policy goes through an iterative refinement process that decomposes an abstract
statement of security policy into more specific statements of security policy. The refinement
occurs in parallel with requirements allocation and decomposition. Figure 11 illustrates security
policy allocation across the organization.

C.2.          Security Requirements
A requirement is a statement that translates or expresses a specific need and its associated
constraints and conditions. 61 Security requirements translate or express protection needs (Section
3.7), associated constraints, and associated conditions. The constraints also reflect concerns
about the system functions, system architecture, and design to ensure that they are specified in a
manner that avoids and reduces susceptibilities, defects, flaws, and weaknesses (Section 3.8) and
is consistent with the needs of active security functions.

Requirements can be categorized as (1) stakeholder requirements that address the need to be
satisfied in a design-independent manner and (2) system requirements that express the specific

     These expectations often cover personnel actions that may expose them to negative external influences (e.g., social media use).
