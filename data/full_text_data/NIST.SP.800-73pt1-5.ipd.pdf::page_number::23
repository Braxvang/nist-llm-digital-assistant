592   The encoding of the 0x7E Discovery Object is as follows:
593                {'7E 12' {'4F 0B A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 10 00 01 00'} {'5F 2F 02 xx yy'}}, where xx and
594                yy encode the first and second byte of the PIN Usage Policy, as described in this section.
595   The Security Object enforces integrity of the Discovery Object according to the issuer.

596   3.3.3. Key History Object
597   Up to 20 retired key management private keys MAY be stored in the PIV Card Application. The
598   Key History object provides information about the retired key management private keys that are
599   present within the PIV Card Application. 4 Retired key management private keys are private keys
600   that correspond to X.509 Certificates for Key Management that have expired, have been revoked,
601   or have otherwise been superseded. The Key History object SHALL be present in the PIV Card
602   Application if the PIV Card Application contains any retired key management private keys but
603   MAY be present even if no such keys are present in the PIV Card Application. For each retired
604   key management private key in the PIV Card Application, the corresponding certificate MAY
605   either be present within the PIV Card Application or MAY only be available from an online
606   repository.
607   The Key History object includes two mandatory fields, keysWithOnCardCerts and
608   keysWithOffCardCerts, and one optional field, offCardCertURL. The keysWithOnCardCerts
609   field indicates the number of retired private keys within the PIV Card Application for which the
610   corresponding certificates are also stored within the PIV Card Application. The
611   keysWithOffCardCerts field indicates the number of retired private keys within the PIV Card
612   Application for which the corresponding certificates are not stored within the PIV Card
613   Application. The numeric values in both keysWithOnCardCerts and keysWithOffCardCerts are
614   represented as unsigned binary integers. The offCardCertURL field contains a URL that points to
615   a file containing the certificates that corresponding to all of the retired private keys within the
616   PIV Card Application, including those for which the corresponding certificate is also stored
617   within the PIV Card Application. The offCardCertURL field SHALL be present if the
