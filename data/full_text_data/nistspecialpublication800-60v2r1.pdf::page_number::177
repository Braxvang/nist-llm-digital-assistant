Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: The consequences of unauthorized
modification or destruction of postal information might provide terrorists the tools to carry out an
attack. The consequences in terms of critical infrastructure protection and risk to human life may
be severe. In such cases, the integrity impact of compromise would be high. Another threat is
that of unauthorized modification of information to support fraudulent activities (e.g.,
misdirection of monetary instruments, execution of fraudulent financial transactions). This
might result in harm to individuals, but not to agency operations or missions.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most postal services information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to postal services information. The
effects of disruption of access to most postal services information or information systems
would have an adverse effect on agency operations. Because most postal services
information is time critical, extended widespread outages could seriously affect the
commerce of the United States.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
postal services information is moderate.

D.11 Transportation
Transportation involves all federally supported activities related to the safe passage,
conveyance, or transportation of goods and/or people. Note that impacts to some information
and many information systems associated with transportation activities may affect the
security of, not only the transportation infrastructure, but also to a broad range of other
critical infrastructures and key national assets.

D.11.1 Ground Transportation Information Type

Ground Transportation involves the activities related to ensuring the availability of transit and
the safe passage of passengers and goods over land. Water and fuel pipelines are included among
ground transportation assets. Note: The protection of ground transportation from deliberate
attack is included in the Transportation Security information type under the Homeland Security
mission area. The recommended provisional security categorization for the ground
transportation information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of ground transportation
information on the ability of responsible agencies to ensure the availability of transit and the safe
passage of passengers and goods over land. The protection of ground transportation from
deliberate attack is included in the Transportation Security information type under the Homeland
