NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                 Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems

       source, suitability, and trustworthiness of the reused system elements for the new purpose. The
       implementation strategy includes procedures, fabrication processes, tools and equipment,
       tolerances, and verification uncertainties, which may introduce weaknesses and vulnerabilities.
       In the case of repeated system element implementation (e.g., mass production, replacement
       system elements), the procedures and fabrication processes are defined to achieve consistent
       and repeatable trustworthy producibility.
       Note 2: The security aspects are informed by the targeted level of assurance, security
       verification uncertainties, and security concerns associated with implementation-related
       logistics, supply, and distribution of components.
       IP-1.2 Identify security-relevant constraints and objectives from implementation in the system
              security requirements, architecture and design characteristics, or implementation
              techniques.
       IP-1.3 Identify the security aspects for enabling systems, services, and materials needed to
              support implementation.
       IP-1.4 Identify and plan for enabling systems, services, and materials needed to support the
              security aspects of implementation.
       IP-1.5 Obtain or acquire access to the security aspects of enabling systems, services, and
              materials to be used in implementation.

IP-2   PERFORM IMPLEMENTATION
       IP-2.1 Realize or adapt system elements in accordance with the security aspects of the
              implementation strategy and implementation procedures, as well as security-relevant
              constraints.
       Note: System elements can include:
       -   Hardware and Software: Hardware and software elements are either acquired or fabricated.
           Custom hardware fabrication and software development enable insight into the details of
           design and implementation. These insights often translate to increased assurance.
           Acquired hardware and software elements may not provide the opportunity to achieve the
           same insight into design and implementation and may offer more functionality and
           capability than required. The limits of what can be known about the internals of the
           elements translate to a level of uncertainty about vulnerability and the maximum assurance
           that can be achieved.
       -   Firmware: Firmware exhibits properties of hardware and software. Firmware elements may
           be acquired or developed to realize the software aspects and then fabricated to realize the
           physical form of the hardware aspects. Firmware elements, therefore, adhere to the
           security implementation considerations of both hardware and software elements.
       -   Services: System elements implemented by obtaining or leasing services are subject to the
           same criteria used to acquire hardware, firmware, and software but must also address the
           security considerations associated with utilization and support resources.
       -   Utilization and Support Resources: The security considerations of acquired or leased services
           account for the specific roles and responsibilities of individuals of the service/lease provider
