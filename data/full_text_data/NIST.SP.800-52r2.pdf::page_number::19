NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                                             GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


Section 3.2.1 specifies a detailed profile for server certificates. Basic guidelines for RSA,
ECDSA, DSA, DH, and ECDH certificates are provided. Section 3.2.2 specifies requirements for
revocation checking. Section 3.5.4 specifies requirements for the “hints list.”

3.2.1      Server Certificate Profile

The server certificate profile, described in this section, provides requirements and
recommendations for the format of the server certificate. To comply with these guidelines, the
TLS server certificate shall be an X.509 version 3 certificate; both the public key contained in
the certificate and the signature shall provide at least 112 bits of security. Prior to TLS 1.2, the
server Certificate message required that the signing algorithm for the certificate be the same as
the algorithm for the certificate key (see Section 7.4.2 of [24]). If the server supports TLS
versions prior to TLS 1.2, the certificate should be signed with an algorithm consistent with the
public key: 13,14

    •      Certificates containing RSA, ECDSA, or DSA public keys should be signed with those
           same signature algorithms, respectively;
    •      Certificates containing Diffie-Hellman public keys should be signed with DSA; and
    •      Certificates containing ECDH public keys should be signed with ECDSA.

The extended key usage extension limits how the keys in a certificate are used. There is a key
purpose specifically for server authentication, and the server should be configured to allow its
use. The use of the extended key usage extension will facilitate successful server authentication,
as some clients may require the presence of an extended key usage extension. The use of the
server DNS name in the Subject Alternative Name field ensures that any name constraints on the
certification path will be properly enforced.

The server certificate profile is listed in Table 3-1. In the absence of agency-specific certificate
profile requirements, this certificate profile should be used for the server certificate.

13 This recommendation is an artifact of requirements in TLS 1.0 and 1.1.


14 Algorithm-dependent guidelines exist for the generation of public and private key pairs. For guidance on the generation of DH

    and ECDH key pairs, see SP 800-56A [6]. For guidance regarding the generation of RSA, DSA and ECDSA key pairs, see
    [45].
