      NIST SP 800-217 ipd                         Guidelines for PIV Federation (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


869   6.   Protocol Requirements
870   This section is normative.
871   A federation protocol connects the IdP and RP together with a series of messages. These
872   messages include assertions, which are passed between the IdP and RP to represent the
873   federated authentication event, and the contents of identity APIs, which convey additional
874   attribute information about the subscriber. This section enumerates requirements for
875   these common components but is not intended to provide sufficient detail for any specific
876   federation protocol.

877   6.1. Required Attributes
878   A PIV IdP SHALL make the following mandatory attributes available to all RPs for each
879   PIV identity account, as required by the trust agreement:
880        • Subject Identifier: A unique identifier for the PIV identity account that is assigned
881          by the IdP to the account for use by the RP; the subject identifier is part of the
882          federated identifier, see Sec. 6.2.1 for additional requirements.
883        • Issuing Agency: A global identifier for the issuing agency associated with the PIV
884          identity account (e.g., an agency’s domain name or a FASCN agency code from
885          [SP800-87]).
886        • Organizational Affiliation: The organization or list of organizations that the PIV
887          identity account is affiliated with.
888        • Last Updated: A timestamp that indicates when the available attributes in the PIV
889          identity account were last updated at the IdP.
890   A PIV IdP SHALL make the following core identity attributes available to RPs, subject to
891   the trust agreement:
892        • Email address: The current email address for the subscriber as known by or issued
893          by the IdP.
894        • Full Name: The full name of the subscriber that is suitable for display or addressing
895          the subscriber at the RP; the individual portions of the name, such as a given name
896          and family name, MAY also be made available separately.
897   A PIV IdP SHOULD make the following optional identity attributes available to RPs,
898   subject to the trust agreement:
899        • Physical Address: The physical address of the subscriber, most typically an office
900          address
901        • Phone Number: The current telephone number for the subscriber as known by or
902          issued by the IdP
