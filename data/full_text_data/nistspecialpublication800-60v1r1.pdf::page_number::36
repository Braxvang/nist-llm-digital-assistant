4.4.2.3    Extenuating Circumstances
This publication focuses on categorizing an information system based on its information types
and associated security objective impacts. There are times when a system security objective
impact level should be elevated based on reasons other than its information. For example, the
information system provides critical process flow or security capability, the visibility of the
system to the public, the sheer number of other systems reliant on its operation or possibly its
overall cost of replacement. These examples, given a specific situation, may provide reason for
the system owner to increase the overall security impact level of a system.
An elevation based on extenuating circumstances can be more apparent by comparing the
original security categorization to the business impact analysis. If the system was categorized
based on FIPS 199 at a Moderate overall impact level but the system owner has determined it
needs to be operational within 4-8 hours of a disruption irrespective of the aggregated
information type availability security impact level assigned, then there is a disconnect that might
be caused by the systemâ€™s extenuating circumstances. Agencies must customize the information
system availability security impact level as appropriate to obtain full value and accuracy.
4.4.2.4    Other System Factors

Public Information Integrity

Most Federal agencies maintain web pages that are accessible to the public. The vast majority of
these public web pages permit interaction between the site and the public. In some cases, the site
provides only information. In other cases, forms may be submitted via the website (e.g.,
applications for service or job applications). In some cases, the site is a medium for business
transactions. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external
communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public
confidence in the agency. In most cases, the damage can be corrected within a relatively short
period of time, and the damage is limited (impact level is low). In other cases (e.g., very large
fraudulent transactions or modification of a web page belonging to an intelligence/security
community component), the damage to mission function and/or public confidence in the agency
can be serious. In such cases, the integrity impact associated with unauthorized modification or
destruction of a public web page would be at least moderate.

Catastrophic Loss of System Availability

Either physical or logical destruction of major assets can result in very large expenditures to
restore the assets and/or long periods of time for recovery. Permanent loss/unavailability of
information system capabilities can seriously hamper agency operations and, where direct
services to the public are involved, have a severe adverse effect on public confidence in Federal
agencies. Particularly in the case of large systems, FIPS 199 criteria suggest that catastrophic
loss of system availability may result in a high availability impact level. Whether or not the
impact level of system availability should be high (and subsequent high system security impact
level) is dependent on other factors, such as cost and criticality of the system, rather than on the
security impact levels for the information types being processed by the system.
