                                                                             GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



2.     Background

The World Wide Web is one of the most important ways for an organization to publish information,
interact with Internet users, and establish an e-commerce/e-government presence. However, if an
organization is not rigorous in configuring and operating its public Web site, it may be vulnerable to a
variety of security threats. Although the threats in cyberspace remain largely the same as in the physical
world (e.g., fraud, theft, vandalism, and terrorism), they are far more dangerous as a result of three
important developments: increased efficiency, action at a distance, and rapid technique propagation
[Schn00].

 Increased Efficiency—Automation makes attacks, even those with minimal opportunity for success,
  efficient and extremely profitable. For example, in the physical world, an attack that would succeed
  once in 10,000 attempts would be ineffectual because of the time and effort required, on average, for
  a single success. The time invested in achieving a single success would be outweighed by the time
  invested in the 9,999 failures. On the Internet, automation enables the same attack to be a stunning
  success. Computing power and bandwidth are becoming less expensive daily, while the number of
  hosts that can be targeted is growing rapidly. This synergy means that almost any attack, no matter
  how low its success rate, will likely find many systems to exploit.

 Action at a Distance—The Internet allows action at a distance. The Internet has no borders, and
  every point on the Internet is potentially reachable from every other point. This means that an
  attacker in one country can target a remote Web site in another country as easily as one close to
  home.

 Rapid Technique Propagation—The Internet allows for easier and more rapid technique
  propagation. Before the Internet, techniques for attack were developed that would take years, if ever,
  to propagate, allowing time to develop effective countermeasures. Today, a new technique can be
  propagated within hours or days. It is now more difficult to develop effective countermeasures in a
  timely manner.

Compromised Web sites have served as an entry point for intrusions into many organizations’ internal
networks. Organizations can face monetary losses, damage to reputation, or legal action if an intruder
successfully violates the confidentiality of their data. Denial of service (DoS) attacks can make it
difficult, if not impossible, for users to access an organization’s Web site. 7 These attacks may cost the
organization significant time and money. DoS attacks are easy for attackers to attempt because of the
number of possible attack vectors, the variety of automated tools available, and the low skill level needed
to use the tools. DoS attacks, as well as threats of initiating DoS attacks, are also increasingly being used
to blackmail organizations. In addition, an organization can find itself in an embarrassing situation
resulting from malicious intruders changing the content of the organization’s Web pages.

Kossakowski and Allen identified three main security issues related to the operation of a publicly
accessible Web site [Koss00]:

 Misconfiguration or other improper operation of the Web server, which may result, for example, in
  the disclosure or alteration of proprietary or sensitive information. This information can include
  items such as the following:

     Many DoS attacks are a result of botnets, a group of computers with a program surreptitiously installed to cause them to
     attack other systems. Botnets are often composed primarily of poorly secured home computers that have high-speed Internet
     connectivity. Botnets can be used to perform distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, which are much harder to defend
     against because of the large number of attacking hosts.
