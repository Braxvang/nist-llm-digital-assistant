      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022


135   Taking into account feedback provided in response to our June 2020 Pre-Draft Call
136   for Comments, as well as research conducted into real-world implementations of the
137   guidelines, market innovation, and the current threat environment, this draft seeks to:
138      1. Advance Equity: This draft seeks to expand upon the risk management content
139         of previous revisions and specifically mandates that agencies account for impacts
140         to individuals and communities in addition to impacts to the organization. It also
141         elevates risks to mission delivery – including challenges to providing services to
142         all people who are eligible for and entitled to them – within the risk management
143         process and when implementing digital identity systems. Additionally, the guidance
144         now mandates continuous evaluation of potential impacts across demographics,
145         provides biometric performance requirements, and additional parameters for the
146         responsible use of biometric-based technologies, such as those that utilize face
147         recognition.
148      2. Emphasize Optionality and Choice for Consumers: In the interest of promoting
149         and investigating additional scalable, equitable, and convenient identify verification
150         options, including those that do and do not leverage face recognition technologies,
151         this draft expands the list of acceptable identity proofing alternatives to provide
152         new mechanisms to securely deliver services to individuals with differing means,
153         motivations, and backgrounds. The revision also emphasizes the need for digital
154         identity services to support multiple authenticator options to address diverse
155         consumer needs and secure account recovery.
156      3. Deter Fraud and Advanced Threats: This draft enhances fraud prevention
157         measures from the third revision by updating risk and threat models to account
158         for new attacks, providing new options for phishing resistant authentication, and
159         introducing requirements to prevent automated attacks against enrollment processes.
160         It also opens the door to new technology such as mobile driver’s licenses and
161         verifiable credentials.
162      4. Address Implementation Lessons Learned: This draft addresses areas where
163         implementation experience has indicated that additional clarity or detail was
164         required to effectively operationalize the guidelines. This includes re-working
165         the federation assurance levels, providing greater detail on Trusted Referees,
166         clarifying guidelines on identity attribute validation sources, and improving address
167         confirmation requirements.
168   NIST is specifically interested in comments on and recommendations for the following
169   topics:
170   Identity Proofing and Enrollment
171       • NIST sees a need for inclusion of an unattended, fully remote Identity Assurance
172         Level (IAL) 2 identity proofing workflow that provides security and convenience,
173         but does not require face recognition. Accordingly, NIST seeks input on the
174         following questions:

                                                   ii
