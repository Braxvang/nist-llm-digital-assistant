                                     The adversary has a very sophisticated level of expertise, is well-resourced, and can generate
   Very High     96-100      10
                                     opportunities to support multiple successful, continuous, and coordinated attacks.
                                     The adversary has a sophisticated level of expertise, with significant resources and opportunities
     High         80-95      8
                                     to support multiple successful coordinated attacks.
                                     The adversary has moderate resources, expertise, and opportunities to support multiple successful
   Moderate       21-79      5
                                     attacks.

                                     The adversary has very limited resources, expertise, and opportunities to support a successful

  Values              Values

                                     The adversary seeks to undermine, severely impede, or destroy a core mission or business
                                     function, program, or enterprise by exploiting a presence in the organization’s information systems
   Very High     96-100      10
                                     or infrastructure. The adversary is concerned about disclosure of tradecraft only to the extent that it
                                     would impede its ability to complete stated goals.
                                     The adversary seeks to undermine/impede critical aspects of a core mission or business function,
                                     program, or enterprise, or place itself in a position to do so in the future, by maintaining a presence
     High         80-95      8
                                     in the organization’s information systems or infrastructure. The adversary is very concerned about
                                     minimizing attack detection/disclosure of tradecraft, particularly while preparing for future attacks.
                                     The adversary seeks to obtain or modify specific critical or sensitive information or usurp/disrupt
                                     the organization’s cyber resources by establishing a foothold in the organization’s information
   Moderate       21-79      5       systems or infrastructure. The adversary is concerned about minimizing attack detection/disclosure
                                     of tradecraft, particularly when carrying out attacks over long time periods. The adversary is willing
                                     to impede aspects of the organization’s missions/business functions to achieve these ends.
                                     The adversary actively seeks to obtain critical or sensitive information or to usurp/disrupt the
     Low          5-20       2       organization’s cyber resources, and does so without concern about attack detection/disclosure of
                                     tradecraft.
                                     The adversary seeks to usurp, disrupt, or deface the organization’s cyber resources, and does so
   Very Low        0-4       0
                                     without concern about attack detection/disclosure of tradecraft.

  Values              Values

                                     The adversary analyzes information obtained via reconnaissance and attacks to target persistently
                                     a specific organization, enterprise, program, mission or business function, focusing on specific
   Very High     96-100      10
                                     high-value or mission-critical information, resources, supply flows, or functions; specific employees
                                     or positions; supporting infrastructure providers/suppliers; or partnering organizations.
                                     The adversary analyzes information obtained via reconnaissance to target persistently a specific
                                     organization, enterprise, program, mission or business function, focusing on specific high-value or
     High         80-95      8
                                     mission-critical information, resources, supply flows, or functions, specific employees supporting
                                     those functions, or key positions.
                                     The adversary analyzes publicly available information to target persistently specific high-value
   Moderate       21-79      5
                                     organizations (and key positions, such as Chief Information Officer), programs, or information.
                                     The adversary uses publicly available information to target a class of high-value organizations or
     Low          5-20       2
                                     information, and seeks targets of opportunity within that class.
   Very Low        0-4       0       The adversary may or may not target any specific organizations or classes of organizations.
