NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                Guidelines for Media Sanitization


           o Position/Title of Person

           o Date

           o Location

           o Phone or Other Contact Information

           o Signature

Optionally, an organization may choose to record the following (if known):

      Data Backup (i.e., if data was backed up, and if so, where)

A sample certificate is included in Appendix G.

If the storage device has been successfully verified and the sanitization results in a lower
confidentiality level of the storage device, all markings on the device indicating the previous
confidentiality level should be removed. A new marking indicating the updated confidentiality
level should be applied, unless the device is leaving the organization and is stored in a location
where access is carefully controlled until the device leaves the organization to prevent
reintroduction of sensitive data.

The value of a certification of media disposition depends on the organization’s handling of
storage media over the media’s lifecycle. If records are maintained when the media is introduced
to the environment, when the media leaves the place it was last used, and when it reaches the
sanitization destination, the organization can most effectively identify how well media
sanitization is being applied across the enterprise. If there is a breakdown in tracking at locations
other than the sanitization destination, the sanitization records only show that specific media was
sanitized and not whether the organization is effectively sanitizing all media that has been
introduced into the operating environment.
