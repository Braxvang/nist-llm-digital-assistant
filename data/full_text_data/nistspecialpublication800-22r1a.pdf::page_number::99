A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



The complementary error function (erfc) utilized in the package is the ANSI C function contained in the
math.h header file and its corresponding mathematical library. This library should be included during
compilation.

The incomplete gamma function is based on an approximation formula whose origin is described in the
Handbook of Applied Mathematical Functions [1] and in the Numerical Recipes in C book [6].
Depending on the values of its parameters a and x, the incomplete gamma function may be approximated
using either a continued fraction development or a series development.

NIST has chosen to use the Cephes C language special functions math library in the test software.
Cerphes may be found at http://www.moshier.net/ - Cephes or on the GAMS server at
http://gams.nist.gov/serve.cgi/Package/CEPHES/. The specific functions that are utilized are igamc (for
the complementary incomplete gamma function) and lgam (for the logarithmic gamma function).

5.6   Running the Test Code

A sample NIST Statistical Test Suite monolog is described below. Note: In this section bold items
indicate input.

In order to invoke the NIST statistical test suite, type assess, followed by the desired bit stream length, n.
For example, assess 100000. A series of menu prompts will be displayed in order to select the data to be
analyzed and the statistical tests to be applied. The first screen appears as follows:
