Chapter 5
5. Capital Planning and Investment
   Control
    Increased competition for limited federal budgets and resources requires that
agencies allocate available funding toward their highest-priority information security
investments to afford the agency and its systems and data, the appropriate degree
of security for their needs. This goal can be achieved through a formal enterprise
capital planning and investment control (CPIC) process designed to facilitate and
control the expenditure of agency funds. The Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA) and other existing federal regulations charge federal
agencies with integrating information security activities and the capital planning and
investment control process. The practices discussed in this chapter are designed to
help security practitioners and managers identify funding needs to secure systems
and provide strategies for obtaining the necessary funding.

5.1 Legislative Overview
   Implementation of information security within the federal government is guided
by a combination of legislation, rules and regulations, and agency-specific policies.
FISMA is the overarching information security legislation for federal information
systems. Signed into law in 2002, FISMA:
     • Charges the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and NIST to develop
       security standards and identify tolerable security risk levels;
     • Makes NIST standards compulsory for all agencies; FISMA eliminated an
       agency’s ability to obtain waivers on NIST standards (Federal Information
       Processing Standard [FIPS]); and
     • Charges agencies to integrate information security into CPIC.
     • NIST SP 800-53 identifies a set of minimum security controls applicable to
       information systems based on FIPS 199 categorization (low, moderate, high).
     • OMB Circular A-11 directs agencies to complete Exhibit 300s and an Exhibit
       53. The Exhibit 300 reflects an investment’s plan for capital asset management.
       The Exhibit 300 is an input to the Exhibit 53, which provides the total
       information technology (IT) and information security spending for the year.
     • FISMA Report is an annual report to OMB detailing the agency’s security
       posture and any areas of weakness. 35
     • Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) documents each agency security
       weakness, associated corrective action, and the corrective action cost. 36
   As Figure 5-1 illustrates, the corrective action and cost information contained in
the POA&M serve as inputs to the Exhibit 300s and are then rolled into the Exhibit
