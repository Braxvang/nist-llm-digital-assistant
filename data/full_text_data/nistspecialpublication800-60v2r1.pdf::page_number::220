When legal investigation information addresses international matters, such as trade enforcement
or tariff agreements or when foreign nationals are involved, the integrity level is high. Any
deliberate or inadvertent corruption of such information could result in catastrophic adverse
effects on future operations, individual or agency reputations, and human life.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
legal investigation information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to legal investigation information.
Missions supported by legal investigation information are not typically tolerant of delay with
resultant serious consequences for ongoing investigations.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Where the crimes involved pose a threat
to human life and/or result in a loss of major assets, the availability impact level recommended
for legal investigation information is high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
legal investigation information is moderate.

D.17.4 Legal Prosecution and Litigation Information Type

Legal prosecution/litigation includes all activities involved with presenting a case in a legal
proceeding both in a criminal or civil court of law in an attempt to prove guilt/responsibility. The
recommended provisional security categorization for the legal prosecution/litigation information
type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of legal
prosecution/litigation information on the ability of responsible agencies to present a case in a
legal proceeding either in a criminal or civil court of law in an attempt to prove
guilt/responsibility. Dissemination of legal prosecution/litigation information is governed by
privacy laws and by Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rules of Civil Procedure, and other laws
governing adversarial legal proceedings. While most information associated with legal
prosecution/litigation is public, some information is sealed by the court or is otherwise protected
from disclosure. Violation of rules regarding unauthorized disclosure is punishable by law,
disbarment, fine, and/or imprisonment. Generally, the unauthorized disclosure of legal
prosecution/litigation information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
assets, or individuals. In criminal cases, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of legal
prosecution information are affected by 1] the seriousness of the crime involved, 2] timing (e.g.,
the ability of the criminal to access the information and use it to commit a crime or evade
detection or surveillance), and 3] the capability of the criminal to injure witnesses or law
enforcement officials.
