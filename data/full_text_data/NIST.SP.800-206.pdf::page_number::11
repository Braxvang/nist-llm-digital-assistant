    INTRODUCTION




       FROM STATE-OF-THE-ART TO STATE-OF-ACTUAL PRACTICE
       NIST’s research, standards, guidelines, and recommended best practices are
       aimed at improving the effectiveness of cybersecurity strategies and measures.
       They offer an expanding and up-to-date toolkit that information technology
       (IT) and operational technology (OT) providers and users can put to work to
       justifiably enhance trust in IT and related technologies. Historically, much of
       NIST’s outputs have been developed primarily for government agencies that are
       directed by statute and policy to use the Institute’s cybersecurity standards and
       guidelines. However, they also are widely and voluntarily relied upon by private
       sector cybersecurity practitioners, product vendors and integrators, state and
       local agencies, and others who see value in NIST’s information and services.
       NIST recognizes that many systems owners and administrators often find it
       difficult to sort through the voluminous output of NIST cybersecurity guidance to
       identify standards and guidelines that apply to their areas of interest. They may
       struggle to understand how these resources apply to their environments and
       how NIST’s cybersecurity products can be used to address their requirements.
       They may have difficulty with usability implications of integrating cybersecurity
       into their systems. These current and potential users need assistance in finding
       the kind of applications support that NIST offers in addressing some specific
       cybersecurity implementation problems. In FY18, NIST increased its attention to
       issues associated with transition to practice with an eye on accelerating adoption
       of cybersecurity standards, guidelines, and best practices. NIST is ramping up
       that priority even more steeply in 2019, often through the National Cybersecurity
       Center of Excellence (NCCoE) as well as throughout the Information Technology
       Laboratory (ITL). This report spotlights some of those initiatives.
