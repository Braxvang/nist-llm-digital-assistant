4.2.2.3       Availability Factors
Using the FIPS 199 potential impact criteria summarized in Table 7, each information type
should be evaluated for availability with respect to the impact level associated with the
disruption of access to or use of information of (i) each known variant of the information
belonging to the type and (ii) each use of the information by the system under review. Answers
to the following questions will help in the evaluation process:
   •      How can a malicious adversary use the disruption of access to or use of information to do
          limited/serious/severe harm to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals?
   •      Would disruption of access to or use of elements of the information type violate laws,
          executive orders, or agency regulations?
For many information types and information systems, the availability impact level depends on
how long the information or system remains unavailable. Undetected loss of availability can be
catastrophic for many information types. For example, permanent loss of budget execution,
contingency planning, continuity of operations, service recovery, debt collection, taxation
management, personnel management, payroll management, security management, inventory
control, logistics management, or accounting information databases would be catastrophic for
almost any agency. Complete reconstruction of such databases would be time consuming and
expensive.
In most cases, the adverse effects of a limited-duration availability compromise on an
organization’s mission functions and public confidence will be limited. In contrast, for time-
critical information types, availability is less likely to be restored before serious harm is done to
agency assets, operations, or personnel (or to public welfare). In such instances, the documented
availability impact level recommendations should indicate the information is time-critical and
the basis for criticality.

4.2.3     Examples of FIPS 199-Based Selection of Impact Levels

FIPS 199-based examples of security objective impact selection and security categorization for
sample information types follow:
EXAMPLE 1: An organization managing public information on its web server determines that
there is no potential impact from a loss of confidentiality (i.e., confidentiality requirements are
not applicable), a moderate potential impact from a loss of integrity, and a moderate potential
impact from a loss of availability. The resulting security category of this information type is
expressed as:
          Security Category public information = {(confidentiality, n/a), (integrity, moderate), (availability,
          moderate)}.

EXAMPLE 2: A law enforcement organization managing extremely sensitive investigative
information determines that the potential impact from a loss of confidentiality is high, the
potential impact from a loss of integrity is moderate, and the potential impact from a loss of
availability is moderate. The resulting security category for this type of information is expressed
as:
