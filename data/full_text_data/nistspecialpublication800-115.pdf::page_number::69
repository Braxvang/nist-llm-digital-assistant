                                               TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT




5.1.    Nontechnical Test Components

Identifies nontechnical test activities that will take place, and includes information to help identify the
types of policies, procedures, and other documents that should be reviewed. If interviews or site surveys
are to be conducted, guidelines should be established for advance approval of the interview list and
questions. If physical security of information systems is in the scope of the testing, procedures should be
determined and a form—with appropriate signatures and contact information—generated for the test team
to show to law enforcement or onsite security personnel in the event that they are questioned.

5.2.    Technical Test Components

Includes the type of technical testing to be conducted (e.g., network scanning, discovery, penetration
testing); discusses whether files are authorized to be installed, created, modified, and/or executed to
facilitate testing; and explains the required actions for those files once testing is completed. Any
additional information regarding the technical testing of the organization’s systems and networks should
also be included in this section. Significant detail should be included on what activities will occur on the
target network to ensure that all parties are aware of what is authorized and to be expected as a result of
the testing.

5.3.    Data Handling

Identifies guidelines for gathering, storing, transmitting, and destroying test data, and establishes detailed,
unambiguous requirements for data handling. Keep in mind that data results from any type of
information security test will identify vulnerabilities that an adversary can exploit, and should be
considered sensitive.

6.      Reporting

Details reporting requirements and the report deliverables expected to be provided throughout the testing
process and at its conclusion. Minimum information to be provided in each report (e.g., vulnerabilities
and recommended mitigation techniques) and the frequency with which the reports will be delivered (e.g.,
daily status reports) should be included. A template may be provided as an appendix to the ROE to
demonstrate report format and content.

7.      Signature Page

Designed to identify accountable parties and ensure that they know and understand their responsibilities
throughout the testing process. At a minimum, the test team leader and the organization’s senior
management (CSO, CISO, CIO, etc.) should sign the ROE stating that they understand the test’s scope
and boundaries.
