      NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022


464         Note: When described generically or bundled, these guidelines will refer to
465         IAL, AAL, and FAL as xAL.
466   SP 800-63 is organized as the following suite of volumes:
467   SP 800-63 Digital Identity Guidelines: Provides the risk assessment methodology and an
468   overview of general identity frameworks, using authenticators, credentials, and assertions
469   together in a digital system, and a risk-based process of selecting assurance levels. SP
470   800-63 contains both normative and informative material.
471   [SP800-63A]: Provides requirements for enrollment and identity proofing of applicants,
472   either remotely or in person, that wish to gain access to resources at each of the three
473   identity assurance levels (IALs). It details the responsibilities of Credential Service
474   Providers (CSPs) with respect to establishing and maintaining subscriber accounts and
475   binding authenticators (either CSP-issued or subscriber-provided) to the subscriber
476   account. SP 800-63A contains both normative and informative material.
477   [SP800-63B]: Provides recommendations on types of authentication processes, including
478   choices of authenticators, that may be used at each of the three authentication assurance
479   levels (AALs). It also provides recommendations on the lifecycle of authenticators,
480   including invalidation in the event of loss or theft. SP 800-63B contains both normative
481   and informative material.
482   [SP800-63C]: Provides requirements on the use of federated identity architectures
483   and assertions to convey the results of authentication processes and relevant identity
484   information to an agency application. Further, this volume offers privacy-enhancing
485   techniques to share information about a valid, authenticated subject, and describes
486   methods that allow for strong multi-factor authentication (MFA) while the subject
487   remains pseudonymous to the digital service. SP 800-63C contains both normative and
488   informative material.

489   2.3. Enterprise Risk Management Requirements and Considerations
490   Effective enterprise risk management is multidisciplinary by default and involves the
491   consideration of a diverse set of factors and equities. In a digital identity risk management
492   context, these factors include, but are not limited to, information security, privacy, equity,
493   and usability. It is important for risk management efforts to weigh these factors as
494   they relate not only to enterprise assets and operations but also to individuals, other
495   organizations, and society more broadly.
496   During the process of analyzing factors relevant to digital identity, organizations may
497   determine that measures outside of those specified in this publication are appropriate in
498   certain contexts, for instance where privacy or other legal requirements exist or where the
499   output of a risk assessment leads the organization to determine that additional measures or
500   other process safeguards are appropriate. Organizations, including federal agencies, may
