                                                                  GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



In theory, confining a scripting language to the boundaries of a Web browser should provide a relatively
secure environment. In practice, this has not been the case. Many attacks against browsers stem from the
use of a scripting language in combination with exploitation of a security vulnerability. The sources of
most problems have been twofold: the prevalence of implementation flaws in the execution environment
and the close binding of the browser to other functionality, such as an e-mail client. Past exploits include
sending a user’s URL history list to a remote site and using the mail address of the user to forge e-mails
[NIST01]. Client-side JavaScript can also be read and analyzed by an attacker to identify possible
vulnerabilities in the Web server.

Adobe Flash is a browser plug-in for major Web browsers that provides support for improved animation
and interactivity. Although plug-ins such as Flash allow browsers to support new types of content, they
are not active content in and of themselves, but simply an active-content-enabling technology. The Flash
plug-in allows browsers to support vector and raster graphics, streaming audio and video, and
ActionScript, a programming language similar to JavaScript used to control Flash animations. Several
versions of Flash contain security flaws that allow remote code execution, requiring users to apply
patches to the plug-in.

Adobe Shockwave is a browser plug-in similar to Adobe Flash but more robust. Shockwave provides a
faster rendering engine and supports hardware-accelerated three-dimensional graphics, layered graphics,
and network protocols. While Flash is widely used for Web animations and movies, Shockwave is
commonly used for games. As with Flash, several versions of Shockwave contain security flaws that
allow remote code execution, requiring users to apply patches to the plug-in.

AJAX is a collection of technologies that allows Web developers to improve the response times between
Web pages. JavaScript code communicates with the Web server and dynamically modifies the contents
of the Web browser’s page without relying on the Web server to send a response with the XML markup
for the entire page. Instead, only the required portion of the affected XML data is transmitted. AJAX
allows Web content to behave more like traditional applications, while potentially reducing the load on
the Web server. However, a number of security concerns exist with AJAX:

 AJAX creates a larger attack surface than traditional Web applications by increasing the number of
  points where a client interacts with the application.

 AJAX may reveal details of internal functions within the Web application.

 Some AJAX endpoints may not require authentication and instead rely on the current state of the
  application [SPID06].

Visual Basic Script (VBScript) is a programming language developed by Microsoft for creating scripts
that can be embedded in Web pages for viewing with the Internet Explorer browser. However, other
browsers do not necessarily support VBScript. Like JavaScript, VBScript is an interpreted language that
can process client-side scripts. VBScript, which is a subset of the Microsoft Visual Basic programming
language, works with Microsoft ActiveX controls. The language is similar to JavaScript and poses
similar risks.

ActiveX is a set of technologies from Microsoft that provide tools for linking desktop applications to the
Web. ActiveX controls are reusable component program objects that can be attached to e-mail or
downloaded from a Web site. ActiveX controls also come preinstalled on Windows platforms. Web
pages invoke ActiveX controls using a scripting language or with an HTML OBJECT tag. ActiveX
controls are compiled program objects, making them difficult to read and reverse engineer.
