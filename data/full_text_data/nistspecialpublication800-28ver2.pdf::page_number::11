2.     Background

The private and public sectors depend heavily upon IT systems to carry out essential, mission-critical
functions. As existing technology evolves and new technologies are introduced to provide new
capabilities and features, new vulnerabilities are often introduced as well. Organizations implementing
and using advanced technologies must be increasingly on guard.

One category of technologies that has emerged in recent years is active content. Although the term has
different connotations among individuals, it is used here in its broadest sense to refer to electronic
documents that contain embedded software components, which can carry out or trigger actions
automatically without an individual directly or knowingly invoking the actions. Examples of active
content documents are PDF 2 documents; Web pages conveying or linking to mobile code such as
JavaScript, VBScript, Java applets, and ActiveX controls; desktop application files containing macros;
and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) encoded email bearing executable content or attachments.
Taken to its extreme, active content becomes, in effect, a delivery mechanism for mobile code. The
purpose of this document is to provide an overview of active content, its technological underpinnings, and
suitable security measures, so that organizations understand the associated security risks and can make
informed IT security decisions on their applications.

Being able to download files and electronic documents off the Internet is a useful function and a common
practice for many people today. Web pages serve as an electronic counterpart to paper documents such as
forms, brochures, magazines, and newspapers. Although paper documents come in different shapes and
sizes, they are composed entirely of text and graphics. Web pages can entail active content capable of
delivering digitally encoded multimedia information or even an interactive experience enabled by
embedded computer instructions.

Active content involves a host of technologies such as built-in macro processing, scripting languages, and
virtual machines, which blur the distinctions between code and data. Electronic documents have evolved
to the point that they are themselves programs or contain programs that can be self-triggered. Loading a
document into a word processor can produce the same effect as executing a program and requires that
appropriate caution is taken.

The popularity of the Internet has particularly spurred the trend toward active content. A dynamic
weather map, a stock ticker, and live camera views or programmed broadcasts appearing on a Web page
are common examples of use of this technology. Web sites are also increasingly adopting technologies,
such as Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) and Adobe Flash, through which partial page update
transactions with remote Web servers or Web services can occur dynamically in the background—
providing a richer, more responsive interface for users than a complete page reload [Mcl05]. Capabilities
for Web access have also spread from desktop and laptop computers to portable handheld devices, such as
cell phones and personal digital assistants (PDA), and Internet appliances. Like any technology, active
content can provide a useful capability for legitimate purposes, but can also become a source of
vulnerabilities for an attacker to exploit. A significant share of today’s malware involves active content.

Many Web sites offer electronic documents that act in much the same way as paper documents—allowing
users to access and view content, follow references to other documents, and furnish information by filling
in forms. That is, Web pages delivered from Web servers to individuals via Web browsers impart an
inherent document metaphor [Ven99]. The value of this metaphor is that people are familiar with
