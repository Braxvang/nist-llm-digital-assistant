                                                                         GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


        IPv6 can be deployed just as securely as IPv4, although it should be expected that
         vulnerabilities within the protocol, as well as with implementation errors, will lead to an initial
         increase in IPv6-based vulnerabilities. As a successor to IPv4, IPv6 does incorporate many of
         the lessons learned by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for IPv4.

        IPv6 has already been deployed and is currently in operation in large networks globally.

To overcome possible obstacles associated with deploying IPv6, organizations should consider the
following recommendations:

        Encourage staff to increase their knowledge of IPv6 to a level comparable with their current
         understanding of IPv4

        Plan a phased IPv6 deployment utilizing appropriate transition mechanisms to support
         business needs; don’t deploy more transition mechanisms than necessary

        Plan for a long transition period with dual IPv4/IPv6 co-existence

Organizations that are not yet deploying IPv6 globally should implement the following recommendations:

        Block all IPv6 traffic, native and tunneled, at the organization's firewall. Both incoming and
         outgoing traffic should be blocked.

        Disable all IPv6-compatible ports, protocols and services on all software and hardware.

        Begin to acquire familiarity and expertise with IPv6, through laboratory experimentation
         and/or limited pilot deployments.

        Make organization web servers, located outside of the organizational firewall, accessible via
         IPv6 connections. This will enable IPv6-only users to access the servers and aid the
         organization in acquiring familiarity with some aspects of IPv6 deployment.

Organizations that are deploying IPv6 should implement the following recommendations to mitigate IPv6
threats:

        Apply an appropriate mix of different types of IPv6 addressing (privacy addressing, unique
         local addressing, sparse allocation, etc) to limit access and knowledge of IPv6-addressed
         environments.

        Use automated address management tools to avoid manual entry of IPv6 addresses, which is
         prone to error because of their length.

        Develop a granular ICMPv6 (Internet Control Protocol for IPv6) filtering policy for the
         enterprise. Ensure that ICMPv6 messages that are essential to IPv6 operation are allowed, but
         others are blocked.3

        Use IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) to authenticate and provide confidentiality to assets that
         can be tied to a scalable trust model (an example is access to Human Resources assets by

    NIST SP 500-267, A Profile for IPv6 in the US Government, specifies the capability to perform selective ICMPv6 filtering
    as a mandatory function. However, currently, that capability is not available in all products.
