3.4.1. Network Monitoring and Observability Tools
This class of tools gathers these data for obtaining visibility into the entire network. These data
are then used to generate a dashboard that presents the topography of the enterprise network by
showing all connections and presenting key operating parameters (e.g., latency, network traffic-
level). Some of these data generated by this class of tool and their uses are:
   •   Identification of interfaces: Monitoring tools identify the interfaces (called tracepoints)
       for defining the parameters for network resource provisioning and help the IaC generate
       the relevant code for invoking those interfaces.
   •   Measurement of drift: Despite using IaC to deploy the network infrastructure,
       unauthorized or ad hoc changes in network configuration can alter the performance and
       security parameters for application execution (called the drift). Monitoring tools should
       have the ability to monitor these drift parameters (e.g., bandwidth availability, unwanted
       traffic) and alert for corrective action.
   •   Secure overlay designs for cloud service access: Monitoring tools can generate data to
       enable centralized network management tools to perform security functions, such as
       building a virtual network segmentation on top of the native network segmentation
       features offered by CSP, provided that suitable APIs are available.
   •   Support for incidence response processes: Sophisticated network monitoring tools
       generate network security alerts and threat intelligence feeds. Handling these alerts and
       feeds is part of the incidence response (IR) process in an enterprise and is carried out by
       members of a security operations center (SOC). A security strategy that has evolved in
       recent years to automate the IR process is called security orchestration, automation, and
       response (SOAR). Some of the state of practice applications of SOAR include threat
       detection and response, vulnerability prioritization, compliance checks, and security
       audits with potential applications in many emerging areas, such as IoT management [15].

3.4.2. Automated Network Provisioning Tools
As already stated, automated network resource provisioning is enabled by infrastructure-as-code
(IaC) tools. The code that describes the networking infrastructure (in addition to the computing
and storage infrastructure) is stored in a code repository. The initial deployment of the
networking infrastructure and subsequent upgrade is automated by defining a workflow that
invokes the IaC (e.g., GitOps workflow) as part of a CI/CD pipeline definition [16]. The
advantages of this approach for managing the enterprise networking infrastructure for multi-
cloud deployment are:
   •   It enables the enterprise to have tight version control (tracking changes) so that
       unauthorized networking devices and changes in associated configurations do not open
       up security vulnerabilities.
   •   It enables the enterprise to have a uniform infrastructure across all environments –
       development, testing, staging, and production.
   •   Monitoring the drift (the unintended changes) between the defined infrastructure (as
       found in IaC) and the operational infrastructure (as measured by monitoring tools
