protocols that perform CKMS functions (e.g., generating keys and providing key
management information for insertion into the protocols) are considered part of the
CKMS.

Figure 6 is an example of an email application that uses a distributed CKMS. The
sender’s email application interfaces with the CKMS module, which generates the keys
that will be used to apply the required cryptographic protection for the email data to be
sent to the intended receiver via the Internet and, if required, to apply cryptographic
protection to the keys that will be transported to the receiving entity. The email
application then hands off the protected key and the protected data to the communication
mechanism for transmission. Note that the communication mechanism may also interact
with the CKMS module as discussed for Figure 5.

The communication mechanism in the sender’s system interacts with its CKMS module,
as appropriate, prior to sending the cryptographically protected email to the email
application. The email application sends the protected key to its local CKMS module to
obtain the key that will subsequently be used to process the protected email data.

2.10 CKMS Framework Components and Devices
This CKMS Framework uses the term “component” to mean the hardware, software,
and/or firmware required to construct the CKMS. The term “device” denotes a
