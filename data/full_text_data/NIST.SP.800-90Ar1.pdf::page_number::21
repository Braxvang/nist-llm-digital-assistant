NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                             Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                    Generation Using Deterministic RBGs

7.2 Other Inputs

Other information may be obtained by a DRBG mechanism as input. This information may or
may not be required to be kept secret by a consuming application; however, the security of the
DRBG itself does not rely on the secrecy of this information. The information should be checked
for validity when possible; for example, if time is used as an input, the format and reasonableness
of the time could be checked. In most cases, a nonce is required during instantiation (see Sections
8.6.1 and 8.6.7). When required, the nonce is combined with the entropy input to create the initial
DRBG seed.
A personalization string should be used during DRBG instantiation; when used, the
personalization string is combined with the entropy input bits and possibly a nonce to create the
initial DRBG seed. The personalization string should be unique for all instantiations of the same
DRBG mechanism type (e.g., all instantiations of HMAC_DRBG). See Section 8.7.1 for
additional discussion on personalization strings.
Additional input may also be provided during reseeding and when pseudorandom bits are
requested. See Section 8.7.2 for a discussion of this input.

7.3 The Internal State

The internal state is the memory of the DRBG and consists of all of the parameters, variables and
other stored values that the DRBG mechanism uses or acts upon. The internal state contains both
administrative data (e.g., the security strength) and data that is acted upon and/or modified during
the generation of pseudorandom bits (i.e., the working state).

7.4 The DRBG Mechanism Functions

The DRBG mechanism functions handle the DRBGâ€™s internal state. The DRBG mechanisms in
this Recommendation have five separate functions:
   1. The instantiate function acquires entropy input and may combine it with a nonce and a
      personalization string to create a seed from which the initial internal state is created.
   2. The generate function generates pseudorandom bits upon request, using the current
      internal state and possibly additional input; a new internal state for the next request is also
      generated.
   3. The reseed function acquires new entropy input and combines it with the current internal
      state and any additional input that is provided to create a new seed and a new internal
      state.
   4. The uninstantiate function zeroizes (i.e., erases) the internal state.
   5. The health test function determines that the DRBG mechanism continues to function
      correctly.
