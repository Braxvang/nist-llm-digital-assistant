     Recommendation for Digital Signature Timeliness
1      Introduction
A digital signature is an electronic analogue of a written signature; the digital signature
can be used to provide assurance that the claimed signatory signed the information. In
addition, a digital signature may be used to detect whether or not the information was
modified after it was signed (i.e., to detect the integrity of the signed data).
Establishing the time when a digital signature was generated is often a critical
consideration. A signed message that includes the (purported) signing time provides no
assurance that the private key was used to sign the message at that time unless the
accuracy of the time can be trusted. With the appropriate use of 1) timestamps that are
digitally signed by a Trusted Timestamp Authority (TTA), and/or 2) verifier-supplied
data that is included in the signed message, some level of assurance about the time that
the message was signed can be provided. A discussion of the establishment and
management of a TTA is outside the scope of this Recommendation. For further
information about TTAs, see [3], [4], and [5].

2      Authority
This document has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information
Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347.
NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum
requirements, for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and
assets, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems.
This recommendation is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency Information
Systems, as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.
This Recommendation has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by
non-governmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright
(attribution would be appreciated by NIST).
Nothing in this Recommendation should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines
made mandatory and binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under
statutory authority. Nor should this Recommendation be interpreted as altering or
superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB,
or any other federal official.
Conformance testing for implementations of this Recommendation will be conducted
within the framework of the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP), a joint
effort of NIST and the Communications Security Establishment Canada. The
requirements of this Recommendation are indicated by the word “shall.”
