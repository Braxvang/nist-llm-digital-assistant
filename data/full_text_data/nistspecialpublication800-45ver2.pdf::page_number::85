                                                                                   GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



 Non-repudiation ensures that the sender cannot deny creating the message.
 Integrity ensures that the message has not accidentally or maliciously been altered during
  transmission from sender to recipient.
Digital certificates can be obtained from either an internal certificate authority (CA) or a public, third-
party CA. 53 Table 3.3 contains a list of third-party CAs.

For a mail client that is configured to send and receive encrypted messages, received messages should be
stored in their encrypted format only if they need to continue to be protected; otherwise, it is preferable to
allow users to choose which messages should be stored encrypted, if any. 54 The mail client may also be
configured to send and receive unencrypted, but authenticated, messages, where integrity is the primary
concern. Under normal circumstances, the mail client should be set to require a password once per email
session. Requiring a password each time a message is opened for reading can take considerable time and
can discourage people from using encryption to protect emails; accordingly, this level of security is
typically used only for the highest-security needs.

8.3     Plug-ins

A number of different plug-ins are available for mail clients. These plug-ins offer additional functionality
beyond that of the basic mail client configuration. Mail encryption, anti-virus, pop-up blocker, and
malware prevention plug-ins are a small subset of the types of plug-ins available. Some provide
advanced filtering capabilities, whereas others provide audible notification of new messages. Regardless
of the type of plug-in, care needs to be taken when installing them. Generally, only install plug-ins from
trusted sources. Be wary of any plug-in that has not been distributed from the manufacturer in a digitally
signed archive. Some plug-ins offering additional functionality may contain spyware that can track the
Web sites a user visits or adware that delivers pop-up advertisements. They can come in the form of a
toolbar that is automatically installed in your Internet browser. Using manufacturers’ Web sites to
acquire plug-ins reduces the likelihood of installing a malicious plug-in.

8.4     Accessing Web-Based Mail Systems

From a user standpoint, accessing a mail server via a Web browser can be efficient and convenient.
Unfortunately, a number of security concerns should be carefully considered before implementing Web-
based access to mail servers. Many of the concerns are the same as those for standard mail clients. For
example, the default configuration for Web-based access normally sends passwords and data in the clear,
such as those for POP and IMAP. For greater security, organizations should configure the mail server to
accept Web connections only via 128-bit SSL/TLS connections. 55 This setting causes both user
authentication and email content to be encrypted during transmission from the user’s Web browser to the
Web server. However, it does not protect the content as it is transmitted from the mail server to the
recipient(s); some form of email encryption, such as S/MIME or OpenPGP, would need to be used if
message confidentiality is required. Unfortunately, most Web-based mail systems do not directly support

      In most cases, users can save email attachments unencrypted, print the unencrypted email message text, and perform other
      actions that leave the email message content unprotected. If such actions are permitted, then requiring the emails to be
      stored encrypted may create a false sense of protection. Also, it might be difficult or impossible to read the encrypted
      emails after the current credentials have expired.
