Information Technology Security Training Requirements


a class of professionals with expertise in system and information protection. IT security
professionalization is rapidly becoming a "business competency" in the public and private
sectors.


IT security professionalization criteria are outside the scope of this document. The training
guidance in Chapter 4 can be used and sequenced by agencies on an individualized basis as a
cost-effective way to fill gaps in a given practitioner's knowledge and prepare him/her for formal
education that may be needed for credentialing or other demonstrable measures of qualification
in IT security.



An rr security professional is one who integrates the principles of the IT security field in a
forward-looking manner to keep up with technology trends and their evolving security
implications.   At the "Training" level of the learning continuum, the specific knowledge and
skills acquired may become obsolete as technology changes. The exploratory nature of education

differentiates it from training. From this exploratory vantage point, advances in thought and
theory make their way into security practices taught in training programs. The educated IT
security professional has the comprehensive grasp of the field required to take responsibility for
their further learning in an ever-changing environment.


At the advanced level of IT security professionalization, such as that of an IT Security Program
Manager, an employee should be able to represent the organization and participate actively and
constructively in addressing interagency or cross-cutting issues and concerns. Examples include
increasing the effectiveness of assurance techniques; developing security policy models;
participating in symposia or workgroups; or contributing to, developing, or managing training
programs.


To reach the advanced level of FT security professionalization, completion of formal education in
the field is required. With regard to formal education, organizational officials who appoint/
supervise IT security specialists should know two important points: first, a concentration or
                                                                     —
major can be located in any of a number of departments or colleges from business
administration to computer science; and second, regardless of where a concentration or major
may be placed in a given university, the program of study should incorporate a well-planned
infusion of coirmiunications technology, human/behavioral science, mathematics, computer
science, engineering, business ethics, and information law.


2.3   Comparative Framework

As illustrated in the learning continuum, "Awareness" constitutes the point-of-entry for all
employees into the progression of IT security knowledge levels; the "Training" level, starting
with "Security Basics and Literacy," then builds a wide range of security-related skills needed by
employees in several functional area categories; and the "Education" level is the capstone of the
learning continuum   — creating expertise necessary for IT security specialists and professionals.
