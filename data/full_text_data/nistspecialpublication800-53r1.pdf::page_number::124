FAMILY: SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION                                               CLASS: MANAGEMENT


SA-1      SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION POLICY AND PROCEDURES

          Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a formal,
          documented, system and services acquisition policy that includes information security
          considerations and that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management
          commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and (ii) formal,
          documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system and services acquisition
          policy and associated system and services acquisition controls.
          Supplemental Guidance: The system and services acquisition policy and procedures are consistent
          with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.
          The system and services acquisition policy can be included as part of the general information
          security policy for the organization. System and services acquisition procedures can be developed
          for the security program in general, and for a particular information system, when required. NIST
          Special Publication 800-12 provides guidance on security policies and procedures.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW SA-1                      MOD SA-1                  HIGH SA-1



SA-2      ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES

          Control: The organization determines, documents, and allocates as part of its capital planning and
          investment control process, the resources required to adequately protect the information system.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization includes the determination of security requirements for
          the information system in mission/business case planning and establishes a discrete line item for
          information system security in the organizationâ€™s programming and budgeting documentation.
          NIST Special Publication 800-65 provides guidance on integrating security into the capital
          planning and investment control process.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW SA-2                      MOD SA-2                  HIGH SA-2



SA-3      LIFE CYCLE SUPPORT

          Control: The organization manages the information system using a system development life cycle
          methodology that includes information security considerations.
          Supplemental Guidance: NIST Special Publication 800-64 provides guidance on security
          considerations in the system development life cycle.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW SA-3                      MOD SA-3                  HIGH SA-3
