      NIST SP 800-73pt3-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)         Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 3
      September 2023                                                                             PIV Client API



197       Overview: Concepts and Constructs
198   SP 800-73-5 Parts 2 and 3 define two interfaces to an ICC that contain the PIV Card Application:
199   a low-level card command interface (SP 800-73-5 Part2) and a high-level client API (Part 3). SP
200   800-73-5 Part 3 (this document) is optional, and NIST Personal Identity Verification Program
201   (NPIVP) conformance testing for PIV Middleware in accordance with SP 800-73 Part 3 is
202   discontinued since endpoints support high level-client API natively at the time of this
203   publication.
204   The information processing concepts and data constructs on both interfaces are identical and
205   MAY be referred to generically as the information processing concepts and data constructs on the
206   PIV interfaces without specific reference to the client API or the card command interface.
207   The client API provides task-specific programmatic access to these concepts and constructs, and
208   the card command interface provides communication access. The client API is used by client
209   applications using the PIV Card Application. The card command interface is used by software
210   that implement the client API (middleware).
211   The client API is thought of as being at a higher level than the card command interface because
212   access to a single entry point on the client API may cause multiple card commands to traverse
213   the card command interface. In other words, it may require more than one card command on the
214   card command interface to accomplish the task represented by a single call on an entry point of
215   the client API.
216   The client API is a program execution, call/return style interface, whereas the card command
217   interface is a communication protocol, command/response style interface. Because of this
218   difference, the representation of the PIV concepts and constructs as bits and bytes on the client
219   API may be different from the representation of these same concepts and constructs on the card
220   command interface.
