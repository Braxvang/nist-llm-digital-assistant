1830          Determining Post-Implementation Activities
1831   Once any CPLP element has been delivered or implemented, the post-implementation activities
1832   that fuel assessment and improvements should be managed. These will include:
1833      •   Sending post-training feedback surveys
1834      •   Conducting instructor feedback surveys
1835      •   Determining attendance and completion rates
1836      •   Other mandated or organizational reporting
1837      •   Budget reconciliation (i.e., did the CPLP element implementation meet budget
1838          requirements or go over or under?)
1839   For some awareness elements, measuring audience engagement is less straightforward,
1840   especially for passive items like posters or email signatures. Nevertheless, it is possible to
1841   measure impact. One method could include surveying a sample of users to discuss their
1842   familiarity with the messaging or whether they have practiced any of the tips.
