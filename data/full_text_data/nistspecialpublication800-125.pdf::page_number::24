                                                       GUIDE TO SECURITY FOR FULL VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGIES



Of course, it is also important to provide physical access controls for the hardware on which the
virtualization system runs. For example, hosted hypervisors are typically controlled by management
software that can be used by anyone with access to the keyboard and mouse. Even bare metal hypervisors
require physical security: someone who can reboot the host computer that the hypervisor is running on
could alter some of the security settings for the hypervisor. It is also important to secure the external
resources that the hypervisor uses, particularly data on hard drives and other storage devices.

There are additional recommendations for hosted virtualization solutions for server virtualization. Hosted
virtualization exposes the system to more threats because of the presence of a host OS. To increase the
security of the host OS, minimize the number of applications other than the hypervisor that are ever run
on the system. All unneeded applications should be removed. Those that remain should be restricted as
much as possible to prevent malware from being inadvertently installed on the system. For example, a
web browser is often used to download updates to the hypervisor, and also to read instructions and
bulletins about the hypervisor. If the computer is intended to be exclusively used to run the hosted
hypervisor, the web browser should have as many settings as possible adjusted to their highest security
level.

Because hosted virtualization systems are run under host OSs, the security of every guest OS relies on the
security of the host OS. This means that there should be tight access controls to the host OS to prevent
someone from gaining access through the host OS to the virtualization system and possibly changing its
settings or modifying the guest OSs.

There has been some concern in the security community about designing hypervisors so that they cannot
be detected by attackers. The motivation for this is to provide an additional layer of security that is
invisible to the attacker, thus preventing successful attacks against the hypervisor and the host OS below
it. However, hypervisors have various characteristics that permit attackers to detect their presence.
Detection techniques include checking for hypervisor artifacts in processes, file system, registry, or
memory; checking for hypervisor-specific processor instructions or capabilities; and checking for
hypervisor-specific virtual hardware devices. These detection techniques are hypervisor implementation-
dependent. Although hypervisor detection can be deterred by a vendor modifying the hypervisorâ€™s
implementation or hiding its identifiable software artifacts, it is not possible to completely hide all
characteristics. When planning their virtualization security, organizations should not assume that attackers
will not be able to detect the presence of a hypervisor or the product type and version.

4.2   Guest OS Security

A guest OS running in a virtualized environment acts almost identically to the OS running on real
hardware. All of the security considerations that apply to OSs running on real hardware also apply to
guest OSs; however, there are some additional security considerations for guest OSs.

To run in a virtual machine, a guest OS needs to use video, sound, keyboard, mouse, and network
hardware drivers that are specific to the hypervisor. There are no specific security issues with such drivers
unless they have programming bugs that are not present in the normal drivers.

More importantly, many hosted virtualization systems allow guest OSs to share information with the host
OS through shared disks or folders, which are normally created by emulating networked disks. In either
case, if one guest OS has been compromised by malware, it might spread the malware through the shared
disk or folder. This is a security vulnerability that does not exist on regular OSs unless they have shared
network storage. Organizations that have security policies that cover network shared storage should apply
those policies to shared disks in virtualization systems.
