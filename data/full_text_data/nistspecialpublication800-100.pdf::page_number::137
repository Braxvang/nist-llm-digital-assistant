CHAPTER 13                                                        Incident Response


   • Deploying software throughout the organization to detect and stop malicious
     code; and
   • Making users aware of policies and procedures on the appropriate use of
     networks, systems, and applications.

13.2 Detection and Analysis
    Detection and analysis are, for many organizations, the most challenging aspects
of the incident response process, in other words, accurately detecting and assessing
possible incidents—determining whether an incident has occurred and, if so, the
type, extent, and magnitude of the problem. Incidents can be detected through
many different means, with varying levels of detail and fidelity. Automated detection
capabilities include network-based and host-based intrusion detection systems
(IDSs), antivirus software, and log analyzers. Incidents may also be detected
through manual means, such as user reports. Some incidents have overt signs that
can be easily detected, whereas others are virtually undetectable without
automation.
    In a typical organization, the thousands or millions of possible signs of incidents
that occur any given day are recorded mainly by computer security software.
Automation is needed to perform an initial analysis of the data and select events of
interest for human review. Event correlation software and centralized logging can be
of great value in automating the analysis process. However, the effectiveness of the
process depends on the quality of the data that goes into it. Organizations should
establish logging standards and procedures to ensure that adequate information is
collected by logs and security software and that the data is reviewed regularly.
Proper and efficient reviews of incident-related data require people with extensive,
specialized technical knowledge and experience.
     When a potential incident is identified, the incident response team should work
quickly to analyze and validate it, documenting each step taken. The team should
rapidly perform an initial analysis to determine the incident’s scope, attack methods,
and targeted vulnerabilities. This analysis should provide enough information for the
team to prioritize subsequent activities, including the containment of the incident.
When in doubt, incident handlers should assume the worst until additional analyses
indicate otherwise. In addition to prioritization guidelines, organizations should also
establish an escalation process for those instances when the incident response team
fails to respond to an incident within the designated time.
    The incident response team should maintain records about the status of
incidents, along with other pertinent information. Using an application or database
for this purpose is necessary to ensure that incidents are handled and resolved in a
timely manner. The incident response team should safeguard this data and other
data related to incidents because it often contains sensitive information concerning
recent security breaches, exploited vulnerabilities, and users that may have
performed inappropriate actions.

13.3 Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
    It is important to contain an incident before it spreads to avoid overwhelming
resources and increasing damage caused by the incident. Most incidents require
containment, so it is important to consider it early in the course of handling each
incident. An essential part of containment is decision making, such as shutting down
a system, disconnecting it from the network, or disabling certain system functions.
Such decisions are much easier to make if strategies and procedures for containing



                                                                                   128
