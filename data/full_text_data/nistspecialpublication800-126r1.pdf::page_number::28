                 The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



      2. The <cpe_dict:check> element data associated with the identified <cpe_dict:cpe-
         item> element SHALL be evaluated using the referenced CPE inventory data stream component
         within the same data stream.

      3. The result of evaluation SHALL be handled according to Section 4.7.3 of this document, with a
         result of ―pass‖ indicating that the CPE Name was found on the machine.

4.5     Check System Usage

In XCCDF content, if multiple <xccdf:check-content-ref> elements are provided, then the
following evaluation method SHALL be performed:

      1. Evaluate each <xccdf:check-content-ref> element in the order that it appears in the
         <xccdf:check> element. The first resolvable <xccdf:check-content-ref> element
         SHALL be used to determine the <xccdf:Rule> status.

      2. For each <xccdf:check-content-ref> element, a product will attempt to retrieve the
         document referenced by the @href attribute. If not resolvable, the next available
         <xccdf:check-content-ref> element SHALL be evaluated. If none of the
         <xccdf:check-content-ref> elements are resolvable, then the result of the rule
         evaluation SHALL be the XCCDF ―unchecked‖ status and processing of the <xccdf:Rule>
         SHALL end. Please note that it is acceptable to map a remote URL to a local copy of the file in
         cases where remote access is not available, not allowed, or not practical.

      3. Once a resolvable <xccdf:check-content-ref> element is found, then check system
         processing SHALL proceed. When evaluating a rule, an <xccdf:rule-
         result/xccdf:message> with the @severity attribute value of ―info‖ SHALL be
         generated, indicating the <xccdf:check-content-ref> @href and @name, if provided.

Use of XCCDF check systems as specified in the <xccdf:check> element‘s @system attribute
SHALL be restricted as follows:

      1. SCAP scanning products SHALL implement the SCAP supported check systems that are required
         for the SCAP capability or capabilities that the products offer. The SCAP supported check
         systems are:

           i.   OVAL check system. Use of the OVAL check system SHALL be indicated by the
                http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5 system identifier.

          ii.   OCIL check system. Use of the OCIL check system SHALL be indicated by the
                http://scap.nist.gov/schema/ocil/2 system identifier.

      2. SCAP scanning tools MAY implement check systems that are not supported by SCAP.

      3. Evaluation of an <xccdf:check> containing a reference to a non-SCAP check system SHALL
         produce an ―unchecked‖ result if an SCAP scanning product does not implement the check
         system.

An <xccdf:check-content-ref> element may omit the @name attribute only for a patches up-to-
date rule (see Section 3.2.6.4). When processing a patches-up-to-date rule, only OVAL patch class
