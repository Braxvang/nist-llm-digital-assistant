       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                        Authentication and Lifecycle Management


1868   In addition, session maintenance cookies SHOULD be tagged to be inaccessible via
1869   JavaScript (HttpOnly). They SHOULD contain only an opaque string (such as a session
1870   identifier), and SHOULD NOT contain cleartext PII. They SHOULD be tagged to expire
1871   at, or soon after, the session’s validity period. This latter requirement is intended to limit
1872   the accumulation of cookies, but SHALL NOT be depended upon to enforce session
1873   timeouts.

1874   7.1.2. Access Tokens
1875   An access token — such as found in OAuth — is used to allow an application to access a
1876   set of services on a subscriber’s behalf following an authentication event. The presence
1877   of an OAuth access token SHALL NOT be interpreted by the RP as presence of the
1878   subscriber, in the absence of other signals. The OAuth access token, and any associated
1879   refresh tokens, MAY be valid long after the authentication session has ended and the
1880   subscriber has left the application.

1881   7.1.3. Device Identiﬁcation
1882   Other methods of secure device identification — including but not limited to mutual
1883   TLS, token binding, or other mechanisms — MAY be used to enact a session between a
1884   subscriber and a service.

1885   7.2. Reauthentication
1886   Periodic reauthentication of sessions SHALL be performed to confirm the continued
1887   presence of the subscriber at an authenticated session (i.e., that the subscriber has not
1888   walked away without logging out).
1889   A session SHALL NOT be extended past the guidelines in Sections 4.1.3, 4.2.3, and
1890   4.3.3 (depending on AAL) based on presentation of the session secret alone. Prior to
1891   session expiration, the reauthentication time limit SHALL be extended by prompting the
1892   subscriber for the authentication factors specified in Table 2.
1893   When a session has been terminated, due to a time-out or other action, the subscriber
1894   SHALL be required to establish a new session by authenticating again.

                               Table 2. AAL Reauthentication Requirements

                        AAL      Requirement
                        1        Presentation of any one factor
                        2        Presentation of a memorized secret or biometric
                        3        Presentation of all factors

1895         Note: At AAL2, a memorized secret or biometric, and not a physical
1896         authenticator, is required because the session secret is something you have,
1897         and an additional authentication factor is required to continue the session.
