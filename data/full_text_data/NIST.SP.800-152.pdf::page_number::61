SP 800-152                                                     A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


6.4.8 Key Derivation or Key Update
When a key is derived from other information (some of which is secret) in a non-reversible
manner, the process is called key derivation. Key update is a special case of key derivation in
which the secret information includes a symmetric key (K1), and the derived symmetric key
(K2) replaces K1 for the next key-update process. Key updating could result in a security
exposure if an adversary obtains a key and knows the update process used. Key update is not
supported in this Profile.

FR:6.36 The CKMS design shall specify all processes used to derive or update keys and the
circumstances under which the keys are derived or updated.

FR:6.37 For each key type, the CKMS design shall specify requirements for advance
notification for deriving or updating the keys, including which parties are notified, how they
are notified, what security services are applied to the notification, and the time-frames for
notification(s).

                           A Federal CKMS shall not support key update.
PR:6.31

                           A Federal CKMS shall use only NIST-approved or allowed
PR:6.32
                           key derivation methods.

6.4.9 Destroy a Key and Metadata
When a key and its sensitive metadata are no longer to be used for normal operations, then all
copies residing in operational storage (including within a cryptographic module) and in
backup storage should be destroyed as soon as possible. Keys and sensitive metadata in an
archive should be destroyed when no longer needed. Non-sensitive metadata may be
retained for administrative purposes.

This Profile considers this function to be a local function, destroying only locally stored keys
upon request. Destroying keys in remote locations may require special messages that request
a key's destruction.

FR:6.38 The CKMS design shall specify how and the circumstances under which keys are
intentionally destroyed and whether the destruction is local or universal throughout the
CKMS.

FR:6.39 For each key type, the CKMS design shall specify requirements for an advance
notification of key destruction, including which parties are notified, how they are notified,
what security services are applied to the notification, and the time-frames for notification(s).

                           When a key and/or its sensitive metadata are no longer to be
PR:6.33
                           used, a Federal CKMS shall destroy all local copies of the key
                           and/or its sensitive metadata.
