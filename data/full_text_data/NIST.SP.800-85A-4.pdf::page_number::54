NIST SP 800-85A-4                                                PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                          INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES


VE05.22A.01: The vendor shall state in its documentation that the card supports the assertion made
in AS05.22A.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.22A.01: The tester shall review the vendor’s documentation and validate that it contains the
information required in VE05.22A.01 and the card returns status word '6A 80' when the PIN
information in the reference data field of the command is not padded to 8 bytes.

AS05.22B: If the key reference is set to a value other than what is supported by the card, the
PIV Card Application shall return the status word '6A 88' (key reference not found).

Required Vendor Information

VE05.22B.01: The vendor shall state in its documentation that the card supports the assertion made
in AS05.22B.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.22B.01: The tester shall review the vendor’s documentation and validate that it contains the
information required in VE05.22B.01.

AS05.22C-R4: The VERIFY command shall reset the security status of the key reference in P2
when the P1 parameter is 'FF' and both L c and the data field are absent. The security status of
the key reference specified in P2 shall be set to FALSE and the retry counter associated with
the key reference shall remain unchanged.

Required Vendor Information
VE05.22C-R4.01: The vendor shall state in its documentation that the card supports the assertion
made in AS05.22C-R4.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.22C-R4.01: The tester shall validate that when using the VERIFY command the security
status of the key reference in P2 is reset when the P1 parameter is 'FF' and both L c and the data field
are absent. The tester shall also validate that in this scenario the retry counter remains unchanged.

AS05.22D-R4: If the key reference is '00' or '80' and the authentication data in the command
data field does not satisfy the criteria in Section 2.4.3 of Part 2 of SP 800-73-4, then the card
command shall fail and the PIV Card Application shall return either the status word '6A 80'
or '63 CX'. If status word '6A 80' is returned, the security status and the retry counter of the
key reference shall remain unchanged. If status word '63 CX' is returned, the security status
of the key reference shall be set to FALSE and the retry counter associated with the key
reference shall be decremented by one.
