                                         Abstract

Entities participating in the generation or verification of digital signatures depend on the
authenticity of the process. This Recommendation specifies methods for obtaining the
assurances necessary for valid digital signatures: assurance of domain parameter validity,
assurance of public key validity, assurance that the key pair owner actually possesses the
private key, and assurance of the identity of the key pair owner.


KEY WORDS: assurance, Certification Authority, digital signatures, timestamp token,
Trusted Timestamp Authority.
