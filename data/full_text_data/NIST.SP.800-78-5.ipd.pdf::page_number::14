317   In addition to the key sizes, keys must be generated using secure parameters. Rivest-Shamir-
318   Adleman (RSA) keys must be generated using a public exponent of 65537. Elliptic curve keys
319   must correspond to one of the following recommended curves from [FIPS186]:
320        •    Curve P-256 or
321        •    Curve P-384.
322   Note that elliptic curve keys are a faster option than RSA-based keys for the Card Authentication
323   key for physical access since elliptic curve private key computation time is significantly shorter
324   than RSA-based private key computation time. There is no phaseout date specified for either
325   curve.
326   If the PIV Card Application supports the virtual contact interface [SP800-73] and the digital
327   signature key, the key management key, or any of the retired key management keys are elliptic
328   curve keys that correspond to Curve P-384, then the PIV Secure Messaging key shall use P-384.
329   Otherwise, it may use P-256 or P-384.
330   While this specification requires that the RSA public exponent associated with PIV keys be
331   65537, applications should be able to process RSA public keys that have any public exponent
332   that is an odd positive integer greater than or equal to 65537 and less than 2256.
333   This specification requires the key management key to be an RSA key transport key or an
334   Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key. The specifications for RSA key transport are
335   [PKCS1] and [SP800-56B], and the specification for ECDH key is [SP800-56A].

       3TDEA is Triple DES using Keying Option 1 from [SP800-67], which requires that all three keys be unique (i.e., Key1 ≠ Key2, Key2 ≠ Key3, and
      Key3 ≠ Key1).
