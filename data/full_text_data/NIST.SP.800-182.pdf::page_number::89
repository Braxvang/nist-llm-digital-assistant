            The group is recognized for its exceptional leadership and outstanding technical achievement in
            developing an innovative framework to improve the cybersecurity of our nation’s critical infrastructure.
            In Executive Order 13636, the President directed NIST to create a Cybersecurity Framework to manage
            and reduce cybersecurity risk across the nation’s critical infrastructure sectors. The team convened a
            highly diverse community to achieve consensus on a framework of standards, guidelines, and practices
            to identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risk.
