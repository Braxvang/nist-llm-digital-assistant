SP 800-152                                      A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


             When interoperability is required, and digital signature
PR:7.6
             generation and verification is to be performed using DSA, the
             hash function used during signature generation and
             verification shall be selected as specified in PR:7.5.
             When interoperability is required, and digital signature
PR:7.7
             generation and verification is to be performed using ECDSA,
             a Federal CKMS shall support curve P-256 as the default
             curve to be used for Low and Moderate impact-levels, and
             curve P-384 for High impact-levels. The hash function used
             during signature generation and verification shall be selected
             as specified in PR:7.5.
             When interoperability is required, and digital signature
PR:7.8
             generation and verification is to be performed using RSA, a
             Federal CKMS shall support the RSASSA-PSS signature
             scheme as the default scheme. The hash function used during
             signature generation and verification shall be selected as
             specified in PR:7.5.
             When interoperability is required, and HMAC is to be used, a
PR:7.9
             Federal CKMS shall support HMAC-SHA-256 as the default
             for Low and Moderate impact-levels, and HMAC-SHA-384
             as the default for High impact-levels, as specified in [FIPS
             198] and [FIPS 180].
             When interoperability is required, and an interactive, finite-
PR:7.10
             field DH key-agreement scheme is to be used for key
             establishment, a Federal CKMS shall support the dhEphem
             scheme specified in [SP 800-56A] as the default scheme, with
             the concatenation KDF as the key-derivation method. For
             Low and Moderate impact-level systems, the KDF shall use
             SHA-256; for High impact-level systems, the KDF shall use
             SHA-384 for the default scheme.
             When interoperability is required, and an interactive, elliptic-
PR:7.11
             curve DH key-agreement scheme is to be used for key
             establishment, a Federal CKMS shall support the Ephemeral
             Unified Model scheme specified in [SP 800-56A] as the
             default scheme, with the concatenation KDF as the key-
             derivation method. Low and Moderate impact-level systems
             shall use curve P-256 and SHA-256 during the key-
             agreement transaction; High impact-level systems shall use
             curve P-384 and SHA-384.
