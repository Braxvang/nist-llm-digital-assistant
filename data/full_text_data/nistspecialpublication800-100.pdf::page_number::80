   − Dial-in access                        − Assignment and limitations of system privileges and individual accountability
   − Connection to the Internet            − Password usage
   − Use of copyrighted work               − Searching databases and divulging information


8.4 System Security Plan Approval
   Organizational policy should clearly define who is responsible for system security
plan approval and procedures developed for plan submission, including any special
memorandum language or other documentation required by the agency. Prior to the
security certification and accreditation process, the authorizing official, independent
from the system owner, typically approves the plan.

8.4.1 System Boundary Analysis and Security Controls
     Before the system security plan can be developed, the information system and
the information resident within that system must be categorized based on a FIPS 199
impact analysis. 59 Then a determination can be made as to which systems in the
inventory can be logically grouped into GSSs or MAs. The FIPS 199 impact levels
must be considered when the system boundaries are drawn and when selecting the
initial set of security controls (e.g., control baseline). The baseline security controls
can then be tailored based on an assessment of risk and local conditions, including
organization-specific security requirements, specific threat information, cost-benefit
analyses, the availability of compensating controls, or special circumstances.
Common security controls, which is one of the tailoring considerations, must be
identified prior to system security plan preparation to identify those controls covered
at the agency level that are not system-specific. These common security controls can
then be incorporated into the system security plan by reference. Figure 8-1 depicts
how large GSSs can be broken down for the purpose of security planning.
    The process of uniquely assigning information resources 60 to an information
system defines the security boundary for that system. Agencies have great flexibility
in determining what constitutes an information system (i.e., MA or GSS). If a set of
information resources is identified as an information system, the resources should
generally be under the same direct management control. Direct management
control 61 does not necessarily imply that there is no intervening management. It is
also possible for an information system to contain multiple subsystems. A subsystem
is a major subdivision or component of an information system consisting of
information, information technology (IT), and personnel that perform one or more
specific functions.

   See NIST SP 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security
   Categories, for supporting guidance on system categorization.
60
   Information resources consist of information and related resources such as personnel, equipment,
   funds, and information technology.
61
   Direct management control typically involves budgetary, programmatic, or operational authority and
   associated responsibility. For new information systems, management control can be interpreted as
   having budgetary/programmatic authority and responsibility for developing and deploying the
   information systems. For information systems currently in the federal inventory, management control
   can be interpreted as having budgetary/operational authority for the day-to-day operation and
   maintenance of the information systems.
