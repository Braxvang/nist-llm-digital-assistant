                         Reports on Computer Systems Technology

The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical leadership for the Nation’s
measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test methods, reference data, proof of
concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the development and productive use of
information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the development of management, administrative,
technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of other than
national security-related information in federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series
reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its
collaborative activities with industry, government, and academic organizations.

Virtual machines (VMs) are key resources to be protected since they are the compute engines hosting
mission-critical applications. Since VMs are end nodes of a virtual network, the configuration of the
virtual network is an important element in the security of the VMs and their hosted applications. The
virtual network configuration areas discussed in this document are network segmentation, network path
redundancy, traffic control using firewalls, and VM traffic monitoring. This document analyzes the
configuration options under these areas and presents a corresponding set of recommendations for secure
virtual network configuration for VM protection.
