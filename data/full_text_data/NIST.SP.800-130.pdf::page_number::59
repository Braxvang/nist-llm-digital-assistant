FR: 6.72 The CKMS design shall specify how the trust anchors are managed in relying-
entity systems to ensure that only authorized additions, modifications, and deletions are
made to the relying-entity systemâ€™s trust anchor store.

6.5 Cryptographic Key and/or Metadata Security: In Storage
When cryptographic keys are submitted for storage, they are typically submitted with
their metadata. The metadata may include an owner identifier or user access control list.
If any of the metadata is incorrect, then the false information will be perpetuated by the
CKMS system. Therefore, a CKMS storage system should verify the authorization of the
submitting entity and the integrity of the submitted data before any data is stored 15.
When cryptographic keys are stored, they require protection. Symmetric keys and private
keys require confidentiality protection and access control. All keys require integrity
protection. For confidentiality protection, cryptography, computer security, and/or
physical security can be employed. If symmetric key cryptography is used for key
confidentiality, then there often exists a symmetric key wrapping key that is used to
encrypt and decrypt the stored keys and confidential metadata. At the top level in the key
encrypting key hierarchy, there typically is a key that must be physically protected.

If asymmetric key cryptography is used for key confidentiality, then a public key could
be used to encrypt stored keys. The corresponding private key that is used to decrypt the
keys must be protected in some manner, e.g., using physical security and key splitting
(see Section 6.7.5), that usually does not involve encryption.

All stored keys require integrity protection because a garbled key will not correctly
perform its intended function and may compromise another key under some
circumstances. Physical security can provide integrity protection for keys, but additional
methods are frequently used. An error detection code can detect an unintentional garble
in a key, and an error correction code can correct certain garbles. However, if a key could
be intentionally garbled, then a cryptographic integrity check like a MAC or digital
signature should be implemented for error detection. If an uncorrectable garble is
detected, the garbled key should not be used. When public keys are contained within a
certificate, they are provided integrity protection by means of the digital signature on the
certificate. If public keys are stored outside of their certificate, then their integrity needs
to be protected by some other means.

A CKMS should only allow authorized users to have access to stored keys. Thus, a
CKMS should have some type of access control system (ACS) (see Section 6.7.1). The
ACS may be as simple as requiring a password or cryptographic key from the authorized
user of the key, and/or it may make use of biometric authentication techniques.

  It is also a good practice to verify the integrity of keys and metadata immediately upon access
and before operational use.
