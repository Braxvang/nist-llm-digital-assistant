330      •   Cloud environments, including virtualization and container technologies
331      •   Technology management solutions (e.g., asset management, configuration management,
332          mobile device management, patch management, vulnerability management)
333      •   Identity, authentication, and authorization technologies
334      •   Threat detection/prevention technologies (e.g., anti-malware, data loss prevention, email

336          INV-2, Update the Logging Infrastructure Inventory

338   Summary: Update the inventory of your organization’s cybersecurity logging infrastructure
339   components. The logging infrastructure encompasses the hardware, software, systems, services,
340   and networks used to transmit, store, analyze, and dispose of log data generated by the log
341   sources. The desired outcome is a comprehensive, up-to-date picture of all of the logging
342   infrastructure components that are currently part of your organization.
343   Tasks to perform include the following:
344      1. INV-2.1: Update the inventory so that it reflects the current set of logging infrastructure
345         components.
346      2. INV-2.2: Update the characteristics recorded for each component in the inventory.
347      3. INV-2.3: Update the logging infrastructure architecture diagrams and other
348         documentation to reflect the updates from INV-2.1 and INV-2.2.
349   Examples of logging infrastructure components include:
350      •   Centralized systems that perform security information and event monitoring (SIEM) and
351          provide bulk storage and other analytical workflows or services
352      •   Cold data storage
353      •   Cyber threat intelligence feeds from third-party services
354      •   Data lakes that act as centrally accessible log storage with log sources that provide data to
355          the data lake and log analysis technologies that receive log data from the data lake instead
356          of or in addition to the log sources that directly provide data to each log analysis
357          technology
358      •   Domain Name System (DNS) logging system
359      •   Managed services for log monitoring and analysis
360      •   Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) implementation
361      •   User behavior monitoring and analytics

362          INV-3, Update the Logging Use Case Inventory
