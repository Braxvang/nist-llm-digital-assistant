      INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING MATRIX                                        — Cell 3.1 B
 Training Area: System Life Cycle Security             —   initiation
 Functional Specialty: Acquire
                                                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



 Definition   —        The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an IT system
                       from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                       model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                       Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                       ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                       needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                       The initiation phase is the series of steps followed to ensure that security
                       requirements are considered and resolved as new information systems and
                       technologies are planned.

 Behavioral Outcome         —   Individuals with acquisition responsibilities are able to analyze and
                                develop acquisition documents and/or provide guidance which
                                ensures that functional IT security requirements are incorporated.
