NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                                             GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


      1. OCSP response or responses in the server’s CertificateStatus message ([29], [54]) (or
         Certificate message in TLS 1.3);
      2. Certificate Revocation List (CRL) or OCSP response in the client’s local certificate store;
      3. OCSP response from a locally configured OCSP responder;
      4. OCSP response from the OCSP responder location identified in the OCSP field in the
         Authority Information Access extension in the server certificate; or
      5. CRL from the CRL Distribution Point extension in the server certificate.

When the server does not provide the revocation status, the local certificate store does not have
the current or a cogent CRL or OCSP response, and the OCSP responder and the CRL
distribution point are unavailable or inaccessible at the time of TLS session establishment, the
client will either terminate the connection or accept a potentially revoked or compromised
certificate. The decision to accept or reject a certificate in this situation should be made
according to agency policy.

4.2.3      Client Public-Key Certificate Assurance

The client public-key certificate may be trusted by the servers on the basis of the policies,
procedures, and security controls used to issue the client public-key certificate as described in
Section 3.5.1. For example, these guidelines recommend that the PIV Authentication certificate
be the norm for authentication of federal employees and long-term contractors. PIV
Authentication certificate policy is defined in the Federal PKI Common Policy Framework [31],
and PIV-I Authentication certificate policy is defined in the X.509 Certificate Policy for the
Federal Bridge Certification Authority [68]. Depending on the requirements of the server-side
application, other certificate policies may also be acceptable. Guidance regarding other
certificate policies is outside the scope of these guidelines.

4.3      Cryptographic Support

4.3.1      Cipher Suites

The acceptable cipher suites for a TLS client are the same as those for a TLS server. General-
purpose cipher suites are listed in Section 3.3.1. Cipher suites appropriate for pre-shared key
environments for TLS 1.2 and prior versions are listed in Appendix C. Applications that require
RSA key transport as the key exchange method may use cipher suites listed in Appendix D
during the deprecation period. When ephemeral keys are used to establish the master secret, each
ephemeral key-pair (i.e., the server ephemeral key-pair and the client ephemeral key-pair) shall
have at least 112 bits of security.

The client should not be configured to use cipher suites other than those listed in Section 3.3.1,
Appendix C, or Appendix D. 32



32 The cipher suite requirement for clients is weaker than for servers because many clients, such as web browsers, may not allow

      the same level of configuration as servers.
