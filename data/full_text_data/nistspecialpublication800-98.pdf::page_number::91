6.       RFID Privacy Considerations

While this document is primarily about securing RFID systems, privacy issues are often interrelated with
security considerations in a manner that one cannot be discussed without the other. For example,
protecting privacy often requires technical security controls related to data confidentiality. This section
explains what types of information are considered personal, reviews a number of privacy considerations
that impact the life cycle of RFID systems, explains general privacy controls, and lists privacy guidance
with which US Federal agencies are required to comply.

Privacy regulations and guidance are often complex and change over time. Organizations planning,
implementing, or managing an RFID system should always consult with the organization’s privacy
officer, legal counsel, and chief information officer when developing and enforcing privacy policy related
to the system.

6.1      Types of Personal Information

Federal privacy laws predominantly address the requirements for assessing, managing and safeguarding
data defined as personal information. Figure 7-1 provides a taxonomy of personal information that is
useful in describing privacy considerations for RFID systems.




                                       Figure 6-1. Taxonomy of Personal Information

For the purposes of current privacy regulation, the most important distinction about the information being
addressed is whether personal information is personally identifiable information (PII) or non-personally
identifiable information. PII is information that can be used to uniquely identify, locate, or contact an
individual. 67 Examples of data elements that typically are considered PII include, but are not limited to,
an individual’s full name, social security number, passport number, financial account or credit card
numbers, and biometric data such as fingerprints. Individual data elements associated with characteristics


67
      PII is also referred to as personally identifying information or “information in identifiable form,” which is defined in the E-
      Government Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-347, 116 Stat. 2923, as “any representation of information that permits the
      identity of an individual to whom the information applies to be reasonably inferred by either direct or indirect means.”
      Information “permitting the physical or online contacting of a specific individual” (see section 208(b)(1)(A)(ii)(II)) is the
      same as “information in identifiable form.”
