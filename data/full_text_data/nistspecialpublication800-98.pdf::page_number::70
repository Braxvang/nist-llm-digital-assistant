GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



Benefits: Information labels or notices can communicate basic information about risks that might
otherwise be left unknown by users that are able to take simple steps to mitigate the risk (e.g., remove a
tag or place it in a shielded sleeve).

Weaknesses: Distributing a notice is no guarantee that it will be read or understood. Notice is not an
appropriate communications medium for complex concepts or instructions that may require formal
training.

5.2.6     Separation of Duties

Control: RFID system duties are distributed among various personnel roles to minimize the damage
resulting from an inadvertent or malicious activity of a single person. The general principle of the control
is that malicious collusion between two or more authorized users is much less likely than one person
engaging alone in inappropriate behavior.

One example of separation of duties is having different personnel (1) attach tags to objects and (2) read
the tags. If an individual performed both functions, the individual could intentionally put the wrong tag
on an object to circumvent the objectives of the business process. For example, a store clerk could affix
tags intended for low-priced items on high-priced items, and then later work the checkout scanner while
the clerkâ€™s accomplice purchased the items. The system would not know that the tags had been switched,
but if another person performed the checkout, he or she might be suspicious of the checkout total, which
could uncover the plot.

Applicability: RFID applications in which an insider might have a motive to perform unauthorized
RFID transactions. This scenario is most likely to occur when tags support commercial transactions,
especially those related to high-value objects.

Benefits: Separation of duties helps to reduce fraud and malicious damage, because any user attempting
to engage in such activities would be forced to collude with at least one other user. Separation of duties
also reduces errors, because a second operator will often catch mistakes made or missed by the first.

Weaknesses: Multiple employees still could collude to commit fraud or violate the RFID usage policy.
Also, organizations with a limited staff may not be able to perform complete separation of duties.

5.2.7     Non-revealing Identifier Formats

Control: RFID tags are assigned identifiers using identifier formats that do not reveal any information
about tagged items or the organization operating the RFID system. Non-revealing identifier format
options include serially assigning identifiers and randomly assigning identifiers. 44

In contrast, if an adversary reads an identifier that is encoded with a standardized format, such as the EPC
format, that adversary may be able to discern the manufacturer or issuer of the item, as well as the type of
item. For example, all cans of a soft drink from a certain manufacturer will have the same EPC manager

44
     A related control is rotating identifiers. Auto-rotating tags store a list of identifiers and cycle through the list when queried.
     To support multiple identifiers, databases in the enterprise subsystem must associate each identifier in the list to the
     particular item. The benefit of rotating identifiers is that organizations can make it more difficult to identity and track
     particular items as well as hide the type of item. Random and serialized identifiers, on the other hand, may not reveal
     information about the type of item, but since these identifiers are fixed, once they are revealed that particular item can be
     tracked. One weakness to rotating identifiers is that a rogue reader can easily obtain the complete list of identifiers through
     repeated queries. Therefore, this control is more appropriate when the primary threat is eavesdropping. While research is
     being conducted on the concept of rotating identifiers, it is not specified in any RFID standard and proprietary designs are
     not widely commercially available.
