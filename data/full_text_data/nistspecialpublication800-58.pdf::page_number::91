NIST SP 800-58                                             Voice Over IP Security

         phone remotely, e.g. “social engineering”, ping flood, MAC spoofing (probably
         SNMP hooks, etc.).

         If possible, use static IP addresses for the IP Phones. This will remove the
         necessity of using a DHCP server. Further, using a state based intrusion
         detection system can filter out DHCP server packets from IP Phone ports,
         allowing this traffic only from the legitimate server.

TFTP Server Insertion Attack

         It is possible to change the configuration of a target phone by exploiting the
         TFTP response race when the IP phone is resetting. A rogue TFTP server can
         supply spurious information before the legitimate server is able to respond to a
         request. This attack allows an attacker to change the configuration of an IP
         Phone. Using a state based intrusion detection system can filter out DHCP
         server packets from IP Phone ports, allowing such traffic only from the
         legitimate server. Organizations looking to deploy VOIP systems should look
         for IP Phone instruments that can download signed binary files.

  A.3    Availability and Denial of Service

        Availability refers to the notion that information and services be available for use
        when needed. Availability is the most obvious risk for a switch. Attacks
        exploiting vulnerabilities in the switch software or protocols may lead to
        deterioration or even denial of service or functionality of the switch. For example:
        if unauthorized access can be established to any branch of the communication
        channel (such as a CCS link or a TCP/IP link), it may be possible to flood the link
        with bogus messages causing severe deterioration (possibly denial) of service. A
        voice over IP system may have additional vulnerabilities with Internet
        connections. Because intrusion detection systems fail to intercept a significant
        percentage of Internet based attacks, attackers may be able to bring down VOIP
        systems by exploiting weaknesses in Internet protocols and services.

        Any network may be vulnerable to denial of service attacks, simply by
        overloading the capacity of the system. With VOIP the problem may be
        especially severe, because of its sensitivity to packet loss or delay.

CPU Resource Consumption Attack without any account information.

         An attacker with remote terminal access to the server may be able to force a system
         restart (shutdown all/restart all) by providing the maximum number of characters for
         the login and password buffers multiple times in succession. Additionally, IP Phones
         may reboot as a result of this attack.

         In addition to producing a system outage, the restart may not restore uncommitted
         changes or, in some cases, may restore default passwords, which would introduce
         intrusion vulnerabilities. The deployment of a firewall disallowing connections from


                                                                                            85
