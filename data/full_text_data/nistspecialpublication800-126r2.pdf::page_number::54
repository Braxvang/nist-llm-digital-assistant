              The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



Appendix C—Glossary

This appendix contains definitions for selected terms used within the document.
Component schema: The schema for an SCAP component specification (e.g. XCCDF, CPE, CVSS).
Within this document, this term is distinct from “OVAL component schema”, which is defined by the
OVAL specification.
Component specification: One of the individual specifications that comprises SCAP.
Content consumer: A product that accepts existing SCAP source data stream content, processes it, and
produces SCAP result data streams
Content producer: A product that generates SCAP source data stream content.
Globally unique identifier: An identifier formatted following special conventions to support uniqueness
within an organization and across all organizations creating identifiers. See Section 3.1.3 for the
conventions.
Result content: Part or all of one or more SCAP result data streams.
Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): A suite of specifications that standardize the format
and nomenclature by which software flaw and security configuration information is communicated, both
to machines and humans.
SCAP component: A logical unit of data expressed using one or more of the SCAP component
specifications.
SCAP conformant: A product or SCAP data stream that meets the requirements of this specification.
SCAP content: Part or all of one or more SCAP data streams.
SCAP data stream: A specific instantiation of SCAP content.
SCAP data stream collection: A container for SCAP data streams and components.
SCAP result data stream: An SCAP data stream that holds output (result) content.
SCAP source data stream: An SCAP data stream that holds input (source) content.
SCAP source data stream collection: A container for SCAP data streams and components.
SCAP use case: A pre-defined way in which a product can use SCAP. See Section 5 for the definitions of
the SCAP use cases.
Source content: Part or all of SCAP source data streams.
Stream component: A major element of a data stream, such as an XCCDF benchmark or a set of OVAL
definitions.
Well-formed: An SCAP-conformant data stream or stream component.
