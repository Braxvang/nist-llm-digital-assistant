            ▪ Data Center Oriented. Cloud services can be used to improve the security of data
            centers. Information about on-line activities collected from many participants from different
            organizations can allow for better threat monitoring. For example, electronic mail can be
            redirected to a cloud provider via mail exchange (MX) records, examined and analyzed
            collectively with similar transactions from other data centers to discover widespread spam,
            phishing, and malware campaigns, and to carry out remedial action (e.g., quarantining
            suspect messages and content) more comprehensively than a single organization would
            be able to do. Researchers have also successfully demonstrated a system architecture
            for provisioning cloud-based antivirus services, as an alternative to host-based antivirus
            solutions [Obe08b].

            ▪ Cloud Oriented. Cloud services can also be used to improve the security of other cloud
            environments. For example, reverse proxy products are available that enable unfettered
            access to a SaaS environment, yet maintain the data stored in that environment in
            encrypted form [Nav10]. Cloud-based identity management services also exist, which can
            be used to augment or replace an organization’s directory service for identification and
            authentication of users to a cloud.

            With any technology area, the functionality afforded can be turned towards improper or
            illicit activities. Cloud computing is no exception. A couple of noteworthy instances have
            already occurred that give a sense of what might be expected in the future:

            ▪ Botnets. In many ways, botnets assembled and controlled by hackers are an early form
            of cloud computing [Mul10]. Cost reduction, dynamic provisioning, redundancy, security,
            and many other characteristics of cloud computing apply. Botnets have been used for
            sending spam, harvesting login credentials, and launching injection attacks against
            Websites [Mul10, Pro09]. Botnets could be used to launch a denial of service attack
            against the infrastructure of a cloud provider. The possibility that a cloud service could
            become infiltrated by a botnet has already occurred; in 2009, a command-and-control
            node was discovered operating from within an IaaS cloud [Mcm09a, Whi09]. Spammers
            have also purchased cloud services directly to launch a phishing campaign, ensnaring
            recipients with malware via social engineering techniques [Cra08, Kre08].

            ▪ Mechanism Cracking. WiFi Protected Access (WPA) Cracker, a cloud service
            ostensibly for penetration testers, is an example of harnessing cloud resources on
            demand to break a cryptographic cipher and determine the encrypted password used to
            protect a wireless network. Through this service, a task that would take five days to run
            on a single computer can be accomplished in only 20 minutes on a cluster of 400 virtual
            machines [Rag09]. Because cryptography is used widely in authentication, data
            confidentiality and integrity, and other security mechanisms, these mechanisms become,
            in effect, less effective with the availability of cryptographic key cracking cloud services.
            Both cloud-based and traditional types of systems are possible targets. An IaaS cloud
            was reportedly used to attack an on-line gaming network and compromise the accounts of
            more than 100 million users [Alp11]. CAPTCHA cracking is another area where cloud
            services could be applied to bypass verification meant to thwart abusive use of Internet
                                               7
            services by automated software.

 CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) involves the solution of a simple test
by a user before gaining service, as a means of thwarting unwanted automated access.
