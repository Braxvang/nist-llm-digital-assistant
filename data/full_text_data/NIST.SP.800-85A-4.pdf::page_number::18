NIST SP 800-85A-4                                             PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                       INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

   +     Precondition for use (PIN, OCC verified, cryptographic authentication).
   +     Expected response status codes.
   +     Appropriate state variables set in the card.

 3.2.2    PIV Data Objects Accessibility and Storage Tests
The testing covers the following data objects:
   +     The seven mandatory data objects as defined in Part 1 of SP 800-73-4:
               Card Capability Container.
               Card Holder Unique Identifier (CHUID).
               X.509 Certificate for PIV authentication.
               X.509 Certificate for Card Authentication.
               Cardholder Fingerprints for off card comparison.
               Cardholder Facial Image.
               Security Object.
   +     The two data objects that are mandatory if the cardholder has a government-issued
         email account at the time of credential issuance:
               X.509 Certificate for Digital Signature.
               X.509 Certificate for Key Management.
   +     The twenty-seven optional data objects, also defined in Part 1 of SP 800-73-4:
               Printed Information.
               Discovery Object.
               Key History Object.
               20 retired X.509 Certificates for Key Management.
               Cardholder Iris Images.
               Pairing Code Reference Data Container.
               Secure Messaging Certificate Signer.
               Biometric Information Templates Group Template.
The data objects will be validated for the following conditions:
   +     Presence of all mandatory data objects and those optional objects in the vendor
         documentation.
   +     Accessibility and storage of data objects using the appropriate BER-TLV tags
         (specified identifiers – Section 4, Part 1 of SP 800-73-4).
   +     Appropriate container size allocations for each of the data objects.
   +     Data objects access rule (e.g., PIN vs. no PIN).
