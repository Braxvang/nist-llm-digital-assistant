implies that the resolver should expect the zone to which the trust anchor points to be signed. This is
sometimes referred to as a “secure entry point.”

TSIG Key: A string used to generate the message authentication hash stored in a TSIG RR and used to
authenticate an entire DNS message. This is not the same as signing a message, which involves a
cryptographic operation.

Unsigned Zone: A zone that is not signed.

Validator: A component that validates DNSSEC signatures. Usually not a separate component but part
of a DNSSEC-aware recursive server (sometimes referred to as a validating resolver or validating
recursive server).

Zone Apex: The name at the child’s side of a zone cut. See also “delegation point.”

Zone Signing Key (ZSK): An authentication key that corresponds to a private key used to sign a zone.
Typically a zone signing key will be part of the same DNSKEY RRSet as the key signing key whose
corresponding private key signs this DNSKEY RRSet, but the zone signing key is used for a slightly
different purpose and may differ from the key signing key in other ways, such as validity lifetime.
Designating an authentication key as a zone signing key is purely an operational issue: DNSSEC
validation does not distinguish between zone signing keys and other DNSSEC authentication keys, and it
is possible to use a single key as both a key signing key and a zone signing key. See also “key signing
key.”
