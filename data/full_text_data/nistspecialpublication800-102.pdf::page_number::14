       •   Any portion of the user_supplied_info may be omitted, since it is known
           by entity A.
       •   Any portion of the TTA_supplied_info may be omitted if this information
           is already known or can be determined by entity A.
   However, even though they may be omitted from the transmitted data, the entire
   user_supplied_info and the entire TTA_supplied_info shall be included in the
   timestamped_data that is used in the generation / verification of
   timestamp_signatureTTA = SIGTTA(timestamped_data).
   Upon receiving the TSP from the TTA, entity A should 1) check that the
   transmitted portions of the user_supplied_info are correct and 2) verify the
   timestamp_signatureTTA using the TTA’s public signature verification key.
3. Entity A signs (M, TSP), assembles D and sends it to entity B:
       D = M, TSP, SIGA(M, TSP)
   where the TSP is as defined in step 2.
   If any portion of the user_supplied_info was omitted from the TSP received from
   the TTA, then the entire user_supplied_info shall be inserted into the TSP used in
   the assembly of D unless there is a mutual agreement between entity A and entity
   B, in which case, the following information may be omitted from the TSP data
   transmitted in D by entity A:
       •   H may be omitted, since it can be (re)calculated by entity B.
       •   Any portion of the other_info in the user_supplied_info may be omitted if
           this information is already known or can be determined by entity B.
   However, the entire user_supplied_info shall be included in the
   timestamped_data that is used in the generation / verification of
   timestamp_signatureTTA and SIGA(M, TSP).
   If any portion of the TTA_supplied_info was omitted from the TSP received from
   the TTA, then the entire TTA_supplied_info shall be inserted into the TSP used in
   the assembly of D unless there is a mutual agreement between entity A and entity
   B, in which case, any portion of the TTA_supplied_info may be omitted from the
   TSP data transmitted by entity A if the information is already known or can be
   determined by entity B. However, the entire TTA_supplied_info shall be included
   in the timestamped_data that is used in the generation/ verification of
   timestamp_signatureTTA and SIGA(M, TSP).
4. Upon receiving D, entity B does the following:
       •   Computes H′ = Hash(M). If H was received in D as part of the transmitted
           TSP (see step 3), then entity B verifies that H = H′; otherwise, B inserts H′
           into the user_supplied_info when verifying timestamp_signatureTTA and
           SIGA(M, TSP).
       •   Verifies timestamp_signatureTTA using the TTA’s public signature
