                 Graphic image analysis

                 Indicators of ownership, which could include program registration data

                 Data analysis

                 Description of relevant programs on the examined items

                 Techniques used to hide or mask data, such as encryption, steganography,
                 hidden attributes, hidden partitions, and file name anomalies

        Report Conclusions

Many forensic software applications have reporting facilities built-in. Examiners should
include only relevant findings in the report to minimize size and confusion among those
reviewing it. Automated reports typically contain the following key components: Case
Number, Date, Examiner Name, Suspect Name, and Files Acquired (showing hash, ASCII
data, graphical representation of data, etc.).

Digital evidence, as well as the tools, techniques and methodologies used in an examination, is
subject to being challenged in a court of law or other formal proceedings. Proper
documentation is essential in providing individuals the ability to re-create the process from
beginning to end. As part of the reporting process, making a copy of the software used and
including it with the output produced is advisable. This is especially pertinent for custom
tools, since confusion about the version of the software used to create the output is eliminated,
should it become necessary to reproduce forensic processing results at a later time. The same
practice applies to commercial software tools, which could be upgraded after an examination is
completed [NTI].
