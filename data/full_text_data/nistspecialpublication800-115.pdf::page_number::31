skills should be employed to analyze the data and results acquired from wireless scans. Scanning tool
operators should be aware of other RF signals authorized for use within the area being scanned.

4.4.1    Passive Wireless Scanning

Passive scanning should be conducted regularly to supplement wireless security measures already in
place, such as WIDPSs. 17 Wireless scanning tools used to conduct completely passive scans transmit no
data, nor do the tools in any way affect the operation of deployed wireless devices. By not transmitting
data, a passive scanning tool remains undetected by malicious users and other devices. This reduces the
likelihood of individuals avoiding detection by disconnecting or disabling unauthorized wireless devices.

Passive scanning tools capture wireless traffic being transmitted within the range of the tool’s antenna.
Most tools provide several key attributes regarding discovered wireless devices, including service set
identifier (SSID), device type, channel, media access control (MAC) address, signal strength, and number
of packets being transmitted. This information can be used to evaluate the security of the wireless
environment, and to identify potential rogue devices and unauthorized ad hoc networks discovered within
range of the scanning device. The wireless scanning tool should also be able to assess the captured
packets to determine if any operational anomalies or threats exist.

Wireless scanning tools scan each IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n channel/frequency separately, often for only
several hundred milliseconds at a time. The passive scanning tool may not receive all transmissions on a
specific channel. For example, the tool may have been scanning channel 1 at the precise moment when a
wireless device transmitted a packet on channel 5. This makes it important to set the dwell time of the
tool to be long enough to capture packets, yet short enough to efficiently scan each channel. Dwell time
configurations will depend on the device or tool used to conduct the wireless scans. In addition, security
personnel conducting the scans should slowly move through the area being scanned to reduce the number
of devices that go undetected.

Rogue devices can be identified in several ways through passive scanning:

      The MAC address of a discovered wireless device indicates the vendor of the device’s wireless
       interface. If an organization only deploys wireless interfaces from vendors A and B, the presence
       of interfaces from any other vendor indicates potential rogue devices.
      If an organization has accurate records of its deployed wireless devices, assessors can compare
       the MAC addresses of discovered devices with the MAC addresses of authorized devices. Most
       scanning tools allow assessors to enter a list of authorized devices. Because MAC addresses can
       be spoofed, assessors should not assume that the MAC addresses of discovered devices are
       accurate—but checking MAC addresses can identify rogue devices that do not use spoofing.
      Rogue devices may use SSIDs that are not authorized by the organization.
      Some rogue devices may use SSIDs that are authorized by the organization but do not adhere to
       its wireless security configuration requirements.
The signal strength of potential rogue devices should be reviewed to determine whether the devices are
located within the confines of the facility or in the area being scanned. Devices operating outside an

     In some environments, the WIDPS implementation might be performing most of the same functions as passive wireless
     scanning. Some WIDPS products offer mobile sensors similar to the wireless scanning device setup described in Section
     4.4. Organizations with WIDPS implementations should use the wireless scanning techniques described in this publication
     to supplement, not duplicate, WIDPS functionality.
