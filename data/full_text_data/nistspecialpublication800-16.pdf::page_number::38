Information Technology Security Training Requirements


    •   To offer a curriculum framework to promote consistency across government.

These objectives are designed to permit a consistent, government-wide approach to ensure that
all employees who are involved with IT systems   —  regardless of agency, organizational unit, job
function(s), or specific system(s)— acquire the same, comprehensive literacy in security basics.
The value of a consistent training program is the portability of security literacy as employees
change jobs and organizations.


3.2 Basics    — Core Set of IT Security Terms and Concepts
The body of knowledge associated with IT security is large and growing at an increasing rate,
commensurate with today's rapid technological changes. Regardless of its size and growth rate,
certain basic concepts form the foundation of any effective IT security program and environment,
These terms and concepts must be learned and applied as the individual proceeds from security
awareness to training and then to education.


The core set of IT security terms and concepts is presented in this section as the "ABC's of
Information Technology Security," 26 items related to the alphabet, as summarized in Exhibit 3-
1 on the next page and described briefly in Exhibit 3-2. This memory tool approach aids the
learning process while communicating fundamental IT security concepts. It is anticipated that
course material developed under this model will build on the memory tool approach to learning.
