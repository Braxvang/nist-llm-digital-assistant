SP 800-152                                                                     A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


6.4.28 Perform a Cryptographic Function using the Key
Cryptographic functions using keys are performed in a cryptographic module to
cryptographically protect data, including metadata and other keys, and process already-
protected information. These functions may include signature generation, signature
verification, data encryption, ciphertext decryption, key wrapping, key unwrapping, MAC
generation, and MAC verification.

FR:6.69 The CKMS design shall specify all cryptographic functions that are supported and
where they are performed in the CKMS (e.g., CA, host, or end user system).

6.4.29 Manage the Trust Anchor Store
An FCKMS could require that some entities have one or more trusted public keys, called
“trust anchors6.” Trust anchors are cached in a trust anchor store. A trust anchor can be used
to establish trust in other public keys that might not otherwise be trusted. Therefore, the
integrity of trust anchors is critical to the security of the FCKMS. The FCKMS typically
supports trust-anchor management functions, such as adding, deleting and storing trust
anchors.

Many commonly used products, such as browsers, are delivered and initially installed with
an assortment of trust anchors, not all of which merit trust.

FR:6.70 The CKMS design shall specify all trust anchor management functions that are
supported (see RFC 6024).

FR:6.71 The CKMS design shall specify how the trust anchors are securely distributed so
that the relying parties can perform source authentication and integrity verification on those
trust anchors.

FR:6.72 The CKMS design shall specify how the trust anchors are managed in relying-entity
systems to ensure that only authorized additions, modifications, and deletions are made to the
relying-entity system’s trust anchor store.

                   SC-12             A Federal CKMS shall only use trust anchors that meet the
PR:6.63
                                     following conditions:
                                         a) The organization associated with the trust anchor is
                                            trusted,
                                         b) The security policy associated with the trust anchor is
                                            acceptable,
                                         c) The actual source of the trust anchor has been
                                            authenticated, and
                                         d) The integrity of the trust anchor has been verified.

                                     Only authorized additions, modifications, and deletions shall
PR:6.64
                                     be made to trust anchors within an FCKMS.

    As used here, "trust anchor" refers to the certificate of a trusted CA, rather than to the CA itself.
