       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                        Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                               and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1043   Issuers need to implement the PIV requirements derived from [FIPS201] and its supporting
1044   publications, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) requirements related to background
1045   investigations, and applicable OMB Memoranda. The capability of an issuer is determined
1046   through the verification of these requirements using appropriate assessments. However,
1047   authorization is generally based on both the demonstration of capability and the presence of
1048   certain organizational characteristics that will provide a high degree of confidence to the assessor
1049   that the demonstrated capabilities will be carried out in a dependable and sustainable manner.
1050   This dependability measure, or reliability (as it is generally called), has to be established by
1051   adequately assessing that an issuer has the desired organizational characteristics, including
1052   adequate issuing facilities, appropriate equipment, trained personnel, adequate resources,
1053   trustworthy management, and properly vetted operations staff. Hence, the assessment and
1054   authorization methodology includes a set of issuer controls, the verification of which establishes
1055   the reliability of the issuer. This set of controls is grouped under the IAT’s authorization focus
1056   area called “Facility and Personnel Readiness.” These reliability-relevant issuer controls are
1057   formulated based on commonly accepted security readiness measures that have evolved in
1058   response to lessons learned in security incidents (e.g., insider attacks) and risks (e.g., physical
1059   security lapses). In addition to the controls provided herein, an organization may develop
1060   additional mission-specific controls that will contribute toward the overall reliability of the issuer
1061   to meet the organization’s mission needs.
1062   Table 1 lists the four IATs with associated authorization focus areas under each topic.
1063                              Table 1. IATs and associated authorization focus areas

                    Organizational Preparedness                    Security Management and Data Protection
         Preparation and Maintenance of Documentation (DO)    Protection of Stored and Transmitted Data (ST)
         Assignment of Roles and Responsibilities (RR)        Enforcement of Applicable Privacy Requirements (PR)
         Facility and Personnel Readiness (FP)
                      Infrastructure Elements                                       Processes
         Deployed Products & Information Systems (DP)         Sponsorship Process (SP)
         Implementation of Credential Infrastructures (CI)    Identity Proofing/Registration Process (EI)
                                                              Adjudication Process (AP)
                                                              Card/Token Production Process (CP)
                                                              Activation/Issuance Process (AI)
                                                              Maintenance Process (MP)

1064   Appendices G.1 and G.2 contain required issuer controls grouped by IAT and the associated
1065   authorization focus area for PCIs and DPCIs, respectively. Each issuer control represents how
1066   one or more requirements from [FIPS201] and its related documents can be satisfied. Issuer
1067   controls are sequentially numbered using the two-character identifier assigned to the
1068   authorization focus area under which they are listed. Identifiers for issuer controls that are
1069   applicable to both PCIs and DPCIs are aligned for ease of reference. In addition, controls for
1070   DPCIs are marked with “derived credential (DC)” for quick identification. For example, DO-1
1071   applies to a PCI, and DO(DC)-1 applies to a DPCI. Both of these issuer controls are targeted at
1072   assessing the same requirement.
1073   Table 2 shows the “Preparation and Maintenance of Documentation” authorization focus area
1074   under the “Organizational Preparedness” IAT.
