NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                                Guidelines for Media Sanitization


                    option may depend on architectural and implementation details of a particular device.
                    Devices seeking to use a factory data reset to purge media should use the eMMC Secure
                    Erase or Secure Trim command, or some other equivalent method (which may depend on
                    the device’s storage media).
                    In some environments, Windows Phone devices may support encryption, and may support
                    Cryptographic Erase. Refer to the device manufacturer (or service provider, if applicable)
                    to identify whether the device has a Purge capability that applies media-dependent
                    sanitization techniques or Cryptographic Erase to ensure that data recovery is infeasible,
                    and that the device does not simply remove the file pointers.

   Destroy:         Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:           Following the Clear/Purge operation, manually navigate to multiple areas of the device (such as
                    browser history, files, photos, etc.) to verify that no personal information has been retained on the
                    device. Before sanitizing your device, ensure that you back up your data to a safe location.
                    Refer to the manufacturer for proper sanitization procedure, and for details about implementation
                    differences between device versions and OS versions. Proper initial configuration using guides
                    such as the DISA STIGs (http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/) helps ensure that the level of data protection
                    and sanitization assurance is as robust as possible.

   All other mobile devices This includes cell phones, smart phones, PDAs, tablets, and other devices not
   covered in the preceding mobile categories.

   Clear:           Manually delete all information, then perform a full manufacturer’s reset to reset the mobile
                    device to factory state. Sanitization performed via a remote wipe should be treated as a
                    Clear operation, and it is not possible to verify the sanitization results.

   Purge:           See Destroy. Many mobile devices only offer capabilities to Clear (and not Purge) the data
                    contents. A mobile device may offer Purge capabilities, but these capabilities are specific to the
                    hardware and software of the device and should be applied with caution. The device
                    manufacturer should be referred to in order to identify whether the device has a Purge capability
                    that applies media-dependent techniques (such as rewriting or block erasing) or Cryptographic
                    Erase to ensure that data recovery is infeasible, and that the device does not simply remove the
                    file pointers.

   Destroy:         Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:           Following the Clear or (if applicable) Purge operation, manually navigate to multiple areas of the
                    device (such as call history, browser history, files, photos, etc.) to verify that no personal
                    information has been retained on the device.
                    For both Clear and (if applicable) Purge, refer to the manufacturer for proper sanitization
                    procedure.
