NIST SP 800-82r3                                           Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            Regression testing is also advised. It is not uncommon for patches to
            have an adverse impact on other software. A patch may remove a
            vulnerability, but it can also introduce a greater risk from a production or
            safety perspective. Patching the vulnerability may also change the way
            the OS or application works with control applications, causing the
            control application to lose some of its functionality. Many OT systems
            utilize older versions of OSs that are no longer supported by the vendor,
            so patches may not be available.
            Organizations should implement a systematic, accountable, and
            documented OT patch management process for managing exposure to
            vulnerabilities. The patch management process should include guidance
            on how to monitor for patches, when to apply patches, how to test the
            patches (e.g., with vendors or on offline systems), and how to select
            compensating controls to limit exposure of the vulnerable system when
            patching is delayed.
            Many OT vulnerabilities are published to CISA as advisories. However,
            not all vendors report known vulnerabilities to CISA. Organizations can
            often stay informed of vulnerabilities by subscribing to vendor-specific
            notifications in addition to CISA alerts and advisories. Private
            cybersecurity companies also offer services to assist organizations with
            staying informed about known vulnerabilities within their OT
            environment. An organization is responsible for staying informed and
            determining when patches should be applied as part of their documented
            patch management process.
            When and how to deploy patches should be determined by
            knowledgeable OT personnel. Consider separating the automated process
            for OT patch management from the automated process for non-OT
            applications. Patching should be deployed during planned OT outages.
            Organizations may be required to follow industry-specific guidance on
            patch management. Otherwise, they may develop patch management
            procedures based on existing standards, such as NIST SP 800-40, Rev. 4
            [SP800-40r4]; NERC CIP-007, or ISA 62443-2-3, Patch Management in
            the IACS Environment.

6.2.12.        Time Synchronization
Time synchronization solutions enable an organization to synchronize time across many devices.
This is important for many functions, including event and log correlation, authentication
mechanisms, access control, and quality of service.

       the Responsible Use of Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Services
