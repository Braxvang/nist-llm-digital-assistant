       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                      Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

2552       •   Full-entropy output by the RBG3(RS) construction,
2553       •   Fallback to the security strength of the RBG3(RS)’s DRBG instantiation (256 bits) if the
2554           entropy source has an undetected failure,
2555       •   Direct access to an RBG2(P) construction with a security strength of 256 bits for faster
2556           output when full-entropy output is not required,
2557       •   Access to an entropy source to instantiate and reseed the DRBG, and
2558       •   Prediction resistance support for the directly accessed DRBG.

2559   B.6.1. Instantiation of an RBG3(RS) Construction
2560   Instantiation for this example consists of the instantiation of the CTR_DRBG used by the
2561   RBG3(RS) construction.
2562   The DRBG is initialized as follows:
2563       (status, RBG3(RS)_state_handle) = RBG3(RS)_DRBG_Instantiate(“RBG3(RS) 2021”).
2564       •   “RBG3(RS) 2021” is to be used as the personalization string for the DRBG instantiation
2565           used in the RBG3(RS) construction.
2566       •   RBG3(RS)_state_handle is returned as the state handle for the DRBG instantiation used
2567           by the RBG3(RS) construction.
2568   Appendices B.6.2 and B.6.3 will show the differences between the operation of the RBG3(RS)
2569   and RBG2(P) constructions.

2570   B.6.2. Generation by an RBG3(RS) Construction
2571   Assuming that the DRBG instantiation for the RBG3(RS) construction has been instantiated (see
2572   Appendix B.6.1), the RBG can be invoked by a consuming application to generate outputs with
2573   full entropy. The RBG3(RS)_Generate construction in Section 6.3.1.2.1 is invoked using
2574              (status, returned_bits) = RBG3(RS)_Generate(RBG3(RS)_state_handle, n,
2575                                        additional_information).
2576       •   The RBG3(RS)_state_handle (obtained during instantiation; see Appendix B.6.1) is used
2577           to access the internal state information for the DRBG instantiation for the RBG3(RS)
2578           construction.
2579       •   The consuming application requests n bits.
2580       •   The input of additional_information is optional.
2581   The process is specified in Section 6.3.1.2.1. The state handle in the Generate_function is
2582   RBG3(RS)_state_handle, which was obtained during instantiation (see Appendix B.6.1).

2583   B.6.3. Generation by the Directly Accessible DRBG
2584   Assuming that the DRBG has been instantiated (see Appendix B.6.1), it can be accessed directly
2585   by a consuming application in the same manner as the RBG2(P) example in Appendix B.4.2 using
