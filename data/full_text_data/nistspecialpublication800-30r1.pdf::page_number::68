                                      The effects of the error, accident, or act of nature are extensive, involving most of the cyber

                                      many critical resources.
                                      The effects of the error, accident, or act of nature are wide-ranging, involving a significant portion

                                      The effects of the error, accident, or act of nature are limited, involving some of the cyber
                                      resources of the [Tier 3: information systems; Tier 2: mission/business processes or EA segments,
