information about its child zones that is carried in a zone is called delegation information. The delegation
information is the one that is used by a zone to refer name resolution requests for a resource lower than it
in the domain name hierarchy. Since the name resolution request in this example pertains to a resource in
the third-level domain, the root server must refer the request to a lower-level name server. The response
to the resolving name server that involves sending this delegation information is called the referral. The
referral provides the name and IP address for the name servers for the TLD zone that is relevant to the
request (i.e., the .com zone) (since the query is for a resource in marketing.example.com). Using this
referral, the resolving name server then formulates and sends a query to the .com zone name server. This
server will provide the referral for example.com’s name server. If the marketing.example.com domain is
included in example.com’s zone, querying the name server for example.com will provide the IP address
for the resource www.marketing.example.com. A diagram of the name resolution process (without cache
search operations) is given in Figure 2-2.




                        Figure 2-2. Name Resolution Process (without cache search)

As the description of the name resolution process makes clear, a name server performs the following
functions:

    •   It provides a referral to a child zone.

    •   It provides a mapping from domain name to IP address, called domain name resolution, or IP
        address to domain name, sometimes called an inverse resolution, but is actually a standard query
        for a different type of data.

    •   It provides an error message if the query is for a DNS entry that does not exist.
