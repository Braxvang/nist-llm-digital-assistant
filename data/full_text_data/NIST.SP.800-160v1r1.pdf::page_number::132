NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                 Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

       BA-1.3 Obtain or acquire access to the security aspects of enabling systems or services to be
              used in business or mission analysis.
       References: [4] [97]

BA-2   DEFINE THE PROBLEM OR OPPORTUNITY SPACE
       BA-2.1 Analyze the problems or opportunities in the context of the security-relevant trade
              space factors.
       Note: The security-relevant trade space factors are analyzed within the context of all factors,
       including factors related to loss tolerances. The results of the analyses inform decisions on the
       suitability and feasibility of alternative options to be pursued.
       BA-2.2 Define the security aspects of the mission, business, or operational problem or
              opportunity to be addressed by the solution class(es).
       Note: Information is elicited from stakeholders to acquire an understanding of the mission,
       business, or operational problem or opportunity from a system security perspective. Security
       aspects include security objectives, concerns, and constraints.

BA-3   CHARACTERIZE THE SOLUTION SPACE
       BA-3.1 Define the security aspects of the preliminary operational concepts and other concepts
              in life cycle stages.
       Note 1: Security operational concepts include modes of secure operation, security-relevant
       operational scenarios and use cases, and secure usage within a mission area or line of business.
       Note 2: Security aspects are integrated into the life cycle concepts and used to support
       feasibility analysis and the evaluation of candidate alternative solution class(es).
       BA-3.2 Identify the security aspects of the alternative solution classes.
       References: [4] [71] [96] [97]

BA-4   EVALUATE ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION CLASSES
       BA-4.1 Assess each alternative solution class while considering the identified security aspects.
       BA-4.2 Select the preferred alternative solution class (or classes) based on the identified
              security aspects, trade space factors, and other criteria defined by the organization.
       BA-4.3 Provide security-relevant feedback to strategic-level life cycle concepts to reflect the
              selected solution class(es).

BA-5   MANAGE THE BUSINESS OR MISSION ANALYSIS
       BA-5.1 Maintain traceability of the security aspects of business or mission analysis.
       Note: Bidirectional traceability is maintained between identified security aspects and supporting
       security data associated with the problems and opportunities, proposed solution class or
       classes, and organizational strategy.
