NIST SP 800-85A-4                                             PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                       INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

4.       Derived Test Requirements

DTRs show the type of tests required based on the specifications in SP 800-73-4. These
specifications cover expected command behavior (in the case of interface specification), data
object representation (in the case of PIV data model) and data contents (in the case of PIV
authentication use cases).
Each DTR consists of the following:
     +    Actual condition statements taken/derived from the SP 800-73-4 specification – these
          include conditions for successful command execution for each command as well as
          exception behaviors explicitly called out through ‘shall’ statements in SP 800-73-4.
          Those exception behaviors that are implicit in SP 800-73-4 through listing of error
          codes associated with each command are tested only through Test Assertions
          (Appendices B, C and D) and are not part of the DTR condition statements. The
          condition statements are identified by codes starting with ‘AS’ followed by a running
          sequence that denotes the section in this document where they occur. All DTRs that
          are new to Revision 4 of this document are identified by the suffix ‘-R4’. Updated
          DTRs that existed previously are requirements updated in SP 800-73-4 and these
          retain their original identifiers.
     +    Required Vendor Information – these include information that the vendors are
          mandated to provide in their documentation. The required vendor information is
          identified by codes starting with ‘VE’ followed by a running sequence that denotes
          the section in this document where they occur. All vendor information requirements
          that are new to Revision 4 of this document are identified by the suffix ‘-R4’.
          Updated required vendor information that existed previously are requirements
          updated in SP 800-73-4 and these retain their original identifiers.
     +    Required Test Procedures – these are actions that the tester has to perform in order to
          satisfy the requirements stated in actual condition statements. These include verifying
          the information mandated in the “Required Vendor Information” for the condition as
          well as performing software-based tests. It must be mentioned, however, that some of
          the required test procedures will not be called out explicitly for verification of
          information in the associated “Required Vendor Information.” In these instances, it is
          implicitly assumed that the information is provided by the vendor and verified by the
          tester. The Required Test Procedures have identifiers starting with ‘TE’ followed by a
          running sequence that denotes the section in this document where they occur. All test
          procedure requirements that are new to Revision 4 of this document are identified by
          the suffix ‘-R4’. Updated required test procedures that existed previously are
          requirements updated in SP 800-73-4 and these retain their original identifiers.
Validations of some DTRs are not covered by the test assertions provided in this document.
These DTRs require compliance of the component with an external specification or standard
such as ISO/IEC 7816 or ISO/IEC 14443. No required test procedures are provided for these
DTRs, and a note is added to indicate that the assertion is externally tested. The tester checks
the vendor documentation for claimed compliance with such requirement or the presence of
an external test/compliance certificate obtained from the related standards testing body, when
applicable.
