       In the table, transparent is used to indicate that the material allows radio waves to propagate through it without a significant
       loss of energy. Absorbent specifies that radio waves propagating through the material will have a significant loss of energy.
       Opaque indicates that radio waves will be blocked, reflected, or scattered.

       This is the designated center frequency for the frequency band of 13.553-13.567 MHz, which is an Industrial, Scientific, and
       Medical (ISM) band that is available worldwide. ISM bands are also used for consumer applications.
12
       The designation 915 MHz represents the frequency band of 902-928 MHz, which is an ISM band in North and South
       America. Contrarily, 433.5-434.5 MHz is not an ISM band in North and South America, but RFID systems in the United
       States can use this band subject to restrictions in the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Part 15 rules.
13
       The designation of 2.45 GHz represents the center frequency of the 2.400-2.500 GHz frequency band, which is an ISM
       band.
