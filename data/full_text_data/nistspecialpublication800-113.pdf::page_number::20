3.    SSL VPN Fundamentals

SSL VPNs provide secure remote access to an organizationâ€™s resources. An SSL VPN consists of one or
more VPN devices that users connect to using their Web browsers. The traffic between the Web browser
and SSL VPN device is encrypted with the SSL protocol. SSL VPNs provide remote users with access to
Web applications and client/server applications, and with connectivity to internal networks. They offer
versatility and ease of use because they use the SSL protocol that is included with all standard Web
browsers, so the client usually does not require configuration by the user.

This section of the document discusses SSL VPNs and their services and features. Section 3.1 provides
an overview of the high-level SSL VPN architecture. Section 3.2 highlights the major functions of an
SSL VPN. Section 3.3 describes the various features and services provided by SSL VPNs and the
security controls used to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Section 3.4 briefly
covers the technical details of the SSL and TLS protocols. Section 3.5 addresses the challenges involved
with SSL VPNs.

3.1   SSL VPN Architecture

Figure 3-1 provides a high level view of a typical SSL VPN architecture. That architecture is the same
for both SSL portal VPNs and SSL tunnel VPNs.

Typical SSL VPN users include people in remote offices, mobile users, business partners, and customers.
Hardware clients include various types of devices, such as public kiosks, home personal computers (PC),
PDAs, or smart phones, which may or may not be controlled or managed by the organization. The SSL
VPN may also be accessed from any location including an airport, a coffee shop, or a hotel room, as long
as the location has connectivity to the Internet and the user has a Web client that is capable of using the
particular SSL VPN. All traffic is encrypted as it traverses public networks such as the Internet. The SSL
VPN gateway is the endpoint for the secure connection and provides various services and features (most
SSL VPN products are standalone hardware appliances, although there are some software-based solutions
that are installed on user-supplied servers).
