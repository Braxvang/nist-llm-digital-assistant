7.2 Metrics Development and Implementation Approach
   Two processes guide the establishment and operation of an information security
metrics program: metrics development and metrics implementation. The metrics
development process establishes the initial set of metrics and selection of the metrics
subset appropriate for an organization at a given time. The metrics program
implementation process operates a metrics program that is iterative by nature and
ensures that appropriate aspects of information security are measured for a specific
time period.

7.3 Metrics Development Process
   Figure 7-1 illustrates the place of information security metrics within a larger
organizational context and demonstrates that information security metrics can be
used to progressively measure implementation, efficiency, effectiveness, and the
business impact of information security activities within organizations or for specific
systems.




              Figure 7-1. Information Security Metrics Development Process


    The information security metrics development process consists of two major
activities:
       1. Identifying and defining the current information security program; and
       2. Developing and selecting specific metrics to measure implementation,
           efficiency, effectiveness, and the impact of the security controls.
    The process steps do not need to be sequential. Rather, the process illustrated in
Figure 7-1 provides a framework for thinking about metrics and aids in identifying
metrics to be developed for each system. The type of metric depends on where the
system is within its life cycle and on the maturity of the information system security
program. This framework facilitates tailoring metrics to a specific organization and to
the different stakeholder groups present within each organization.
