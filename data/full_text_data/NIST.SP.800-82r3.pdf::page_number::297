F.7.16.        SYSTEM AND SERVICES ACQUISITION â€“ SA
Tailoring Considerations for the System and Services Acquisition Family
In situations where the OT cannot support the specific system and services acquisition
requirements of a control, the organization employs compensating controls in accordance with
the general tailoring guidance. Examples of compensating controls are given with each control as
appropriate.

            SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE | MANAGE PREPRODUCTION
 SA-3 (1)
            ENVIRONMENT

 SA-3 (3)   SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE | TECHNOLOGY REFRESH


No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancements: (1) OT Discussion: Organizations that do not maintain local pre-
production environments and utilize a third-party integrator should ensure that contracts are
developed to limit security and privacy risks.
Control Enhancements: (3) OT Discussion: Many OT systems have an expected life cycle that is
longer than most IT components. Technology refresh is addressed in budget planning to limit the
use of obsolete systems that present security or reliability risks.
