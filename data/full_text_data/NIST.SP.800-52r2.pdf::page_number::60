NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                             GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


Appendix D—RSA Key Transport

RSA key transport is a key exchange mechanism where the premaster secret is chosen by the
client, encrypted with the server’s public key, and sent to the server. It is available in TLS
versions 1.0 through 1.2, but it is not supported by TLS 1.3. While it is a convenient method for
key exchange when the server’s certificate contains an RSA public key, this method has several
drawbacks:

      1. The client has sole responsibility for the premaster secret generation. If the client does
         not have sufficient entropy to generate the premaster secret, the security of the session
         will suffer.
      2. It does not enable forward secrecy.
      3. The padding scheme that TLS uses for this operation has a known vulnerability that
         requires TLS implementations to perform attack mitigation.

For these reasons, this guideline does not recommend cipher suites that use RSA key transport
for key exchange (see Section 3.3.1).

Perfect forward secrecy (see Footnote 20) is often a security goal, as it prevents the compromise
of long-term keys from enabling the decryption of sessions. The only way to achieve this
property in TLS is to use a key exchange mechanism that relies on ephemeral parameters (i.e.,
cipher suites that contain DHE or ECDHE) as specified in RFC 5246 [25].

RSA key-transport using PKCS #1 v1.5 is vulnerable to Bleichenbacher oracle attacks. RFC
5246 contains steps to mitigate the attacks by processing incorrectly formatted messages in a
manner indistinguishable from the processing of properly-formatted messages (see [25], Section
7.4.7.1). The mitigation techniques are not always effective in practice (for examples, see [14]).

D.1        Transition Period

While these guidelines do not recommend cipher suites using RSA key transport, there may be
circumstances in practice where RSA key transport is needed. For example, if an agency uses a
network appliance for regulatory or enterprise security purposes that only functions with these
cipher suites, then these cipher suites may need to be enabled. It is recommended that agencies
transition to a new method to meet their needs as soon as it is practical.

If RSA key transport is needed while a new traffic inspection strategy is being developed, only
RSA key transport cipher suites from the following list may be used. See Section 3.3.1.1 for
general information on preference order.
