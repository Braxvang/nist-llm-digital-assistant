590           Comprehensive role-based training addresses management, operational, and technical roles and
591           responsibilities that cover physical, personnel, and technical controls. Such training can include
592           policies, procedures, tools, and artifacts for the security roles defined. Organizations also provide
593           the training necessary for individuals to carry out their responsibilities related to operations and
594           supply chain security within the context of organizational information security programs.

601   3.3.1. Event Logging
602           REQUIREMENT: 03.03.01
603           a. Specify the following event types selected for logging within the system: [Assignment:
604              organization-defined event types].
605           b. Review and update the event types selected for logging periodically.

606           DISCUSSION
607           An event is any observable occurrence in a system, including unlawful or unauthorized system
608           activity. Organizations identify event types for which a logging functionality is needed. This
609           includes events that are relevant to the security of systems and the environments in which those
610           systems operate to meet specific and ongoing auditing needs. Event types can include password
611           changes, the execution of privileged functions, failed logons or accesses related to systems,
612           administrative privilege usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining event types that
613           require logging, organizations consider the system monitoring and auditing that are appropriate
614           for each of the security requirements. When defining event types, organizations consider the
615           logging necessary to cover related events, such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based
616           processes (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur
617           in service-oriented or cloud-based architectures. Monitoring and auditing requirements can be
618           balanced with other system needs. For example, organizations may determine that systems must
619           have the capability to log every file access, both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that
620           capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance.
621           The event types that are logged by organizations may change over time. Periodically reviewing
622           and updating the set of logged event types is necessary to ensure that the current set remains
623           necessary and sufficient.
