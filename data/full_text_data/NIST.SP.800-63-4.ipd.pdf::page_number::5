100   Reports on Computer Systems Technology

101   The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
102   Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
103   leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops
104   tests, test methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical
105   analyses to advance the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s
106   responsibilities include the development of management, administrative, technical, and
107   physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of other
108   than national security-related information in federal information systems. The Special
109   Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in
110   information system security, and its collaborative activities with industry, government,
111   and academic organizations.

112   Abstract

113   These guidelines provide technical requirements for federal agencies implementing digital
114   identity services and are not intended to constrain the development or use of standards
115   outside of this purpose. The guidelines cover identity proofing and authentication of users
116   (such as employees, contractors, or private individuals) interacting with government
117   information systems over networks. They define technical requirements in each of
118   the areas of identity proofing, registration, authenticators, management processes,
119   authentication protocols, federation, and related assertions. This publication will
120   supersede NIST Special Publication 800-63-3.

121   Keywords

122   authentication; authentication assurance; authenticator; assertions; credential service
123   provider; digital authentication; digital credentials; identity proofing; federation;
124   passwords; PKI.

125   Note to Reviewers

126   The rapid proliferation of online services over the past few years has heightened the need
127   for reliable, equitable, secure, and privacy-protective digital identity solutions.
128   Revision 4 of NIST Special Publication 800-63, Digital Identity Guidelines, intends to
129   respond to the changing digital landscape that has emerged since the last major revision
130   of this suite was published in 2017 — including the real-world implications of online
131   risks. The guidelines present the process and technical requirements for meeting digital
132   identity management assurance levels for identity proofing, authentication, and federation,
133   including requirements for security and privacy as well as considerations for fostering
134   equity and the usability of digital identity solutions and technology.
