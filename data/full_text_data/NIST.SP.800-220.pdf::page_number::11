Computer Forensic Tool Testing (CFTT)
In FY 2021, the CFTT Program, a project supported by NIST’s Special Programs Office and the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS), helped address critical needs in the law enforcement
community to ensure the reliability of computer forensic tools to identify and store evidence from a
computing device.

•   Specifications and Testing – the CFTT partnered with DHS to test numerous digital forensic
    tools for search functions, mobile device acquisition, and SQLite Data Recovery, resulting in 12
    published reports.
•   Federated Testing – Federated testing was developed to provide third parties with the ability
    to use the NIST testing methodology in their labs and produce standardized test reports. In
    FY 2021, NIST added a new test suite, Federated Testing Lite, for string searching and mobile
    forensics data.
•   Computer Forensic Reference Data Sets (CFReDS) – The CFReDS project is a repository of
    various documented sets of digital evidence. In FY 2021, an improved CFReDS portal was
    published and is currently live at https://cfreds.nist.gov/. The goal is for the CFReDS website to
    be a centralized portal that provides the forensic community with a quick and easy way to find
    and share datasets of interest.
•   Forensics Tool Catalog – The Forensics Tool Catalog is a web-based, community-sourced
    catalog of software forensics tools aided by a taxonomy. In FY 2021, the catalog entries
    increased to 208 entries from 82 vendors.

National Software Reference Library (NSRL)
The NSRL collects software from various sources and incorporates the file profiles computed from
this software into a Reference Data Set (RDS) of information. The RDS is used by law enforcement,
government, and industry to review computer files by matching file profiles in the RDS. This will
help alleviate much of the effort involved in determining which files are important as evidence on
computers or other electronic devices that have been seized as part of criminal investigations.
The NSRL also provides a research environment to promote the development of new forensics
techniques and other applications in computer science.

In FY 2021, the NSRL published four releases of software metadata and enlarged the collection
to contain 897 million files from 43,629 microcomputer applications; 198,321 mobile device
applications; and 3,897 gaming platform applications.
