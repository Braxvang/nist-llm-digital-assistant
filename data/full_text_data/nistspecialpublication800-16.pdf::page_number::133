      INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING MATRIX ~~ Cell 3.3E
 Training Area: System Life Cycle Security            — Test & Evaluate
 Functional Specialty: Review & Evaluate

 Definition   —        The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an IT system
                       from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                       model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                       Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                       ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                       needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                       The test and evaluation phase is the series of steps followed to ensure that
                       the design and construction of a new or modified information system or
                       technology has successfully incorporated appropriate security safeguards.

 Behavioral Outcome        —   Individuals are able to evaluate the appropriateness of test
                               methodologies, and conduct independent tests and evaluations to
                               ensure that adequate and appropriate safeguards cire in place,
                               effective, and documented; and to prepare certification/accreditation
                               documentation.
