NIST SP 800-82r3                                              Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

6.1.4. Risk Management Strategy (ID.RM)
The risk management strategy guides how risk is framed, assessed, responded to, and monitored
and provides a consistent approach to making risk-based decisions across the organization. Risk
tolerance, assumptions, constraints, priorities, and trade-offs are identified for investment and
operational decision making. Additionally, the risk management strategy identifies acceptable
risk assessment methodologies, potential risk responses, and a process to continuously monitor
the security posture (or implementation of security countermeasures and outcomes) of the
organization.
Section 3 describes the overall risk management process for supporting an effective
cybersecurity program. The following NIST documents provide additional implementation
guidance for developing a risk management strategy:
   •   NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 2, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and
       Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy
   •   NIST SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and
       Information System View
   •   NIST IR 8179, Criticality Analysis Process Model: Prioritizing Systems and Components
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            When establishing an OT risk management strategy, organizations
            should consider:
                   •   Ensuring that the risk tolerance of an OT environment is
                       informed by the organization’s role in critical infrastructure and
                       sector-specific risk analysis
                   •   Documenting failure scenarios that involve IT components within
                       the OT environment and their effect on operations and safety
                   •   Establishing processes to periodically update information to
                       determine the current risk posture for the environment and
                       coordinate required adjustments to risk management and
                       management controls
            Overall risk can also be reduced by addressing likelihood and
            consequence. For OT systems, the risk management strategy should
            consider non-security and safety controls (e.g., pressure relief valves,
            manual valves) that can also help reduce the consequence of a failure.

6.1.5. Supply Chain Risk Management (ID.SC)
Supply chains are multifaceted and built on a variety of business, economic, and technological
factors. Organizations choose their suppliers, and consumers choose their sources based on a
range of factors that vary from corporate preferences and existing business relationships to more
discrete considerations, such as the existence of limited sources of supply or other unique
characteristics.
