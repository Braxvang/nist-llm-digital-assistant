       November 2023

2580   Appendix B. Glossary
2581   Appendix B provides definitions for the terminology used in NIST SP 800-171. The definitions
2582   are consistent with the definitions contained in the National Information Assurance Glossary [78]
2583   unless otherwise noted.

2584   agency
2585   Any executive agency or department, military department, Federal Government corporation, Federal Government-
2586   controlled corporation, or other establishment in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government, or any
2587   independent regulatory agency. [13]

2588   assessment
2589   See security control assessment.

2590   assessor
2591   See security control assessor.

2592   audit log
2593   A chronological record of system activities, including records of system accesses and operations performed in a
2594   given period.

2595   audit record
2596   An individual entry in an audit log related to an audited event.

2597   authentication
2598   Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in a
2599   system. Adapted from [7].

2600   availability
2601   Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information. [79]

2602   advanced persistent threat
2603   An adversary that possesses sophisticated levels of expertise and significant resources which allow it to create
2604   opportunities to achieve its objectives by using multiple attack vectors including, for example, cyber, physical, and
2605   deception. These objectives typically include establishing and extending footholds within the IT infrastructure of the
2606   targeted organizations for purposes of exfiltrating information, undermining or impeding critical aspects of a
2607   mission, program, or organization; or positioning itself to carry out these objectives in the future. The advanced
2608   persistent threat pursues its objectives repeatedly over an extended period; adapts to defenders’ efforts to resist it;
2609   and is determined to maintain the level of interaction needed to execute its objectives. [60]

2610   authenticator
2611   Something the claimant possesses and controls (typically a cryptographic module or password) that is used to
2612   authenticate the claimant’s identity. This was previously referred to as a token.

2613   baseline configuration
2614   A documented set of specifications for a system or a configuration item within a system that has been formally
2615   reviewed and agreed upon at a given point in time, and that can only be changed through change control procedures.

2616   common secure configuration
2617   Recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for specific
2618   information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring those system components to meet
2619   operational requirements. These benchmarks are also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown and
2620   hardening guides, security reference guides, and security technical implementation guides.
