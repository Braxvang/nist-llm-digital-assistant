Special Publication 800-79-2                             Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



After carrying out an assessment procedure, the Assessor records his/her conclusion in one of
two ways: MET, NOT MET. Using the list of conclusions pertaining to assessment procedures
associated with an issuer control, the assessment result (which is one of the 4 outcomes listed
above) is arrived at as follows:
       If the conclusion from all assessment procedures is MET, then the assessment result for
        the issuer control is “Satisfied”
       If some of the conclusions are NOT MET, then the assessment result for the issuer
        control is marked as either “Partially Satisfied” or “Not Satisfied”, depending on whether
        or not any of the underlying tasks in the assessment procedures are critical (i.e., they
        represent the only way to meet the issuer control’s objective). An example of an
        assessment that resulted in “Partially Satisfied” is given in Figure 4. In this instance, there
        is an awareness of a task requirement, and the task itself is being carried out, but the
        reference to the task is missing in the document.

In drawing a conclusion after carrying out an assessment procedure, the Assessor must consider
the potential subjective and objective aspects of the assessment methods used (e.g., interviews,
document reviews, observations, and tests) for that assessment procedure. Deficiencies that
result in “Partially Satisfied” or “Not Satisfied” must be reported by the Assessor. The Assessor
must also outline the potential adverse impacts if the issuer control is deployed with the
identified deficiencies.

The assessment report template provides the means for recording the assessment result for each
issuer control. The assessment results for all issuer controls are aggregated to generate the
assessment result for an Issuer Authorization Focus area. The set of Issuer Authorization Focus
Area results are aggregated to generate Issuer Authorization Topic results. Finally, the group of
Issuer Authorization Topic results is used to generate the overall Issuer Assessment Report and
an accompanying Executive Summary (intended for Senior Management).
