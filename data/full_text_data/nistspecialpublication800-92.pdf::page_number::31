               entries from a single source or multiple sources based on logged values, such as timestamps,
               IP addresses, and event types. Event correlation can also be performed in other ways, such as
               using statistical methods or visualization tools. If correlation is performed through automated
               methods, generally the result of successful correlation is a new log entry that brings together
               the pieces of information into a single place. Depending on the nature of that information,
               the infrastructure might also generate an alert to indicate that the identified event needs
               further investigation.

          –    Log viewing is displaying log entries in a human-readable format. Most log generators
               provide some sort of log viewing capability; third-party log viewing utilities are also
               available. Some log viewers provide filtering and aggregation capabilities.

          –    Log reporting is displaying the results of log analysis. Log reporting is often performed to
               summarize significant activity over a particular period of time or to record detailed
               information related to a particular event or series of events.
       Disposal

          –    Log clearing is removing all entries from a log that precede a certain date and time. Log
               clearing is often performed to remove old log data that is no longer needed on a system
               because it is not of importance or it has been archived.
A log management infrastructure usually encompasses most or all of the functions described in this
section. Section 3.1 describes the components and architectures of log management infrastructures. The
placement of some of the log functions among the three tiers of the log management infrastructure
depends primarily on the type of log management software used. Log management infrastructures are
typically based on one of the two major categories of log management software: syslog-based centralized
logging software and security information and event management software. Sections 3.3 and 3.4 describe
these types of software. Section 3.5 describes additional types of software that may be valuable within a
log management infrastructure.

3.3     Syslog-Based Centralized Logging Software

In a logging infrastructure based on the syslog protocol, each log generator uses the same high-level
format for its logs and the same basic mechanism for transferring its log entries to a syslog server running
on another host.26 Syslog provides a simple framework for log entry generation, storage, and transfer,
that any OS, security software, or application could use if designed to do so. Many log sources either use
syslog as their native logging format or offer features that allow their log formats to be converted to
syslog format. Section 3.3.1 describes the format of syslog messages, and Section 3.3.2 discusses the
security features of common syslog implementations.27

3.3.1     Syslog Format

Syslog assigns a priority to each message based on the importance of the following two attributes:

       Message type, known as a facility. Examples of facilities include kernel messages, mail system
        messages, authorization messages, printer messages, and audit messages.

26
      Although syslog has been in use for many years for log generationand storage, it has not been standardized formally.
      Request for Comments (RFC) 3164, The BSD Syslog Protocol, which is available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3164.txt, is
      an informational document and not a true standard. Because of the lack of syslog standards, there are major differences
      among existing syslog implementations.
27
      Most syslog implementations are free; there are also some commercial syslog implementations.
