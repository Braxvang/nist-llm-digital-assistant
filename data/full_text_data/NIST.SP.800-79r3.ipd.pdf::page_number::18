      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                              Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                                                     and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

477        Preparation for Assessment and Authorization
478   This section presents the fundamentals of an authorization of an issuer, including (i) definitions
479   for an issuer and issuing facility, (ii) outsourcing issuer services or functions, (iii) the differences
480   between an assessment and authorization, (iv) the authorization boundaries of an issuer, (v) roles
481   and responsibilities, (vi) the relationship between authorization under [SP800-37] and this
482   revision of SP 800-79, (vii) preparing for the assessment, (viii) the types of authorization
483   decisions, (xi) the use of risk in authorization decisions, and (x) the contents of the authorization
484   package.

485              Organization
486   An organization in the context of this document is a federal department or agency that is
487   responsible for issuing PIV Cards and, optionally, derived PIV credentials to their employees
488   and contractors in accordance with [HSPD-12] and [FIPS201] requirements. An organization
489   SHALL be responsible for maintaining the enterprise identity management system (IDMS) and
490   associated PIV identity accounts for its employees and contractors. The organization SHALL
491   also be responsible for authorizing an issuer (Sec. 2.2) via an authorization to operate (ATO)
492   (Sec. 2.10) prior to issuing PIV credentials.
493   An organization is responsible for completely describing its PIV credential issuance functions in
494   an operations plan. This comprehensive document incorporates all of the information about the
495   organization that is needed for any independent party to review and assess the capability and
496   reliability of its issuance functions, as implemented by the issuers. An operations plan includes a
497   description of the issuerâ€™s structure, its facilities, any external service providers, roles and
498   responsibilities, the policies and procedures that govern its operations, and a description of how
499   the requirements of [FIPS201] are being met. A template for an operations plan is provided in
500   Appendix D.

501              Issuer
502   At the highest level, an issuer is considered to be owned by an organization (e.g., federal agency)
503   or a private entity outsourced by the organization to provide PIV credential services. An issuer
504   SHALL provide a full set of functions required to produce, issue, and maintain PIV Cards or
505   derived PIV credentials for the organization. An issuer is considered operational if the
506   organization has relevant roles and responsibilities defined and appointed; suitable policies and
507   compliant procedures have been implemented for all relevant PIV processes, 2 including
508   sponsorship, identity proofing/registration (to include supervised remote identity proofing, if
509   implemented), adjudication, card/token production, activation/issuance, and maintenance; and
510   information system components that are utilized to perform the above-mentioned functions (i.e.,
511   processes) have been assessed and shown to meet all technical and operational requirements
512   prescribed in [FIPS201] and related documents.
513   In order to comply with [HSPD-12], an organization SHALL first establish an issuer to issue PIV
514   Cards or derived PIV credentials that conforms to and satisfies the requirements of [FIPS201]

      2
       Some of the processes may not apply to issuers of derived PIV credentials. For example, identity proofing is not required for the issuance of
      derived PIV credentials since it is a post-enrollment binding process based on the issued PIV Card and identity record previously created.
