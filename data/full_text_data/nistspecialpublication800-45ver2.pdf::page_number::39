                                                                          GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



4.5       Human Resources Requirements

The greatest challenge and expense in developing and securely maintaining a mail server is providing the
necessary human resources to adequately perform the required functions. Many organizations fail to fully
realize the amount of expense and skills required to field a secure mail server. This failure often results in
overworked employees and insecure systems. From the initial planning stages, organizations need to
determine the necessary human resource requirements. Appropriate and sufficient human resources are
the single most important aspect of mail server security. Organizations should also consider the fact that,
in general, technical solutions are not a substitute for skilled and experienced personnel.

When considering the human resource implications of developing and deploying a mail server,
organizations should address the following in the deployment plan:

 Required Personnel – What types of personnel are going to be required? This would include such
  positions as system and mail server administrators, network administrators, and ISSOs.
 Required Skills – What are the required skills to adequately plan, develop, and maintain the mail
  server in a secure manner? Examples include operating system administration, network
  administration, active content expertise, and programming.
 Available Personnel – What are the available human resources within the organization? In addition,
  what are their current skill sets and are they sufficient for supporting the mail server? Often an
  organization discovers that its existing human resources are not sufficient and needs to consider the
  following options:

      –    Train Current Staff – If there are personnel available but they do not have the requisite skills, the
           organization may choose to train the existing staff in the skills required. While this is an
           excellent option, the organization should ensure that employees meet all prerequisites for training.

      –    Hire Additional Staff – If there is not enough staff available or they do not have the requisite
           skills, it may be necessary to hire additional personnel.
Once the organization has staffed the project and the mail server is active, it will be necessary to ensure
the number and skills of the personnel are still adequate. The threat and vulnerability levels of hosts
including mail servers are constantly changing, as is the technology. This means that what is adequate
today may not be tomorrow.

4.6       General Information System Security Principles

When addressing mail server security issues, it is an excellent idea to keep some general information
security principles in mind [Curt01 and Salt75]:

 Simplicity—Security mechanisms (and the information systems in general) should be as simple as
  possible. Complexity is at the root of many security issues.
 Fail-Safe—If a failure occurs, the system should fail in a secure manner by which security controls
  and settings remain in effect and are enforced. It is usually better to lose functionality rather than
  security.
 Complete Mediation—Rather than providing direct access to information, mediators that enforce
  access policy should be employed. Common examples include file system permissions, proxies,
  firewalls, and mail gateways.
