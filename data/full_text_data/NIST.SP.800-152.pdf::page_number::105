SP 800-152                                               A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


to its cryptographic standards and recommendations, including the Cryptographic Module
Validation Program (CMVP) and the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program
(CAVP). Non-cryptographic software and hardware could be validated using the
Common Criteria Standard ([ISO 15408 Parts 1- 3] by the National Information
Assurance Partnership (NIAP)). These validations produce a high level of assurance
regarding specific characteristics of a product or service.

FR:9.2 The CKMS design shall specify all third-party testing programs that have been
passed to date by the CKMS or its devices.

                           All Federal CKMS modules and devices should be tested by

                           a third-party, and the test results should be provided to the
                           appropriate FCKMS procurement authorities for review.

9.3   Interoperability Testing

Interoperability testing, in its most general form, merely tests that two or more devices
can be interconnected and operate with one another. This means that the data exchanged
between the devices must be in a format that each device can process. Interoperable
devices may be interconnected to form a system, and interoperable systems may be
interconnected to form a network. Note that this type of testing does not necessarily test
the internal functioning of the individual device. If a device performs a unique function,
interoperability testing may not verify that function.

FR:9.3 If a CKMS claims interoperability with another system, then the CKMS design
shall specify the tests that have been performed and passed that verify the claim.

FR:9.4 If a CKMS claims interoperability with another system, then the CKMS design
shall specify any configuration settings that are required for interoperability.

                           If an FCKMS, FCKMS module, or FCKMS device claims
PR:9.6
                           interoperability with a reference implementation, then the
                           FCKMS, FCKMS module or FCKMS device shall be tested
                           and validated against the reference implementation.
