    The complexity in virtual machine environments can also be more challenging than in
    their traditional counterparts, giving rise to conditions that undermine security [Gar05].
    For example, paging, checkpointing, and migration of virtual machines can leak sensitive
    data to persistent storage, subverting protection mechanisms in the hosted operating
    system intended to prevent such occurrences. Moreover, the hypervisor itself can
    potentially be compromised. A compromise of the hypervisor could result in the
    compromise of all systems that it hosts [Sca11]. For instance, a vulnerability that
    allowed specially crafted File Transfer Protocol (FTP) requests to corrupt a heap buffer in
    the hypervisor, which in turn could induce the execution of arbitrary code at the host, was
    discovered in the Network Address Translation (NAT) routine of a widely used
    virtualization software product [Sec05, She05].

    Virtual servers and applications, much like their non-virtual counterparts, need to be
    secured, both physically and logically. Following organizational policies and procedures,
    the operating system and applications should be hardened when producing virtual
    machine images for deployment. Care must also be taken to provision security for the
    virtualized environments in which the images run [You07]. For example, virtual
    firewalls can be used to isolate groups of virtual machines from other hosted groups, such
    as production systems from development systems or development systems from other
    cloud-resident systems. Carefully managing virtual machine images is also important to
    avoid accidentally deploying images under development or containing vulnerabilities.

ï€¼   Virtual Network Protection. Most virtualization platforms have the ability to create
    software-based switches and network configurations as part of the virtual environment to
    allow virtual machines on the same host to communicate more directly and efficiently.
    For example, for virtual machines requiring no external network access, the virtual
    networking architectures of most virtualization software products support same-host
    networking, in which a private subnet is created for intra-host communications. Traffic
    over virtual networks may not be visible to security protection devices on the physical
    network, such as network-based intrusion detection and prevention systems [Sca11,
    Vie09]. To avoid a loss of visibility and protection against intra-host attacks, duplication
    of the physical network protection capabilities may be required on the virtual network
    [Ref10, Vmw10]. While some hypervisors allow network monitoring, their capabilities
    are generally not as robust as those in tools used to monitor physical networks.
    Organizations should consider the risk and performance tradeoffs between having traffic
    hidden within the hypervisor versus exposing that traffic to the physical network for
    monitoring [Sca11].

    A side effect of virtualized environments is the potential loss of separation of duties
    between existing administration roles in an organization. For example, in traditional
    computing environments, computer administrators typically do not configure network
    security components, such as intrusion detection and prevention systems and firewalls.
    Network security administrators, on the other hand, can configure such devices, but
    typically do not have administrative rights on hosts to grant system access. In virtual
    environments, the distinct roles of computer and network security administrators can
    collapse into a single role of a virtual infrastructure administrator. Other distinct roles,
