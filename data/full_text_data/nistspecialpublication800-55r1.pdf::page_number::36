Information security program goals and objectives can also be derived from enterprise-level
goals and objectives in support of the overall organizationâ€™s mission, which are usually
articulated in agency strategic and performance plans. Applicable documents should be
reviewed to identify and extract applicable information security performance goals and
objectives. Extracted goals and objectives should be validated with the organizational
stakeholders to ensure their acceptance of, and participation in, the measures development
process.

Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 200, Minimum Security Requirements for
Federal Information and Information Systems, provides specifications for minimum security
requirements. NIST SP 800-53 provides minimum security controls corresponding to low-
impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact categories as defined in FIPS 199, Standards for
Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems. Agencies must define
and implement minimum security controls based on the sensitivity of data processed, stored, and
transmitted on their information systems. As such, agency information security programs must
include planning, implementing, monitoring, and reporting on the implementation and
effectiveness of these information system security controls. To facilitate explicit linkage of
information security activities with agency-level strategic planning, agencies can use
specifications for minimum security requirements, stated in FIPS 200, as an input into objectives
for developing information security performance measures. (These specifications, which
correspond to the 17 security control families in NIST SP 800-53, are provided in Appendix D.
Appendix A provides candidate information security measures from both programmatic and
system-level perspectives, with corresponding goals and objectives.)

5.3    Information Security Policies, Guidelines, and Procedures Review

Phase 3 of the measures development process (see Figure 5-1) focuses on organization-specific
information security practices. Details of how security controls should be implemented are
usually set forth in organization-specific policies and procedures that define a baseline of
information security practices for the information system. Specifically, they describe how
implementing security controls, requirements, and techniques lead to accomplishing information
security performance goals and objectives. These documents should be examined not only
during initial measures development, but in future measures development activities when the
initial list of measures is exhausted and needs to be replaced. Applicable documents should be
reviewed to identify information security controls, applicable processes, and targets of
performance.

5.4    Information Security Program Implementation Review

In Phase 4 of the measures development process (see Figure 5-1), any existing measures and data
repositories that can be used to derive measures data should be reviewed. Following the review,
applicable information should be extracted and used to identify appropriate implementation
