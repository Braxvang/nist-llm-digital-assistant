CHAPTER 3                                                               System Development Life Cycle


Security                   Provide the necessary security authorization of an information system to process, store, or
Accreditation 29            transmit information that is required. This authorization is granted by a senior organization
                            official and is based on the verified effectiveness of security controls to some agreed-upon
                            level of assurance and on an identified residual risk to agency assets or operations. This
                            process determines whether the remaining known vulnerabilities in the information system
                            pose an acceptable level of risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Upon
                            successful completion of this phase, system owners will either have authority to operate,
                            interim authorization to operate, or denial of authorization to operate the information system.
D. Operations/Maintenance Phase
Configuration              Ensure adequate consideration of the potential security impacts due to specific changes to an
Management and              information system or its surrounding environment. CM and configuration control procedures
Control 30                  are critical to establishing an initial baseline of hardware, software, and firmware components
                            for the information system and for subsequently controlling and maintaining an accurate
                            inventory of any changes to the system.
                           Develop CM plan
                              − Establish baselines
                              − Identify configuration
                              − Describe configuration control process
                              − Identify schedule for configuration audits
Continuous                 Monitor security controls to ensure that controls continue to be effective in their application
Monitoring                  through periodic testing and evaluation. Security control monitoring (i.e., verifying the
                            continued effectiveness of those controls over time) and reporting the security status of the
                            information system to appropriate agency officials is an essential activity of a comprehensive
                            information security program. Monitor to ensure system security controls are functioning as
                            required.
                           Perform self-administered or independent security audits or other assessments periodically.
                            Types: using automated tools, internal control audits, security checklists, and penetration
                            testing.
                           Monitor system and/or users. Methods: review system logs and reports, use automated
                            tools, review change management, monitor external sources (trade literature, publications,
                            electronic news, etc.), and perform periodic reaccreditation.
                              − POA&Ms
                              − Measurement and metrics
                              − Network monitoring
E. Disposal Phase:
Information                Retain information, as necessary, to conform to current legal requirements and to
Preservation                accommodate future technology changes that may render the retrieval method obsolete.
                           Consult with agency office on retaining and archiving federal records.
                           Ensure long-term storage of cryptographic keys for encrypted data.
                           Determine archive, discard or destroy information.
Media Sanitization         Determine sanitization level (overwrite, degauss, or destroy).
                           Delete, erase, and overwrite data as necessary.
Hardware and               Dispose of hardware and software as directed by governing agency policy.
Software Disposal
