                                                              GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


 RFC 4621 Design of the IKEv2 Mobility and Multihoming (MOBIKE) Protocol
 RFC 4877 Mobile IPv6 Operation with IKEv2 and the Revised IPsec Architecture
 RFC 4891 Using IPsec to Secure IPv6-in-IPv4 Tunnels
The three applications all bear directly on IPsec with IPv6. For OSPF on IPv6 networks (which is called
v3), integrity is specified, ESP is REQUIRED, and AH is OPTIONAL. IKEv2 Mobility and
Multihoming Protocol (MOBIKE) defines an efficient way to move IPsec SAs when an address changes,
which happens much more often in IPv6 because of mobility, multihoming, or renumbering. RFC 4877
brings IPv6 mobility up to date with the RFC 4301-series version of IPsec. Finally, RFC 4891 answers
the question of what protocol stack and type of tunneling works best when IPv6 is tunneled through an
IPv4 network, and IPsec is applied at the tunnel endpoints. Using Protocol 41 and ESP in transport mode
is the easiest configuration to achieve this goal.

Management of security

 RFC 4807 IPsec Security Policy Database Configuration MIB



PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) for IPsec and IKE

 RFC 4945 The Internet IP Security PKI Profile of IKEv1/ISAKMP, IKEv2, and PKIX
 RFC 4809 Requirements for an IPsec Certificate Management Profile
The use of Public Key Certificates, and the interpretation of their contents, has been a source of
interoperability problems within IPsec and IKE. These RFCs attempt to pin down some of the details and
enhance interoperability. However, they are not specific enough to eradicate these problems.



Weaker authentication and trust models

 RFC 5387 Problem and Applicability Statement for Better Than Nothing Security (BTNS)
 RFC 5386 Better-Than-Nothing-Security: An Unauthenticated Mode of IPsec
Recognizing that the lack of a global PKI for peer authentication is a major hurdle to the universal
deployment of IPsec, the BTNS (Better Than Nothing Security) Working Group defined a method of
using IPsec to protect communications, but allowing lesser methods of authentication (e.g., self-signed
certificates or raw public keys). This provides protection to the communications themselves, but does not
guarantee the identities of the peers. This approach could be used to protect communications for
applications that provide their own peer authentication.



The Applicability of IPsec

 RFC 5406 Guidelines for Specifying the Use of IPsec Version 2
