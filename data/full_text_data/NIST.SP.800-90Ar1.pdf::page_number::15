                                                                 Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


                          entropy immediately upon request or within an acceptable
                          amount of time, as determined by the user or application
                          relying upon that RBG.

Min-entropy               The min-entropy (in bits) of a random variable X is the largest
                          value m having the property that each observation of X
                          provides at least m bits of information (i.e., the min-entropy of
                          X is the greatest lower bound for the information content of
                          potential observations of X). The min-entropy of a random
                          variable is a lower bound on its entropy. The precise
                          formulation for min-entropy is −(log2 max pi) for a discrete
                          distribution having n possible outputs with probabilities p1,…,
                          pn. Min-entropy is often used as a worst-case measure of the
                          unpredictability of a random variable. Also see [SP 800-90B].
Non-Deterministic         An RBG that always has access to an entropy source and
Random Bit Generator      (when working properly) produces output bitstrings that have
(Non-deterministic RBG)   full entropy. Often called a True Random Number (or Bit)
(NRBG)                    Generator. (Contrast with a deterministic random bit
                          generator).

Nonce                     A time-varying value that has at most a negligible chance of
                          repeating, e.g., a random value that is generated anew for each
                          use, a timestamp, a sequence number, or some combination of
                          these.

Personalization String    An optional string of bits that is combined with a secret
                          entropy input and (possibly) a nonce to produce a seed.
Prediction Resistance     An RBG provides prediction resistance relative to time T if it
                          provides assurance that an adversary with knowledge of the
                          state of the RBG at some time(s) prior to T (but incapable of
                          performing work that matches the claimed security strength of
                          the RBG) would be unable to distinguish between
                          observations of ideal random bitstrings and (previously
                          unseen) bitstrings output by the RBG at or subsequent to time
                          T. In particular, an RBG whose design allows the adversary to
                          step forward from the initially compromised RBG state(s) to
                          obtain knowledge of subsequent RBG states and the
                          corresponding outputs (including the RBG state and output at
                          time T) would not provide prediction resistance relative to
                          time T. (Contrast with backtracking resistance.)
Pseudorandom              A process (or data produced by a process) is said to be
                          pseudorandom when the outcome is deterministic, yet also
                          effectively random, as long as the internal action of the
                          process is hidden from observation. For cryptographic
                          purposes, “effectively” means “within the limits of the
