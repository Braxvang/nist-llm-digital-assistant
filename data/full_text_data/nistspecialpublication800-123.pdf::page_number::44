                                                                                         GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



organization may wish to ensure that some of its staff are knowledgeable in the fields of computer and
network forensics. 41

A server administrator should follow the organization’s policies and procedures for incident handling, and
the incident response team should be contacted for guidance before the organization takes any action after
a suspected or confirmed security compromise. Examples of steps commonly performed after
discovering a successful compromise are as follows:

 Report the incident to the organization’s computer incident response capability.

 Isolate the compromised systems or take other steps to contain the attack so that additional
  information can be collected. 42

 Consult expeditiously, as appropriate, with management, legal counsel, and law enforcement.

 Investigate similar 43 hosts to determine if the attacker also has compromised other systems.

 Analyze the intrusion, including—

     –   The current state of the server, starting with the most ephemeral data (e.g., current network
         connections, memory dump, files time stamps, logged in users)

     –   Modifications made to the server’s software and configuration

     –   Modifications made to the data

     –   Tools or data left behind by the attacker

     –   System, intrusion detection, and firewall log files.

 Restore the server before redeploying it.

     –   Either install a clean version of the OS, applications, necessary patches, and server content; or
         restore the server from backups (this option can be more risky because the backups may have
         been made after the compromise, and restoring from a compromised backup may still allow the
         attacker access to the server).

     –   Disable unnecessary services.

     –   Apply all patches.

     –   Change all passwords (including on uncompromised hosts, if their passwords are believed to have
         been seen by the compromised server, or if the same passwords are used on other hosts).

     Techniques Into Incident Response (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html).
42
     Isolating the server must be accomplished with great care if the organization wishes to collect evidence. Many attackers
     configure compromised systems to erase evidence if a compromised system is disconnected from the network or rebooted.
     One method to isolate a server would be to reconfigure the nearest upstream switch or router.
43
     Similar hosts would include hosts that are in the same IP address range, have the same or similar passwords, share a trust
     relationship, and/or have the same OS and/or applications.
