Special Publication 800-39                                          Managing Information Security Risk
                                                                    Organization, Mission, and Information System View

                     Compliance with NIST Standards and Guidelines

In accordance with the provisions of FISMA,1 the Secretary of Commerce shall, on the basis of
standards and guidelines developed by NIST, prescribe standards and guidelines pertaining to
federal information systems. The Secretary shall make standards compulsory and binding to the
extent determined necessary by the Secretary to improve the efficiency of operation or security of
federal information systems. Standards prescribed shall include information security standards
that provide minimum information security requirements and are otherwise necessary to improve
the security of federal information and information systems.
     •    Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are approved by the Secretary of
          Commerce and issued by NIST in accordance with FISMA. FIPS are compulsory and
          binding for federal agencies.2 FISMA requires that federal agencies comply with these
          standards, and therefore, agencies may not waive their use.
     •    Special Publications (SPs) are developed and issued by NIST as recommendations and
          guidance documents. For other than national security programs and systems, federal
          agencies must follow those NIST Special Publications mandated in a Federal Information
          Processing Standard. FIPS 200 mandates the use of Special Publication 800-53, as
          amended. In addition, OMB policies (including OMB Reporting Instructions for FISMA
          and Agency Privacy Management) state that for other than national security programs
          and systems, federal agencies must follow certain specific NIST Special Publications.3
     •    Other security-related publications, including interagency reports (NISTIRs) and ITL
          Bulletins, provide technical and other information about NIST's activities. These
          publications are mandatory only when specified by OMB.
     •    Compliance schedules for NIST security standards and guidelines are established by
          OMB in policies, directives, or memoranda (e.g., annual FISMA Reporting Guidance).4

 The E-Government Act (P.L. 107-347) recognizes the importance of information security to the economic and
national security interests of the United States. Title III of the E-Government Act, entitled the Federal Information
Security Management Act (FISMA), emphasizes the need for organizations to develop, document, and implement an
organization-wide program to provide security for the information systems that support its operations and assets.

 The term agency is used in this publication in lieu of the more general term organization only in those circumstances
where its usage is directly related to other source documents such as federal legislation or policy.
3
  While federal agencies are required to follow certain specific NIST Special Publications in accordance with OMB
policy, there is flexibility in how agencies apply the guidance. Federal agencies apply the security concepts and
principles articulated in the NIST Special Publications in accordance with and in the context of the agency’s missions,
business functions, and environment of operation. Consequently, the application of NIST guidance by federal agencies
can result in different security solutions that are equally acceptable, compliant with the guidance, and meet the OMB
definition of adequate security for federal information systems. Given the high priority of information sharing and
transparency within the federal government, agencies also consider reciprocity in developing their information security
solutions. When assessing federal agency compliance with NIST Special Publications, Inspectors General, evaluators,
auditors, and assessors consider the intent of the security concepts and principles articulated within the specific
guidance document and how the agency applied the guidance in the context of its mission/business responsibilities,
operational environment, and unique organizational conditions.

  Unless otherwise stated, all references to NIST publications in this document (i.e., Federal Information Processing
Standards and Special Publications) are to the most recent version of the publication.
