3.10 System Environment
Provide a brief (one to three paragraphs) general description of the technical system.
Include any environmental or technical factors that raise special security concerns, such
as use of Personal Digital Assistants, wireless technology, etc. Typically, operational
environments are as follows:

     •   Standalone or Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) describes small, informal
         computer installations that are used for home or business purposes. Standalone
         encompasses a variety of small-scale environments and devices, ranging from
         laptops, mobile devices, or home computers, to telecommuting systems, to small
         businesses and small branch offices of a company.

     •   Managed or Enterprise are typically large agency systems with defined,
         organized suites of hardware and software configurations, usually consisting of
         centrally managed workstations and servers protected from the Internet by
         firewalls and other network security devices.

     •   Custom environments contain systems in which the functionality and degree of
         security do not fit the other environments. Two typical Custom environments are
         Specialized Security-Limited Functionality and Legacy:

            -- Specialized Security-Limited Functionality. A Specialized Security-
            Limited Functionality environment contains systems and networks at high risk
            of attack or data exposure, with security taking precedence over functionality.
            It assumes systems have limited or specialized (not general purpose
            workstations or systems) functionality in a highly threatened environment
            such as an outward facing firewall or public web server or whose data content
            or mission purpose is of such value that aggressive trade-offs in favor of
            security outweigh the potential negative consequences to other useful system
            attributes such as legacy applications or interoperability with other systems.
            A Specialized Security-Limited Functionality environment could be a subset
            of another environment.

            -- Legacy. A Legacy environment contains older systems or applications that
            may use older, less-secure communication mechanisms. Other machines
            operating in a Legacy environment may need less restrictive security settings
            so that they can communicate with legacy systems and applications. A
            Legacy environment could be a subset of a standalone or managed
            environment.16
