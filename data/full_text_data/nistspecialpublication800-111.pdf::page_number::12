with a filesystem. Some media types can contain only one partition (and consequently, one logical
volume), while others can contain multiple partitions.

2.2      The Need for Storage Security

In today’s computing environment, there are many threats to the confidentiality of information stored on
end user devices. Some threats are unintentional, such as human error, while others are intentional.
Intentional threats are posed by people with many different motivations, including causing mischief and
disruption and committing identity theft and other fraud. One of the most common threats is malware,
also known as malicious code, which refers to a program that is inserted into a system, usually covertly,
with the intent of compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim’s data,
applications, or OS. Types of malware threats include viruses, worms, malicious mobile code, Trojan
horses, rootkits, and spyware. Malware can give attackers unauthorized access to a device, transfer
information from the device to an attacker’s system, and perform other actions that jeopardize the
confidentiality of the information on a device. Another common threat against end user devices is device
loss or theft. Someone with physical access to a device has many options for attempting to view the
information stored on the device. This is also a concern for insider attacks, such as an employee
attempting to access sensitive information stored on another employee’s device. Another form of insider
attack is a user attempting to access another user’s files on a device that the two users share.

Many threats against end user devices could cause information stored on the devices to be accessed by
unauthorized parties. To prevent such disclosures of information, particularly of personally identifiable
information (PII) 3 and other sensitive data, the information needs to be secured. Securing other
components of end user devices, such as OSs, is also necessary, but in many cases additional measures
are needed to secure the stored information. For example, without these additional measures, an attacker
that steals a device could use forensic tools and techniques to recover information directly from the
storage media, circumventing the protections applied by the device’s OS.

A number of laws and regulations compel organizations to ensure that sensitive information is protected
appropriately. The following is a list of key regulations, standards, and guidelines that help define
organizations’ needs for storage security: 4

 Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA). FISMA emphasizes the need
  for each Federal agency to develop, document, and implement an organization-wide program to
  provide information security for the information systems that support its operations and assets. NIST
  Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems,
  was developed in support of FISMA. 5 NIST SP 800-53 is the primary source of recommended
  security controls for Federal agencies. It describes several controls related to storage security, such as
  controlling access through encryption of stored information, restricting access to mobile computing
  devices and information system media, and storing media in physically secure locations.

      OMB Memorandum 06-19, “Reporting Incidents Involving Personally Identifiable Information and Incorporating the Cost
      for Security in Agency Information Technology Investments”, defines PII as “any information about an individual
      maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or
      employment history and information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name,
      social security number, date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, biometric records, etc., including any other personal
      information which is linked or linkable to an individual.” The full text of the memorandum is available at

      It is outside this publication’s scope to explain which types of information organizations need to protect and how each type
      should be protected. NIST SP 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security
      Categories, discusses the identification of common types of information. It is at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/.
