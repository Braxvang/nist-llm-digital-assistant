GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



Supply chain systems can record information about products at every stage in the supply chain. Ideally,
tags are affixed to products during the manufacturing process or soon afterward. As a product moves
through the supply chain, to the end customer, and later to post-sale service, the tag’s identifier can be
used by all supply chain participants to refer to a specific item. In addition, supply chain systems that use
active tags can track larger objects such as cargo containers. Tags on these containers can store a
manifest of the items shipped in each container. This manifest can be automatically updated when items
are removed from the container.

The information collected by a supply chain RFID system offers many benefits. By more accurately
tracking products throughout their life cycle, participants can realize improved speed and accuracy of
ordering, automated invoicing and payment, fewer supply shortages with lower inventory levels, and
reduced shrinkage (product loss or theft). Furthermore, RFID-based supply chain systems give
management programs better visibility into the supply chain, which enables identification of bottlenecks,
targeted recalls, and new forms of market research. Such systems also generate an electronic pedigree for
each item. This feature gives buyers evidence of the item’s freshness, so they can identify if its useful life
has expired. It also provides buyers evidence of a product’s authenticity, so buyers can determine if it is
an unauthorized clone.

3.2   RFID Information Characteristics

Once an organization determines the general application type that corresponds to the business process it
wants to enhance or enable with RFID technology, it should characterize the information that will be
processed by the system. At the low end of the data requirement spectrum is the case of EAS. In EAS,
systems, the necessary information is conveyed in a single bit: either the tag is functioning (the item has
not yet been sold), or it is has been deactivated (the product has been sold). For this reason, EAS is
referred to as a one-bit or single-bit application. Similarly, in the case of relatively simple asset
management systems, the only data required is the identifier on the tag. The RFID system merely records
which items are present or have been read by the reader. Matching applications also have relatively
simple data requirements because they just link one identifier with another.

Data storage requirements increase in tracking applications. The system needs to record which of
multiple readers last read the tag and at what time. As the tracking systems get more complex, more data
is collected, such as changes in the possession of the item (e.g., someone signing for a package) or the
particular contents of a container. Process control applications further increase data requirements because
they use the recorded specifications of an item to customize actions in the business process.

Supply chain management systems are the most data-intensive RFID application. They not only process
data, but they must also maintain information about the data, such as the formats the various organizations
in the supply chain use to store and transmit data and the network addresses of database servers that
contain data about tagged items.

When determining the appropriate RFID technology and security controls for a given RFID application,
the personnel responsible should ask three questions regarding each data element in the RFID system:

 Is it considered sensitive or confidential?
 Could the data element be easily correlated or combined with other data to allow someone to infer
  sensitive or confidential information through indirect means?
 Does it change, and if so, how frequently?
