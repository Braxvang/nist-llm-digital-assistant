3.      Review Techniques

Review techniques passively examine systems, applications, networks, policies, and procedures to
discover security vulnerabilities. 6 They also gather information to facilitate and optimize other
assessment techniques. Because review techniques are passive, they pose minimal risk to systems and
networks. This section covers several common review techniques—documentation, log, ruleset, and
system configuration review; network sniffing; and file integrity checking.

3.1      Documentation Review

Documentation review determines if the technical aspects of policies and procedures are current and
comprehensive. These documents provide the foundation for an organization’s security posture, but are
often overlooked during technical assessments. Security groups within the organization should provide
assessors with appropriate documentation to ensure a comprehensive review. Documents to review for
technical accuracy and completeness include security policies, architectures, and requirements; standard
operating procedures; system security plans and authorization agreements; memoranda of understanding
and agreement for system interconnections; and incident response plans.

Documentation review can discover gaps and weaknesses that could lead to missing or improperly
implemented security controls. Assessors typically verify that the organization’s documentation is
compliant with standards and regulations such as FISMA, and look for policies that are deficient or
outdated. Common documentation weaknesses include OS security procedures or protocols that are no
longer used, and failure to include a new OS and its protocols. Documentation review does not ensure
that security controls are implemented properly—only that the direction and guidance exist to support
security infrastructure.

Results of documentation review can be used to fine-tune other testing and examination techniques. For
example, if a password management policy has specific requirements for minimum password length and
complexity, this information can be used to configure password-cracking tools for more efficient
performance.

3.2      Log Review

Log review determines if security controls are logging the proper information, and if the organization is
adhering to its log management policies. 7 As a source of historical information, audit logs can be used to
help validate that the system is operating in accordance with established policies. For example, if the
logging policy states that all authentication attempts to critical servers must be logged, the log review will
determine if this information is being collected and shows the appropriate level of detail. Log review may
also reveal problems such as misconfigured services and security controls, unauthorized accesses, and
attempted intrusions. For example, if an intrusion detection system (IDS) sensor is placed behind a
firewall, its logs can be used to examine communications that the firewall allows into the network. If the
sensor registers activities that should be blocked, it indicates that the firewall is not configured securely.

      This publication discusses reviews strictly from the aspect of assessment. Reviews should also be conducted periodically as
      part of regular system monitoring and maintenance, such as to identify operational problems, security misconfigurations,
      malicious activity, and other types of security events. Organizations can choose to use findings from operational reviews for
      their assessments.
