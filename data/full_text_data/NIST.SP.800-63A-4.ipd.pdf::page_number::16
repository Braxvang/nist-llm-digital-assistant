362   2.   Introduction
363   This section is informative.
364   One of the challenges of providing online services is being able to associate a set of
365   activities with a single, specific individual. While there are situations where this is
366   not necessary - such as when anonymity or pseudonymity is desirable - there are other
367   situations where it is important to reliably establish an association with a real-life
368   subject. Examples of this include accessing some government services or executing
369   financial transactions. There are also situations where association with a real-life
370   subject is required by regulations (e.g., the financial industry’s ‘Know Your Customer’
371   requirements) or to establish accountability for high-risk actions (e.g., changing the
372   release rate of water from a dam).
373   This guidance defines identity proofing as the process of establishing, to some degree
374   of certainty or assurance, a relationship between a subject accessing online services and
375   a real-life person. This document provides guidance for Federal Agencies, third-party
376   Credential Service Providers (CSP), and other organizations that provide identity proofing
377   services.
378   The following list states which sections of this document contain normative language
379   and which contain non-normative, informative language. Where needed to help clarify
380   specific requirements, normative sections often include informative explanations. See the
381   “Requirements Notation and Conventions” section of this document for clarification on
382   which statements are normative and which are not.
