     information system owners whose systems will implement or use the common security
     controls); and
•    The results from the assessment of the common security controls can be used to support the
     security certification and accreditation processes of organizational information systems where
     the controls have been applied. 22
The identification of common security controls is most effectively accomplished as an
organization-wide exercise with the involvement of the chief information officer, senior agency
information security officer, authorizing officials, information system owners/program managers,
information owners, and information system security officers. The organization-wide exercise
considers the categories of information systems within the organization in accordance with FIPS
199 (i.e., low-impact, moderate-impact, or high-impact information systems) and the minimum
security controls necessary to protect the operations and assets supported by those systems (see
baseline security controls in Section 2.2). For example, common security controls can be
identified for all low-impact information systems by considering the baseline security controls for
that category of information system. Similar exercises can be conducted for moderate-impact and
high-impact systems as well.

Many of the security controls needed to protect an information system (e.g., contingency planning
controls, incident response controls, security training and awareness controls, personnel security
controls, physical and environmental protection controls, and intrusion detection controls) may be
excellent candidates for common security control status. By centrally managing the development,
implementation, and assessment of the common security controls designated by the organization,
security costs can be amortized across multiple information systems. Security controls not
designated as common controls are considered system-specific controls and are the responsibility
of the information system owner. Security plans for individual information systems should
clearly identify which security controls have been designated by the organization as common
security controls and which controls have been designated as system-specific controls.

Organizations may also assign a hybrid status to security controls in situations where one part of
the control is deemed to be common, while another part of the control is deemed to be system-
specific. For example, an organization may view the IR-1 (Incident Response Policy and
Procedures) security control as a hybrid control with the policy portion of the control deemed to
be common and the procedures portion of the control deemed to be system-specific. Hybrid
security controls may also serve as templates for further control refinement. An organization may
choose, for example, to implement the CP-2 (Contingency Planning) security control as a master
template for a generalized contingency plan for all organizational information systems with
individual information system owners tailoring the plan, where appropriate, for system-specific
issues.

Information system owners are responsible for any system-specific issues associated with the
implementation of an organization’s common security controls. These issues are identified and
described in the system security plans for the individual information systems. The senior agency
information security officer, acting on behalf of the chief information officer, should coordinate
with organizational officials (e.g., facilities managers, site managers, personnel managers)
responsible for the development and implementation of the designated common security controls
to ensure that the required controls are put into place, the controls are assessed, and the

systems.
