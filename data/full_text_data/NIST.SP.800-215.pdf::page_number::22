NIST SP 800-215                                                              Guide to a Secure Enterprise
November 2022                                                                        Network Landscape

       described in Section 3.4.1) and taking corrective action to address the drift help to
       maintain the necessary security posture for the enterprise networking environment.
   •   The DevSecOps paradigm consisting of CI/CD pipelines invokes the network
       provisioning tool (IaC code generator) to automate the initial deployment and subsequent
       reconfiguration of the networking infrastructure. Since the pipelines have a built-in audit
       process, the changes in network configuration are automatically captured in the audit,
       which enables the enterprise to demonstrate corporate security policy compliance and
       regulatory policy compliance for their networks where applicable.
   •   Testing the code (IaC code) generated by IaC tools (and invoked by the CI/CD pipeline
       code that deploys the infrastructure using IaC in the DevSecOps process) ensures that
       security policies are consistently and uniformly applied across the entire enterprise
       networking infrastructure (i.e., multiple cloud services).
   •   The advantage of having plug-ins for defining network provisioning for different public
       cloud provider environments is that they can be used to customize the observability tools
       used for network monitoring for each of those cloud services that the enterprise has
       subscribed to [17].

       Networking Appliances as Services
Another trend in the enterprise network landscape is that a portion of network infrastructure can
be obtained from third-party providers as a leased service called a network as a service (NaaS).
This service is offered using technologies such as enterprise 5G and edge computing. The
advantages of NaaS are:
   •   Just like subscriptions to SaaS and IaaS, it reduces capex costs for the enterprise.
   •   It is flexible and scalable since it is software-defined and virtualized.
   •   As a consequence of the previous advantage, quality of service (QoS) requirements of
       diverse applications can be met by creating customized traffic flow for each application
       type [18].
   •   New applications that require an increased network footprint can be quickly introduced to
       the enterprise, thus facilitating agile business diversification.
However, they are limited point security solutions rather than comprehensive solutions that
address all aspects of enterprise security.
