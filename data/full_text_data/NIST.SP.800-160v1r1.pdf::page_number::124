F.2.3. Assurance Needs
Assurance is a need that is to be engineered and satisfied similar to the need to engineer the
system capability to satisfy specified capability needs. Assurance needs for trustworthy secure
systems are grounded in the concerns of loss and adverse effects due to intentional and
unintentional adversity (Commensurate Trustworthiness, Substantiated Trustworthiness,
Commensurate Rigor). Assurance needs include the evidence-basis for reasoning, the degree of
rigor to acquire and interpret the evidence, and the selection of the methods, tools, and processes
used throughout the system life cycle. Similar to capability and performance needs, assurance
needs, expectations, priorities, and constraints should be expressed as system requirements and
achieved, tracked, and maintained within the systems engineering effort.


                                   CONFIDENCE MAY BE NEGATIVE
            Assurance evidence can support a conclusion that a stated claim is not achieved
            or that there is an insufficient basis to conclude that the claim is supported or
            not supported. In either case, the assurance is negative relative to the goal of
            substantiating the claim. That is, the system or some part of the system is not
            sufficiently trustworthy and should not be trusted relative to its specified
            function without further action.




Assurance needs determine the type of evidence and the rigor associated with the activities,
methods, and tools used to acquire the evidence to satisfy the following cases:
•   What is to be accomplished in the systems engineering effort: The realization of the design
    for a secure system
•   The means to conduct the systems engineering effort: The methods, processes, and tools
    employed (driven by rigor and assurance objectives) to realize the design for a secure system
•   The results of the systems engineering effort: The substantiated effectiveness of the realized
    design of the secure system

Assurance needs can vary and constitute a trade space that must be managed similar to how
capability and performance needs can vary. The degree of rigor is the primary means of varying
assurance. As shown in Figure 17, a direct relationship exists between the degree of rigor and
assurance and the stakeholder’s assessment of the effects of asset loss. The assurance trade space
includes the following considerations:
•   Cost, schedule, and performance
•   Architecture and design decisions
•   Selection of technology and solutions
•   Selection and employment of methods and tools
•   Qualifications necessary for subject-matter experts
