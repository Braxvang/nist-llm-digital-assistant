SP 800-89                                                                 November 2006



      2. Cooperative generation by the owner and a TTP. The intended owner generates
         the key pair with the assistance of a TTP using an Approved method.
      3. Intended owner validation. The intended owner performs an explicit public key
         validation (see Section 5.3) and receives an indication of validity.
      4. TTP validation. The intended owner receives assurance that a TTP (trusted by the
         intended owner) has performed a successful public key validation on the intended
         owner’s public key for which assurance is to be obtained (see Section 5.3) and
         received an indication of validity. The TTP shall provide the public key
         validation result to the intended owner.
      5. TTP generation. The intended owner receives assurance when a TTP (trusted by
         the intended owner) generates the key pair and provides it to the intended owner.
         This method is not preferred, since the TTP will know the private key and must be
         trusted not to masquerade as the owner. However, if used, this method should
         include public key validation by the owner or TTP (method 3 or method 4).
The owner, or an agent trusted to act on the owner’s behalf, shall know which method(s)
of assurance were used in order to determine that the provided assurance is sufficient and
appropriate to meet the owner’s requirements.

5.2      Verifier Assurances of Public Key Validity
A verifier shall obtain assurance of the validity of a claimed signatory’s public key using
one or more of the following methods; the first two methods are preferred.
      1. Verifier validation: The verifier performs an explicit public key validation as
         described in Section 5.3 and receives an indication of validity.
      2. TTP assurance of validity: The verifier receives assurance from a TTP (i.e.,
         trusted by the verifier) that the TTP has performed an explicit public key
         validation as described in Section 5.3 and received an indication of validity.
      3. TTP assurance of public key generation or regeneration: The verifier receives
         assurance when a TTP (trusted by the verifier) has generated or regenerated the
         public key using trusted routines and has checked the consistency of the key pair.
         This method may impact the non-repudiation property that could be desired for
         some signatures, as the TTP will know the private key and must be trusted not to
         masquerade as the owner.
The verifier, or an agent trusted by the verifier, shall know which method(s) of assurance
were used in order for the verifier to determine that the provided assurance is sufficient
and appropriate to meet the verifier’s requirements.

5.3      (Explicit) Public Key Validation
Public key validation is the process of checking the arithmetic characteristics of the
public key. Public key validation does not require knowledge of the associated private
key; therefore, it may be performed by anyone at any time. Section 5.3.1 specifies the
method for full public key validation for DSA. Section 5.3.2 specifies the method for full
public key validation for ECDSA. At present, there is no method defined for full public
