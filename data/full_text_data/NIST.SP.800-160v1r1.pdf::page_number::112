E.21. Minimize Detectability
Principle: The design of the system minimizes the detectability of the system as much as
practicable.
Note: A system that is not discoverable, observable, or trackable by an adversarial threat or exposed to
such a threat is less prone to a targeted attack. Minimizing detectability drives engineering design
decisions to eliminate or reduce exposures such as unnecessary interfaces, access points, footprints, and
emanations, thereby reducing susceptibility to adversarial threat actions. Interfaces and access points have
the effect of exposing the system to intentional adversity (i.e., attacks) and unintentional adversity (i.e.,
faults, errors, incidents, accidents). Yet interfaces and access points are necessary to compose system
elements to deliver required capabilities, and duplicating interfaces and access points is needed to avoid
single points of failure. System design must balance the need for interfaces with the susceptibility that
results from the interface being exposed, discovered, and observed. Every interface, whether internal or
external, constitutes an exposure that must be considered.
Minimizing detectability reduces the ability of an adversary to observe and discover information about the
system to craft and execute attacks. This includes detecting a system’s location, presence, and movement
(e.g., due to emissions, signatures, or footprints). Ways by which a system may be detected include heat
emission, electronic magnetic (EM) emissions, sound, vibrations, reflecting radar waves or light, response
to stimulus (e.g., a response to an Internet Control Message Protocol [ICMP] echo request or “ping”), and
software traces and thrown exceptions. Specific forms or means to minimize detectability include
camouflage, stealth, low probability of intercept/low probability of detect (LPI/LPD) waveforms (for
radios), and frequency hopping.

E.22. Protective Defaults
Principle: The default configuration of the system provides maximum protection effectiveness.
Note: The configuration of the system includes the parameters for system functions, data, interfaces, and
resources that determine how the system behaves and the outcomes it produces. Protective defaults
guarantee that the “as shipped” system configuration and parameters prioritize the achievement of loss
control objectives over the ability to deliver a required system capability and performance without
dependence on human intervention. Protective defaults require conscientious action to establish the
system configuration and parameters that deliver the required capability and performance in a manner that
provides Commensurate Protection against loss. Protective default configurations for systems include
constituent subsystems, components, and mechanisms. The principles of Protective Failure, Protective
Recovery, and Continuous Protection parallel this principle to provide the ability to detect and recover
from failure.

E.23. Protective Failure
Principle: A failure of a system element neither results in an unacceptable loss nor invokes
another loss scenario.
