                                                   SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



•   Checklist item 34: A parent zone must have an emergency contact method made available to its
    delegated child subzones in case of emergency KSK rollover. There also should be a secure
    means of obtaining the new KSK.

•   Checklist item 35: Periodic re-signing should be scheduled before the expiration field of the
    RRSIG RRs found in the zone. This is to reduce the risk of a signed zone being rendered bogus
    because of expired signatures.

•   Checklist item 36: The serial number in the SOA RR must be incremented before re-signing the
    zone file. If this operation is not done, secondary name servers may not pick up the new
    signatures because they are refreshed purely on the basis of the SOA serial number mismatch.
    The consequence is that some security-aware resolvers will be able to verify the signatures (and
    thus have a secure response) but others cannot.
