NIST SP 800-186                                                  Discrete Logarithm-based Cryptography:
February 2023                                                          Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters

•   Appendix B: Relationship Between Curve Models – This appendix details how different
    curve models are related and how the coordinates of a point and the domain parameters of a
    curve in one curve model relate to those in another curve model.
•   Appendix C: Generation Details for Recommended Elliptic Curves – This appendix
    describes the cryptographic criteria that guided the selection of suitable elliptic curves and
    the process by which one of many such suitable elliptic curves is selected.
•   Appendix D: Elliptic Curve Routines – This appendix details elementary routines for
    elliptic curves, such as verification that these curves are indeed well-formed, and point
    compression.
•   Appendix E: Auxiliary Functions – This appendix covers mathematical functions that are
    used to describe elliptic curve operations and representation conversions, such as inversion
    and taking square roots.
•   Appendix F: Data Conversion – This appendix documents the detailed procedure for the
    conversion of data elements, such as integers, field elements, bit strings, octet strings, and
    elliptic curve points.
•   Appendix G: Implementation Aspects – This appendix discusses the various
    implementation aspects of binary curves, including conversions between different field
    representations. For prime curves, it indicates how the special form of the underlying prime
    field aids in efficient modular reduction.
•   Appendix H: Other Allowed Elliptic Curves – This appendix lists other elliptic curves that
    may be used for interoperability reasons.
•   Appendix I: Symbols, Abbreviations, and Acronyms
•   Appendix J: Glossary
