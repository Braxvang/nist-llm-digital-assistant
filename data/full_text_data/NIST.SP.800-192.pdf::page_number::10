                                                                                             resources against inappropriate or undesired user access. From a business perspective, this
                                                                                             objective could just as well be described in terms of the optimal sharing of information to users
                                                                                             and applications. However, a greater degree of sharing may get in the way of resource protection,
                                                                                             so a sufficiently fine-grained AC policy should enable selective sharing of information where in
