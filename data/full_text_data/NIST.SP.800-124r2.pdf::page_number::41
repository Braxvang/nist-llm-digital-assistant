NIST SP 800-124r2                                                 Guidelines for Managing the Security

4.3.10.        User Education
Security is everyone’s responsibility. The user cannot solely depend on the EMM and other
third-party apps to secure their device and enterprise data. User awareness is important because
the device user plays a vital role in securing the enterprise’s information. Understanding the
importance of securing the device and how to contribute to that security is important for both the
user and the enterprise.
Providing effective ways to teach users how to protect their mobile devices is essential to
understanding the importance of security mechanisms and how to apply them. This may include
constant reminders of security practices via posted signage. The following are some examples of
mobile device security on which device users should be trained:
   •   How to identify phishing attacks.
   •   How to properly manage authentication credentials.
   •   The organization’s privacy policy and the personal information collected.
   •   How to identify malicious EMM profiles or other malicious applications.
   •   Why apps should only be installed from trusted sources.
   •   Why it is important to rapidly perform OS and application updates.
If the device users are not educated on how to properly secure their mobile devices, this
oversight could endanger enterprise and user information. That’s why user education is essential
for enabling users to do their part in securing their mobile devices for themselves and the
enterprise.
Mobile device and EMM administrators also require proper security training. Mobile security
technologies often include instructional training material to ensure that mobile administrators
know how to use the technology and that security controls are properly applied. The enterprise
may want to identify the Workforce Categories and Specialty Areas from the National Initiative
for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NIST SP 800-181)
[46] that are of interest and applicable to the enterprise’s needs. Through identifying the
Workforce needs, the enterprise will be able to understand the necessary knowledge, skills, and
abilities for a mobile device/EMM administrator.
Threats Addressed: Credential theft via phishing, installation of malicious developer and EMM
profiles, mobile malware, exploitation of supply chain vulnerabilities, information loss due to
insecure lock screen, user privacy violations, data loss via synchronization, shadow IT usage,
exploitation of vulnerabilities within the underlying EMM platform, insider threat

4.3.11.        Mobile Device Security Policies
The development of security policies is vital to establishing a prominent security posture through
well-defined procedures and governance. The purpose of security policies is to provide a clear
course of action for organizations to follow when deploying new technologies and remediating
issues or other occurrences. Mobile device security policies can be established by performing a
threat modeling exercise or risk assessment to understand the attack landscape and plan
according to an organization’s specific security needs.
