2.3.6. Physical Access Control Systems
A physical access control system (PACS) is a type of physical security system designed to
control access to an area. Unlike standard physical barriers, physical access control can control
who is granted access, when the access is granted, and how long the access should last.
An access point is the entrance or barrier where access control is required. Some common
physical access control examples of access points are doors and locks, security gates, turnstiles,
and vehicular gate arms. Depending on the type of facility, there can be a single access point
(e.g., for high-security areas) or many (e.g., for a large office building).
An identification (ID) or personal credential is used to identify the authorized user trying to gain
access to the area or facility. A PACS often requires a user to have credentials to gain entrance to
a facility or access sensitive data. Examples of identification credentials include simple controls
(e.g., PIN codes, passwords, key fobs, key cards) and more advanced credentials (e.g., encrypted
badges, mobile credentials). Identification credentials allow the system to know who is
attempting to gain access and to maintain access logs.
Readers and/or keypads are typically located at the access point. The reader reads the data and
sends it to a door controller to validate the credential and determine whether access should be
authorized. If a keypad or biometric reader is also required (i.e., for multi-factor authentication),
the user will enter their PIN or perform the biometric scan following their credential scan. An
example of a PACS is shown in Fig. 10.

In this example, the door controller receives credential data from the reader and verifies the
identification credential. If the credential is approved by the access control server, the control
panel transmits the command to authorize access and unlock the door. If the credential is denied,
the door will remain locked, and the user will not be able to gain entry. All access attempts are
logged by the door controller(s) and, ultimately, the access control server. The access control
