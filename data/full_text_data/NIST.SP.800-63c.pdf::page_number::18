                                                                                             As shown in Figure 5-2, manual registration involves three steps:

                                                                                                   1. The RP’s system administrator shares the RP’s attributes with the IdP’s system
                                                                                                      administrator, who associates those attributes with the RP.
                                                                                                   2. The IdP’s system administrator shares the IdP’s attributes with the RP’s system
                                                                                                      administrator, who associates those attributes with the IdP.
                                                                                                   3. The IdP and RP then communicate using a standard federation protocol.
