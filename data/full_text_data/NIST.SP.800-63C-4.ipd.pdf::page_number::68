1714   This section is informative.

1715   9.1. Minimizing Tracking and ProÔ¨Åling
1716   Federation offers numerous benefits to RPs and subscribers, but requires subscribers to
1717   have trust in the federation participants. Sec. 5 and Sec. 6.2.5 cover a number of technical
1718   requirements, the objective of which is to minimize privacy risks arising from increased
1719   capabilities to track and profile subscribers. For example, a subscriber using the same IdP
1720   to authenticate to multiple RPs allows the IdP to build a profile of subscriber transactions
1721   that would not have existed absent federation. The availability of such data makes it
1722   vulnerable to uses that may not be anticipated or desired by the subscriber and may inhibit
1723   subscriber adoption of federated services.
1724   Sec. 5.5 requires IdPs to use measures to maintain the objectives of predictability
1725   (enabling reliable assumptions by individuals, owners, and operators about PII and
1726   its processing by an information system) and manageability (providing the capability
1727   for granular administration of PII, including alteration, deletion, and selective
1728   disclosure) commensurate with privacy risks that can arise from the processing of
1729   attributes for purposes other than identity proofing, authentication, authorization, or
1730   attribute assertions, related fraud mitigation, or to comply with law or legal process
1731   [NISTIR8062].
1732   IdPs may have various business purposes for processing attributes, including providing
1733   non-identity services to subscribers. However, processing attributes for different purposes
1734   from the original collection purpose can create privacy risks when individuals are not
1735   expecting or comfortable with the additional processing. IdPs can determine appropriate
1736   measures commensurate with the privacy risk arising from the additional processing.
1737   For example, absent applicable law, regulation or policy, it may not be necessary to
1738   get consent when processing attributes to provide non-identity services requested by
1739   subscribers, although notices may help subscribers maintain reliable assumptions about
1740   the processing (predictability). Other processing of attributes may carry different privacy
1741   risks that call for obtaining consent or allowing subscribers more control over the use
1742   or disclosure of specific attributes (manageability). Subscriber consent needs to be
1743   meaningful; therefore, when IdPs do use consent measures, they cannot make acceptance
1744   by the subscriber of additional uses a condition of providing the identity service.
1745   Consult the SAOP if there are questions about whether the proposed processing falls
1746   outside the scope of the permitted processing or the appropriate privacy risk mitigation
1747   measures.
1748   Sec. 5.5 also encourages the use of technical measures to provide disassociability
1749   (enabling the processing of PII or events without association to individuals or devices
1750   beyond the operational requirements of the system) and prevent subscriber activity
