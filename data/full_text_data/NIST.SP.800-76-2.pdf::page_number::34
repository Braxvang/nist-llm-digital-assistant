NORMATIVE NOTES:
1. The entire record length plus the CBEFF header and CBEFF signature block length must be less than or equal to size
specified in NIST Special Publication 800-73-4. A single image of size 3K, or two images of each of size 3K, will fit in
this container. These sizes refer to the JPEG 2000 compressed iris image. JPEG 2000 implementations shall be
executed with a bit rate input value that corresponds to a 3Kilobyte target result. Higher bit rates and higher sizes are
allowed.
2. The specification of a Type 7 image requires that the image captured from the camera has sufficient margin around
the iris to support the strict (0.6R, 0.2R) margin requirements of Image Type 7. During enrollment, client capture
software might usefully display the result with a prototypical overlay.
3. If any captured iris has diameter outside of the range [160,280] pixels, see Section 6.7.1.3.
4. The record should include a single iris. This recommendation exists because one iris can easily satisfy 1:1
comparison accuracy objectives [IREX-III] and, moreover, a single eye will be read faster and its digital signature can
be accessed and verified faster. Two eyes will be useful if one of the images is somehow of poor quality, or if one eye
is somehow occasionally unavailable for authentication. Quality control of the PIV Card imagery is imperative.

6.3.2                          Special case for individuals whose eyes cannot be captured
In cases where an Agency elects to place iris records on PIV Cards, there may be a few instances where iris images
cannot be captured (for example, due to rare medical conditions). In these cases the Card should nevertheless be
populated with the special "null" iris record of Table 10. This defines an empty but conformant instance of [IRISSTD]
with an image of width and height equal to 1 pixel. The reason for doing this is to ensure that a cryptographically
signed record exists on the PIV Card where it should. Implementations shall check the digital signature and shall
reject all iris-based attempts at authentication
