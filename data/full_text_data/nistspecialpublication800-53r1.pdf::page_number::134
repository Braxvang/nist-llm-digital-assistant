Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1             Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________

SC-10     NETWORK DISCONNECT

          Control:The information system terminates a network connection at the end of a session or after
          [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of inactivity.
                               The organization applies this control within the context of risk
          Supplemental Guidance:
          management that considers specific mission or operational requirements.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW Not Selected              MOD SC-10                 HIGH SC-10



SC-11     TRUSTED PATH

          Control: The information system establishes a trusted communications path between the user and
          the following security functions of the system: [Assignment: organization-defined security
          functions to include at a minimum, information system authentication and reauthentication].
          Supplemental Guidance: A trusted path is employed for high-confidence connections between the
          security functions of the information system and the user (e.g., for login).
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW Not Selected              MOD Not Selected          HIGH Not Selected



SC-12     CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY ESTABLISHMENT AND MANAGEMENT

          Control:When cryptography is required and employed within the information system, the
          organization establishes and manages cryptographic keys using automated mechanisms with
          supporting procedures or manual procedures.
                               NIST Special Publication 800-56 provides guidance on cryptographic key
          Supplemental Guidance:
          establishment. NIST Special Publication 800-57 provides guidance on cryptographic key
          management.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW Not Selected              MOD SC-12                 HIGH SC-12
