developed and implemented for vulnerability management throughout the life cycle of the
components.

6.2.4.1.       Least Functionality (PR.IP-1)
The principle of least functionality involves configuring systems to only provide essential
functions and services. Some default functions and services may not be necessary to support
essential organizational missions, functions, or operations. These functions include network ports
and protocols, software, and services.
Supplemental guidance can be found in the following document:
   •   NIST SP 800-167, Guide to Application Whitelisting
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Systems and devices in the OT environment include many functions and
            services that are unnecessary for their proper operation, some of which
            may be enabled by default and without the organization’s knowledge.
            Any functions or services that are not required for proper operation
            should be disabled to reduce exposure.
            Care should be taken when disabling these functions and services, as
            unintended impacts may result if a critical function or service is
            unknowingly disabled (e.g., disabling all external communications to a
            PLC may also disable the ability to communicate with associated HMIs).
            Devices should be subjected to extensive testing before being deployed
            on the OT network.

6.2.4.2.       Configuration Change Control (Configuration Management) (PR.IP-3)
Configuration management helps ensure that systems are deployed and maintained in a secure
and consistent state to reduce risks from outages due to configuration issues and security
breaches through improved visibility and tracking of changes to the system. In addition,
configuration management can detect improper configurations before they negatively impact
performance, safety, or security. Configuration management tools enable an asset owner to
establish and maintain the integrity of system hardware and software components by controlling
the processes for initializing, changing, monitoring, and auditing the configurations of the
components throughout the system life cycle.
Supplemental guidance for configuration management can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-128, Guide for Security-Focused Configuration Management of
       Information Systems
   •   NIST SP 1800-5, IT Asset Management
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should document the approved baseline configuration for
            their OT devices and establish the system development life cycle
