       NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                                                  Building a Cybersecurity and
       August 2023                                                                                             Privacy Learning Program

1355   3.1.2.3.             Identify the Knowledge and Skills Needed per Participant Type
1356   The primary knowledge and skillset for All Users is the ability to recognize cybersecurity and
1357   privacy risks, take appropriate actions to reduce harm to the organization, and report any
1358   incidents or events, when appropriate. All Users must be empowered and skilled in adhering to
1359   the organization’s Rules of Behavior and Acceptable Use Policies, which include guidance on
1360   how to use organization-provided devices and access network resources.
1361   Privileged users must possess the knowledge and skills to appropriately use systems that they
1362   have been given access to without introducing additional risks or harm to the organization. The
1363   training they receive must provide them with the ability to judge risks appropriately.
1364   It is critical to identify the necessary role-based knowledge and skills for those with significant
1365   cybersecurity or privacy responsibilities. The NICE Framework can be a useful resource for
1366   identifying the knowledge and skills related to specific cybersecurity learning objectives if the
1367   learning goal is clear. The NICE Framework includes detailed knowledge and skills statements at
1368   a high level related to the work that personnel perform in a variety of cybersecurity work roles.
1369   In addition, an organizational job analysis will be useful in determining what the learning
1370   objectives are for the program participants. For those with significant privacy responsibilities, the
1371   Learning Program Manager should consult with the privacy senior leadership of the organization
1372   (i.e., CPO or SAOP) for additional guidance on knowledge and skills required per individual.
1373   The Learning Program Manager may also need to consult with managers and subject-matter
1374   experts related to the learning goal for additional input on needed knowledge or skills 11.
1375   There are existing models for evaluating the tasks necessary for a particular person’s role, such
1376   as considering the complexity or difficulty of the task, its importance, and how frequently the
1377   task is performed. This is sometimes referred to as the “DIF model” for considering the relative
1378   difficulty, importance, and frequency of the task. It can be helpful for identifying the knowledge
1379   and skills that the CPLP should focus on when training those with significant cybersecurity or
1380   privacy responsibilities.

1381   3.1.2.4.             Assess Each Audience’s Current Knowledge and Skill Level
1382   After determining the knowledge and skills needed, the next step in the analysis phase is to
1383   determine what the audience segment already knows about the topic and skills they possess
1384   while keeping the learning goal in mind. The CPLP should focus on providing the learner with
1385   the requisite amount of new knowledge and skills while reinforcing existing knowledge and
1386   skills.
1387   There are several methods for determining the existing knowledge and skill set:
1388        •    Hold guided conversations and interviews with subject-matter experts, managers, system
1389             owners, and other organization personnel with relevant mission or business functions.
1390        •    Review recent job task analyses.
1391        •    Analyze events and related responses that may indicate skill levels.
