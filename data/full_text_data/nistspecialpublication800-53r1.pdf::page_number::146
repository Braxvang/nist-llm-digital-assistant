APPENDIX G

SECURITY CONTROL MAPPINGS
RELATIONSHIP OF SECURITY CONTROLS TO OTHER STANDARDS AND CONTROL SETS




T
       he mapping table in this appendix provides organizations with a general indication of
       Special Publication 800-53 security control coverage with respect to other frequently
       referenced security control standards and control sets. 51 The security control mappings are
not exhaustive and are based on a broad interpretation and general understanding of the control
sets being compared. The mappings are created by using the primary security topic identified in
each of the Special Publication 800-53 security controls and associated control enhancements (if
any) and searching for a similar security topic in the other referenced security control standards
and control sets. Security controls with similar functional meaning are included in the mapping
table. For example, Special Publication 800-53 contingency planning and ISO/IEC 17799 52
business continuity were deemed to have similar, but not exactly the same, functionality. In some
instances, similar topics are addressed in the security control sets but provide a different context,
perspective, or scope. For example, Special Publication 800-53 addresses information flow
broadly in terms of assigned authorizations for controlling access between source and destination
objects, whereas ISO/IEC 17799 addresses the information flow more narrowly as it applies to
interconnected network domains. And finally, the following cautionary notes are in order:
•    The granularity of the security control sets being compared is not always the same. This
     difference in granularity makes the security control mappings less precise in some instances.
     Therefore, the mappings should not be used as a “checklist” for the express purpose of
     comparing security capabilities or security implementations across information systems
     assessed against different control sets.
•    Some of the control sets referenced in this appendix (e.g., Department of Defense Instruction
     8500.2) are organized into groups of security controls with each group reflecting different
     levels of protection. When the security control groups reflect a hierarchical enhancement of
     another group, only the paragraph reference from the lowest hierarchical group where the
     security topic first occurred is listed in the mapping column.

Organizations are encouraged to use the mapping table only as a starting point for conducting
further analyses and interpretation of control similarity and associated coverage when comparing
disparate control sets.

   The security control mapping table includes references to: (i) ISO/IEC 17799: 2005, Code of Practice for
Information Security Management; (ii) NIST Special Publication 800-26, Security Self-Assessment Guide for
Information Technology Systems; (iii) GAO, Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual; (iv) Director of
Central Intelligence Directive 6/3 Policy and Manual, Protecting Sensitive Compartmented Information within
Information Systems; and (v) Department of Defense Instruction 8500.2, Information Assurance Implementation. The
designations in the respective columns indicate the paragraph identifier(s) or number(s) in the above documents where
the security controls, control objectives, or associated implementation guidance may be found.
52
  ISO/IEC 17799, Code of Practice for Information Security Management, is expected to be renamed to ISO 27002
consistent with the new designations for the ISO series of information security publications. ISO/IEC 17799 security
controls are also referenced in ISO/IEC 27001:2005 Specification for an Information Security Management System.
