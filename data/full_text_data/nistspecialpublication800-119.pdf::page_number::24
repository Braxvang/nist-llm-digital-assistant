                                                              GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


           longer be used as a source address in new communications, but packets sent from or to
           deprecated addresses are delivered as expected.

        Router. A node that sends and receives packets, and also accepts packets and forwards them
         on behalf of other nodes.

        Host. A node that may send and receive packets but does not forward packets for other nodes.

        Link. A communication facility or medium over which nodes can communicate at the link
         layer, i.e., the layer immediately below IPv6. Examples are Ethernets (simple or bridged);
         Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP); X.25, Frame Relay, or Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
         networks; and layer three (or higher) tunnels, such as tunnels over IPv4 or IPv6 itself.

        Link MTU. The maximum transmission unit (MTU), i.e., maximum packet size in octets,
         which can be conveyed over a link.

        Path MTU. The minimum link MTU of all the links in a path between a source node and a
         destination node.

        Upper Layer. A protocol layer immediately above IPv6. Examples are transport protocols
         such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP), control
         protocols such as Internet Message Control Protocol (ICMP), routing protocols such as Open
         Shortest Path First (OSPF), and internet or lower-layer protocols being tunneled over (i.e.,
         encapsulated in) IPv6 such as Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX), AppleTalk, or IPv6 itself.

        Interface. The point at which a node connects to a link. Unicast IPv6 addresses are always
         associated with interfaces.

        Packet. An IPv6 header plus payload.

        Neighbors. Nodes attached to the same link.

This section provides general information about IPv6 as a foundation for later sections. The rest of this
section is a resource for understanding the similarities and differences between IPv4 and IPv6, with a
focus on addressing (RFC 4291). Section 3.1 discusses IPv6 addresses, how the IPv6 address space is
used, and IPv6 address types and scope. This is followed by a review of IPv4 addressing and IPv4
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) addressing. Then IPv4 and IPv6 addressing are summarized and
compared. Section 3.2 covers IPv6 address allocation. IPv6 headers, their formats, and fields are
discussed in Section 3.3. Sections 3.4 through 3.7 cover extension headers, ICMPv6, IPv6 routing, and
IPv6 Domain Name System (DNS) respectively.

3.1   IPv6 Addressing

Described in RFC 4291, IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long and are written in what is called colon-delimited
hexadecimal notation. An IPv6 address is comprised of eight distinct numbers representing 16 bits each
and written in base-16 (hexadecimal or hex) notation. The valid hex digits are 0 through 9 and A through
F and together with the colon separator are the only characters that can be used for writing an IPv6
address. A comparison of IPv4 and IPv6 addressing conventions is illustrated in Figure 3-5 and discussed
in more detail in Section 3.1.7.

An example of an IPv6 address is:


                                                   3-2
