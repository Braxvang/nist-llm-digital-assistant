A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS




Large values of Vn (obs) indicate oscillation in the string of ε's which is too fast; small values indicate
oscillation which is too slow.

3.4 Test for the Longest Run of Ones in a Block
The length of the longest consecutive subsequence (run) of ones is another characteristic that can be used
for testing randomness. A string of length n, such that n = MN, must be partitioned into N substrings,
each of length M. For the test based on the length of the longest run of ones ν j within the j-th substring
of size M, K + 1 classes are chosen (depending on M). For each of these substrings, one evaluates the
frequencies ν 0 ,ν1,…,ν k (ν 0 + ν1 + … + ν K = N , i.e., the computed values of the longest run of ones
within each of these substrings belonging to any of the K + 1 chosen classes). If there are r ones and M -
r zeroes in the m-bit block, then the conditional probability that the€longest string of ones ν in this block
                                                                               r 
