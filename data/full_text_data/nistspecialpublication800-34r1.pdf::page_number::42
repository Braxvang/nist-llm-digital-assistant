                                                             CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



           Other plan testing (where coordination is identified, i.e., COOP, BCP).

To derive the most value from the test, the ISCP Coordinator should develop a test plan designed to
examine the selected element(s) against explicit test objectives and success criteria. The use of test
objectives and success criteria enable the effectiveness of each system element and the overall plan to be
assessed. The test plan should include a schedule detailing the time frames for each test and test
participants. The test plan should also clearly delineate scope, scenario, and logistics. The scenario
chosen may be a worst-case incident or an incident most likely to occur. It should mimic reality as
closely as possible.


Testing          Tests are evaluation tools that use quantifiable metrics to validate the operability of an
                 information system or system component in an operational environment. For example, an
                 organization could test call tree lists to determine if calling can be executed within
                 prescribed time limits; another test may be removing power from a system or system
                 component. A test is conducted in as close to an operational environment as possible; if
                 feasible, an actual test of the components or systems used to conduct daily operations for
                 the organization should be used. 27 The scope of testing can range from individual system
                 components or systems to comprehensive tests of all systems and components that support
                 an ISCP. Tests often focus on recovery and backup operations; however, testing varies
                 depending on the FIPS 199 impact level, the goal of the test, and its relation to a specific
                 ISCP.

3.5.2       Training

Training for personnel with contingency plan responsibilities should focus on familiarizing them with
ISCP roles and teaching skills necessary to accomplish those roles. This approach helps ensure that staff
is prepared to participate in tests and exercises as well as actual outage events. Training should be
provided at least annually. Personnel newly appointed to ISCP roles should receive training shortly
thereafter. Ultimately, ISCP personnel should be trained to the extent that that they are able to execute
their respective recovery roles and responsibilities without aid of the actual ISCP document. This is an
important goal in the event that paper or electronic versions of the plan are unavailable for the first few
hours, as a result of the disruption. Recovery personnel should be trained on the following plan elements:

           Purpose of the plan;
           Cross-team coordination and communication;
           Reporting procedures;
           Security requirements;
           Team-specific processes (Activation and Notification, Recovery, and Reconstitution Phases); and
           Individual responsibilities (Activation and Notification, Recovery, and Reconstitution Phases).

     Special consideration should be given to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) where systems typically have a need for real-time
     response and extremely high availability, predictability, and reliability. Thorough testing of these systems may not be possible
     during a single testing event. NIST SP 800-53, Appendix I, includes supplemental guidance for ICSs.
