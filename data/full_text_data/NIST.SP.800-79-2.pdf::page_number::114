                                  with the underlying certificate policy.

                                  Assessment
                                  Determine that:
                                    (i) in the case of lost, stolen, damaged or
                                        compromised credential the issuer has processes
                                        in place to revoke the Derived PIV Authentication
                                        certificate (review, observe, test).

                    MP(DC)-5      Upon Derived PIV Credential termination, the                DPCI          Commonly accepted security
                                  organization enforces a standard methodology of                           readiness measures
                                  updating systems of records to indicate Derived PIV
                                  Credential status, and this status is distributed
                                  effectively.
                                  Assessment
                                  Determine that:
                                      (i) the issuer has procedures to update information
                                          systems and disseminate information to indicate
                                          Derived PIV Credential termination (review);
                                     (ii) the organization’s information systems are
                                          updated to indicate Derived PIV Credential
                                          termination ( observe);
                                    (iii) the Derived PIV Credential termination status is
                                          distributed to remote access points as applicable
                                          (test).

                    MP(DC)-7      The organization has completed a lifecycle walkthrough      DPCI          SP 800-79-2, Section 5.4 -
                                  at one year intervals since the last authorization date,                  Monitoring Phase
                                  and the results are documented in a report to the DAO.

                                  Assessment
                                  Determine that:
                                     (i) the organization has completed a lifecycle
                                         walkthrough to cover initial issuance,
                                         maintenance and termination processes
                                         (interview);
                                    (ii) a lifecycle walkthrough has been completed at
                                         one year intervals since the last authorization
                                         date (interview);
                                   (iii) the results of the issuer lifecycle walkthrough
                                         have been documented and reviewed by the DAO
                                         (review, interview).

                              following applies: (i) communication between the issuer
                              and the cryptographic module in which the Derived PIV
                              Authentication private key is stored occurs only over
