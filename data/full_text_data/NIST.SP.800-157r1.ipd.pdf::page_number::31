843   B.1.2.1.   Derived PIV Application Data Object Containers and Associated Access
844              Rules
845   Section 3.5 of [SP800-73] Part 1 provides the container IDs and access rules for the
846   mandatory and optional data objects for a derived PIV application with the following
847   mappings:

                                  Table 1. Mapping of Data Objects

848   The detailed data model specifications for each of the data objects of the derived PIV
849   application are the same as the specifications for the corresponding data objects (mapped
850   per Table 1) of the PIV Card application as described in Appendix A of [SP800-73] Part 1,
851   except for the following:
852       • The security object for the derived PIV application is optional. It is required if the
853         optional discovery object, the optional key history object, or the optional pairing
854         code reference data container is present.
855       • The minimum capacity for the security object container SHALL be 3000 bytes in
856         order to allow space for the derived PIV credential issuer’s certificate.

857   B.1.3. Derived PIV Application Data Objects Representation
858   The ASN.1 object identifiers (OID) and “basic encoding rules – tag length value” (BER-
859   TLV) tags for the mandatory and optional data objects within the derived PIV application
860   are the same as for the corresponding data objects (mapped per Table 1) of the PIV Card
861   application, as described in Sec. 4 of [SP800-73] Part 1.

862   B.1.4. Derived PIV Application Data Types and Their Representation
863   This appendix provides a description of the data types used in the derived PIV application
864   command interface.
