                                                             GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



3.2.3     Detection Capabilities

IDPS technologies typically offer extensive, broad detection capabilities. Most products use a
combination of detection techniques, which generally supports more accurate detection and more
flexibility in tuning and customization. The types of events detected and the typical accuracy of detection
vary greatly depending on the type of IDPS technology. Most IDPSs require at least some tuning and
customization to improve their detection accuracy, usability, and effectiveness, such as setting the
prevention actions to be performed for particular alerts. Technologies vary widely in their tuning and
customization capabilities. Typically, the more powerful a product’s tuning and customization
capabilities are, the more its detection accuracy can be improved from the default configuration.
Organizations should carefully consider the tuning and customization capabilities of IDPS technologies
when evaluating products. Examples of such capabilities are as follows:

 Thresholds. A threshold is a value that sets the limit between normal and abnormal behavior.
  Thresholds usually specify a maximum acceptable level, such as x failed connection attempts in 60
  seconds, or x characters for a filename length. Thresholds are most often used for anomaly-based
  detection and stateful protocol analysis.
 Blacklists and Whitelists. A blacklist is a list of discrete entities, such as hosts, TCP or UDP port
  numbers, ICMP types and codes, applications, usernames, URLs, filenames, or file extensions, that
  have been previously determined to be associated with malicious activity. Blacklists, also known as
  hot lists, are typically used to allow IDPSs to recognize and block activity that is highly likely to be
  malicious, and may also be used to assign a higher priority to alerts that match entries on the
  blacklists. Some IDPSs generate dynamic blacklists that are used to temporarily block recently
  detected threats (e.g., activity from an attacker’s IP address). A whitelist is a list of discrete entities
  that are known to be benign. Whitelists are typically used on a granular basis, such as protocol-by-
  protocol, to reduce or ignore false positives involving known benign activity from trusted hosts.
  Whitelists and blacklists are most commonly used in signature-based detection and stateful protocol
  analysis.
 Alert Settings. Most IDPS technologies allow administrators to customize each alert type.
  Examples of actions that can be performed on an alert type include the following:

     –    Toggling it on or off 10

     –    Setting a default priority or severity level

     –    Specifying what information should be recorded and what notification methods (e.g., e-mail,
          pager) should be used

     –    Specifying which prevention capabilities should be used.
     Some products also suppress alerts if an attacker generates many alerts in a short period of time, and
     may also temporarily ignore all future traffic from the attacker. This is to prevent the IDPS from
     being overwhelmed by alerts.
 Code Viewing and Editing. Some IDPS technologies permit administrators to see some or all of the
  detection-related code. This is usually limited to signatures, but some technologies allow
  administrators to see additional code, such as programs used to perform stateful protocol analysis.

     In some IDPS technologies, turning off an alert also disables related detection capabilities; in other products, the detection
     processing is still done but an alert message is not generated. For technologies in the first category, shutting off unneeded
     alerts can reduce the load on the IDPS.
