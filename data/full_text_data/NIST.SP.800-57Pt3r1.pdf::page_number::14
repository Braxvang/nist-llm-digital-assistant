      Is negotiation mandatory, optional or unsupported?
      When negotiation is supported, who proposes the cryptographic mechanisms to be
       used, who selects the mechanisms, and what are the selection criteria?
      Is negotiation based on predefined cipher suites, or is each algorithm proposed
       independently?
      What is the granularity for the negotiation: just algorithms, both algorithms and
       key sizes, combinations of algorithms and/or key sizes, or protocol versions?
       What cannot be specified?
A good start at ensuring communication security in a multi-algorithm setting would be to:
      Limit the list of algorithms available to the application to those best suited for
       users of the system and those needed for interoperability,
      Adopt a policy that disallows sending messages using an inadequate level of
       protection,
      Adopt a policy explaining how to respond to messages received without adequate
       protection, and
      Adopt a policy explaining what to do when faced with a need for secure
       communications with a party using un-approved algorithms or inadequate key
       sizes.


1.3.3 Single or Multi-Use Keys
A major thrust from Part 1 of this Recommendation is that, in general, keys shall not be
used for multiple cryptographic purposes. For example, the same key shall not be used to
generate a digital signature and to establish other keying material (see [SP 800-57 Part 1,
Sec. 8.1.5.1.1.2 ] for the rare exceptions to this guidance). It is less clear as to whether a
digital signature key, for example, can be used only for a specific application (e.g.,
signing e-mail) or for multiple applications (e.g., for both signing e-mail and signing
documents). In some cases, it may be acceptable for an application to share keys with
other applications. In other cases, sharing keys may not be desirable. For example, best
practices indicate that a server’s TLS keys should not be used to support other
applications. Even where keys are used to perform the same cryptographic operation
(e.g., digital signatures), sharing keys may be inappropriate because one application
could be providing one service (e.g., authentication), while a second application could be
providing a different service (e.g., non-repudiation). It is important to remember that it
may be a bad idea to use keys for multiple applications.

An agency should perform a risk assessment when considering the use of the same key
for multiple applications.


1.3.4 Algorithm and Key Size Transition
Part 1 of this Recommendation provides timeframes for transitioning from algorithms
and key sizes currently in use by many applications and protocols in order to increase the
