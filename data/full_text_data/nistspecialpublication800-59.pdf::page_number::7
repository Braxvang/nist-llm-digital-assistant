2.0 Basis for Identification of National Security Systems
 The basis for the identification of 'national security systems' is the definition provided in
 law (44 U.S.C. 3542(b)(2), which was established by FISMA, Title III, Public Law 107­
 347, December 17, 2002):

“(2)(A) The term `national security system' means any information system (including
       any telecommunications system) used or operated by an agency or by a contractor

     (B) Subparagraph (A)(i)(V) does not include a system that is to be used for routine
     administrative and business applications (including payroll, finance, logistics, and
