Most Significant Bit(s)    The left-most bit(s) of a bit string.

NIST                       National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Nonce                      A value that is used only once within a specified context.

Permutation                An invertible function.

Plaintext                  The input data to the authenticated encryption function that is both
                           authenticated and encrypted.

Random Field               In the RBG-based construction of IVs, either a direct random string
                           or one of its successors.

RBG                        Random Bit Generator

Successor                  In the RBG-based construction of IVs, the result of one or more
                           applications of the appropriate incrementing function to a direct
                           random string.

XOR                        Exclusive-OR.
