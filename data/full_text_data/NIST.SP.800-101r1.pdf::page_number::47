5. Acquisition

       Acquisition is the process of imaging or otherwise obtaining information from a mobile device
       and its associated media. Performing an acquisition at the scene has the advantage that loss of
       information due to battery depletion, damage, etc. during transportation and storage is avoided.
       Off-site acquisitions unlike a laboratory setting may be challenging in finding a controlled
       setting in which to work with the appropriate equipment while satisfying additional
       prerequisites. For the purpose of this discussion, a laboratory environment is assumed
       throughout this chapter.

       The forensic examination begins with the identification of the mobile device. The type of
       mobile device, its operating system, and other characteristics determine the route to take in
       creating a forensic copy of the contents of the device. The type of mobile device and data to be
       extracted generally dictates which tools and techniques should be used in an investigation.

 5.1   Mobile Device Identification

       To proceed effectively, mobile devices need to be identified by the make, model, and service
       provider. If the mobile device is not identifiable, photographing the front, back and sides of the
       device may be useful in identifying the make, model and current state (e.g., screen lock) at a
       later time. Individuals may attempt to thwart specialists by altering the mobile device to
       conceal its true identity. Device alteration may range from removing manufacturer labels to
       filing off logos. In addition, the operating system and applications may be modified or in rare
       situations completely replaced, and appear differently as well as behave differently than
       expected. These modifications should be taken into consideration on a case-by-case basis.

       If the mobile device is powered on, the information appearing on the display may aid in mobile
       device identification. For example, the manufacturer’s or service provider’s name may appear
       on the display, or the screen layout may indicate the family of operating system used.
       Information such as the manufacturer’s label may be found in the battery cavity (e.g., make,
       model, IMEI, MEID). Removing the battery from the cavity of a mobile device, even when
       powered off, may affect its state, particularly the contents of volatile memory. Most mobile
       devices keep user data in non-volatile memory (i.e., NAND). If the mobile device is powered
       on, battery removal will power it off, possibly causing an authentication mechanism to trigger
       when powered back on.

       Other clues that allow identification of a mobile device include such things as: manufacturer
       logos, serial numbers, or design characteristics (e.g. candy bar, clam shell). Overall, knowing
       the make and model helps to limit the potential service providers, by differentiating the type of
       network the device operates over (i.e., GSM, non-GSM), and vice versa. Synchronization
       software discovered on an associated computer may also help to differentiate among operating
       system families. Further means of identification include the following:

              Device Characteristics – The make and manufacturer of a mobile device may be
               identified by its observable characteristics (e.g., weight, dimensions, and form factor),
               particularly if unique design elements exist. Various web sites contain databases of
               mobile device that may be queried based on selected attributes to identify a particular
