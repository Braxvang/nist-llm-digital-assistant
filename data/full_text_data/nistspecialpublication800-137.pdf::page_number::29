                                                            Federal Information Systems and Organizations




•    Assess ongoing security control effectiveness [ISCM step: Implement; RMF Steps: Assess, 29
     Monitor].

•    Take steps to respond to risk as needed (e.g., request additional or revised assessments,
     modify existing security controls, implement additional security controls, accept risk, etc.)
     based on the results of ongoing monitoring activities, assessment of risk, and outstanding
     items in the plan of action and milestones [ISCM step: Respond; RMF Step: Monitor].

•    Provide ongoing input to the security plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and
     milestones based on the results of the ISCM process [ISCM step: Respond; RMF Step: 6].
•    Report the security status of the information system including the data needed to inform Tiers
     1 and 2 metrics [ISCM step: Analyze/Report; RMF Steps: Assess, Monitor].
•    Review the reported security status of the information system to determine whether the risk to
     the system and the organization remains within organizational risk tolerances [ISCM step:
     Analyze/Report; RMF Steps: Authorize, Monitor].
3.1.4 DEFINE SAMPLE POPULATIONS
Organizations may find that collecting data from every object of every system within an
organization may be impractical or cost-prohibitive. Sampling is a methodology employable with
both manual and automated monitoring that may make ISCM more cost-effective. A risk with
sampling is that the sample population may fail to capture the variations in assessment outcomes
that would be obtained from an assessment of the full population. This could result in an
inaccurate view of security control effectiveness and organizational security status.

NIST SP 800-53A, as amended, describes how to achieve satisfactory coverage when
determining sample populations for the three named assessment methods: examine, interview,
and test. The guidelines in NIST SP 800-53A for basic, focused, and comprehensive testing30
addresses the need for a “representative sample of assessment objects” or a “sufficiently large
sample of assessment objects.” Statistical tools can be used to help quantify sample size.

NIST 800-53A provides guidelines to help address the general issue of sampling and particularly
that of coverage. In selecting a sample population, the coverage attribute is satisfied through
consideration of three criteria:

•    Types of objects - ensure sufficient diversity of types of assessment objects;
•    Number of each type - chose “enough” objects of each type to provide confidence that
     assessment of additional objects will result in consistent findings; and

•    Specific objects per type assessed - given all of the objects of relevance throughout the
     organization that could be assessed, include “enough” objects per type in the sample
     population to sufficiently account for the known or anticipated variance in assessment
     outcomes.

     Prior to initial authorization, the system is not included in the organization’s continuous monitoring program. This
     reference to RMF 4 is relevant after the system becomes operational, and is passing through Step 4 in support of
     ongoing authorization.
