D.1 Defense and National Security
Defense and national security operations protect and advance U.S. National Security interests
and, if deterrence fails, decisively defeat threats to those interests. Defense and national
security activities include military operations, border protection, and intelligence gathering.
Defense operations are subdivided into the following sub-elements:

       •   Strategic National and Theater Defense – Establishing national and multinational
           military objectives, sequencing initiatives, defining limits and assessing risks for the
           use of military and other instruments of national power, developing global plans or
           theater war plans to achieve these objectives, and providing military forces and other
           capabilities in accordance with strategic plans;

     the mission-based information type.
