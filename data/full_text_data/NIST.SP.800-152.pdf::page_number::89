                               the key-derivation method. Low and Moderate impact-level
                               systems shall use curve P-256 and SHA-256 for the default

                               108] as the default method, using SHA-256 as the hash
                               function for Low and Moderate impact-levels, and SHA-384
                               for High impact-levels.

  Note to the reader: While PKCS1 v1.5 [PKCS 1] is commonly used, it is not among the schemes that are
NIST-approved in [SP 800-56B].
