Special Publication 800-79-2                                             Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



A PCI or DPCI which out-sources services to an external provider must make sure that all
privacy-related requirements are satisfied and as such is responsible for ensuring that privacy
requirements are being met both internally and by every external service provider.

If an issuer is considering using PIV services set up by another organization, the operations plan
and associated documents, the authorization decision and evidence of implementation of FIPS
201-2 requirements of that issuer (PCI or DPCI service provider) must be reviewed by the
Designated Authorizing Official (DAO) of the issuer. Similarly, if an issuer is using the services
of an external service provider selectively for one or more of its processes, the provider’s
capability to meet FIPS 201-2 requirements for those processes must be reviewed as well. In
both cases, the information gathered as part of this review activity must be included in the
issuer’s assessment leading to authorization. Outsourced functions must be assessed prior to
authorization of an issuer.

2.4 Assessment and Authorization

[HSPD-12] mandates that identification credentials be “issued only by providers whose
reliability has been established by an official accreditation process.” This document contains
guidelines for satisfying the requirements for an official authorization and provides a
methodology that can be utilized to formally authorize an issuer. This methodology consists of
two major sets of activities–assessment and authorization. While assessment and authorization
are very closely related, they are two very distinct activities.

Assessment occurs before authorization and is the process of gathering evidence regarding an
issuer’s satisfaction of the requirements of FIPS 201-2, both at the organization and facility level.
Assessment activities include interviews with the issuer and the issuing facility’s personnel, a
review of documentation, observation of processes, and execution of tests to determine overall
reliability of the issuer. The result of the assessment is a report that serves as the basis for an
authorization decision. The report is also the basis for developing corrective actions for removing
or mitigating discovered deficiencies.

Distinct from assessment, authorization is the decision to permit the operation of the issuer once
it has been established that the requirements of FIPS 201-2 have been met and the risks regarding
security and privacy are acceptable. The individual making the authorization decision must be
knowledgeable of [HSPD-12] and aware of the potential risks to the organization’s operations,
assets, and personnel (e.g., applicants, issuing facility staff).

The assessment and the authorization are both carried out by the organization (as per Section 5.3)
that “owns” (i.e., manages, controls, or privately owns) the issuance of PIV Cards and/or
Derived PIV Credentials9. In order to make an informed, risk-based authorization decision, the
assessment process should seek to answer the following questions:

           Has the issuer implemented the requirements of FIPS 201-2 in the manner consistent with
            the standard?

    The trust in PIV Cards and Derived PIV Credentials stems from the guidelines in Task 6 of Section 5.3.
