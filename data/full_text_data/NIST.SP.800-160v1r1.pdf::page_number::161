NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                 Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

       MA-2.1 Monitor and review stakeholder requirements and incident and problem reports to
              identify security-relevant corrective, preventive, adaptive, additive, or perfective
              maintenance needs.
       Note: Security-relevant maintenance needs include those needs that are direct (e.g., an
       identified security incident) or indirect (e.g., considerations to securely address a maintenance
       need).
       MA-2.2 Record the security aspects of maintenance incidents and problems, and track their
              secure resolution.
       MA-2.3 Analyze the impact of the changes introduced by maintenance actions on the security
              aspects of the system and system elements.
       MA-2.4 Upon encountering faults that cause a system failure, securely restore the system to
              secure operational status.
       Note: Secure restoration means that the maintenance action itself does not worsen the secure
       state or condition of the system.
       MA-2.5 Securely correct anomalies (e.g., defects, errors, and faults), and replace or upgrade
              system elements.
       MA-2.6 Perform preventive maintenance by securely replacing or servicing system elements
              prior to failure.
       MA-2.7 Securely perform adaptive, additive, or perfective maintenance as required.

MA-3 PERFORM LOGISTICS SUPPORT
       MA-3.1 Perform the security aspects of acquisition logistics.
       MA-3.2 Perform the security aspects of operational logistics.
       MA-3.3 Implement mechanisms for the secure logistics needed during the life cycle.
       Note 1: These mechanisms enable secure packaging, handling, storage, and transportation.
       Note 2: These mechanisms aid in the prevention and detection of counterfeits, tampering,
       substitution, and redirection.
       MA-3.4 Confirm that the security aspects of logistics actions are implemented.
       Note: The security aspects of logistics actions satisfy both logistics protection concerns and the
       need to meet repair rates, replenishment levels, and planned schedules.

MA-4 MANAGE RESULTS OF MAINTENANCE AND LOGISTICS
       MA-4.1 Record the security aspects of maintenance and logistics results and any anomalies
              encountered.
       MA-4.2 Record maintenance and logistics security incidents and problems, and track their
              secure resolution.
