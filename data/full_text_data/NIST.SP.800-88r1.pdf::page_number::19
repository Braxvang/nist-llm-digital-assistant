NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                Guidelines for Media Sanitization


    2.6.3 Additional CE Considerations

    If the encryption key exists outside of the storage device (typically due to backup or
    escrow), there is a possibility that the key could be used in the future to recover data stored
    on the encrypted media.

    CE should only be used as a sanitization method when the organization has confidence that
    the encryption keys used to encrypt the Target Data have been appropriately protected.
    Such assurances can be difficult to obtain with software cryptographic modules, such as
    those used with software-based full disk encryption solutions, as these products typically
    store cryptographic keys in the file system or other locations on media which are accessible
    to software. While there may be situations where use of CE with software cryptographic
    modules is both appropriate and advantageous, such as performing a quick remote wipe on a
    lost mobile device, unless the organization has confidence in both the protection of the
    encryption keys, and the destruction of all copies of those keys in the sanitization process,
    CE should be used in combination with another appropriate sanitization method.

    Sanitization using CE should not be trusted on devices that have been backed-up or
    escrowed the key(s) unless the organization has a high level of confidence about how and
    where the keys were stored and managed outside the device. Such back-up or escrowed
    copies of data, credentials, or keys should be the subject of a separate device sanitization
    policy. That policy should address backups or escrowed copies within the scope of the
    devices on which they are actually stored.

    A list of applicable considerations, and a sample for how vendors could report the
    mechanisms implemented, is included in Appendix E. Users seeking to implement CE
    should seek reasonable assurance from the vendor (such as the vendor’s report as described
    in Appendix E) that the considerations identified here have been addressed and only use
    FIPS 140 validated cryptographic modules.

 2.7 Factors Influencing Sanitization and Disposal Decisions

Several factors should be considered along with the security categorization of the system
confidentiality when making sanitization decisions. The cost versus benefit tradeoff of a
sanitization process should be understood prior to a final decision. For instance, it may not be
cost-effective to degauss inexpensive media such as diskettes. Even though Clear or Purge may
be the recommended solution, it may be more cost-effective (considering training, tracking, and
verification, etc.) to destroy media rather than use one of the other options. Organizations retain
the ability increase the level of sanitization applied if that is reasonable and indicated by an
assessment of the existing risk.

Organizations should consider environmental factors including (but not limited to):

      What types (e.g., optical non-rewritable, magnetic) and size (e.g., megabyte, gigabyte,
       and terabyte) of media storage does the organization require to be sanitized?

      What is the confidentiality requirement for the data stored on the media?
