5.8       Data Backup

current operational system stored for future recovery efforts. This full backup is then kept with other
system backups. The procedures for conducting a full system backup are:

Provide appropriate procedures for ensuring that a full system backup is conducted within a reasonable
time frame, ideally at the next scheduled backup period. This backup should go offsite with the other
media in Section 5.7.

5.9       Event Documentation

It is important that all recovery events be well-documented, including actions taken and problems
encountered during the recovery and reconstitution effort, and lessons learned for inclusion and update to
this ISCP. It is the responsibility of each ISCP team or person to document their actions during the
recovery and reconstitution effort, and to provide that documentation to the ISCP Coordinator.

Provide details about the types of information each ISCP team member is required to provide or collect
for updating the ISCP with lessons learned. Types of documentation that should be generated and
collected after a contingency activation include:
         Activity logs (including recovery steps performed and by whom, the time the steps were initiated
          and completed, and any problems or concerns encountered while executing activities);
         Functionality and data testing results;
         Lessons learned documentation; and
         After Action Report.

Event documentation procedures should detail responsibilities for development, collection, approval, and
maintenance.

5.10      Deactivation

Once all activities have been completed and documentation has been updated, the {designated authority}
will formally deactivate the ISCP recovery and reconstitution effort. Notification of this declaration will
be provided to all business and technical POCs.
