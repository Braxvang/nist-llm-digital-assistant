Special Publication 800-79-2                                            Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                                         and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



are being added to the issuer organization. There may also be cases where one or more issuing
facilities cease operation. If this situation results in a PIV service identified in the operations plan
becoming unavailable, then the DAO must issue a Denial of Authorization to Operate (DATO -
See Section 2.9.3). On the other hand, if the issuer can continue to provide all services in the
operations plan, then the authorization decision letter has to be modified to exclude those issuing
facilities that have ceased operations (thus revising the authorization boundary). The required re-
authorization activities are at the discretion of the DAO and based on the extent and type of
change.

2.9.2 Interim Authorization to Operate (IATO)
If, after reviewing the results of the assessment phase, the DAO deems the discrepancies to be
significant, but there is an overarching necessity to allow the issuer to operate, an interim
authorization to operate (IATO) may be issued.13 An interim authorization to operate is rendered
to an issuer when the identified deficiencies are significant, but can be addressed in a timely
manner. These deficiencies must be documented so that they can be addressed during the
planning of corrective actions. An interim authorization is an authorization to operate under
specific terms and conditions. The DAO shall indicate exactly which facilities are included in
the IATO authorization decision during this interim period, along with any limitations or
restrictions imposed. The maximum duration of an IATO is three (3) months. A maximum of
two (2) consecutive IATOs may be granted. Failure to correct deficiencies after the expiration of
the second IATO must result in an issuance of a denial of authorization to operate (DATO) for
the issuer. The authorization boundary may be revised to exclude issuing facilities that exhibit
significant deficiencies in performing their functions. The IATO is transmitted to the OIMO.

An issuer is not considered authorized during the period of an IATO. When the deficiencies
have been corrected, the IATO should be replaced with an ATO. Significant changes in the
status of an issuer (e.g. addition of new issuing facilities) that occur during the IATO period shall
be reported immediately to the DAO.

2.9.3 Denial of Authorization to Operate (DATO)
If, after reviewing the results of the assessment phase, the DAO deems operation of the issuer to
be unacceptable, a denial of authorization to operate (DATO) shall be transmitted to the OIMO.
Failure to receive authorization to operate indicates that there are major deficiencies in reliably
meeting the requirements of FIPS 201-2 and its related documents. The issuer is not authorized
and must not be allowed to operate. If issuance services are currently in operation, all functions
must be halted including all operations at the any issuing facility. If an issuer was previously
authorized and had issued PIV Cards or Derived PIV Credentials under an ATO, the OIMO
along with the Issuing Facility Manager(s) should consider whether a revocation of PIV Cards
and their Derived PIV Credentials are necessary. The DAO and the Assessor should work with
the OIMO and Issuing Facility Manager(s) to ensure that proactive measures are taken to correct
the deficiencies.
