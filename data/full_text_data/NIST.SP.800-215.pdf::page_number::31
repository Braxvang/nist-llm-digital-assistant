NIST SP 800-215                                                           Guide to a Secure Enterprise

   •   The access level determined by the previous process is continuously reevaluated during
       the user session and recalibrated if required. As the context surrounding the identity
       changes in real time, so can the user’s entitlements [31].
   •   The attack surface is reduced by preventing lateral movement [32] through techniques
       like microsegmentation, as described in Section 5.1. With the increasing deployment of
       microservices, the inter-services resource requests (generator of east-west traffic)
       dominate external application requests (north-south traffic). Application of this principle
       thus secures east-west traffic.
In all security frameworks for current enterprise network environments, the common principles
that underlie application-specific requirements – such as low latency, high data transfer rates,
and high reliability – that were applicable in previous network landscapes remain the same.
