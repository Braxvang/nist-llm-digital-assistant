IT infrastructure maintenance information or information systems may be to deny mission-
critical IT resources to all affected organizations. The availability impact level associated
with denial-of-service to IT infrastructure maintenance information needed to respond to
emergencies or critical to public safety can be high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
IT infrastructure maintenance information is low.
C.3.5.5 Information Security Information Type

IT Security involves all functions pertaining to the securing of Federal data and systems through
the creation and definition of security policies, procedures and controls covering such services as
identification, authentication, and non-repudiation. The recommended security categorization
for the IT security information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of IT security
information on the ability of responsible agencies to secure Federal data and systems through the
creation and definition of security policies, procedures and controls covering such services as
identification, authentication, and non-repudiation. In most cases, the security policy,
procedures, and available controls are not particularly sensitive. Typically, the security
information is used in initializing and implementing the controls (e.g., passwords, cryptographic
keys) that need to be protected. In general, disclosure of the security policies, procedures, and
controls will result in only limited adverse effects on the confidentiality of system information
and processes.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The recommended provisional confidentiality impact
level recommended for IT security information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for IT
security information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to IT security information. Temporary
disruption of access to IT security information can usually be expected to have a limited
adverse effect on agency operations (including mission functions and public confidence in
the agency), agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
IT security information is low.
