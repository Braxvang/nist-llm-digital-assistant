CHAPTER 8                                                                         Security Planning


security plans for minor applications 52 are not required because the security controls
for those applications are typically provided by the GSS or MA in which they operate.
In those cases where the minor application is not connected to an MA or GSS, the
minor application should be briefly described in a GSS plan that either has a common
physical location or is supported by the same organization.

8.2   Security Planning Roles and Responsibilities
    Agencies should develop policy on the system security planning process. System
security plans are living documents that require periodic review, modification, and
plans of action and milestones (POA&M) for implementing security controls.
Procedures should be in place outlining who reviews the plans, keeps the plan
current, and follows up on planned security controls. In addition, procedures should
require that system security plans be developed and reviewed prior to proceeding
with the security certification and accreditation process for the system.
   During the security certification and accreditation process, the system security
plan is analyzed, updated, and accepted. The certification agent confirms that the
security controls described in the system security plan are consistent with the FIPS
199 security category determined for the information system, and that the threat
and vulnerability identification and initial risk determination is identified and
documented in the system security plan, risk assessment, or equivalent document.
The results of a security certification are used to reassess the risks, develop the
POA&Ms that are required to track remedial actions, and update the system security
plan, thus providing the factual basis for an authorizing official to render a security
accreditation decision. 53
    The roles and responsibilities in this section are specific to information system
security planning. Recognizing that agencies have widely varying missions and
organizational structures, there may be differences in naming conventions for
security planning-related roles and how the associated responsibilities are allocated
among agency personnel (e.g., multiple individuals filling a single role or one
individual filling multiple roles). 54,55

8.2.1 Chief Information Officer
   The chief information officer (CIO) 56 is the agency official responsible for
developing and maintaining an agency-wide information security program and has
the following system security planning responsibilities:



52
   NIST SP 800-37 defines a minor application as an application, other than major application, that
   requires attention to security due to the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or
   unauthorized access to or modification of the information in the application. Minor applications are
   typically included as part of a GSS.
53
   See NIST SP 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information
   Systems, and Chapter 11, Certification and Accreditation, of this guide for additional guidance on the
   C&A process.
54
   Caution should be exercised when one individual fills multiple roles in the security planning process to
   ensure that the individual retains an appropriate level of independence and remains free from conflicts
   of interest.
55
   See Chapter 2, Governance, Chapter 5, Capital Planning, Chapter 11, Certification, Accreditation, and
   Security Assessments, and Chapter 14, Configuration Management, of this guide for additional guidance
   on roles and responsibilities.
56
   When an agency has not designated a formal CIO position, the Federal Information Security
   Management Act (FISMA) requires the associated responsibilities to be handled by a comparable agency
   official.
