       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                     Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                            and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1608           walkthrough is intended to provide an accurate and holistic view of the issuer’s
1609           operations and reliability at a point in time. Any potential impacts to the reliability of the
1610           issuer’s operations and risks to the organization need to be documented and presented to
1611           the EIMO and the DAO.
1612                    Subtask 9.1: Observe all of the processes involved in getting a PIV Card or a
1613                    derived PIV credential, including those from sponsorship to maintenance.
1614                    Observe each process, and compare its controls against the applicable list of
1615                    required issuer controls. If an issuer has several facilities, this process needs to be
1616                    repeated using randomly selected issuing facilities.
1617                    Responsibility: EIMO (or designated appointee)
1618                    Guidance: As part of the walkthrough, the EIMO (or designated appointee)
1619                    observes the processes followed for new employees and contractors (if different)
1620                    as well any maintenance processes, such as termination, reissuance, or renewals.
1621                    The EIMO (or designated appointee) observes each process and compares it to the
1622                    documented steps for the issuer and the associated issuer controls. An annual
1623                    walkthrough is required until reauthorization is initiated.
1624                    Subtask 9.2: The results of the life cycle walkthrough are summarized in a report
1625                    to the DAO. The report highlights any deficiencies and the corrective actions that
1626                    need to be implemented to correct those deficiencies.
1627                    Responsibility: EIMO, DAO
1628                    Guidance: The EIMO (or designated appointee) documents the results of the
1629                    walkthrough, which are recorded in the assessment report template included in
1630                    Appendix E. All deficiencies need to be highlighted, and a plan for correcting
1631                    each deficiency needs to be documented. The DAO decides whether any
1632                    deficiency is significant enough to require a change of the issuer’s ATO status.
