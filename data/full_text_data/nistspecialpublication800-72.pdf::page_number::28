       backed up data on an identical device, which is used with ASRDisp for presentation purposes.
       The ASRDisp utility is part of the Windows Mobile Developer Power Toys suite.22

       Another means of presenting data is to use a Pocket PC emulator and the shared folder
       functionality available. Again, after device acquisition has taken place, examiners can export
       out individual files gleaned from the device to a specific folder present on the forensic
       workstation. The shared folder allows information to be imported and displayed via the
       emulator, giving examiners the ability to present relevant information virtually. Emulators for
       all versions of the Pocket PC operating system are available for downloading at the Microsoft
       site.23

       Where possible, established procedures should guide the technical process of acquisition, as
       well as the examination of evidence. However, some situations demand that specialized
       procedures and methods be applied. Procedures must be tested to ensure that the results
       obtained are valid and independently reproducible. The development and validation of the
       procedures should be documented and include the following steps [DOJ04]:

                Identifying the task or problem

                Proposing possible solutions

                Testing each solution on an identical test device and under known control conditions

                Evaluating the results of the test

                Finalizing the procedure
