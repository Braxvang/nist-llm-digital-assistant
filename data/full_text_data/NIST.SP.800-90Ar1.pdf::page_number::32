8.8 Prediction Resistance and Backtracking Resistance

Figure 7 depicts the sequence of DRBG internal states that result from a given seed. Some subset
of bits from each internal state are used to generate pseudorandom bits upon request by a user.
The following discussions will use the figure to explain backtracking and prediction resistance.
Suppose that a compromise occurs at Statex, where Statex contains both secret and non-secret
information.




                             Figure 7: Sequence of DRBG States
Backtracking Resistance: Backtracking resistance is provided relative to time T if there is
assurance that an adversary who has knowledge of the internal state of the DRBG at some time
subsequent to time T would be unable to distinguish between observations of ideal random
bitstrings and (previously unseen) bitstrings that were output by the DRBG prior to time T. This
assumes that the adversary is incapable of performing the work required to negate the claimed
security strength of the DRBG. Backtracking resistance means that a compromise of the DRBG
internal state has no effect on the security of prior outputs. That is, an adversary who is given
access to all of the prior output sequence cannot distinguish it from random output with less
work than is associated with the security strength of the instantiation; if the adversary knows
only part of the prior output, he cannot determine any bit of that prior output sequence that he
has not already seen with better than a 50-50 chance.
For example, suppose that an adversary knows Statex. Backtracking resistance means that:
   a. The output bits from State1 to Statex-1 cannot be distinguished from random output, and
   b. The prior internal state values themselves (State1 to Statex-1) cannot be recovered, given
      knowledge of the secret information in Statex.
Backtracking resistance can be provided by ensuring that the DRBG generation algorithm is a
one-way function. All DRBG mechanisms in this Recommendation have been designed to
provide backtracking resistance.
 Prediction Resistance: Prediction resistance means that a compromise of the DRBG internal
state has no effect on the security of future DRBG outputs. That is, an adversary who is given
access to all of the output sequence after the compromise cannot distinguish it from random
output with less work than is associated with the security strength of the instantiation; if the
adversary knows only part of the future output sequence, he cannot predict any bit of that future
output sequence that he does not already know (with better than a 50-50 chance).
For example, suppose that an adversary knows Statex. Prediction resistance means that:
   a. The output bits from Statex+1 and forward cannot be distinguished from an ideal random
      bitstring by the adversary, and
