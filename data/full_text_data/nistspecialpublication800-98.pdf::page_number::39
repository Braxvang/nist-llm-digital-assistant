                                                                                  SECTION 2: RFID TECHNOLOGY



Much like the DNS, the Root ONS is accessible by any Internet user. Some organizations may choose to
implement their own Local ONS that is not connected to the EPCglobal Root ONS. Using an
independent ONS limits the applications and users that can access it. This characteristic is a beneficial
feature for organizations that require their EPCs to remain confidential, but is overly restrictive for
organizations that expect large numbers of external users or that cannot anticipate a priori who will have
a legitimate need for the EPC records (e.g., individual retail consumers seeking support after purchase of
a tagged object).

2.5.3    Discovery Service

The EPCglobal Discovery Services are still in the early phases of development and use cases are still
being developed to better understand the needs and requirements for this service. The concept of the
EPCglobal Discovery Services is similar to ONS in that it is envisioned to return network addresses
where data related to an EPC can be found. However, the Root ONS only provides information regarding
where a particular tag was commissioned. It does not provide information regarding the history of a
particular tag’s transactions. Multiple entities along the supply chain would benefit from having quick
access to this information that ONS does not offer. Discovery services offer a potential mechanism to
make this information available over an inter-enterprise subsystem.

The EPCglobal Discovery Services can be viewed as a search engine that provides a means to locate the
network addresses of all EPCIS services that may have information about a specific EPC (not just the
EPCIS service of the EPC Manager). For instance, it is envisioned that the EPCglobal Discovery
Services will ultimately return multiple pointers from the multiple organizations that have collected
information about the tagged object at some point in the object’s life cycle. In addition, the EPCglobal
Discovery Services may provide a cache for selected EPCIS data and may enforce authorization policies
with respect to access of the aforementioned data. It is envisioned that more than one EPCglobal
Discovery Service may operate in parallel, and may compete against each other and/or cater to particular
audiences with specific information requirements.

2.6     Summary

RFID is an innovation in AIDC technology that provides significant advantages over earlier technology,
such as optical scanning of bar codes. These advantages include the ability to identify objects without
optical line of sight over significant distances and the ability to work reliably both indoors and outdoors.

The components of an RFID system can be categorized into three subsystems:

 The RF subsystem,
 The enterprise subsystem, and
 The inter-enterprise subsystem.
Every RFID system includes an RF subsystem, which is composed of (1) tags attached to or embedded in
objects and (2) readers that query the tags. Important characteristics of tags include their identifier
format, the source of their power, the radio frequencies over which they operate, their size and shape, and
additional functionality they support, such as security features and connections to environmental sensors.
Important characteristics of readers include their power output, duty cycle, antenna design, and interface
to the enterprise subsystem, which can be either wireless or wired. A wireless enterprise interface enables
the reader to be mobile. Important aspects of tag-reader communication include the singulation protocol,
the encoding scheme, and the distance over which tag and reader signals can be reliably received.
