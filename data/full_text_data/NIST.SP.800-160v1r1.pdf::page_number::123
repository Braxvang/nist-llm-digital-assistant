   synthesis of the constituent parts). It requires that assurance be a consideration at every step
   of design and implementation, from the smallest components to the final subsystem
   realization.
   -   The assurance case described in [30] is an example of structured reasoning (Section 4.3).
       Structured reasoning serves to fill the gaps associated with the axiomatic and analytic
       assurance approaches. Since synthetic assurance is based on the expert judgment of
       available evidence, it is not complete. However, synthetic assurance does further reduce
       uncertainty and, thus, reduces risk.

Assurance depends on the quality of the evidence used in arguments demonstrating that claims
about the system are satisfied. Assurance evidence can be obtained either directly through
measurement, testing, observation, or inspection or indirectly through analysis, including the
analysis of data obtained from measurement, testing, observation, or inspection. Evidence must
have sufficient quality in accuracy, credibility, relevance, rigor, and quantity. The accuracy,
credibility, and relevance of evidence should be confirmed prior to its use. For example, some
evidence can support arguments for strength of function, others for negative requirements (i.e.,
what will not happen), and still other evidence for qualitative properties.


                                          ASSURANCE CASE
            An assurance case is a reasoned, auditable artifact that is created to support
            the contention that a top-level claim is satisfied. The assurance case includes
            systematic argumentation, evidence, and explicit assumptions that support
            the claim.
            An assurance case contains the following elements [30]:
            •   One or more claims about properties
            •   Arguments that logically link the evidence and any assumptions
            •   A body of evidence
            •   Justification of the choice of a top-level claim and the method of reasoning
            Assurance cases have numerous advantages over other means for obtaining
            confidence, such as in the areas of comprehension, informing needed
            allocation responsibilities, information organization, and robust due diligence
            [63]. These advantages were greater in areas with otherwise insufficient
            methods for achieving high assurance. Additionally, assurance cases were
            determined to be more efficient for complex and novel systems, as well as
            systems in need of high assurance.
            Many formalizations and tools for building assurance cases have been
            developed in recent years, including the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) [64]
            and NASA’s AdvoCATE: Assurance Case Automation Toolset [65].
