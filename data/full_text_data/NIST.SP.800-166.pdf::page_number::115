NIST SP 800-166                                                    DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                   DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

 Test Scenario            1. Send the SELECT command with
                                • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                          2. Send the GET DATA command with
                                • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                   ('5FC105') of the X.509 Certificate for
                                   Derived PIV Authentication data object
                          3. Extract the value of the subjectAltName extension
                             from the certificate.
 Expected Result(s)       1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                             template with the status word '90 00'.
                          2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                             along with the status word '90 00'.
                          3. From Step 3, a name of type uniformResourceIdentifier
                             containing a UUID is present.

9.3.1.9 piv-interim Extension

 Test Assertion           TA-09.03.01.09
 Purpose                  Verifies that the piv-interim extension is present in the Derived
                          PIV Authentication certificate.
 DTR(s)                   • DTR-07.03.01.08
 Issuer Documentation     None.
 Precondition(s)          • A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                             appropriate token reader.
                          • Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and
                             an instance of the reader.
                          • A Derived PIV Authentication certificate is present within the
                             Derived PIV Application.
 Test Scenario            1. Send the SELECT command with
                                • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                          2. Send the GET DATA command with
                                • Data field of the command containing the tag
                                   ('5FC105') of the X.509 Certificate for
                                   Derived PIV Authentication data object
                          3. Extract the piv-interim extension from the
                             certificate.
 Expected Result(s)       1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property
                             template with the status word '90 00'.
                          2. From Step 2, the command returns the requested data object
                             along with the status word '90 00'.
                          3. From Step 3, the non-critical piv-interim extension is present
                             and contains the interim_indicator field, which is of type
                             BOOLEAN.
