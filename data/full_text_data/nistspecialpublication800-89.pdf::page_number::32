SP 800-89                                                               November 2006



The TTP shall obtain assurance of a (claimed or intended) owner’s possession of the
private key using one or more of the following methods:

   1. TTP obtains assurance from the owner by verifying an assurance signature.
            a. Determine the appropriate value of d. For example, d may be selected in
               accordance with the assurance of possession model described in Section
               6.2, along with appropriate values of a, b and c.
            b. The owner shall generate a new private-key-possession assurance message
               (see Section 6.3.1.1).
            c. The owner shall sign the assurance message using the private key for
               which assurance is to be obtained, thus obtaining an assurance signature.
            d. The owner shall provide the assurance message, the assurance signature
               and any other necessary data to the TTP.
            e. The TTP shall determine a trusted value for t1 (see Sections 6.2 and
               6.3.1.2).
            f. The TTP shall verify the assurance signature using the public key that
               corresponds to the owner’s private key.
            g. If verification is successful:
               •   The TTP shall determine a trusted value for t2 (see Sections 6.2 and
                   6.3.1.2).
               •   Provided that t1 ≤ t2 ≤ t1+d, the TTP shall assign the assurance_time
                   and the initial assurance level (see Sections 6.3.1.2 and 6.3.1.3).
               •   The TTP shall record the assurance_time, the initial assurance level,
                   and the value of d. These values should also be provided to the owner.

   2. TTP obtains assurance from the owner by regenerating the owner’s key(s)
            a. Determine the appropriate value of d. For example, d may be selected in
               accordance with the assurance of possession model described in Section
               6.2, along with appropriate values of a, b and c.
            b. The owner shall provide the owner’s currently-held keys to the trusted
               party, along with any other necessary data.
            c. The TTP shall determine a trusted value for t1 (see Sections 6.2 and
               6.3.1.2).
            d. The TTP shall:
               •   Regenerate the owner’s entire key pair, or
               •   Regenerate one key of the owner’s key pair from the currently-held
                   value of the other key of that pair.
