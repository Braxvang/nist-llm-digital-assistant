6.      Alternatives to SSL VPNs

Although SSL VPNs are flexible enough to meet many needs, there are certain cases when other types of
VPNs may provide a better solution. This section lists several VPN protocols that are used as alternatives
to SSL VPNs in different scenarios. This section groups the types of VPN by the approximate layer of
the TCP/IP model at which they function, because many of the protocols’ characteristics are based on the
layer they use. SSL is the prevalent transport layer VPN protocol; this section discusses several data link
layer, network layer, and application layer VPN protocols. For each protocol, a brief description is
provided, along with a description of the circumstances under which it may be more advantageous than an
SSL VPN.

6.1     Data Link Layer VPN Protocols

Data link layer VPN protocols function below the network layer in the TCP/IP model. This means that
various network protocols, such as IP, Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX), and Network Basic
Input/Output System (NetBIOS) Extended User Interface (NetBEUI), can usually be used with a data link
layer VPN. Most VPN protocols, such as IPsec, only support IP, so data link layer VPN protocols may
provide a viable option for protecting networks running non-IP protocols and for networks running more
than one network protocol (such as IP and IPX at the same time).

The most commonly implemented data link layer VPN protocols are typically used on top of the Point-to-
Point Protocol (PPP) and are most often used to secure modem-based connections. PPP, not the VPN
protocol itself, typically provides encryption and authentication services for the traffic. The standards for
PPP only reference supporting Data Encryption Standard (DES) for encryption and Password
Authentication Protocol (PAP) and Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) for
authentication. Because there are known weaknesses in these algorithms, data link layer VPN protocols
often make use of additional protocols and services to provide stronger encryption and authentication for
VPN connections. The most commonly used data link layer VPN protocols are as follows:

 Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) Version 2

          –    PPTP provides a protected tunnel between a PPTP-enabled client (e.g., a personal computer)
               and a PPTP-enabled server. Each system that may use PPTP needs to have PPTP client
               software installed and configured appropriately.

          –    PPTP uses Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) to transport data. Most packet filtering
               devices block this protocol by default, so they may need to be reconfigured to permit it in
               systems that use PPTP for a VPN. In addition to the GRE connection, PPTP also establishes
               a separate control channel using TCP port 1723.

          –    Microsoft has created its own PPP encryption mechanism for use with PPTP, Microsoft
               Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE); it uses a 40-bit or 128-bit key with the RSA RC4
               algorithm. Microsoft has also created MS-CHAP to provide stronger authentication than
               PAP and CHAP; nevertheless, researchers have found serious weaknesses in MS-CHAP. 21

          –    The original version of PPTP contained serious security flaws. PPTP version 2 addressed
               many of these issues, but researchers have identified weaknesses with it as well (in addition
               to the MS-CHAP issues).
