      NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1
      September 2023                                 PIV Card Application Namespace, Data Model, and Representation

379   The CCC supports minimum capability for retrieval of the data model and, optionally, the
380   application information specified in [GSC-IS]. The data model of the PIV Card Application
381   SHALL be identified by data model number 0x10. Deployed applications use 0x00 through
382   0x04. This enables the GSC-IS application domain to correctly identify a new data model
383   namespace and structure as defined in this document.
384   For PIV Card Applications, the PIV data objects exist in a namespace tightly managed by NIST,
385   and a CCC discovery mechanism is not needed by client applications that are not based on GSC-
386   IS. Therefore, all mandatory data elements of the CCC except for the data model number MAY
387   optionally have a length value set to zero bytes (i.e., no value field will be supplied). Unused
388   optional data elements SHALL be absent. Other than the data model number, the contents of the
389   CCC data elements are out of scope for this specification.
390   The Security Object enforces integrity of the CCC according to the issuer.

391   3.1.2. Card Holder Unique Identifier
392   The Card Holder Unique Identifier (CHUID) data object is defined in accordance with the
393   Technical Implementation Guidance: Smart Card Enabled Physical Access Control Systems
394   (TIG SCEPACS) [TIG SCEPACS]. For this specification, the CHUID is common between the
395   contact and contactless interfaces. For dual chip implementations, the CHUID is copied in its
396   entirety between the two chips.
397   In addition to the requirements specified in TIG SCEPACS, the CHUID on the PIV Card
398   SHALL meet the following requirements:
399          •    The previously deprecated Authentication Key Map data element SHALL NOT be
400               present in the CHUID. 1
401          •    The Federal Agency Smart Credential Number (FASC-N) SHALL be in accordance with
402               TIG SCEPACS [TIG SCEPACS] with the exception that credential series, individual
403               credential issue, person identifier, organizational category, organizational identifier, and
404               the person/organization association category MAY be populated with all zeros. The
405               FASC-N SHALL NOT be modified post-issuance.
406               A subset of the FASC-N, the FASC-N Identifier, SHALL be the unique identifier as
407               described in [TIG SCEPACS, Section 6.6]: “The combination of an Agency Code,
408               System Code, and Credential Number is a fully qualified number that is uniquely
409               assigned to a single individual.” The Agency Code is assigned to each department or
410               agency by SP 800-87, Codes for Identification of Federal and Federally-Assisted
411               Organizations [SP800-87]. The subordinate System Code and Credential Number value
412               assignment is subject to department or agency policy, provided that the FASC-N
413               identifier (i.e., the concatenated Agency Code, System Code, and Credential Number) is
414               unique for each card. The same FASC-N value SHALL be used in all of the PIV data
415               objects that include the FASC-N. To eliminate unnecessary use of personally identifiable
416               information, the FASC-N’s Person Identifier (PI) field SHOULD NOT encode Social
417               Security numbers (SSNs). TIG SCEPACS also specifies PACS interoperability
