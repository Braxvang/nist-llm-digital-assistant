SP 800-152                                                       A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


                             A Federal CKMS shall generate keys using a NIST-approved
PR:6.22
                             random number generator that provides a security strength
                             that meets or exceeds the security strength required for the
                             key.

6.4.2 Register an Owner
The initial registration of a security entity (i.e., an individual (person), organization, device or
process) and a cryptographic key with metadata is a fundamental requirement of every
FCKMS. This requirement is difficult to fully automate while preserving security (i.e.,
protecting from an impersonation threat), and thus, it usually requires verified and authorized
human interactions. There typically exists a registration process in an FCKMS that associates
each entity’s initial set of long-term (i.e., static) secret, public, and/or private keys with the
entity’s identifier and perhaps other metadata. The process of associating a key-owner’s
identifier, key, and metadata involves either an initial identity-based authentication by a
human relying on specific identification information, or relying on the pre-existing identity
of the owner in some FCKMS.

FR:6.21 The CKMS design shall specify all the processes involved in owner registration,
including the process for binding keys with the owner’s identifier.

                 IA-4        A Federal CKMS shall:
PR:6.23
                               a) Support the initial registration and periodic verification
                                  of each security entity that is to be managed,
                               b) Manage the association of each security entity with its
                                  key and its associated metadata, and
                               c) Provide owner registration and key association
                                  processes that can be implemented and evaluated for all
                                  FCKMS entities.
                 IA-4        During a registration process, a Federal CKMS shall register
PR:6.24
                             a security entity, as well as the entity’s initial cryptographic
                             keys and metadata.

6.4.3 Activate a Key
The activation function provides for the transition of a cryptographic key from the pre-
activation state to the active state (see [SP 800-57 Part 1] for further information). A key
could be automatically activated immediately after generation, upon request, or in
accordance with a date-time metadata value (e.g., set at the time of key generation) that
indicates when the key needs to become active and can be used.

FR:6.22 The CKMS design shall specify how each key type is activated and the
circumstances for activating the key.

FR:6.23 For each key type, the CKMS design shall specify requirements for the notification
of key activation, including which parties are notified, how they are notified, what security
services are applied to the notification, and the time-frames for notification(s).
