A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



2.12.8 Example
(input)     ε = 11001001000011111101101010100010001000010110100011
                00001000110100110001001100011001100010100010111000

(input)           m = 2; n = 100

(processing)      ApEn(m) = 0.665393

(processing)      χ2(obs) = 5.550792

(output)          P-value = 0.235301

(conclusion)      Since P-value ≥ 0.01, accept the sequence as random.


2.13 Cumulative Sums (Cusum) Test

2.13.1 Test Purpose
The focus of this test is the maximal excursion (from zero) of the random walk defined by the cumulative
sum of adjusted (-1, +1) digits in the sequence. The purpose of the test is to determine whether the
cumulative sum of the partial sequences occurring in the tested sequence is too large or too small relative
to the expected behavior of that cumulative sum for random sequences. This cumulative sum may be
considered as a random walk. For a random sequence, the excursions of the random walk should be near
zero. For certain types of non-random sequences, the excursions of this random walk from zero will be
large.

2.13.2 Function Call
CumulativeSums(mode,n), where:

           n      The length of the bit string.

Additional input for the function, but supplied by the testing code:

           ε      The sequence of bits as generated by the RNG or PRNG being tested; this exists as a
                  global structure at the time of the function call; ε = ε1, ε2, … , εn.

           mode   A switch for applying the test either forward through the input sequence (mode = 0) or
                  backward through the sequence (mode = 1).

2.13.3 Test Statistic and Reference Distribution
z:     The largest excursion from the origin of the cumulative sums in the corresponding (-1, +1)
       sequence.

The reference distribution for the test statistic is the normal distribution.

2.13.4 Test Description
(1)    Form a normalized sequence: The zeros and ones of the input sequence (ε) are converted to
       values Xi of –1 and +1 using Xi = 2εi – 1.
