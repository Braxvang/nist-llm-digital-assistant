Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1           Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________



                                           Cautionary Note
  The security controls described in this catalog should be employed in federal information systems in
  accordance with the risk management guidance provided in Chapter Three. This guidance includes the
  selection of minimum (baseline) security controls based upon the FIPS 199 security categorization of the
  information system and the tailoring of the minimum (baseline) security controls by: (i) applying
  appropriate scoping guidance; (ii) specifying compensating controls, if needed; and (iii) inserting
  organization-defined security control parameters, where allowed. Since the baseline security controls
  represent the minimum controls for low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact information systems,
  respectively, there are additional controls and control enhancements that appear in the catalog that are
  not used in any of the baselines. These additional security controls and control enhancements are
  available to organizations and can be used in supplementing the tailored baselines to achieve the
  needed level of protection in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk. Moreover, security
  controls and control enhancements contained in higher-level baselines can also be used by
  organizations to strengthen the level of protection provided in lower-level baselines, if deemed
  appropriate.
