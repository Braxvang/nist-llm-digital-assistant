                                                               GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



Completed                                          Action
            Remove or disable all unneeded default login accounts created by the mail
            server installation
            Remove all manufacturer documentation from server
            Remove any example or test files from server
            Apply appropriate security template or hardening script to the server
            Reconfigure SMTP, POP and IMAP service banners (and others as required)
            NOT to report mail server and operating system type and version
            Disable dangerous or unnecessary mail commands (e.g., VRFY and EXPN)
            Configure operating system and mail server access controls
            Limit the access of the mail server application to a subset of computational
            resources
            Limit the access of users through additional access controls enforced by the mail
            server, where more detailed levels of access control are required
            Configure the mail server application to execute only under a unique individual
            user and group identity with restrictive access controls
            Ensure the mail server is not running with root or system/administrator privileges
            Configure the host operating system so that the mail server can write log files but
            not read them
            Configure the host operating system so that temporary files created by the mail
            server application are restricted to a specified and appropriately protected
            subdirectory
            Configure the host operating system so that access to any temporary files
            created by the mail server application is limited to the mail server processes that
            created these files
            Ensure that the mail server cannot save files outside of the specified files
            structure dedicated to the mail server
            Configure the mail server to run in a chroot jail on Linux and Unix hosts
            Install usersâ€™ mailboxes on a different server (preferred), hard drive, or logical
            partition than the operating system and mail server application
            Configure the mail server application so it cannot consume all available space on
            its hard drives or partitions
            Limit the size of attachments that are allowed
            Ensure log files are stored in a location that is sized appropriately
            Protect email from malware
            Determine which types of attachments to allow
            Consider restricting the maximum acceptable size for attachments
            Determine if having access to personal email accounts from organizational
            computers is appropriate
            Determine which types of active content should be permitted within email
            messages
            Implement centralized malware scanning (on the firewall, mail relay, mail
            gateway, and/or mail server)
            Install malware scanners on all client hosts
            Implement centralized content filtering
