automated mechanisms during contingency operations, it should provide nonautomated
mechanisms or predetermined procedures as compensating controls in accordance with the
general tailoring guidance. Examples of compensating controls are given with each control as
appropriate.

OT Discussion: The organization defines contingency plans for categories of disruptions or
failures. In the case of a contingency, the OT equipment executes preprogrammed functions,
such as alerting the operator of the failure and then doing nothing, alerting the operator and then
safely shutting down the industrial process, or alerting the operator and then maintaining the last
operational setting prior to failure. Contingency plans for widespread disruption may involve
specialized organizations (e.g., FEMA, emergency services, regulatory authorities).
