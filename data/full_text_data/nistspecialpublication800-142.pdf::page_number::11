interaction level t in t-way combinations is often referred to as strength). With the NASA
application, for example, 67% of the failures were triggered by only a single parameter
value, 93% by 2-way combinations, and 98% by 3-way combinations. The detection rate
curves for the other applications studied are similar, reaching 100% detection with 4 to 6Â­
way interactions. Studies by other researchers [6, 7, 26] have been consistent with these
results.

    While not conclusive, these results are interesting because they suggest that, while
pairwise testing is not sufficient, the degree of interaction involved in failures is relatively
low. We summarize this result in what we call the interaction rule, an empirically-derived rule that
characterizes the distribution of interaction faults:

Interaction Rule: Most failures are induced by single factor faults or by the joint combinatorial
effect (interaction) of two factors, with progressively fewer failures induced by interactions
between three or more factors.
