                                  GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



Context of use: The release of the individuals‘ names and contact information would not likely cause
harm to the individuals, and disclosure of the fact that the agency has collected or used this information is
also unlikely to cause harm.

Access to and location of PII: The information is accessed by IT staff members who detect security
breaches, as well as the team members themselves. The PII needs to be readily available to teleworkers
and to on-call IT staff members so that incident responses can be initiated quickly.

Taking into account these factors, the agency determines that unauthorized access to the roster would
likely cause little or no harm, and it chooses to assign the PII confidentiality impact level of low. 42

3.3.2     Example 2: Intranet Activity Tracking

An organization maintains a web use audit log for an intranet web site accessed by employees. The web
use audit log contains the following:

 The user‘s IP address
 The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the web site the user was viewing immediately before
  coming to this web site (i.e., referring URL)
 The date and time the user accessed the web site
 The web pages or topics accessed within the organization‘s web site (e.g., organization security
  policy).
Identifiability: By itself, the log does not contain any directly identifiable data. However, the
organization has a closely-related system with a log that contains domain login information records,
which include user IDs and corresponding IP addresses. Administrators who have access to both systems
and their logs could correlate information between the logs and identify individuals. Potentially,
information could be stored about the actions of most of the organization‘s users involving web access to
intranet resources. The organization has a small number of administrators who have access to both
systems and both logs.

Quantity of PII: The log contains a large number of records containing linked PII.

Data field sensitivity: The information on which internal web pages and topics were accessed could
potentially cause some embarrassment if the pages involved certain human resources-related subjects,
such as a user searching for information on substance abuse programs. However, since the logging is
limited to use of intranet-housed information, the amount of potentially embarrassing information is
minimal.

Context of use: Creation of the logs is known to all staff members through the organization‘s acceptable
use policies. The release of the information would be unlikely to cause harm, other than potential
embarrassment for a small number of users.

Access to and location of PII: The log is accessed by a small number of system administrators when
troubleshooting operational problems and also occasionally by a small number of incident response

     This scenario is presented for illustrative purposes only. It is possible that this type of information could be used for a social
     engineering attack. Organizations may consider their particular circumstances and assign a higher impact level for this
     scenario.
