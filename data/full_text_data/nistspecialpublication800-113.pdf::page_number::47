Here are the advantages and disadvantages as compared with the other options:

Advantages:

 Only a single rule for a single address needs to be added to the firewall.
 The device is internal, so holes between the device and internal hosts do not have to be opened in the
  firewall.
 Traffic between the device and the internal network is behind the firewall, so it is protected from
  sniffing or Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) attacks by machines in the DMZ.
Disadvantages:

 VPN traffic bypasses the firewall entirely because all applications are tunneled through the SSL
  connection. This means that the firewall offers no protection from malicious traffic sent through the
  VPN. Instead, the VPN device must provide this protection by means of a packet filter or other
  methods.
 Unsolicited traffic can now be sent from the outside into the internal network (namely, to the SSL
  VPN device). This behavior is a violation of some corporate security policies.
 If the SSL VPN device is compromised, the attacker could have access to the internal network. This
  is, of course, also true if the firewall itself is compromised.
Placing the VPN device within the DMZ. This design protects traffic between the device and internal
hosts as well as the device itself from external attacks. The only port that must be opened in the firewall
to access the device is TCP port 443 (https). Figure 4-3 illustrates an example of a network design where
