6.1.3   Sensor Locations

In addition to choosing the appropriate network for the components, administrators also need to decide
where the sensors should be located. Most NBA sensors can be deployed in passive mode only, using the
same connection methods (e.g., network tap, switch spanning port) as network-based IDPSs. Passive
sensors that are performing direct network monitoring should be placed so that they can monitor key
network locations, such as the divisions between networks, and key network segments, such as
demilitarized zone (DMZ) subnets. Inline sensors are typically intended for network perimeter use, so
they would be deployed in close proximity to the perimeter firewalls, often between the firewall and the
Internet border router to limit incoming attacks that could overwhelm the firewall.
