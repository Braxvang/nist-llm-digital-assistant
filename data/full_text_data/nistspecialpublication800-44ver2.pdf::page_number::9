identity theft. Successful attacks can compromise confidential Web site resources or harm an
organization’s image. These indirect attacks occur in two forms:

 Phishing, where attackers use social engineering to trick users into logging into a fake site

 Pharming, where Domain Name System (DNS) servers or users’ host files are compromised to
  redirect users to a malicious site in place of the legitimate site.

This document is intended to assist organizations in installing, configuring, and maintaining secure public
Web servers. More specifically, this document describes, in detail, the following practices to apply:

 Securing, installing, and configuring the underlying operating system

 Securing, installing, and configuring Web server software

 Deploying appropriate network protection mechanisms, such as firewalls, routers, switches, and
  intrusion detection and intrusion prevention systems

 Maintaining the secure configuration through application of appropriate patches and upgrades,
  security testing, monitoring of logs, and backups of data and operating system files

 Using, publicizing, and protecting information and data in a careful and systematic manner.

The following key guidelines are recommended to Federal departments and agencies for maintaining a
secure Web presence.

Organizations should carefully plan and address the security aspects of the deployment of a public
Web server.

Because it is much more difficult to address security once deployment and implementation have occurred,
security should be considered from the initial planning stage. Organizations are more likely to make
decisions about configuring computers appropriately and consistently when they develop and use a
detailed, well-designed deployment plan. Developing such a plan will support Web server administrators
in making the inevitable tradeoff decisions between usability, performance, and risk.

Organizations often fail to consider the human resource requirements for both deployment and
operational phases of the Web server and supporting infrastructure. Organizations should address the
following points in a deployment plan:

 Types of personnel required (e.g., system and Web server administrators, Webmasters, network
  administrators, information systems security officers [ISSO])

 Skills and training required by assigned personnel

 Individual (i.e., level of effort required of specific personnel types) and collective staffing (i.e.,
  overall level of effort) requirements.

Organizations should implement appropriate security management practices and controls when
maintaining and operating a secure Web server.

Appropriate management practices are essential to operating and maintaining a secure Web server.
Security practices entail the identification of an organization’s information system assets and the
