8.2   Operating System and Device Security Controls

This section addresses security controls for FCKMS computer operating systems and
devices. Note that an FCKMS module or device that incorporates a general-purpose
operating system should also have computer security controls.

8.2.1 Operating System Security
A trusted (secure) operating system manages data to make sure that it cannot be altered,
moved, or viewed except by entities having appropriate and authorized access rights. A
trusted operating system should be the foundation of every modern, shared computing
system, personal computer, and “smart” device. Without a trusted operating system, the
security of the control programs, applications, and data on these personal devices cannot be
assured. Section 8.2.1 of the Framework provides guidance on the security features that
should be provided in trusted operating systems. A trusted operating system depends on a
secure hardware platform running secure (operating system) software. The platform often
supports two or more physically or logically separated processing capabilities in order to
isolate keys, metadata, security services, and cryptographic functions according to their
impact-levels, applications, users, or FCKMS Security Policies.

An FCKMS module might run on a general-purpose computer where non-validated
application code is permitted. In such cases, a trusted operating system should be used to
protect sensitive code and data from the non-validated code. The operating system should
protect itself from all applications and should separate applications from each other. A
trusted operating system is designed to provide these separations and is “trusted” to maintain
a secure environment. The trusted operating system, including the hardware platform, can
enforce two or more states in order to support privileged operations, such as memory
management, I/O management, and secure cryptographic function calls.

Software integrity in an FCKMS must be maintained to prevent unauthorized disclosure and
modification of the keys and metadata. Software integrity may be supported by using
integrity mechanisms such as hash functions, message authentication codes, and digital
signatures. Software integrity should be verified when the software is received from its
supplier, after initial installation, upon system startup, and periodically thereafter.

Hardening is the process of eliminating a means of attack by patching vulnerabilities and
turning off nonessential services. Hardening a computer involves several steps to form layers
