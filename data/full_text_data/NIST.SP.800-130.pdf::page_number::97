       maximum extent that is feasible, external access to CKMS devices by
       unauthorized parties. The access control mechanisms upon which the CKMS
       relies for its security should be periodically reviewed against the most recent
       attacks being perpetrated and upgraded as required.

   d) New Computing Technologies
      New computing technologies may threaten the security of a CKMS. The current
      threat of highest concern is that of the development of quantum computers with
      sufficient capability to recover cryptographic keys. The implementation of
      practical quantum computers could result in a major change in cryptographic
      security technology. For example, if large qubit quantum computers could be
      built, the security of integer factorization and discrete log-based public key
      cryptographic algorithms would be threatened. This would have a major impact
      on the CKMS that rely on these algorithms for the establishment of cryptographic
      keys. Research is currently underway to find public key algorithms that are
      resistant to quantum computing (e.g., lattice-based public key cryptography), but
      no widely accepted solution has yet been found. Research is also currently
      underway to find scalable, symmetric key distribution architectures that can use
      symmetric key algorithms (e.g., AES-256) that are currently considered more
      resistant to quantum computing attacks.

FR:12.1 The CKMS design shall specify the expected security lifetime of each
cryptographic algorithm implemented in the system.

FR:12.2 The CKMS design shall specify which sub-functions (e.g., the hash sub-
function of HMAC) of the cryptographic algorithms can be upgraded or replaced with
similar, but cryptographically improved, sub-functions without negatively affecting the
CKMS operation.

FR:12.3 The CKMS design shall specify which key establishment protocols are
implemented by the system.

FR:12.4 The CKMS design shall specify the expected security lifetime of each key
establishment protocol implemented in the system in terms of the expected security
lifetimes of the cryptographic algorithms employed.

FR:12.5 The CKMS design shall specify the extent to which external access to CKMS
devices is permitted.

FR:12.6 The CKMS design shall specify how all allowed external accesses to CKMS
devices is controlled.

FR:12.7 The CKMS design shall specify the features employed to resist or mitigate the
consequences of the development of new technologies, such as a quantum computing
attack upon the CKMS cryptographic algorithms.
