       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                                 Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


1686   Authentication Intent
1687   The process of confirming the claimant’s intent to authenticate or reauthenticate
1688   by including a process requiring user intervention in the authentication flow. Some
1689   authenticators (e.g., OTP devices) establish authentication intent as part of their operation,
1690   others require a specific step, such as pressing a button, to establish intent. Authentication
1691   intent is a countermeasure against use by malware of the endpoint as a proxy for
1692   authenticating an attacker without the subscriber’s knowledge.

1693   Authentication Protocol
1694   A defined sequence of messages between a claimant and a verifier that demonstrates that
1695   the claimant has possession and control of one or more valid authenticators to establish
1696   their identity, and, optionally, demonstrates that the claimant is communicating with the
1697   intended verifier.

1698   Authentication Secret
1699   A generic term for any secret value that an attacker could use to impersonate the
1700   subscriber in an authentication protocol.
1701   These are further divided into short-term authentication secrets, which are only useful
1702   to an attacker for a limited period of time, and long-term authentication secrets, which
1703   allow an attacker to impersonate the subscriber until they are manually reset. The
1704   authenticator secret is the canonical example of a long-term authentication secret, while
1705   the authenticator output, if it is different from the authenticator secret, is usually a short-
1706   term authentication secret.

1707   Authenticator
1708   Something the claimant possesses and controls (typically a cryptographic module or
1709   password) that is used to authenticate the claimant’s identity. In some previous editions of
1710   SP 800-63, this was referred to as a token.

1711   Authentication Assurance Level (AAL)
1712   A category describing the strength of the authentication process.

1713   Authenticator Output
1714   The output value generated by an authenticator. The ability to generate valid authenticator
1715   outputs on demand proves that the claimant possesses and controls the authenticator.
1716   Protocol messages sent to the verifier are dependent upon the authenticator output, but
1717   they may or may not explicitly contain it.

1718   Authenticator Secret
1719   The secret value contained within an authenticator.
