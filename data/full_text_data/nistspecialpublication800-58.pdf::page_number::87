  A   Appendix: VOIP Risks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

      This appendix details some of the potential threats and vulnerabilities in a VOIP
      environment, including vulnerabilities of both VOIP phones and switches. Threat
      discussion is included because the varieties of threats faced by an organization
      determine the priorities in securing its communications equipment. Not all threats
      are present in all organizations. A commercial firm may be concerned primarily
      with toll fraud, while a government agency may need to prevent disclosure of
      sensitive information because of privacy or national security concerns.
      Information security risks can be broadly categorized into the following three
      types: confidentiality, integrity, and availability, (which can be remembered with
      the mnemonic “CIA”). Additional risks relevant to switches are fraud and risk of
      physical damage to the switch, physical network, or telephone extensions.

      Packet networks depend for their successful operation on a large number of
      configurable parameters: IP and MAC (physical) addresses of voice terminals,
      addresses of routers and firewalls, and VOIP specific software such as Call
      Managers and other programs used to place and route calls. Many of these
      network parameters are established dynamically every time a network component
      is restarted, or when a VOIP telephone is restarted or added to the network.
      Because there are so many places in a network with dynamically configurable
      parameters, intruders have a wide array of potentially vulnerable points to attack.

      Vulnerabilities described in this section are generic and may not apply to all
      systems, but investigations by NIST and other organizations have found these
      vulnerabilities in a number of VOIP systems. In addition, this list is not
      exhaustive; systems may have security weaknesses that are not included in the
      list. For each potential vulnerability, a recommendation is included to eliminate or
      reduce the risk of compromise.

  A.1 Confidentiality and Privacy

      Confidentiality refers to the need to keep information secure and private. For
      home computer users, this category includes confidential memoranda, financial
      information, and security information such as passwords. In a
      telecommunications switch, eavesdropping on conversations is an obvious
      concern, but the confidentiality of other information on the switch must be
      protected to defend against toll fraud, voice and data interception, and denial of
      service attacks. Network IP addresses, operating system type, telephone
      extension to IP address mappings, and communication protocols are all examples
      of information that, while not critical as individual pieces of data, can make an
      attacker’s job easier

      With conventional telephones, eavesdropping usually requires either physical
      access to tap a line, or penetration of a switch. Attempting physical access
      increases the intruder’s risk of being discovered, and conventional PBXs have


                                                                                        81
