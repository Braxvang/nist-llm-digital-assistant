       INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING MATRIX                               ~ Cell 3.5A
 Training Area: System Life Cycle Security                  — Operations
pFunctional Specialty: Manage

 Definition    —       The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an FT system
                       from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                       model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                       Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                       ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                       needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                       The operations phase includes the ongoing day-to-day use (production) and
                       maintenance or enhancement of the system without compromising the
                       integrity and effectiveness of the installed safeguards.


 Behavioral Outcome        —      Individuals with management responsibilities are able to monitor
                                  operations to ensure that safeguards are effective and have the
                                  intended effect of balancing efficiency with minimized risk.
