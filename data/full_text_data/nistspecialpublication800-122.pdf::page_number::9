                                 GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



     an individual‘s phone number or ZIP code. Organizations should also evaluate the sensitivity of the
     PII data fields when combined.
 Context of Use. Organizations should evaluate the context of use—the purpose for which the PII is
  collected, stored, used, processed, disclosed, or disseminated. The context of use may cause the same
  PII data elements to be assigned different PII confidentiality impact levels based on their use. For
  example, suppose that an organization has two lists that contain the same PII data fields (e.g., name,
  address, phone number). The first list is people who subscribe to a general-interest newsletter
  produced by the organization, and the second list is people who work undercover in law enforcement.
  If the confidentiality of the lists is breached, the potential impacts to the affected individuals and to
  the organization are significantly different for each list.
 Obligations to Protect Confidentiality. An organization that is subject to any obligations to protect
  PII should consider such obligations when determining the PII confidentiality impact level.
  Obligations to protect generally include laws, regulations, or other mandates (e.g., Privacy Act, OMB
  guidance). For example, some Federal agencies, such as the Census Bureau and the Internal Revenue
  Service (IRS), are subject to specific legal obligations to protect certain types of PII. 10
 Access to and Location of PII. Organizations may choose to take into consideration the nature of
  authorized access to and the location of PII. When PII is accessed more often or by more people and
  systems, or the PII is regularly transmitted or transported offsite, then there are more opportunities to
  compromise the confidentiality of the PII.
Organizations should apply the appropriate safeguards for PII based on the PII confidentiality
impact level.
Not all PII should be protected in the same way. Organizations should apply appropriate safeguards to
protect the confidentiality of PII based on the PII confidentiality impact level. Some PII does not need to
have its confidentiality protected, such as information that the organization has permission or authority to
release publicly (e.g., an organization‘s public phone directory). NIST recommends using operational
safeguards, privacy-specific safeguards, and security controls,11 such as:
 Creating Policies and Procedures. Organizations should develop comprehensive policies and
  procedures for protecting the confidentiality of PII.
 Conducting Training. Organizations should reduce the possibility that PII will be accessed, used, or
  disclosed inappropriately by requiring that all individuals receive appropriate training before being
  granted access to systems containing PII.
 De-Identifying PII. Organizations can de-identify records by removing enough PII such that the
  remaining information does not identify an individual and there is no reasonable basis to believe that
  the information can be used to identify an individual. De-identified records can be used when full
  records are not necessary, such as for examinations of correlations and trends.
 Using Access Enforcement. Organizations can control access to PII through access control policies
  and access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists).
 Implementing Access Control for Mobile Devices. Organizations can prohibit or strictly limit
  access to PII from portable and mobile devices, such as laptops, cell phones, and personal digital

     The Census Bureau has a special obligation to protect based on provisions of Title 13 of the U.S. Code, and IRS has a
     special obligation to protect based on Title 26 of the U.S. Code. There are more agency-specific obligations to protect PII,
     and an organization‘s legal counsel and privacy officer should be consulted.
