Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to services acquisition information.
Functions and processes supported by most services acquisition information are tolerant of
delays i.e., the data supporting the functions/processes are not time-critical. In most cases,
disruption of access to services procurement information can be expected to have a limited
adverse effect on agency operations (including mission functions and public confidence in
the agency), agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
services acquisition information is low.

C.3.5 Information and Technology Management

IT management involves the coordination of IT resources and systems required to support or
enable a citizen service. Impacts to information associated with the operation of IT systems
generally need to be considered even when all mission-related information processed by the
system is intended to be available to the general public. The relevant issues may be different
for integrity and availability than for confidentiality. Information that has been made public,
by definition, requires no confidentiality protection. In contrast, integrity and availability
protection cannot be maintained for copies of information that have been distributed to the
public. Integrity and availability assurance can only be maintained by maintaining copies of
information in organization-controlled information systems.
C.3.5.1 System Development Information Type

System Development supports all activities associated with the in-house design and development
of software applications. The recommended security categorization for the system development
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of system development
information on the ability of responsible agencies to design and develop software applications in-
house. In the system development phase, a systemâ€™s security configuration baseline is
established. In most cases, the system development information is not particularly sensitive and
is distributed to the users. In general, disclosure of the system development information is likely
to result in only limited adverse effects on the confidentiality of system information and
processes.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for system development information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of system development information
