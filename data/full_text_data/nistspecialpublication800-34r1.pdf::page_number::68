        assessment, vulnerability scanning) in the production systems should be implemented in the
        contingency solution(s) to ensure that, during a network disruption, executing the technical
        contingency solution(s) does not compromise or disclose sensitive data.
    Âƒ   Use results from the BIA. Impacts and priorities discovered through the BIA of associated
        systems should be reviewed to determine telecommunications recovery priorities. The BIA
        should identify the high-availability FIPS 199 impact levels for any data networks and email that
        support COOP Mission, Primary, or National Essential Functions.

5.3.2   Telecommunications Contingency Solutions

While similar contingencies exist for both LAN and WAN telecommunications systems, there are
different strategies and solutions the ISCP Coordinator should consider when determining an overall
telecommunications recovery strategy. Differences in solutions primarily exist due to geographic and
connectivity ownership. While LANs are typically in small areas (offices or campuses) and the routing
and wiring is owned or managed by the organization, WANs typically rely on network service providers
(NSPs) for both routing and wiring.

When developing an ISCP for a LAN, the ISCP Coordinator should identify single points of failure that
affect critical systems or processes outlined in the BIA. This analysis could include threats to the cabling
system, such as cable cuts, electromagnetic and radio frequency interference, and damage resulting from
fire, water, and other hazards. As a solution, redundant cables may be installed when appropriate. For
example, it might not be cost-effective to install duplicate cables to desktops. However, it might be cost-
effective to install a gigabit cable between floors so that hosts on both floors could be reconnected if the
primary cable were cut.

Contingency planning also should consider network-connecting devices, such as hubs, switches, routers,
and bridges. The BIA should characterize the roles that each device serves in the network, and a
contingency solution should be developed for each device based on its BIA criticality. As an example of
a contingency strategy for network-connecting devices, redundant intelligent network routers may be
installed in a network, enabling a router to assume the full traffic workload if the other router failed.

Remote access is a service provided by servers and devices on the LAN. Remote access provides a
convenience for users working offsite or allows for a means for servers and devices to communicate
between sites. Remote access can be conducted through various methods, primarily through a virtual
private network (VPN). If an emergency or serious system disruption occurs, remote access may serve as
an important contingency capability by providing access to organization-wide data for recovery teams or
users from another location. If remote access is established as a contingency strategy, data bandwidth
requirements should be identified and used to scale the remote access solution. Additionally, security
controls such as multifactor authentication and data encryption should be implemented if the
communications contain FIPS 199 moderate- or high-impact information. Remote access will work only
if the remote access server and the network are both functioning at either the primary or the alternate
location.

Wireless (or WiFi) local area networks can serve as an effective contingency solution to restore network
services following a wired LAN disruption. Wireless networks do not require the cabling infrastructure
of conventional LANs; therefore, they may be installed quickly as an interim or permanent solution.
However, wireless networks broadcast data over a radio signal, enabling the data to be intercepted. When
implementing a wireless network, security controls, such as data encryption, should be employed if the
communications traffic contains FIPS 199 moderate- or high-impact information. Wireless LANs allow
for quick temporary access of portable devices, which typically have wireless antennae built into them.
