SP 800-89                                                                     November 2006



      2. The entity performs an explicit domain parameter validation and obtains an
         indication of validity (see Section 4.1 for DSA, and ANS X9.62 for ECDSA; for
         ECDSA, a check that the subgroup order n and the cofactor h are selected
         appropriately for the security strength shall also be included).
      3. The entity has received assurance from a TTP (e.g., a CA) that the domain
         parameters were valid at the time that they were generated because the TTP either
         generated the domain parameters (see method 1 above and Section 4.2), or has
         performed an explicit domain parameter validation (see method 2 above).
         Note: Some domain parameters have been generated using SHA-1 (e.g., the
         NIST Recommended curves in FIPS 186-3). When SHA-1 is no longer approved
         for the generation of digital signatures (see [2]), those domain parameters that
         were generated using SHA-1 and were successfully validated while SHA-1 was
         still Approved will continue to qualify as valid.
The entity, or an agent trusted to act on the entity’s behalf, shall know which method(s)
of assurance were used in order to determine that the provided assurance is sufficient and
appropriate to meet an application’s requirements.

4.1      Explicit Domain Parameter Validation for DSA
DSA domain parameters are explicitly validated using the following procedure or its
equivalent if p, q, g, domain_parameter_seed, and counter are known:
      Input:
         1. L           The length of p in bits.
         2. N           The length of q in bits.
         3. p, q, g, domain_parameter_seed, counter
                        The domain parameters, where p and q are primes, g is the
                        generator, domain_parameter_seed is the domain parameter seed
                        that was used to generate p and q, and counter was obtained during
                        the generation of p and q.
         Output:
         1. status      The status returned from the validation routine, where status is
                        either g_partially_validated, g_fully_validated or INVALID.
      Process:
                                        Comment: Verify the values of the (L, N) pair
                                        specified in FIPS 186-3.
         1. Verify that the (L, N) pair is valid. If (L, N) is not in the list of Approved pairs
            (see FIPS 186-3), then return INVALID.
