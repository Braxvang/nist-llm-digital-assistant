                                                             SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



7.        Guidelines for Securing DNS Hosting Environment

The guidelines for secure configuration of the DNS hosting environment are classified under the
following headings:

      •    Securing DNS host platform

      •    Securing DNS software

      •    Content control of zone file.
These guidelines are provided mostly in the context of BIND DNS Name Server software. Where
possible, similar guidelines will be provided for other DNS authoritative software packages such as NSD
(from NLnet Labs) and Microsoft Windows Server.

7.1       Securing DNS Host Platform

The platform on which the name server software is hosted should be running an adequately secured OS.
Most of the DNS installations run either on a flavor of Unix or Windows. Given this scenario, it is
necessary to ensure the following:

      •    The latest OS patches are installed.

      •    Recommended OS configuration practices as issued by CERT®//CC [CERT] and NIST’s NVD
           metabase [NVD], based on identified vulnerabilities that pertain to the application profile into
           which the name server software fits, are followed. In particular, hosts that run the name server
           software should not provide any other services and therefore should be configured to respond to
           DNS traffic only. In other words, the only allowed incoming ports/protocols to these hosts should
           be 53/udp and 53/tcp. Outgoing DNS messages should be sent from a random port to minimize
           the risk of an attacker guessing the outgoing message port and sending forged replies.
7.2       Securing DNS Software

Protection approaches for DNS software include choice of appropriate version, installation of patches,
running it with restricted privileges, restricting other applications in the execution environment,
dedicating instances for each function, controlling the set of hosts where software is installed, placement
within the network, and limiting information exposure by logical/physical partitioning of zone file data or
running two name server software instances for different client classes.

7.2.1      Running the Latest Version of Name Server Software

Each newer version of the name server software, especially the BIND software, generally is devoid of
vulnerabilities found in earlier versions because it has design changes incorporated to take care of those
vulnerabilities. Of course, these vulnerabilities have been exploited (i.e., some form of attack was
launched), and sufficient information has been generated with respect to the nature of those exploits.
Thus, it makes good business sense to run the latest version of name server software because theoretically
it is the safest version. Even if the software is the latest version, it is not safe to run it in default mode. The
security administrator should always configure the software to run in the recommended secure mode of
operation after becoming familiar with the new security settings for the latest version.
