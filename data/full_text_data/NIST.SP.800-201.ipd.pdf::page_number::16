      NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                   Cloud Computing Forensic
      February 2023                                                                   Reference Architecture

442           b. Malware may circumvent virtual machine isolation methods
443   5. Incident first responders (e.g., trustworthiness of cloud providers, response time,
444      reconstruction). Incident first responder challenges in cloud forensics include:
445          a. Confidence, competence, and trustworthiness of the cloud providers to act as first
446             responders and perform data collection
447          b. Difficulty in performing initial triage
448          c. Processing a large volume of collected forensic artifacts
449   6. Role management (e.g., data owners, identity management, users, access control). Role
450      management challenges in cloud forensics include:
451         a. Uniquely identifying the owner of an account
452         b. Decoupling between cloud user credentials and physical users
453         c. Ease of anonymity and creating fictitious identities online
454         d. Determining exact ownership of data
455         e. Authentication and access control
456   7. Legal (e.g., jurisdictions, laws, service level agreements, contracts, subpoenas, international
457      cooperation, privacy, ethics). Legal challenges in cloud forensics include:
458         a. Identifying and addressing issues of jurisdictions for legal access to data
459         b. Lack of effective channels for international communication and cooperation during an
460             investigation
461         c. Data acquisition that relies on the cooperation, competence, and trustworthiness of
462             cloud providers
463         d. Missing terms in contracts and service-level agreements
464         e. Issuing subpoenas without knowledge of the physical location of data
465   8. Standards (e.g., standard operating procedures, interoperability, testing, validation).
466      Standards challenges in cloud forensics include:
467         a. Lack of minimum/basic SOPs, practices, and tools
468         b. Lack of interoperability among cloud providers
469         c. Lack of test and validation procedures
470   9. Training (e.g., forensic investigators, cloud providers, qualification, certification). Training
471      challenges in cloud forensics include:
472         a. Misuse of digital forensic training materials that are not applicable to cloud forensics
473         b. Lack of cloud forensic training and expertise for both investigators and instructors
474         c. Limited knowledge about evidence by record-keeping personnel in cloud providers
