 Text – used to represent textual information in a number of character sets and formatted text
  description languages in a standardized manner.
 Video – for transmitting video or moving image data, possibly with audio as part of the composite
  video data format.
The current MIME standards include five parts: RFCs 2045, 2046, 2047, 4289 (which replaced 2048),
and 2049 (see Appendix B). They address message body format, media types, non-American Standard
Code for Information Interchange (non-ASCII) message header extensions, registration procedures, and
conformance criteria, respectively. With this added functionality, email features such as message
attachments and inline hypertext markup language (HTML) are possible. Although MIME extensions
allow for binary message content, such content is incorporated into an RFC 2822 message using Base64
encoding, which provides a textual representation of binary data. 3

2.3     Mail Transport Standards

To ensure reliability and interoperability among various mail applications, mail transport standards were
established. In the simplest scenario, an email message is sent from one local user to another local user.
For this case, an LDA is responsible for placing the message in the appropriate mailbox. When a message
is sent to non-local recipients, an MTA is needed to send the message from the local mail server to the
remote mail server. Depending on the type of systems involved, different MTAs may be used, which in
turn may support different implementations of a particular message transfer protocol or more than one
distinct transfer protocol.

The most common MTA transfer protocol is the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). SMTP is the
de-facto Internet standard for sending email messages. Thus, any Internet messaging system must support
SMTP to facilitate communication with other email messaging applications. Other messaging systems
exist that use different MTA transfer protocols between similar or clustered messaging systems. For the
most part, these MTAs are proprietary and work only with specific systems. Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2
provide background information on SMTP and SMTP extensions, while Section 2.3.3 discusses
proprietary MTAs.

2.3.1     Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

Jon Postel of the University of Southern California developed SMTP in August 1982. As RFC 821,
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, states, “SMTP was developed to ensure a more reliable and efficient way
to transport messages.” At the most basic level, SMTP is a minimal language that defines a
communications protocol for delivering email messages. Figure 2.2 lists the SMTP commands and
syntax as defined in RFC 2821, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, which replaced RFC 821.

      Base64 encoding was originally derived from RFC 1421 for Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM).
