 With the continued proliferation of information, the explosion of devices connecting to the expanding
communication infrastructure and the evolving threat environment, the need for cybersecurity standards and
best practices that address interoperability, usability and privacy continues to be critical for the Nation. The
Computer Security Division (CSD), a component of the Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) is responsible for developing standards, guidelines, tests, and metrics for the
protection of non-national security federal information and communication infrastructure. These standards,
guidelines, tests, and metrics are also important resources for the private sector.

 In 2012, CSD aligned its resources to enable greater development and application of practical, innovative
security technologies and methodologies, and to enhance our ability to address current and future computer and
information security challenges in support of critical national and international priorities.

 CSD extended its research and development agenda for high-quality, cost-effective security and privacy
mechanisms to foster improved information security across the federal government and the global information
security community. In 2012, NIST concluded the five-year SHA-3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm Competition with
the selection of KECCAK for standardization and worldwide adoption. The selection of this cryptographic hash
algorithm, an indispensable component for the information and communication systems that support commerce
in the modern era, confirmed NIST’s well-respected and trusted technical authority in this field.

 A strong partnership with industry is vital to the success of our technical programs. In 2012, CSD engaged
the international standards community on emerging technical standards to advance continuous monitoring
capabilities and to further interoperability with commercially available tools. We also devised new security
testing methodologies for smart phone software app functionality. Our research in hardware-enabled security
continued with the development of guidelines on mechanisms that measure and report the security state of BIOS.
Our research also continued to expand into the cybersecurity aspects of cyber-physical and embedded systems,
and the mechanisms for enabling and protecting public safety communications.

 Our ability to interact with the broad federal community continues to be critical to our success. This interaction
helps to ensure that our research is consistent with national objectives related to or impacted by information
security. This interaction is most prominent in our strengthened collaborations with the Department of Defense,
the Intelligence Community, and the Committee on National Security Systems to establish a common foundation
for information security across the federal government. The release of Special Publication 800-30, Guide for
Conducting Risk Assessments, developed by the Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative Interagency Working
Group, is not only leading to more consistent ways to assess risks, but is also enabling more effective risk
management and facilitating greater sharing of information across organizational boundaries.

 For many years, the Computer Security Division (CSD), in collaboration with our global partners from government,
industry, and academia, has made great contributions to help secure the nation’s critical information and
infrastructure. We look forward to furthering these relationships in 2013 as we lead in
examining the diverse cybersecurity aspects of a broad set of areas, including supply
chain risk management; security analytics; cloud, mobile, and privacy-enhancing
technologies; hardware-enabled security; and cyber-physical and embedded systems.
