1603   When n bits of output are requested from an RBG3(XOR) construction, n bits of output from the
1604   DRBG are XORed with n full-entropy bits obtained either directly from the entropy source or from
1605   the entropy source after cryptographic processing by an external vetted conditioning function (see
1606   Section 3.3). When the entropy source is working properly, 30 an n-bit output from the RBG3(XOR)
1607   construction is said to provide n bits of entropy or to support a security strength of n bits. The
1608   DRBG used in the RBG3(XOR) construction is always required to support a 256-bit security
1609   strength. If the entropy source fails without being detected and the DRBG has been successfully
1610   instantiated with at least 256 bits of entropy, the DRBG continues to produce output at a security
1611   strength of 256 bits.
1612   An example of an RBG3(XOR) design is provided in Appendix B.5.

1613   6.2.1. Conceptual Interfaces
1614   The RBG interfaces include function calls for instantiating the DRBG (see Section 6.2.1.1),
1615   generating random bits on request (see Section 6.2.1.2), and reseeding the DRBG instantiation(s)
1616   (see Section 6.2.1.3).

1617   6.2.1.1.                 Instantiation of the DRBG
1618   The DRBG for the RBG3(XOR) construction is instantiated as follows:


       30
            The entropy source provides at least the amount of entropy determined during the entropy-source validation process.
