NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

D.2.3. Cybersecurity for the Operational Technology Environment (CyOTE)
DOE CESER has partnered with the Idaho National Laboratory and energy companies on a
research initiative to enhance energy-sector threat detection of anomalous behavior that
potentially indicates malicious cyber activity in OT networks.

D.2.4. Cybersecurity Risk Information Sharing Program (CRISP)
The Cybersecurity Risk Information Sharing Program (CRISP) is a public-private partnership
that is co-funded by DOE and industry and managed by the Electricity Information Sharing and
Analysis Center (E-ISAC) at NERC. The purpose of CRISP is to collaborate with energy-sector
partners to facilitate the timely bidirectional sharing of unclassified and classified threat
information and to develop situational awareness tools that enhance the sector’s ability to
identify, prioritize, and coordinate the protection of critical infrastructure and key resources.
CRISP leverages DOE’s advanced sensors, threat analysis techniques, and expertise to better
inform the energy sector of high-level cyber risks. This information is shared with voluntary
utility participants who collectively deliver more than 80 % of the Nation’s electricity. The
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) plays a lead role at CRISP.

D.2.5. Cyber Testing for Resilient Industrial Control Systems (CyTRICS)
DOE CESER has partnered with the Idaho National Laboratory and other stakeholders to
identify high-priority OT components, perform expert testing, share information about
vulnerabilities in the digital supply chain, and inform improvements in component design and
manufacturing.

D.2.6. Homeland Security Information Network – Critical Infrastructure (HSIN-CI)
The Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) is the trusted network for homeland
security mission operations to share Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) information. The critical
infrastructure community on HSIN (HSIN-CI) is the primary system through which private-
sector owners and operators, DHS, and other federal, state, and local government agencies
collaborate to protect the Nation’s critical infrastructure. HSIN-CI provides real-time
collaboration tools at no charge, including a virtual meeting space, document sharing, alerts, and
instant messaging.
