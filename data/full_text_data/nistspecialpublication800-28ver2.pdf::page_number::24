                                                               GUIDELINES ON ACTIVE CONTENT AND MOBILE CODE

 Distributed untrusted computation. “As a basic premise, the Web provides a means for
  information provided by arbitrary servers at unknown locations operated by unknown organizations
  to be interpreted by any of a large number of different browsers at unknown locations operated by
  unknown organizations. The idea of interpreting unknown information from unknown sources seems
  inherently risky.”

 Remote execution of untrusted software. “Many Web extensions are designed to provide added
  function making the Web more than just a massive uncontrolled distributed database. These
  extensions, such as PostScript, Java, and MIME essentially allow for remote execution of untrusted
  software. For the browser, the risk is that the computer running the browser will be taken over, while
  for a server, the same risk extends to the server and any subsequent browsers that get information
  from that server once it is attacked.”

 Remote interpretation of unstructured and unverified content. “In essence, most browsers and
  servers assume that the incoming information follows the HTTP protocol, but there is inadequate
  enforcement of this by servers and browsers. The result is that any incoming information might not
  conform, might be interpreted using an undefined method (corresponding to a don’t care condition in
  the interpreter), and might result in arbitrary undesirable side effects.”

Since then, mobile code has become increasingly popular on the Web. Most modern Web browsers
execute JavaScript by default. Similarly, Web browsers provide extension capabilities to support third-
party mobile code execution environments through ActiveX or browser plug-ins. For example, Sun
provides a Java plug-in, while Adobe provides Flash and PDF plug-ins.

Two primary threats associated with mobile code have been noted: malicious logic and malicious hosts
[Zac03]. Malicious logic executing as mobile code attempts to compromise the host computer system in
some manner through the interfaces available. Similarly, a malicious host computer system may attempt
to compromise the mobile code, affecting the Web transaction as a whole, by performing one of the
following actions:

 Inspection. A malicious host may gain insight into the Web site as a whole by decomposing the
  mobile code used.
 Modification. A malicious host may modify the actions performed by the mobile code in an attempt
  to compromise the Web site or perform an unexpected action.
 Replay. A host may attempt to run the mobile code one or more times without requesting it from the
  producer.
 Denial of service. A host may not run the mobile code at all, which may adversely affect any
  associated Web transactions.
Coupled with the concerns associated with the Web, the prevalence of mobile code has exacerbated the
threats facing computer systems on the Web. As such, it is important to ensure proper protections and
mitigations are in place, as discussed in Section 5.

3.3   Categories of Threats

A number of generic security threats apply to systems on the Internet, for example, unauthorized release
of information, modification of information, and denial of service. The Web is subject to these same
threats. In addition, the capabilities for supporting active content and mobile code provide new threat
opportunities that fall within these general categories. Like any technology, active content can provide a
