Special Publication 800-85B                                PIV Data Model Testing Specification


AS05.01.12: For all biometric data whether stored on a PIV card or otherwise retained by
agencies the quality value shall be a signed integer between -2 and 100 per the text of
INCITS 358. A value of -2 shall denote that assignment was not supported by the
implementation; a value of -1 shall indicate that an attempt to compute a quality value
failed. Values from 0 to 100 shall indicate an increased expectation that the sample will
ultimately lead to a successful match. The zero value required by FACESTD shall be coded
in this CBEFF field as -2.
VE05.01.12.01: The vendor shall provide the quality values for the biometric data.
TE05.01.12.01: The tester shall verify that the value of Biometric Data Quality is between -2
and 100 for fingerprint template.
TE05.01.12.02: The tester shall verify that the value of Biometric Data Quality is -2 for a facial
image.

AS05.01.13: The Creator field in the PIV Patron Format contains 18 bytes of which the
first K <= 17 bytes shall be ASCII characters, and the first of the remaining 18-K shall be a
null terminator (zero).
VE05.01.13.01: The vendor shall provide the value of Creator field.
TE05.01.13.01: The tester shall verify the Creator field value.

AS05.01.14: The Data Type Encoding field in the PIV Patron Format shall contain the 25
bytes of the FASC-N component of the CHUID identifier.
VE05.01.14.01: The vendor shall provide the value for FASC-N.
TE05.01.14.01: The tester shall verify the FASC-N value.

AS05.01.15: The “Reserved for future use” field in the PIV Patron Format shall contain
0x00000000.
No requirement for vendor.
TE05.01.15.01: The tester shall verify the “Reserved for future use” field is 0x00000000.

5.2   Fingerprint Template for Storage on PIV Card

AS05.02.01: Both finger’s template records shall be wrapped in a single CBEFF structure
prior to storage on the PIV card.
VE05.02.01.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the CBEFF structure is
constructed in accordance with this assertion.
TE05.02.01.01: The tester shall parse the biometric data container to verify this assertion.
Note: The CBEFF structure itself is tested in later assertions.
