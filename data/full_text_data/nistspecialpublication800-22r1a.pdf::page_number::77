A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS




However, Coron and Naccache (1998) report that “the inaccuracy due to [this approximation] can make
the test 2.67 times more permissive than what is theoretically admitted.” In other words, the ratio of the
standard deviation of fn obtained from the approximation above to the true standard deviation deviates
considerably from one. In view of this fact and also since all approximations are based on the
“admissible” assumption that Q → ∞ , the randomness hypothesis may be tested by verifying normality
of the observed values fn, assuming that the variance is unknown. This can be done using a t-test.

The original sequence must be partitioned into r (r ≤ 20) substrings, on each of which the value of the
universal test statistic
                     € is evaluated (for the same value of parameters K, L and Q). The sample variance is
evaluated, and the P-value is

                                                               
                                                   f n − E (L) 
                                              erfc
                                                   var ( f ) 
                                                            n 

3.10 Linear Complexity Test
This test uses linear complexity to test for randomness. The concept of linear complexity is related to a
popular part of many keystream generators, namely, Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR). Such a
register of length L consists of L delay elements each having one input and one output. If the initial state
of LFSR is (εL-1, …, ε1, ε0), then the output sequence, (εL, εL+1, …), satisfies the following recurrent
formula for j ≥ L

                                ε j = (c1ε j−1 + c 2ε j−2 + … + c Lε j−L ) mod2 .

c1, …, cL are coefficients of the connection polynomial corresponding to a given LFSR. An LFSR is said
to generate a given binary sequence if this sequence is the output of the LFSR for some initial state.
