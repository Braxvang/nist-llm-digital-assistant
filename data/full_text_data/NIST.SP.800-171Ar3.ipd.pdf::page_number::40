1141   3.4.1. Baseline Configuration
1142           REQUIREMENT: 03.04.01

1143           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
1144           Determine if:
1145           A.03.04.01.a[01]: a current baseline configuration of the system is developed.
1146           A.03.04.01.a[02]: a current baseline configuration of the system is maintained under
1147           configuration control.
1148           A.03.04.01.b[01]: the baseline configuration of the system is reviewed periodically.
1149           A.03.04.01.b[02]: the baseline configuration of the system is reviewed when system components
1150           are installed or modified.
1151           A.03.04.01.b[03]: the baseline configuration of the system is updated periodically.
1152           A.03.04.01.b[04]: the baseline configuration of the system is updated when system components
1153           are installed or modified.
