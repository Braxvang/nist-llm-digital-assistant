             A network security metric is desirable in evaluating                   In this manuscript, we present our efforts towards
          the effectiveness of security solutions in distributed                 a framework for exposing the functionality of a mobile
          systems. Aggregating CVSS scores of individual                         application through a combination of static and
          vulnerabilities provides a practical approach                          dynamic program analysis that attempts to explore
          to network security metric. However, existing                          all available execution paths including libraries. We
          approaches to aggregating CVSS scores usually cause                    verified our approach by testing a large number of
          useful semantics of individual scores to be lost in the                Android applications with our program to exhibit its
          aggregated result. In this paper, we address this issue                functionality and viability. The framework allows
          through two novel approaches. First, instead of taking                 complete automation of the execution process so
          each base score as an input, our approach drills down                  that no user input is required. We also discuss how
          to the underlying base metric level where dependency                   our static analysis program can be used to inform
          relationships have well-defined semantics. Second,                     the execution of the dynamic analysis program. The
          our approach interprets and aggregates the base                        program can serve as an extensible basis to fulfill
          metrics from three different aspects in order to                       other useful purposes such as symbolic execution,
          preserve corresponding semantics of the individual                     program verification, interactive debugger, and other
          scores. Finally, we confirm the advantages of our                      approaches that require deep inspection of an Android
          approaches through simulation.                                         application.
