Special Publication 800-79-2                           Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                        and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



For instance, each issuer (but not DPCI) is required to identity-proof their applicants (i.e., use
due diligence in validating the claimed identity of the applicant). This process can be
implemented in one of several ways, depending upon the structure, size, and geographical
distribution of the organization’s facilities. The process could be conducted at a central location
or distributed throughout the country within regional centers. It could be operated directly by the
organization or by an outside service provider. However, irrespective of the implementation
approach, this identity proofing/registration activity must be reliably and accurately performed.

The evidence that ensures the presence of issuer controls that are derived from FIPS 201-2
requirements and its related documents as well as OMB Memoranda, and verified through
appropriate assessments, establishes the capability of the issuer. However, authorization is
generally based not merely on the demonstration of capability, but also on the presence of certain
organizational characteristics that will provide a high degree of confidence to the Assessor that
the demonstrated capabilities will be carried out in a dependable and sustainable manner. This
dependability measure, or reliability (as it is generally called), has to be established by
adequately assessing that an issuer has the desired organizational characteristics, including
adequate issuing facilities, appropriate equipment, trained personnel, adequate resources,
trustworthy management, and properly vetted operations staff. Hence, the assessment and
authorization methodology includes a set of issuer controls, verification of which establishes the
reliability of the issuer. This set of controls is grouped under the IAT’s Authorization Focus Area
called - “Facility and Personnel Readiness”. These reliability-relevant issuer controls are
formulated, based on “commonly accepted security readiness measures” that have evolved in
response to lessons learned in security incidents that have taken place due to threats, such as
insider attacks, and risks, such as physical security lapses. In addition to the controls provided
herein, an organization may develop additional mission-specific controls that will contribute
towards the overall reliability of the issuer to meet the organization’s mission needs.
