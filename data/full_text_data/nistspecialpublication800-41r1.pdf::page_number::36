                                                                  GUIDELINES ON FIREWALLS AND FIREWALL POLICY


    be part of an overall security program that also includes products such as antimalware and intrusion
    detection software.
 Pay attention to internal threats. Focusing attention solely on external threats leaves the network
  wide open to attacks from within. These threats may not come directly from insiders, but can involve
  internal hosts infected by malware or otherwise compromised by external attackers. Important
  internal systems should be placed behind internal firewalls.
 Document the firewall’s capabilities. Each model of firewall has different capabilities and
  limitations. These will sometimes affect the planning of the organization’s security policy and
  firewall deployment strategy. Any features that positively or negatively affect this planning should be
  written into the overall planning document.
Keep in mind that the expression “all rules are meant to be broken” applies when building firewalls.
While firewall implementers should keep the above rules in mind during planning, every network and
organization has unique requirements and idiosyncrasies that could require unique solutions.

Organizations should consider the following when purchasing and implementing a firewall solution:

 Security Capabilities

    –   Which areas of the organization need to be protected (the perimeter, internal departments, remote
        office, individual hosts, specific services, mobile clients, etc.)?

    –   Which types of firewall technologies will best address the kinds of traffic that need to be
        protected (packet filtering, stateful inspection, application firewall, application-proxy gateway,
        etc.)?

    –   What additional security features—such as intrusion detection capabilities, VPNs, and content
        filtering—does the firewall need to support?
 Management

    –   Which protocols does the firewall support for remote management, such as HTTP-over-SSL,
        SSH, and access over a serial cable?

    –   Are any of the firewall’s remote management protocols acceptable for use, according to the
        organization’s policies?

    –   Can remote management be restricted to certain firewall interfaces and source IP addresses, such
        as those on a particular internal network?

    –   Does the firewall support centralized management for multiple devices (not necessarily just
        firewalls) from the same vendor?

    –   If centralized management is available, is it performed by a vendor-specific application or can it
        be controlled by other applications?
 Performance (generally for network firewalls only)

    –   What amount of throughput, maximum simultaneous connections, connections per second, and
        latency requirements must be met to prevent the firewall from being a bottleneck for network
        access, for both current and future traffic needs?
