To maximize effectiveness and minimize costs, security and privacy must be considered
throughout the system lifecycle from the initial planning stage forward. Attempting to address
security and privacy issues after implementation and deployment is not only much more difficult
and expensive, but also exposes the organization to unnecessary risk.

Understand the public cloud computing environment offered by the cloud provider.
The responsibilities of both the organization and the cloud provider vary depending on the
service model. Organizations consuming cloud services must understand the delineation of
responsibilities over the computing environment and the implications for security and privacy.
Assurances furnished by the cloud provider to support security or privacy claims, or by a
certification and compliance review entity paid by the cloud provider, should be verified
whenever possible through independent assessment by the organization.

Understanding the policies, procedures, and technical controls used by a cloud provider is a
prerequisite to assessing the security and privacy risks involved. It is also important to
comprehend the technologies used to provision services and the implications for security and
privacy of the system. Details about the system architecture of a cloud can be analyzed and used
to formulate a complete picture of the protection afforded by the security and privacy controls,
which improves the ability of the organization to assess and manage risk accurately, including
mitigating risk by employing appropriate techniques and procedures for the continuous
monitoring of the security state of the system.

Ensure that a cloud computing solution satisfies organizational security and privacy
requirements.
Public cloud providers’ default offerings generally do not reflect a specific organization’s
security and privacy needs. From a risk perspective, determining the suitability of cloud services
requires an understanding of the context in which the organization operates and the
consequences from the plausible threats it faces. Adjustments to the cloud computing
environment may be warranted to meet an organization’s requirements. Organizations should
require that any selected public cloud computing solution is configured, deployed, and managed
to meet their security, privacy, and other requirements.

Non-negotiable service agreements in which the terms of service are prescribed completely by
the cloud provider are generally the norm in public cloud computing. Negotiated service
agreements are also possible. Similar to traditional information technology outsourcing contracts
used by agencies, negotiated agreements can address an organization’s concerns about security
and privacy details, such as the vetting of employees, data ownership and exit rights, breach
notification, isolation of tenant applications, data encryption and segregation, tracking and
reporting service effectiveness, compliance with laws and regulations, and the use of validated
products meeting federal or national standards (e.g., Federal Information Processing Standard
140). A negotiated agreement can also document the assurances the cloud provider must furnish
to corroborate that organizational requirements are being met.

Critical data and applications may require an agency to undertake a negotiated service agreement
in order to use a public cloud. Points of negotiation can negatively affect the economies of scale
