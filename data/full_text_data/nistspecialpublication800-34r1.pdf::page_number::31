system. Organizational and system uniqueness are important considerations for contingency planning and
business impact. Adding information types to address this uniqueness will enhance the prioritization of
system component impacts.

Unique processes and impacts can be expressed in values or units of measurement that are meaningful to
the organization. Values can be identified using a scale and should be characterized as an indication of
impact severity to the organization if the process could not be performed. 17 For example, an impact
category such as “Costs” can be created with impact values expressed in terms of staffing, overtime, or
fee-related costs.

The ISCP Coordinator should next analyze the supported mission/business processes and with the process
owners, leadership and business managers determine the acceptable downtime if a given process or
specific system data were disrupted or otherwise unavailable. Downtime can be identified in several
ways. 18

    Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD). The MTD represents the total amount of time the system
     owner/authorizing official is willing to accept for a mission/business process outage or disruption and
     includes all impact considerations. Determining MTD is important because it could leave
     contingency planners with imprecise direction on (1) selection of an appropriate recovery method,
     and (2) the depth of detail which will be required when developing recovery procedures, including
     their scope and content. 19

    Recovery Time Objective (RTO). RTO defines the maximum amount of time that a system
     resource can remain unavailable before there is an unacceptable impact on other system resources,
     supported mission/business processes, and the MTD. Determining the information system resource
     RTO is important for selecting appropriate technologies that are best suited for meeting the MTD. 20
     When it is not feasible to immediately meet the RTO and the MTD is inflexible, a Plan of Action and
     Milestone should be initiated to document the situation and plan for its mitigation.

    Recovery Point Objective (RPO). The RPO represents the point in time, prior to a disruption or
     system outage, to which mission/business process data can be recovered (given the most recent
     backup copy of the data) after an outage. Unlike RTO, RPO is not considered as part of MTD.
     Rather, it is a factor of how much data loss the mission/business process can tolerate during the
     recovery process.
Because the RTO must ensure that the MTD is not exceeded, the RTO must normally be shorter
than the MTD. For example, a system outage may prevent a particular process from being
completed, and because it takes time to reprocess the data, that additional processing time must
be added to the RTO to stay within the time limit established by the MTD.

   NIST Special Publication 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories,
   provides additional guidance on security categories and information types that could influence criticality.
18
   The first version of NIST SP 800-34 used the term Maximum Allowable Outage (MAO) to describe the downtime threshold.
   To further delineate business process and information system downtime, Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) and Recovery
   Time Objective (RTO) terms are used.
19
   Any information system that supports continuity of operations Mission Essential Functions (MEF), Primary Mission Essential
   Functions (PMEF), or National Essential Functions (NEF) must be able to meet the function’s MTD of 12 hours or less per
   FCD-1.
20
   RTOs for telecommunications systems that support continuity of operation MEFs, PMEFs, or NEFs must support the
   function’s COOP requirements including those put forth by National Communications Systems (NCS) Directive 3-10.
