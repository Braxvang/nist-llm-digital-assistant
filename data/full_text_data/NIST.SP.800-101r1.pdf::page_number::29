                                                     Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

       Rebooting of the mobile device is frequently required to begin the extraction
        process; this may cause authentication mechanisms to activate preventing further
        analysis.

       Many flasher boxes recover the data in an encrypted format requiring the
        examiner to either use the software provided by the flasher box manufacturer to
        decrypt the data or may require reverse engineering the data’s encryption scheme
        by the analyst.

       Many phone models do not provide the acquisition of the entire memory range
        within a given mobile device. Only certain ranges may be available for certain
        mobile devices

       The flasher box service software often has many buttons that are labeled with
        nearly identical names. This confusion may easily lead even an experienced
        examiner to press the wrong button, erasing the contents of the mobile device
        instead of dumping the memory.

       Lack of documentation on the use of the flasher box tools is common. Extraction
        methods are frequently shared on forums supported by the vendor and moderated
        by more seasoned users. Caution should be taken when advice is provided, as not
        all the information provided is correct.

       Forensic Use: Nearly all flasher boxes were not designed with a forensic use as its
        intended purpose. Examiners must be experienced in the use of flasher boxes and
        should understand the proper use and function of flasher boxes.

       Despite all of these limitations, use of a flasher box is a viable option for many
        forensics cases. Proper training, experience and understating of how the tools
        work are the keys to success.

    A wide range of technical expertise and proper training is required for extracting and
    analyzing binary images with these methods, including locating and connecting to
    JTAG ports, creating customized boot loaders and recreating file systems.

   Chip-Off – Chip-Off methods refer to the acquisition of data directly from a mobile
    device’s flash memory. This extraction requires the physical removal of flash
    memory. Chip-Off provides examiners with the ability to create a binary image of the
    removed chip. In order to provide the examiner with data in a contiguous binary
    format file, the wear-leveling algorithm must be reverse engineered. Once complete,
    the binary image may then be analyzed. This type of acquisition is most closely
    related to physical imaging a hard disk drive as in traditional digital forensics.
    Extensive training is required in order to successfully perform extractions at this level.
    Chip-Off extractions are challenging based on a wide variety of chip types, a myriad
    of raw data formats, and the risk of causing physical damage to the chip during the
    extraction process. Due to the complexities related to Chip-Off, JTAG extraction is
    more common.

   Micro Read – A Micro Read involves recording the physical observation of the gates
    on a NAND or NOR chip with the use of an electron microscope. Due to the extreme
    technicalities involved when performing a Micro Read, this level of acquisition would
