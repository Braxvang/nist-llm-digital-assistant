D.1.5.1.        ISA95, Enterprise-Control System Integration
The ISA95 standards development committee defines the interface between control functions
and other enterprise functions based upon the Purdue Reference Model for Computer Integrated
Manufacturing (CIM). The ISA95 standard grew from the Purdue Enterprise Reference
Architecture (PERA), first published by ISA in 1992. Since then, it has served as a common
reference for defining the interfaces between the enterprise and control networks across all OT
sectors.

D.1.5.2.        ISA99, Industrial Automation and Control Systems Security
The ISA99 standards development committee brings together industrial cybersecurity experts
from across the globe to develop ISA standards on industrial automation and control systems
security. This original and ongoing ISA99 work is being utilized by the International
Electrotechnical Commission in producing the multi-standard ISA/IEC 62443 series, which are
currently organized into four categories: General, Policies and Procedures, System, and
Component.
