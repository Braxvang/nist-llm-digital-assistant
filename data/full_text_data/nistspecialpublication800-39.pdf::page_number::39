decentralized governance structure for reasons such as widely diverging mission/business areas or
need for increased separation between mission/business lines due to sensitivity of the work. The
reasons for decentralization may reflect and likely will influence risk tolerance. For instance, if
there are no partnering organizations meeting the established trust qualifications, less risk-tolerant
organizations may require significantly more supporting evidence of due diligence (e.g., access to
risk assessments, security plans, security assessment reports, risk acceptance decisions) than is
typically required in such situations (see validated trust model in Appendix G).

2.8.2 Trust and Culture
There is also potential interplay between the concepts of risk, trust, and culture. Changes in
mission/business requirements (e.g., a new mission or business requirement to interconnect
information systems for the purpose of sharing information) may require a greater acceptance of
risk than is typical for that organization. In the short term, additional measures may be needed to
establish and/or build trust (e.g., increase transparency between interconnecting organizations).
Such measures facilitate building trust and evolving organizational beliefs and norms over the
longer term. Interaction between trust and culture can also be observed when there are gaps and
overlaps in responsibility among an organizationâ€™s components that may impact the ability for
proposed actions (especially new actions) to be carried out quickly. For example, many
organizations with decentralized governance structures may be slower to embrace change unless
there has been an extensive effort to expand coordination and improve trust among organizational
components. Assume that some organizations are directed by higher authorities (see mandated
trust model in Appendix G) to share information more freely with peer organizations. If the
organizations have a history and culture of tightly controlling information, they may be reluctance
to share information with outside entities, even though directed to do so. In such situations,
organizations may require that partnering organizations provide concrete evidence of the steps
taken to protect the information designated for sharing prior to release.

2.8.3 Investment Strategy and Risk Tolerance
Investment strategies and organizational risk tolerance also have linkages. Organizations may
recognize that there is a need to address advanced persistent threats where adversaries have
achieved some degree of penetration of and foothold within organizational information systems
and the environments in which those systems operate. The strategic investments that are required
to address these types of threats may, in part, be influenced by the risk tolerance of organizations.
Less risk-tolerant organizations may focus investments on information technologies that prevent
adversaries from gaining further access within organizations and/or limiting the damage done to
the organizations even if at the expense of achieving some of the many mission/business benefits
automation can provide. More risk-tolerant organizations may focus investments on information
technologies that provide greater mission/business benefits even if these benefits are achieved at
the expense of adversaries gaining some advantage or benefit from compromising the information
systems and supporting infrastructure.

2.8.4 Culture and Risk Tolerance
A major part of managing risk within organizations is identifying what the organizational risk
tolerance is for a particular type of loss. Risk tolerance can be described as a combination of the
cultural willingness to accept certain types of loss within organizations and the subjective risk-
related actions of senior leaders/executives. Risk-based decisions within organizations often
reflect the blending of the risk tolerance of senior leaders/executives and the risk tolerance that is
embedded within the culture of organizations. In establishing organizational risk tolerance, the
values, beliefs, and norms of organizations are examined in order to understand why risk trade-
