NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                 Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

       Note 2: Change or variance can be based on reasons other than security or without an obvious
       relevance to security.
       CM-3.2 Determine the security aspects of action to coordinate, evaluate, and disposition
              requests for change or requests for variance.
       Note: The security aspects identified are coordinated and evaluated across all impacted
       performance and effectiveness evaluation criteria, as well as the criteria of project plans, cost,
       benefits, risks, quality, and schedule.
       CM-3.3 Submit requests for security review and approval.
       Note: Control boards may or may not be security focused. For a non-security control board
       activity, security should be reviewed to verify that a request has no security aspects.
       CM-3.4 Track and manage the security aspects of approved changes to the baseline, requests
              for change, and requests for variance.

CM-4   PERFORM CONFIGURATION STATUS ACCOUNTING
       CM-4.1 Develop and maintain security-relevant configuration management status information
              for system elements, baselines, approved changes, and releases.
       Note: The information includes security certification, accreditation, authorization, or approval
       decisions for a system, system element, baseline, or release.
       CM-4.2 Capture, store, and report security-relevant configuration management data.

CM-5   PERFORM CONFIGURATION EVALUATION
       CM-5.1 Identify the need for secure configuration and configuration management verification
              activities and audits.
       CM-5.2 Verify that the product or service configuration meets the security-relevant
              configuration requirements.
       Note: This is performed by comparing security requirements, constraints, and waivers
       (variances) with the results of formal verification activities.
       CM-5.3 Monitor the secure incorporation of approved configuration changes.
       CM-5.4 Perform configuration and configuration management security verification activities
              and audits to establish the security aspects of product baselines.
       Note: This includes the security aspects of the functional configuration audit (FCA) that are
       focused on functional and performance capabilities and of the physical configuration audit (PCA)
       that are focused on system conformance to operational and configuration information items.
       CM-5.5 Record the security aspects of the configuration management audit and other
              configuration evaluation results and disposition action items.
