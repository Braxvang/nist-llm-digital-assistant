     IMPERATIVE 6 – Enhancing Identity and Access Management



              •   Personal Identity Verification (PIV).54 As charged by Homeland Security
                  Presidential Directive-12, NIST developed and maintains the Federal
                  Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for personal identity verification (PIV)
                  of federal employees and contractors (FIPS 201).55 In FY18, the agency revised
                  its guideline for the use of PIV credentials for physical access (SP 800-116)56
                  and sought comments on a draft report demonstrating how commercial
                  technologies can be used to issue and use PIV credentials on mobile devices.
                  NIST also requested public comments SP 1800-12,57 a guide that shows how
                  to leverage identity-proofing and vetting results of current and valid PIV
                  credentials to enable two-factor authentication to information technology
                  systems via mobile devices. In FY19, NIST plans to revise FIPS 201 to reflect
                  technology changes and evolving practices regarding authentication using
                  PIV credentials.
              •   Policy Machine – Next Generation Access Control. NIST is developing
                  an Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) framework called the “Policy
                  Machine,” which is designed to align with a Next Generation Access Control
                  emerging standard from the American National Standards Institute/
                  International Committee for Information Technology Standards (ANSI/
                  INCITS). In FY18, NIST updated its Policy Machine Web Services through
                  GitHub as an open-source distribution to support widespread experimentation
                  of web-based applications.
              •   Access Control and Privilege Management. NIST continued to provide
                  improved guidance for dealing with access control and privilege management
                  issues. This included publishing an Attribute-Based Access Control textbook;
                  researching a general access control mechanism for cloud computing services;
                  enhancing conformance verification for access control policies; revising SP
                  1800-958—a guide that shows how to manage disparate identity and access
                  mechanisms and systems as a comprehensive identity and access management
                  system; and developing SP 1800-1859—a guide that shows a way to detect
                  and protect against IT user accounts that have administrative or “super user”
                  privileges being misused. In FY19, NIST plans to finalize SP 1800-9 and continue
                  its work with private sector communities of interest to align its guidance and
                  capability demonstrations with the needs of industry and private citizens.
