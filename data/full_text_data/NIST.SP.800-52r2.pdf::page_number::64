Appendix Fâ€”Determining the Need for TLS 1.0 and 1.1

Enabling TLS 1.0 or 1.1 when they are not needed may leave systems and users vulnerable to
attacks (such as the BEAST attack and the Klima attack [65]). However, disabling older versions
of TLS when there is a need may deny access to users who are unable to install or upgrade to a
client that is capable of TLS 1.3 or 1.2.
The system administrator must consider the benefits and risks of using TLS 1.0 or 1.1, in the
context of applications supported by the server, and decide whether the benefits of using TLS 1.0
or 1.1 outweigh the risks. This decision should be driven by the service(s) running on the server
and the versions supported by clients accessing the server. Services that do not access high-value
information (such as personally identifiable information or financial data) may benefit from
using TLS 1.0 by increasing accessibility with little increased risk. On the other hand, services
that do access high-value data may increase the likelihood of a breach for relatively little gain in
terms of accessibility. The decision to support TLS 1.0 or 1.1 must be technically assessed on a
case-by-case basis. This is to ensure that supporting older TLS versions is absolutely necessary
and that associated risks and business implications are understood and accepted.
These guidelines do not give specific recommendations on steps that can be taken to make this
determination. There are tools available (such as the Data Analytics Program [69]) that can
provide information to system administrators that can be used to assess the impact of supporting
or not supporting TLS versions prior to TLS 1.2. For example, DAP data on visitor OS and
browser versions can help administrators determine what percentage of visitors to agency
websites cannot negotiate recommended TLS versions by default.
Many products that implement TLS 1.1 also implement TLS 1.2. Because of this, it may be
unnecessary for servers to support TLS 1.1. Administrators can determine whether TLS 1.1 is
needed by assessing whether it must support connections with clients where TLS 1.1 is the
highest version available.
