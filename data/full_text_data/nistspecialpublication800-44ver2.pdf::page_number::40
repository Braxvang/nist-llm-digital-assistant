                                                                           GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



     authentication mechanisms and devices are used, the organization’s policy should be changed
     accordingly, if necessary. Some organizational policies may already require the use of strong
     authentication mechanisms.

As mentioned earlier, attackers using network sniffers can easily capture passwords passed across a
network in clear text. However, passwords are economical and appropriate if properly protected while in
transit. Organizations should implement authentication and encryption technologies, such as Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure Shell (SSH), or virtual private networking
(VPN), to protect passwords during transmission. Requiring user-friendly server authentication to be
used with encryption technologies reduces the likelihood of successful man-in-the-middle and spoofing
attacks.

4.1.4    Configure Resource Controls Appropriately

All commonly used modern server OSs provide the capability to specify access privileges individually for
files, directories, devices, and other computational resources. By carefully setting access controls and
denying personnel unauthorized access, the Web server administrator can reduce intentional and
unintentional security breaches. For example, denying read access to files and directories helps to protect
confidentiality of information, and denying unnecessary write (modify) access can help maintain the
integrity of information. Limiting the execution privilege of most system-related tools to authorized
system administrators can prevent users from making configuration changes that could reduce security. It
also can restrict the attacker’s ability to use those tools to attack the system or other systems on the
network.

4.1.5    Install and Configure Additional Security Controls

OSs often do not include all of the security controls necessary to secure the OS, services, and applications
adequately. In such cases, administrators need to select, install, and configure additional software to
provide the missing controls. Commonly needed controls include the following:

 Anti-malware software, such as antivirus software, anti-spyware software, and rootkit detectors, to
  protect the local OS from malware and to detect and eradicate any infections that occur. 21 Examples
  of when anti-malware software would be helpful include a Web administrator bringing infected media
  to the Web server and a network service worm contacting the server and infecting it.

 Host-based intrusion detection and prevention software, to detect attacks performed against the Web
  server, including DoS attacks. Section 7.2.2 contains additional information on host-based intrusion
  detection and prevention software.

 Host-based firewalls, to protect the server from unauthorized access. 22

 Patch management software to ensure that vulnerabilities are addressed promptly. Patch management
  software can be used only to apply patches or also to identify new vulnerabilities in the Web server’s
  OSs, services, and applications.
