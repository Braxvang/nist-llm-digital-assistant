Elliptic curves in FIPS 186-4 that do not meet the current bit security requirements put forward
in NIST SP 800-57, Part 1, Recommendation for Key Management: Part 1 â€“ General [SP_800-
57], are now legacy-use. They may be used to process already protected information (e.g.,
decrypt or verify) but not to apply protection to information (e.g., encrypt or sign). Also see
NIST SP 800-131A, Transitions: Recommendation for Transitioning the Use of Cryptographic
Algorithms and Key Lengths [SP_800-131A].
Each elliptic curve specified in this recommendation is allowed for specific NIST approved
cryptographic functions. The allowed usages for each curve are summarized in Table 2.

3.1.3. Choice of Basis for Binary Fields
To describe the arithmetic of a binary field, it is first necessary to specify how a bit string is to be
interpreted. This is referred to as choosing a basis for the field. There are two common types of
bases: a polynomial basis and a normal basis.
