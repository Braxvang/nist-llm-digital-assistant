                                                                              GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



Some Web server administrators also install one or more forms of host-based intrusion detection or
intrusion prevention software on their servers. For example, file integrity checking software can identify
changes to critical system files.

When planning security controls, Web server administrators should consider the resources that the
security controls will consume. A server’s performance could degrade if it does not have enough memory
and processing capacity for the controls.

4.2     Security Testing the Operating System

Periodic security testing of the OS is a vital way to identify vulnerabilities and to ensure that the existing
security precautions are effective. Common methods for testing OSs include vulnerability scanning and
penetration testing. Vulnerability scanning usually entails using an automated vulnerability scanner to
scan a host or group of hosts on a network for application, network, and OS vulnerabilities. Penetration
testing is a testing process designed to compromise a network using the tools and methodologies of an
attacker. It involves iteratively identifying and exploiting the weakest areas of the network to gain access
to the remainder of the network, eventually compromising the overall security of the network.
Vulnerability scanning should be conducted periodically, at least weekly to monthly, and penetration
testing should be conducted at least annually. Because both of these testing techniques are also applicable
to testing the Web server application, they are discussed in detail in Section 9.4. 23

Testing generally should not be performed on the production Web server itself. As mentioned in Section
4.1.1, testing for patches and changes to the system should be performed on a separate system; this same
testing environment should be used to perform security testing of the Web server.

4.3     Checklist for Securing the Web Server Operating System

             Completed                                               Action
                               Patch and upgrade OS
                               Create, document, and implement a patching process
                               Keep the servers disconnected from networks or on an isolated network that
                               severely restricts communications until all patches have been installed
                               Identify and install all necessary patches and upgrades to the OS
                               Identify and install all necessary patches and upgrades to applications and
                               services included with the OS
                               Identify and mitigate any unpatched vulnerabilities
                               Remove or disable unnecessary services and applications
                               Disable or remove unnecessary services and applications
                               Configure OS user authentication
                               Remove or disable unneeded default accounts and groups
                               Disable non-interactive accounts
                               Create the user groups for the particular computer
                               Create the user accounts for the particular computer
                               Check the organization’s password policy and set account passwords
                               appropriately (e.g., length, complexity)
