                                                                        INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

                        4. No other contactless card is within the proximity of the reader.
                        5. Secure messaging session keys have been established and secure
                           messaging is used in the test scenario.
 Test Scenario          1. Send SELECT card command without secure messaging with
                           â€¢ AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 10 00 01 00'
                        2. Perform steps 1-5 of test C.3.2.1 using the '0C' CLA byte
 Expected Result(s)     1. The command returns the application property template with the
                           status word '90 00' at the end.
                        2. Referenced steps 1-5 from C.3.2.1 return an error status word for
                           all key references.
 Postcondition(s)       N/A


C.3.2.4        Virtual Contact Interface
 Purpose               Validates that the GENERATE ASYMMETRIC KEY PAIR command
                       cannot be issued through the VCI.

                       2. AS05.03
 Precondition(s)       1. The existing contents of the public key data object have been
                          recorded.
                       2. The IUT is placed within the reading range of the contactless
                          reader.
                       3. There exists a valid PC/SC connection between the test system
                          and the contactless reader.
                       4. No other contactless card is within the proximity of the reader.
                       5. The PIV Card Application is the currently selected application on
                          the card.
                       6. There exists a valid VCI connection to the card.
 Test Scenario         Perform steps 1-5 of test C.3.2.1 using the '0C' CLA byte
 Expected Result(s) Referenced steps 1-5 from C.3.2.1 return an error status word for all
                       key references.

C.3.3         Secure Messaging Error Handling
The following tests are applicable to all cards that support secure messaging as specified in NIST
SP 800-73-4 Part 2 Section 4.

C.3.3.1       Contact Interface
 Purpose             Validates that the card handles secure messaging error conditions
                     properly.
