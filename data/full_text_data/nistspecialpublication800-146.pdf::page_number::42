                                                            CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



sharing of roles and responsibilities between customers and cloud providers. The following are additional
recommendations for SaaS systems:

 Data Protection. Analyze the SaaS provider’s data protection mechanisms, data location
  configuration and database organization/transaction processing technologies, and assess whether they
  will meet the confidentiality, compliance, integrity and availability needs of the organization that will
  be using the subscribed SaaS application.
 Client Device/Application Protection. Consistent with the FIPS 199 impact level of the data being
  processed, protect the cloud consumer's client device (e.g., a computer running a Web browser) so as
  to control the exposure to attacks.
 Encryption. Require that strong encryption using a robust algorithm with keys of required strength
  be used for Web sessions whenever the subscribed SaaS application requires the confidentiality of
  application interaction and data transfers. Also require that the same diligence be applied to stored
  data. Federal agencies must employ government-approved cryptographic algorithms for encryption
  and digital signature, and the implementations need to be FIPS 140-2 validated. Understand how
  cryptographic keys are managed and who has access to them. Ensure that cryptographic keys are
  adequately protected.
 Secure Data Deletion. Require that cloud providers offer a mechanism for reliably deleting data on a
  consumer's request.
