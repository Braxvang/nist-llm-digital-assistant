tariffs/quotas monitoring processes. Consequently, the confidentiality impact level associated
with tariffs/quotas monitoring information is high.

Intelligence information is included in national security systems. National security information
and national security systems are outside the scope of this guideline.

Some information that has supported a merchandise inspection process might be of higher
sensitivity. The unauthorized disclosure of this information might jeopardize the success of
future merchandise inspection processes. The consequent threat to agency image or reputations
may cause a serious adverse effect on an agencyâ€™s mission capability. Consequently, the general
confidentiality impact level associated with merchandise inspection information is high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for global trade information is high.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of global trade information depends
on whether the information is time-critical.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting export promotion information
may adversely affect mission operations and result in potentially serious economic repercussions.

Trade agreements that have been implemented are generally matters of public record. Therefore,
the specific negotiated terms, etc., must be accurately recorded.

The modification of merchandise inspection information may result in significant financial
consequences to an importer or exporter whose shipment is in question and may adversely affect
mission operations and result in potentially serious economic repercussions. The results of
completed inspections are matters of public record and must be accurately recorded.

For tariffs/quotas monitoring information, the requirement for adequate means to detect data
corruption is high. This information is used in policy and strategic analysis, and the accuracy of
this statistical information is critical. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information
affecting tariffs/quotas monitoring information may adversely affect mission operations and
result in potentially catastrophic economic repercussions.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
global trade information is high.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to global trade information.
