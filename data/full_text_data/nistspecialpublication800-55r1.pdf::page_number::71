Goal              •    Strategic Goal: Accelerate the development and use of an electronic information
                       infrastructure.
                  •    Information Security Goal: Allocate sufficient resources to adequately protect
                       electronic information infrastructure.
Measure           Percentage of mobile computers and devices that perform all cryptographic operations
                  using FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules operating in approved modes of
                  operation
                  NIST SP 800-53 Control – SC-13: Use of Validated Cryptography
Measure Type      Implementation
