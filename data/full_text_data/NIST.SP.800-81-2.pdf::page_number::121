Since this is the public key, no new security risks are introduced. However, the basic security
recommendations for configuration files (see Section 8) should be followed. The risk is an attacker may
be able to change the key material to point to a key that the attacker controls. However, this would
involve other successful attacks (such as redirecting queries as well) to be fully effective, so it is not
considered a high risk.


Checklist item 51 : Validator administrator must configure one or more trust anchors for each validator
in the enterprise.



13.3 Maintaining Trust Anchors

Once the trust anchors are initially configured, the administrator must set up a means to monitor that the
key is still in use for the give zone, and perform updates as required. Often, zone administrators will
perform key rollovers (see Section 11.2) on keys that some clients use as trust anchors. Since there is no
means in DNS for servers to contact clients to inform them their trust anchors are out of date, clients must
perform their own checks to insure they have an up-to-date list of trust anchors.

The IETF has specified a way for signed zones to signal that a key rollover is underway so clients that
have the current zone key can successfully migrate to the new key. This method is specified in RFC 5011
[RFC5011], and some DNSSEC validators that implement this specification can rollover trust anchors in
an automated fashion.

Validator administrators should be cogent that not every zone uses the rollover method specified in RFC
5011, and not every implementation can perform automated trust anchor rollovers so regular polling
should be done to insure that the validator has the most current key installed as a trust anchor. This could
be done via a normal query for the DNSKEY RRset and look for a new key, or by regularly checking the
same method the original key was obtained. For example, the DNS root zone key is maintained on
website 15 that can be routinely checked (manually or via an automated script) for updates.

How often these checks need to be performed is difficult to determine, but some hints may be found the
TTL and RRSIG validity period of the DNSKEY RRset that contains the key used as the trust anchor.
Using these values and understanding the timed steps of a key rollover (See section 11.2), a validator
administrator can calculate the minimum time between checks.

If a key rollover is detected as in progress, or a new key is anounced, validator administrators should
update the validator configuration file with the new key material. This process may be similar to the
initial configuration or different, depending on the software used as the validator.


Checklist item 52: The validator administrator regularly checks each trust anchor to ensure that it is still
in use, and updates the trust anchor as necessary.
