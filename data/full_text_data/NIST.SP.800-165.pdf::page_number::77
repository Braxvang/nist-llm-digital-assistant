 Î Universal Credential Revocation
 Through NIST’s identity-related project and hosting
the IDTrust Symposium, credential revocation has
emerged as one of the key gaps in progressing secure
authentication online. In federated environments,
credential revocation has traditionally been managed
by the credential issuer. In an effort to improve
credential revocation mechanisms across federations
and effectively mitigate credential misuse, NIST
researchers are exploring the broader scope of
credential revocation, where all parties contribute
to and participate in credential revocation. In this
model, service providers give feedback on a credential
reliability score based on detected credential misuse.
The credential holder and Identity Provider, on the
other hand, receive feedback notifications and are
able to immediately suspend or revoke the credential
should the score reach an unacceptable level. Lastly,
other federation services can consult scores and status
to determine the suitability of a presented credential
with an associated reliability score.

 In FY2012, NIST scientists published an initial
draft NISTIR 7817 titled A Credential Reliability
and Revocation Model that describes and classifies
the different types of identity providers serving
federations. For each classification, the document
identifies perceived improvements or gaps when the
credentials are used in authentication services and
recommends countermeasures to eliminate some of
the identified gaps. With the countermeasures as the
basis, the document suggests a Universal Credential
Reliability and Revocation Services (URRS) model
that strives to improve authentication services for
federations where all parties contribute to and
participate in credential revocation and where the
service can be tailored to the type of (classification
of) identity providers it accommodates.

  After the public comment period, NISTIR 7817 was
further revised to accommodate the comments and
final approval is anticipated in FY2013.
