2547               REQUIREMENT: 03.13.12

2548               ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
2549               Determine if:
2550               A.03.13.12.a: remote activation of collaborative computing devices and applications is
2551               prohibited.
2552               A.03.13.12.b: an explicit indication of use is provided to users who are physically present at
2553               the devices.
