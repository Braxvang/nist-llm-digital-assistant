                    The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



3.       SCAP Content Requirements and Recommendations

This section defines the SCAP 1.2 content syntax, structure, and development requirements and
recommendations for SCAP-conformant content and products. Organizations are encouraged to adopt the
optional recommendations to promote stronger interoperability and greater content consistency. The first
part of the section discusses SCAP source data streams. The middle of the section groups requirements
and recommendations by specification: XCCDF, OVAL, OCIL, CPE, CCE, CVE, CVSS, and CCSS, in
that order. Finally, the last part of the section discusses applying XML digital signatures to source data
streams.

3.1      SCAP Source Data Stream
This section discusses SCAP source data streams only; SCAP result data streams are discussed in Section
4.4 as part of the requirements for SCAP processing.
An SCAP source data stream collection is composed of SCAP data streams and SCAP source
components. See http://scap.nist.gov/revision/1.2/#example for a sample of an SCAP source data stream
collection and its sections. The components section contains an unbounded number of SCAP source
components, each consisting of data expressed using one or more of the SCAP specifications. The data
streams section contains one or more source data streams, each of which references the source
components in the components section that compose the data stream. This model allows source
components to be reused across multiple data streams. Many data streams are allowed in a data stream
collection to allow grouping of related or similar source data streams. For example, NIST currently
distributes the United States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB)10 as a series of SCAP
bundles. Source data streams that are similar or related (e.g., Microsoft Windows 7 content and Microsoft
Windows 7 Firewall content) may be bundled into the same source data stream collection. Figure 1 shows
the relationship between data stream collections, data streams, and components.




                                       Figure 1 - SCAP Data Stream Collection

In Figure 1, data stream1 points to xccdf1, xccdf2, oval1, oval3, cpe dict1, and cpe dict2. data stream2
points to xccdf2, oval2, oval3, and cpe dict2. Each data stream is a collection of links to the components
that they reference; each logical link encapsulates the information required to allow the content consumer
