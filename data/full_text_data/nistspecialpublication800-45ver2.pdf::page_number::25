2.4.3   Proprietary Mailbox Access Mechanisms

Proprietary mailbox access protocols are designed to work within closed messaging environments.
Microsoft Exchange and Lotus Notes are examples of messaging systems that use proprietary mailbox
access protocols. These proprietary protocols offer additional functionality when used with their
associated clients. Nearly all proprietary messaging systems support standard protocols, including SMTP,
POP, and IMAP, in order to interoperate with other types of MTAs and MUAs. Organizations must
decide for themselves whether it is appropriate to support proprietary protocols in their mail clients and
servers. As mentioned earlier, regardless of whether they are standard or proprietary, most access
protocols default to weak authentication mechanisms (unencrypted authentication information).
Therefore, organizations need to configure the access protocols to support stronger forms of
authentication.

2.4.4   Web-Based Mail Access

Web-based mail applications, also known as Webmail applications, are increasingly being used as a
means of email service delivery, because Web browsers that enable access to the client are available on
nearly every Internet-enabled device. A user simply runs a Web browser and connects to a Web site that
hosts the Web-based mail application. The connection is made using either Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) or HTTP over Transport Layer Security (TLS), also known as HTTPS. HTTPS encrypts the
communications, which protects both authentication information and email message content. HTTP alone
does not offer any protection, so organizations should consider using HTTPS for Web-based mail
application communications.

Web-based mail applications incorporate much of the mail-handling functionality of traditional mail
clients and communicate with their associated mail servers using the same mailbox access protocols
described earlierâ€”SMTP, POP, and IMAP, as well as proprietary protocols. The mailbox access
protocols are used between the Web servers and mail servers only; the protocols are not carried between
the Web servers and Web browsers.
