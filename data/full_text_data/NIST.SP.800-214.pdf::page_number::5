NIST continues to coordinate a National Cybersecurity Awareness and Education Program that
includes activities such as the widespread dissemination of cybersecurity technical standards
and best practices; efforts to make cybersecurity best practices usable by a variety of individuals
and stakeholders; increasing public awareness of cybersecurity, cyber safety, and cyber ethics;
increasing the understanding of the benefits of ensuring effective risk management of
information technology and the methods to mitigate and to remediate vulnerabilities;
supporting formal cybersecurity education programs at all levels to prepare and improve a
skilled cybersecurity workforce; and promoting initiatives to evaluate and forecast future
cybersecurity workforce needs of the Federal Government and develop strategies for
recruitment, training, and retention.
National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education
The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) is a partnership among government,
academia, and the private sector. NICE is focused on cybersecurity education, training,
and workforce development. NIST's leadership of the program helps position it to
support the countryâ€™s ability to address current and future cybersecurity challenges through
standards and best practices.
NICE's mission is to energize and promote a robust network and ecosystem of
cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development. This mission supports the
vision of helping to secure the nation by increasing the number of skilled cybersecurity
professionals.
