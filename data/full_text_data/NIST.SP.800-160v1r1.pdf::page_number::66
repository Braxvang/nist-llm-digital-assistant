NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                           Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems

architecture view
A work product expressing the architecture of a system from the perspective of specific system concerns. [71]

architecture viewpoint
A work product establishing the conventions for the construction, interpretation, and use of architecture views to
frame specific system concerns. [71]

artifact
Work products that are produced and used during a project to capture and convey information (e.g., models, source
code). [72]

aspect
The parts, features, and characteristics used to describe, consider, interpret, or assess something.

asset
Anything that has value to a person or organization. [24]
         Note 1: Assets have interrelated characteristics that include value, criticality, and the degree to which they
         are relied upon to achieve organizational mission and business objectives. From these characteristics,
         appropriate protections are to be engineered into solutions employed by the organization.
         Note 2: An asset may be tangible (e.g., physical item such as hardware, software, firmware, computing
         platform, network device, or other technology components) or intangible (e.g., information, data,
         trademark, copyright, patent, intellectual property, image, or reputation).

assurance
Grounds for justified confidence that a claim has been or will be achieved. [61]
         Note 1: Assurance is typically obtained relative to a set of specific claims. The scope and focus of such
         claims may vary (e.g., security claims, safety claims), and the claims themselves may be interrelated.
         Note 2: Assurance is obtained through techniques and methods that generate credible evidence to
         substantiate claims.

assurance case
A reasoned, auditable artifact created that supports the contention that its top-level claim (or set of claims) is
satisfied, including systematic argumentation and its underlying evidence and explicit assumptions that support the
claim(s). [61]

assurance evidence
The information upon which decisions regarding assurance, trustworthiness, and risk of the solution are
substantiated.
         Note: Assurance evidence is specific to an agreed-upon set of claims. The security perspective focuses on
         assurance evidence for security-relevant claims, whereas other engineering disciplines may have their own
         focus (e.g., safety).

availability
Property of being accessible and usable on demand by an authorized entity. [73]

baseline
Formally approved version of a configuration item, regardless of media, formally designated and fixed at a specific
time during the configuration itemâ€™s life cycle. [74]
         Note: The engineering process generates many artifacts that are maintained as a baseline over the course of
         the engineering effort and after its completion. The configuration control processes of the engineering
         effort manage baselined artifacts. Examples include stakeholder requirements baseline, system
         requirements baseline, architecture/design baseline, and configuration baseline.
