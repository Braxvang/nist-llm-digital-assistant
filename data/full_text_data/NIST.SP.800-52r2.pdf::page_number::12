NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                          GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


allowing a variety of options for interoperability is not necessary. The use of an appropriate
subset of the capabilities specified in these guidelines may be acceptable in such cases.

The scope is further limited to TLS when used in conjunction with TCP/IP. For example,
Datagram TLS (DTLS), which operates over datagram protocols, is outside the scope of these
guidelines. NIST may issue separate guidelines for DTLS at a later date.

1.2.1    Alternative Configurations

TLS may be used to secure the communications of a wide variety of applications in a diverse set
of operating environments. As such, there is not a single configuration that will work well for all
scenarios. These guidelines attempt to provide general-use recommendations. However, the
needs of an agency or application may differ from general needs. Deviations from these
guidelines are acceptable, provided that agencies and system administrators assess and
accept the risks associated with alternative configurations in terms of both security and
interoperability.

1.3     Document Conventions

Throughout this document, key words are used to identify requirements. The key words “shall,”
“shall not,” “should,” and “should not” are used. These words are a subset of the IETF Request
for Comments (RFC) 2119 key words, and have been chosen based on convention in other
normative documents [15]. In addition to the key words, the words “need,” “can,” and “may” are
used in this document but are not intended to be normative. The key words “NIST-approved”
and “NIST-recommended” are used to indicate that a scheme or algorithm is described in a
Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) or is recommended by NIST in a Special
Publication (SP).

The recommendations in this document are grouped by server recommendations and client
recommendations. Section 3 provides detailed guidance for the selection and configuration of
TLS servers. Section 4 provides detailed guidance for the selection, configuration, and use of
TLS clients.
