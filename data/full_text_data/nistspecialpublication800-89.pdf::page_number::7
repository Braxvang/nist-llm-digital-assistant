2     Authority
This document has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information
Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347.
NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum
requirements, for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and
assets, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems.
This recommendation is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency Information
Systems, as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.
This Recommendation has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by
non-governmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright
(attribution would be appreciated by NIST.)
Nothing in this Recommendation should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines
made mandatory and binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under
statutory authority. Nor should this Recommendation be interpreted as altering or
superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB,
or any other federal official.
Conformance testing for implementations of this Recommendation will be conducted
within the framework of the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP), a joint
effort of NIST and the Communications Security Establishment of the Government of
Canada.
