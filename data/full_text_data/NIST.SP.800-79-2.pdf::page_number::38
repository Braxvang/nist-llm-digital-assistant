Special Publication 800-79-2                            Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                         and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



responsible for the implementation of that control (the organization or an external service
provider) and if the issuer control is at the organizational or facility level.

 Activation/Issuance Process

  Issuer Control Identifier— AI-7
 Control Description— Before the PIV Card is provided to the applicant, the issuer performs a
 1:1 biometric match of the applicant against biometrics available on the PIV Card or in the
 chain-of-trust. The 1:1 biometric match requires either a match of fingerprint(s) or, if
 unavailable, other optional biometric data that are available. If the match is unsuccessful, or if no
 biometric data is available, the cardholder provides two identity source documents (as specified
 in FIPS 201-2, Section 2.7), and an attending operator inspects these and compares the
 cardholder with the facial image printed on the PIV Card.

 ASSESSMENT DETAILS

          Assessment Method(s):
          Review: Operations Plan
          Observe: Activation/Issuance Process
 Assessment Result— Partially Satisfied
 Assessment Findings— There is operational evidence that a 1:1 biometric match is carried out
 before the card is released to the applicant.
 Assessment Deficiency and Potential Impact— The requirement to carry out this task is not
 documented clearly enough in the operations plan. Although personnel are knowledgeable about
 this requirement, and the task was observed to be performed correctly during card issuance, the
 lack of documentation could be a problem if there is turnover in staff. Alternate processes when
 fingerprints are unavailable are not in place.
 Recommendation— Update the issuance process description within the operations plan to
 include a clear description of this task in the process and develop alternate processes for issuance
 when fingerprints are not available.
