GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



       Are there requirements (e.g., compliance efforts, regulations) that mandate certain tests be
        performed on a specific schedule or frequency, such as compliance with NIST SP 800-53?

       When was the last time that this component, system, or group of components and systems was
        tested? Have there been any significant changes or updates since the completion of the last test?

Tests are usually conducted after personnel have been trained on the use of the systems or components
being tested and before the systems or components become operational, to ensure they do not adversely
affect the security posture or other operational aspects of the organization. If personnel have not yet been
trained, system testing should be delayed until the training has been completed. After operational use has
begun, periodic testing should be conducted to ensure the continued proper and secure use of the systems
or components. Comprehensive tests should also be scheduled periodically to ensure that the IT plans are
reasonable, effective, and complete, and that personnel know what their roles and responsibilities are in
the conduct of the plans. High personnel turnover might necessitate more frequent testing to maintain the
level of preparedness the organization requires.

The scheduling of tests should also consider factors such as available resources and the potential impact
on the organization. It is important that when a test is being scheduled, that senior managers are notified
and the potential impact on operations assessed to determine the best time to conduct the test. For
example, conducting a test that might affect the operations of the organization might not be wise during
known peak operational periods. Although scheduling comprehensive tests when many employees are on
vacation or on holiday breaks might have a minimal impact on operations, it also could limit the number
of available personnel. Ensuring that senior leadership in the organization has agreed to the test,
especially for comprehensive tests, is an essential step in the development of the test.

Testing schedules might also be affected by factors external to the organization itself. For example,
compliance and regulatory issues might dictate that certain tests be performed on a periodic basis.
Another example is environmental and safety issues; a test requiring that staff relocate operations from
one facility to another might be better accomplished when the weather is not unpredictable so that
employees do not have to travel under extreme conditions, such as a blizzard.

6.2      Design the Test Event

Once the need to conduct a test has been established, the TT&E program coordinator should create a test
design team 21 to design each specific test. Several factors can have a significant bearing on the design of
the test, including the level of the test (component, system, or comprehensive), the organizational entities
involved, and the scope of the test. These factors can affect the lead time required to develop the test, the
level of complexity for the test, and the length of time the test will take. At an early stage in the design
process, the personnel who will participate in the test should be identified and the senior managers for
these affected areas should be contacted. Sections 6.2.1 through 6.2.6 describe the major steps in the
event design process.

6.2.1      Determine the Scope

The scope of the test should be determined based on current system or security requirements and any
potential compliance or regulatory requirements. The scope of the test is directly shaped by the type of
test. Component tests are more focused and generally involve fewer individuals and organizational
entities. System tests are broader in scope and include more personnel and multiple components.

      The test design team should include a team leader and subject matter experts for each of the areas to be tested; they should
      develop the content of the test cooperatively.
