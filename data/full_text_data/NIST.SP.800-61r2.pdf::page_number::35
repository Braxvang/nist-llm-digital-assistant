 Loss or Theft of Equipment: The loss or theft of a computing device or media used by the
  organization, such as a laptop, smartphone, or authentication token.
 Other: An attack that does not fit into any of the other categories.
This section focuses on recommended practices for handling any type of incident. It is outside the scope
of this publication to give specific advice based on the attack vectors; such guidelines would be provided
in separate publications addressing other incident handling topics, such as NIST SP 800-83 on malware
incident prevention and handling.
3.2.2   Signs of an Incident

For many organizations, the most challenging part of the incident response process is accurately detecting
and assessing possible incidents—determining whether an incident has occurred and, if so, the type,
extent, and magnitude of the problem. What makes this so challenging is a combination of three factors:

 Incidents may be detected through many different means, with varying levels of detail and fidelity.
  Automated detection capabilities include network-based and host-based IDPSs, antivirus software,
  and log analyzers. Incidents may also be detected through manual means, such as problems reported
  by users. Some incidents have overt signs that can be easily detected, whereas others are almost
  impossible to detect.
 The volume of potential signs of incidents is typically high—for example, it is not uncommon for an
  organization to receive thousands or even millions of intrusion detection sensor alerts per day. (See
  Section 3.2.4 for information on analyzing such alerts.)
 Deep, specialized technical knowledge and extensive experience are necessary for proper and
  efficient analysis of incident-related data.
Signs of an incident fall into one of two categories: precursors and indicators. A precursor is a sign that
an incident may occur in the future. An indicator is a sign that an incident may have occurred or may be
occurring now.

Most attacks do not have any identifiable or detectable precursors from the target’s perspective. If
precursors are detected, the organization may have an opportunity to prevent the incident by altering its
security posture to save a target from attack. At a minimum, the organization could monitor activity
involving the target more closely. Examples of precursors are:
 Web server log entries that show the usage of a vulnerability scanner
 An announcement of a new exploit that targets a vulnerability of the organization’s mail server
 A threat from a group stating that the group will attack the organization.
While precursors are relatively rare, indicators are all too common. Too many types of indicators exist to
exhaustively list them, but some examples are listed below:

 A network intrusion detection sensor alerts when a buffer overflow attempt occurs against a database
  server.
 Antivirus software alerts when it detects that a host is infected with malware.
 A system administrator sees a filename with unusual characters.
 A host records an auditing configuration change in its log.
