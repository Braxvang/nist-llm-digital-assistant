5.3     Discovery Phase

The discovery phase is the first phase in the process to establish RSNAs. During this phase, STAs
discover the existence of a network with which to communicate. STAs locate and identify APs through
the APs’ periodic transmission of Beacon frames. 51 A Beacon frame contains a timestamp, beacon
interval, and capability information, which includes supported data rates and the SSID. Figure 5-5 depicts
an ESS with three APs; each has a different SSID. Because the STA shown with the ellipse is within the
range of all three APs, it can identify and connect (associate) with any of them.

During the discovery phase, STAs and APs negotiate several things, including the SSID, supported data
rates, and other technical operating parameters related to reliable communication, as well as a security
policy. In general, 802.11i does not support extensive negotiation The AP describes the options that it
supports, and only clients that are configured for compatible options will attempt to connect. Many APs
and STAs can only store a single configuration at a time. Section 5.3.1 provides a detailed explanation of
the security policy negotiation process. Section 5.3.2 shows how frames used for negotiation flow
between STAs and APs during the discovery phase.

      Beacon frames may be configured to transmit periodically from approximately every millisecond to every 66 seconds.
