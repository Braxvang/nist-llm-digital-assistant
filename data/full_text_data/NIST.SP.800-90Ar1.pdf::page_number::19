NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                             Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                    Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


      Symbol                                          Meaning
0xab                 Hexadecimal notation that is used to define a byte (i.e., eight bits) of
                     information, where a and b each specify four bits of information and
                     have values from the range {0, 1, 2,…F}. For example, 0xc6 is used to
                     represent 11000110, where c is 1100, and 6 is 0110.
0x                   A string of x zero bits.



6 Document Organization
This Recommendation is organized as follows:
     ⎯ Section 7 provides a functional model for a DRBG that uses a DRBG mechanism and
        discusses the major components of the DRBG mechanism.
     ⎯ Section 8 provides concepts and general requirements for the implementation and use of a
        DRBG mechanism.
     ⎯ Section 9 specifies the functions of a DRBG mechanism that were introduced in Section 8.
        These functions use the DRBG algorithms specified in Section 10.
     ⎯ Section 10 specifies approved DRBG algorithms. Algorithms have been specified that are
        based on the hash functions specified in [FIPS 180], and the block cipher algorithms
        specified in [FIPS 197] and [SP 800-67] (AES and TDEA, respectively).
     ⎯ Section 11 addresses assurance issues for DRBG mechanisms, including documentation
        requirements, and implementation validation and health testing.
This Recommendation also includes the following appendices:
     ⎯ Appendix A provides conversion routines.
     ⎯ Appendix B provides example pseudocode for each DRBG mechanism. Examples of the
        values computed for the DRBGs using each approved cryptographic algorithm and key
        size are available at http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/examples.html under the entries
        for SP 800-90A.
     ⎯ Appendix C provides a discussion on DRBG mechanism selection.
     ⎯ Appendix D provides references.
     ⎯ Appendix E provides a list of modifications to SP 800-90A since it was first published.
