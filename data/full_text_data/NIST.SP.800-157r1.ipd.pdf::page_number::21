      NIST SP 800-157r1 ipd                               Derived PIV Credentials (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


558   3.   Technical Requirements
559   This section is normative.
560   This section describes technical requirements for both PKI-based and non-PKI-based
561   derived PIV credentials and associated authenticators.
562   While the following sections focus on credential and authenticator requirements, the
563   verifier is required to meet the corresponding verifier requirements in [SP800-63B] Sec.
564   5.1.

565   3.1. PKI-based Derived PIV Credentials
566   A PKI-based derived PIV credential is a derived PIV authentication certificate, which is
567   an X.509 public key certificate that has been issued in accordance with the requirements
568   of this document and [COMMON]. All derived PIV credentials created under previous
569   revisions of these guidelines are PKI-based and remain valid implementations under this
570   revision of SP 800-157. Additional requirements for PKI-based derived PIV credentials
571   that are removable or wireless are found in Appendix B.
572   Authentication using PKI-based derived PIV credentials SHALL include a check to
573   determine that the authentication certificate is valid and current (e.g., that the certificate is
574   unexpired and not revoked).

575   3.1.1. Certiﬁcate Policies for Derived PIV Credentials
576   Derived PIV authentication certificates SHALL be issued under either the id-fpki-
577   common-derived-pivAuth-hardware policy (satisfying [SP800-63B] AAL3) or the
578   id-fpki-common-derived-pivAuth policy (satisfying AAL2) of [COMMON]. All
579   derived PIV credentials SHALL be deemed to satisfy [SP800-63A] IAL3 since that is the
580   identity proofing and issuance level associated with the PIV Card and bound to the PIV
581   identity account.
582   Derived PIV authentication certificates SHALL comply with the Derived PIV
583   Authentication Certificate profile in [PROF].
584   The expiration date of a derived PIV authentication certificate is based on the certificate
585   policy of the issuer. There is no requirement to align the expiration date of a derived PIV
586   authentication certificate with the expiration date of the PIV authentication certificate or
587   the expiration of the PIV Card. However, in many cases, aligning the expiration dates will
588   simplify lifecycle management.

589   3.1.2. Cryptographic Speciﬁcations
590   The cryptographic algorithm and key size requirements for the derived PIV authentication
591   certificates and private keys are the same as the requirements for the PIV authentication
592   certificate and private key, as specified in [SP800-78].
