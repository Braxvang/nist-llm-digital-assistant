Special Publication 800-79-2                                           Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                                        and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



2.9.4 Authorization Impact of Information Systems under NIST SP 800-37-1
An issuer must not be authorized to operate if one or more of its critical information systems is
deemed insecure and therefore is issued a DATO according to [SP 800-37-1]. In the case where
an IATO (under [SP 800-37-1]) has been issued for an information system, the DAO may issue
no greater than an IATO for the issuer. Once the [SP 800-37-1] IATO is replaced with an [SP
800-37-1] ATO, the DAO can issue a SP 800-79-2 ATO. If the [SP 800-37-1] ATO expires for
one or more of information systems during the course of operation of an issuer, the OIMO shall
assess the criticality of the system for operations and present the analysis to the DAO. The DAO
then can exercise the following options:

        Specify a short time during which the information systems of the issuer must be re-
         authorized under [SP 800-37-1] without changing the ATO status;
        Downgrade the current SP 800-79-2 ATO to an IATO; or
        If circumstances warrant, issue a SP 800-79-2 DATO and halt all issuer operations.


2.10 The Use of Risk in the Authorization Decision

Authorization is the official management decision by the DAO to permit operation of an issuer
based on an assessment of its reliability and an acceptance of the risk inherent in that decision.
By granting an authorization to operate, the DAO accepts responsibility for the reliability of the
issuer and is fully accountable for any adverse impact to the organization or any other
organization from the use of issued PIV Card or Derived PIV Credentials.

The assessment of an issuer provides the DAO with the basis for not only determining its
reliability, but also for determining whether to accept the risk to the organization in granting an
ATO. As the requirements in FIPS 201-2 and related documents form the basis of the
authorization and are ultimately derived from the policy objectives of [HSPD-12], those not
reliably met by the issuer and its issuing facilities represent the potential for adverse impact.

Implementation of an [HSPD-12] program exposes an organization to specific risks at the
mission level of the organization. The PIV Card is used to establish assurance of an identity, and
as such, it must be trusted as a basis for granting access to the logical and physical resources of
the organization. Similarly, the Derived PIV Credential is also used to establish the assurance of
an identity, and must be trusted as a basis for granting access from mobile devices to the remote
IT resources of the organization. Any problem with an issued PIV Card or Derived PIV
Credential that undermines this assurance could expose an organization to harm. Furthermore,
the collection, processing, and dissemination of personal information is required to issue these
credentials and thereby increases the threat of this information being used for malicious
purposes14 if not secured. It is the DAO’s responsibility to weigh the risks of these and other
security and privacy impacts when making the authorization decision. Furthermore, as [HSPD-
12] is a government-wide mandate based on a standard of interoperability allowing organizations
to accept other organizations’ credentials, authorization decisions within a single organization

  Note: Personally Identifiable Information (PII) collection is minimized for Derived PIV Credentials because of the derivation
 process.
