      NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                                                          Cloud Computing Forensic
      February 2023                                                                                                          Reference Architecture

756           The Forensic Reference Architecture Data
757   The data that supplements the CC FRA methodology described in Section 4 represents the result
758   of an analysis performed by the NCC FSWG members. The methodology was applied to all
759   possible pairings of cloud forensic challenges (62 total challenges) with cloud functional
760   capabilities (347 capabilities). In total, 21,514 challenge-capability pairings were evaluated using
761   the flowchart in Figure 1.
762   All users of CC FRA data are encouraged to use the data as an initial implementation of the
763   methodology but use their own judgment when employing the CC FRA methodology in the
764   context of their cloud systems and modify or customize NIST’s initial dataset for their specific
765   situations and needs.
766   For example, if the existing capabilities are not appropriate for the user’s situation, some or all
767   can be removed, and new ones can be added. Similarly, new challenges appropriate for the user’s
768   situation can be added, or those challenges that have been adequately mitigated can be removed.
769   This architectural methodology has the advantage of helping to focus on how challenges can be
770   mitigated because it considers each challenge specifically in the context of affected capabilities.
771   The results of the NCC FSWG’s analysis are summarized in a Mapping Table (MT). An entry in
772   the MT is YES if the associated challenge was identified as affecting the paired capability.
773   Otherwise, the entry is NO.
774   The CC FRA data set provides all interested parties with the responses for every challenge-
775   capability pairing based on the analysis performed by the authors and collaborators of this
776   document. A sample excerpt of the table is displayed in Figure 3. The full CC FRA Mapping
777   Table is available for download (see Appendix D for a partial image and a link for downloading
778   the data).
779   The CC FRA data has 62 cloud forensic challenges obtained from NISTIR 8006 [1]. In the CC
780   FRA Mapping Table, each cloud forensic challenge is shown across the top row (i.e., Forensic
781   Challenge 1 [FC01], Forensic Challenge 2 [FC02], etc.). In Figure 3, only FC01-FC09 and
782   FC58-FC65 are shown, and the rest of the challenges are hidden for the sake of readability in the
783   figure. See Appendix D for the full Mapping Table.
784   The CC FRA data has 347 cloud functional capabilities. In the CC FRA Mapping Table, each
785   cloud functional capability is listed on the left column labeled “CAPABILITY” (see Figure 3).
786   The CC FRA data set preserves the grouping of the cloud functional capabilities provided by the
787   CSA EA [2] into “CONTAINERS” and “DOMAINS.”
788   In Figure 3, the first nine capabilities are shown, as are the last nine; the rest are hidden. Each
789   row, therefore, represents a separate capability and includes the following information: the
790   domain of the capability (all of the domains are described in Section 3), the container (the
791   highest-level elements within the architectural diagram in Appendix D 1), the name of the
792   capability, and a description of the capability (not shown in Figure 3 but shown in Appendix D).

          The container is a high-level collection of capabilities consisting of related processes and procedures within the domain.
