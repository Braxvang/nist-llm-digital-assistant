 Consumer Toolbars—Vendors provide browser plug-ins that can provide or augment phishing
  detection available in users’ browsers.

 E-mail Authentication—Vendors provide secure e-mail solutions allowing users to discern whether
  or not an e-mail is from the organization itself or is a potential phishing attack.

 E-mail Filtering—Vendors provide solutions to prevent an organization’s internal users from
  receiving phishing e-mails.

 Web Filtering—Vendors monitor an organization’s outbound Web requests and prevent users from
  accessing known or suspected phishing Web sites.

 Authentication—Vendors provide strong authentication solutions that are less susceptible to
  phishing attacks.

 Law Enforcement Enablement—Vendors assist organizations in contacting law enforcement
  officials to aid in shutting down and prosecuting phishing attacks.

When contemplating anti-phishing measures, it is important to consider the type of information being
hosted on the Web site. Web sites with little or no sensitive information may not need to implement more
advanced or costly anti-phishing measures. Web sites storing PII should strongly consider implementing
more robust anti-phishing measures.

6.3.2    Pharming

Pharming attackers use technical means, instead of social engineering, to redirect users into accessing a
fake Web site masquerading as a legitimate one and divulging personal information. Pharming is
normally accomplished either by exploiting vulnerabilities in DNS software, which is used to resolve
human-readable Internet domain names into IP addresses, or by altering the host files maintained on a
client computer for locally resolving Internet domain names. In either case, the affected system
incorrectly resolves legitimate names to the malicious Web site address. Various techniques can help
reduce the likelihood that a Web site’s users become involved in a pharming attack [Ollm05]:

 Using the Current Versions of DNS Software with the Latest Security Patches Applied—A
  compromised DNS server will allow attackers to direct users to a malicious server while maintaining
  a legitimate DNS name.

 Installing Server-Side DNS Protection Mechanisms Against Pharming—There are tools available
  to mitigate threats to DNS software, such as the DNS Security Extensions; these are discussed in
  NIST SP 800-81, Secure Domain Name System (DNS) Deployment Guide. 39

 Monitoring Organizational Domains and the Registration of Similar Domains—Pharming
  attacks may take advantage of users who misspell the organization’s domain name when accessing
  the site.

 Simplifying the Structure and Number of Organizational Domain Names—If an organization has
  a complicated naming structure for its servers, it becomes increasingly difficult for users to discern
  whether they are on an illegitimate site. For example, many organizations will have users login at one
