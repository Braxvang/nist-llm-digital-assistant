                                                                GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


    Multicast addresses with embedded unicast prefixes should be updated after renumbering to avoid
     future address clashes.

    Using ULAs for services within a site during renumbering may be a good idea. Renumbering does
     not have to change ULAs.

    During renumbering, some traffic will be sent from the old to the new prefix or vice versa. Routers
     and packet filters need to be aware of this.
    4.8.2   Differences from IPv4 Standards

RFC 2072 contains a description of IPv4 renumbering at a comparable level of detail with RFC 4192. On
the one hand, NAT simplifies renumbering, but renumbering plans that involve different size CIDR
networks tend to be more complicated than, for example, mapping one /48 to another in IPv6.

Because IPv4 does not provide the basic building blocks for automated renumbering—starting with RAs
containing preferred and valid timers and continuing with DHCPv6 prefix delegation and other features—
IPv4 networks must be renumbered manually, which usually means continuous operation throughout the
renumbering process is not possible. The processes described in this section do not correspond to any
processes typically followed in IPv4 networks.

    4.8.3   Security Ramifications

Three main points to keep in mind are:

    Errors and omissions during renumbering can result in timeouts or lost connectivity during the
     renumbering. This applies especially to infrastructure components like DNS (including the reverse
     tree) and routing protocols.

    Renumbering, if not carried out with attention to security, can leave the network in intermediate states
     vulnerable to attack. If one wants to extend the castle metaphor for firewalls, then renumbering is the
     changing of the guard.

    Incomplete renumbering of security systems can leave permanent vulnerabilities.
If renumbering is due to changing service providers, and both prefixes are available during an overlap or
transition period, all of the security considerations for multihoming apply here:

    Multiple addresses and prefixes lead to complications, especially for enforcing access control lists.

    Ingress filtering, if implemented at both service providers, will cause some loss of connectivity,
     unless some arrangement can be made to relax the filtering rules temporarily.
Other security considerations include the following:

    Renumbering will break long-lived IPsec SAs and SSL/TLS connections.

    Log files need to be interpreted correctly with respect to address changes.

    Dynamic DNS updates should be secured with the TSIG and SIG(0) mechanisms defined in
     DNSSEC.
