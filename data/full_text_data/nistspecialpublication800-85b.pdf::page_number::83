Special Publication 800-85B                                   PIV Data Model Testing Specification


Expected              The crls field is omitted from the SignedData.

10.1.1.6 Verify contents of signerInfos

Purpose               Confirms that the signerInfos in the SignedData is populated with a single
                      SignerInfo.
Reference(s)          1.      FIPS201, Section 4.2.2
                      2.      AS06.01.09
Precondition          1.      A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                      2.      A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and the
                              contact reader.
                      3.      The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                      4.      A valid CHUID is present on the PIV card.
Test Steps            1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                      2. Set OID := <<CHUID (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.48.0)>>
                      3. Call pivGetData w/
                         • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                      4. Extract the SignerInfos field contents from the
                         asymmetric digital signature of the CHUID
Expected              The signerInfos field in the SignedData contains a single SignerInfo.
Result(s)


10.1.1.7 Verify Signer Identifier in SignerInfo

Purpose               Confirms that the sid in the SignerInfo uses the issuerAndSerialNumber
                      choice.
Reference(s)          1.      FIPS201, Section 4.2.2
                      2.      AS06.01.10
Precondition          1.      A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                      2.      A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and the
                              contact reader.
                      3.      The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                      4.      A valid CHUID is present on the PIV card.
