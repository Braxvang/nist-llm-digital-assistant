CHAPTER 6                                                                 Interconnecting Systems




                          Figure 6-2. Steps to Plan a System Interconnection

Step 1: Establish a Joint Planning Team
    The organizations should consider establishing a joint planning team composed of
appropriate management and technical staff that includes program managers,
system security officers, system administrators, network administrators, and system
architects. The typical joint planning team is responsible for coordinating all aspects
of the planning process and ensuring that it has both clear direction and sufficient
resources. It also must have the commitment and support of the system and data
owners, and other senior managers.

Step 2: Define the Business Case
    Both organizations should work together to define the purpose of the
interconnection, determine how it will support their mission requirements, and
identify potential costs and risks. Defining the business case will establish the basis
of the interconnection and facilitate the planning process. Factors that should be
considered are estimated costs (e.g., staffing, equipment, facilities), expected
benefits (e.g., improved efficiency), and potential risks (e.g., technical, legal, and
financial).

Step 3: Perform Certification and Accreditation
    Establishing an interconnection may represent a significant change to the
connected systems. Before proceeding further, each organization should consider
recertification and reaccreditation of its respective system(s) to verify that security
protections remain acceptable. A full security certification and accreditation might
not be necessary, however, if the system continues to operate within an acceptable
level of risk; in that case, an abbreviated certification and accreditation would
suffice. 45

Step 4: Determine Interconnection Requirements
   The joint planning team should identify and examine all relevant technical,
security, and administrative requirements surrounding the proposed interconnection.

Step 5: Document Interconnection Agreement
   The interconnection security agreement (ISA) is a security document that
specifies the technical and security requirements for establishing, operating, and
maintaining the interconnection. It also supports the memorandum of

     Systems, and Chapter 11, Certification, Accreditation, and Security Assessments, of this guide can be
