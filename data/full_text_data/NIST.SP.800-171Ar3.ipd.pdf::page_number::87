2843   3.15.3. Rules of Behavior
2844             REQUIREMENT: 03.15.03

2845             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
2846             Determine if:
2847             A.03.15.03.a[01]: rules that describe responsibilities and expected behavior for handling CUI
2848             and system usage are established.
2849             A.03.15.03.a[02]: rules of behavior for handling CUI and system usage are provided to
2850             individuals who require access to the system.
2851             A.03.15.03.b: a documented acknowledgement from individuals indicating that they have read,
2852             understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior is received before authorizing access to
2853             CUI and the system.
2854             A.03.15.03.c[01]: the rules of behavior are reviewed periodically.
2855             A.03.15.03.c[02]: the rules of behavior are updated periodically.

2856             ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
2857             Examine
2858             [SELECT FROM: security planning policy and procedures; rules of behavior for system users;
2859             signed acknowledgements of rules of behavior; records for rules of behavior reviews and
2860             updates; system security plan; other relevant documents or records]
2861             Interview
2862             [SELECT FROM: personnel with rules of behavior establishment, review, and update
2863             responsibilities; personnel with literacy training and awareness responsibilities; personnel with
2864             role-based training responsibilities; authorized users of the system who have signed rules of
2865             behavior; personnel with information security responsibilities]
