        shows these in the context of the application infrastructure and the example policies that
        cover traffic flows from Service 1 to Service 2.

                           selector:
         matchLabels:
            app: service-2
      action: ALLOW
      rules:
      - from:
         - source:
               principals: ["cluster.local/ns/service-1/sa/service-1"]
         to:
         - operation:
               ports: ["443"]
               methods: ["GET"]
               paths: ["/public"]


 Fig. 4. An example authorization policy in a Service mesh that allows Service 1 to Service 2 on port 443
                 but only allows it to execute the GET HTTP verb on the “/public” path

This simple example shows some of the advanced capabilities that identity-tier policies can
achieve by limiting access based on the application request context. Specifically, this policy
limits the application actions to a single HTTP verb on a specific path, but a much more
sophisticated policy can be implemented as well. See [2] and [3] for detailed overviews.

        Another Application Infrastructure Scenario
Consider another common application scenario in which there is an internal (i.e., within a cluster
in the enterprise data center) three-tier application. This application is accessed from outside
(through a mobile app or website) through a DMZ. This scenario consists of edge gateways
present in the DMZ — an ingress gateway and an egress gateway at the entrance and exit points
to and from the data center with firewalls at either side of the gateways. Each of the services that
represent the front end and back end (application logic) of the three-tier application have to have
a sidecar proxy to enforce policies that pertain to inter-service call requests. This scenario
requires the definition and deployment of a combination of network-tier and identity-tier policies
that span the various types of gateways and sidecar proxies. Deploying policies at these multiple
locations requires an enterprise-level infrastructure that plays the role of a global control plane,
as described in Section 2.1. This is designated as a central coordination infrastructure, as shown
in Fig. 5.
