It may be diffcult to estimate specifc re-identifcation probabilities, as the ability to re-
identify depends on vulnerabilities such as the original dataset, the de-identifcation tech-
nique, and the availability of additional data (publicly available or privately held) that can
be linked with the de-identifed data, as well as specifc threats, such as the technical skill
of the data intruder and the intruder’s available resources and motivation. It is likely that
the true probability of re-identifcation increases over time as vulnerabilities are likely to
increase, such as improvement in re-identifcation techniques and the availability of more
contextual information.
Some researchers have claimed that computing these probabilities “is a fundamentally
meaningless exercise” because the calculations are based on assumptions that cannot be
validated (e.g., the lack of a database that could link specifc quasi-identifers or sensitive,
non-identifying values to identities) [108]. To avoid such a “meaningless exercise,” de-
identifcation practitioners must become experts in the range of relevant data that is in both
public and private datasets, especially those that are sold by data brokers. Such knowledge
must include the quasi-identifers that the datasets contain, their accuracy, and the abil-
ity to generate nearly complete population registers. It is important to recognize practical
limitations that apply to potential data intruders and not assume omniscient or omnipotent
capabilities to the detriment of the practical data privacy or accuracy trade-offs. However, it
is also important to account for unknown datasets that may become available in the future.
De-identifcation practitioners have traditionally quantifed re-identifcation probability based
in part on the skills and abilities of a potential data intruder. In some cases, datasets that
were thought to have little possibility for exploitation were deemed to have a lower re-
identifcation probability than datasets that contained sensitive or otherwise valuable infor-
mation. It is not appropriate to consider the degree of potential exploitation when attempt-
ing to evaluate the re-identifcation probability of government datasets that will be publicly
released.
    • Although a specifc de-identifed dataset may not be recognized as sensitive, re-
      identifying that dataset may be an important step in re-identifying another dataset
      that is sensitive. Alternatively, the data intruder may merely wish to embarrass the
      government agency. Thus, adversaries may have a strong incentive to re-identify
      datasets that are otherwise innocuous.
    • Although the public may not generally be skilled in re-identifcation, many resources
      on the internet make it easy to acquire specialized datasets, tools, and experts for
      specifc re-identifcation challenges. Family members, friends, colleagues, and oth-
      ers may also possess substantial personal knowledge about individuals in the data
      that can be used for re-identifcation.
De-identifcation practitioners should assume that de-identifed government datasets could
be subjected to sustained, worldwide re-identifcation attempts, and they should gauge
their de-identifcation requirements accordingly. Of course, it is unrealistic to assume
that all of the world’s resources will be used to attempt to re-identify every publicly re-
