                                                                                NIST Special Publication 800-35



This guide describes a life cycle that provides a context to assist organizations with managing the myriad
issues surrounding IT security services. However, the guide does not prescribe or recommend any specific
IT security service, IT security service arrangement, IT security service agreement, or IT security service
provider. Each organization must perform its own analysis of its needs and assess, select, implement, and
oversee the IT security service to best address its needs.

The Guide should be used in conjunction with other NIST Special Publications (SP) that focus on
procurement of IT systems, including NIST SP 800-64, Security Considerations in the Information
System Development Life Cycle, and NIST SP 800-36: Guide to Selecting Information Technology
Security Products. NIST SP 800-55, Security Metrics Guide for Information Technology Systems will
help organizations understand the importance of using metrics and developing a metrics program.

Other NIST special publications may be helpful in providing information on specific services and
technologies. These include:


 SP 800-30: Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems
 SP 800-32: Introduction to Public Key Technology and the Federal PKI Infrastructure
 SP 800-33: Underlying Technical Models for Information Technology Security
 SP 800-34: Contingency Planning for Information Technology Systems
 SP 800-41: An Introduction to Firewalls and Firewall Policy
 SP 800-42: Guideline on Network Security Testing
 SP 800-48: Wireless Network Security: 802.11, Bluetooth, and Handheld Devices
 SP 800-50: Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program
 SP 800-53: Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems


NIST recommends that organizations planning to acquire IT security services should:

 Develop careful, objective business cases. The need for an IT security service should be supported by
  the business needs of the organization. A business case containing an analysis of the proposed
  solution, cost estimate, benefits analysis, project risk analysis, and an evaluation of other considered
  alternatives should provide sufficient documentation to describe and support these needs.
 Develop strong, specific service agreements that define the expectations of performance for each
  required security control, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response
  requirements for any identified instances of non-compliance.
 Use metrics throughout the IT security life cycle. Metrics will provide the objective data to evaluate
  the baseline level of service in the assessment phase and assess service provider performance in the
  operations phase. Wherever possible, metrics should be selected to indicate progress toward the
  achievement or maintenance of a security condition that meets an underlying organizational need.
 Develop processes and procedures that can effectively track the myriad service agreements and the
  metrics that will be applied throughout the lifecycle of the many different and disparate IT security
  services within an organization
