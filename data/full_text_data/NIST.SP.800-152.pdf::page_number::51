SP 800-152                                                    A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


a key should be correctly associated with a key and used whenever a key is stored, retrieved,
loaded into a cryptographic module, used to protect data (e.g., other keys), exchanged with
peer entities authorized to use the key, and when assuring that a key is correctly protected.

FR:6.2 For each key type used in the system, the CKMS design shall specify all metadata
elements selected for a trusted association, the circumstances under which the metadata
elements are created and associated with the key, and the method of association (i.e.,
cryptographic mechanism or trusted process).

FR:6.3 For each cryptographic mechanism used in the Key Protections metadata element
(item s above), the CKMS design shall specify the following:
   i. The cryptographic algorithm: See item g) above.
   ii. The parameters for the key: See item i) above.
   iii. The key identifier: See item b) above.
   iv. The protection value: This element contains the protection value for integrity
        protection, confidentiality protection, or source authentication. For example, a
        properly implemented MAC or digital signature technique may provide for integrity
        protection and/or source authentication.
   v. When the protection was applied.
   vi. When the protection was verified.
FR:6.4 For each non-cryptographic trusted process used in the Key Protections metadata
element (item s above), the CKMS design shall specify the following:
   i. The identifier of the process used to distinguish it from other processes, and
   ii. A description of the process or a pointer to a description of the process.

FR:6.5 For each cryptographic mechanism used in the Metadata Protections metadata
element (item t above), the CKMS design shall specify the following:
   i. The cryptographic algorithm.
   ii. The parameters for the key.
   iii. The key identifier.
   iv. The protection value (e.g., MAC, digital signature).
   v. When the protection was applied.
   vi. When the protection was verified.

Generally, the same mechanism will be used for the key and bound metadata, especially if
the key and metadata are bundled together.

FR:6.6 For each non-cryptographic trusted process used in the Metadata Protections
metadata element (item t above), the CKMS design shall specify the following:
   i. The identifier that is used to distinguish this process from other processes, and
   ii. A description of the process or a pointer to a description of the process.
