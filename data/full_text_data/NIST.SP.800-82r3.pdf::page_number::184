security audit
Independent review and examination of a system’s records and activities to determine the adequacy of system
controls, ensure compliance with established security policy and procedures, detect breaches in security services,
and recommend any changes that are indicated for countermeasures. [ISO7498-1]

security controls
The management, operational, and technical controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) prescribed for an
information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information.
[FIPS199]

security plan
Formal document that provides an overview of the security requirements for an information system and describes
the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements. [SP800-18r1]

security policy
Security policies define the objectives and constraints for the security program. Policies are created at several levels,
ranging from organization or corporate policy to specific operational constraints (e.g., remote access). In general,
policies provide answers to the questions “what” and “why” without dealing with “how.” Policies are normally
stated in terms that are technology-independent.

sensor
A device that produces a voltage or current output that is representative of some physical property being measured
(e.g., speed, temperature, flow). [ISADICT]

set point
An input variable that sets the desired value of the controlled variable. This variable may be manually set,
automatically set, or programmed. [ISADICT]

single loop controller
A controller that controls a very small process or a critical process. [IR6859]

social engineering
An attempt to trick someone into revealing information (e.g., a password) that can be used to attack systems or
networks. [SP800-61r2]

supervisory control
A term that is used to imply that the output of a controller or computer program is used as input to other controllers.
See Control Server. [ISADICT]

supervisory control and data acquisition
A generic name for a computerized system that is capable of gathering and processing data and applying operational
controls over long distances. Typical uses include power transmission and distribution and pipeline systems.
SCADA was designed for the unique communication challenges (e.g., delays, data integrity) posed by the various
media that must be used, such as phone lines, microwave, and satellite. Usually shared rather than dedicated.
[ISADICT]

technical controls
The security controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) for an information system that are primarily implemented
and executed by the information system through mechanisms contained in the hardware, software, or firmware
components of the system. [FIPS200]

threat
Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact agency operations (including safety, mission,
functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, or individuals through an information system via unauthorized
access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of service. [FIPS200] (adapted)

threat event
An event or situation that has the potential for causing undesirable consequences or impact. [SP800-30r1]
