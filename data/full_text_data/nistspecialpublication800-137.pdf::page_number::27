effectiveness in accordance with the system security plan and the methods described in NIST SP
800-53A, as amended. System owners determine assessment frequencies of security controls
based on drivers from all three tiers. A full discussion of factors to consider when determining
assessment and monitoring frequencies can be found in Section 3.2.2. System-level security-
related information is used to determine security status at all three tiers. Use of system-level
security-related information in metrics for determining security status is addressed in Section
3.2.1.

The ISCM strategy at the information systems tier also supports ongoing authorization. Ongoing
authorization implies recurring updates to the authorization decision information in accordance
with assessment and monitoring frequencies. Assessment results from monitoring common
controls implemented and managed at the organization or mission/business process tier may be
combined with information generated at the information systems tier in order to provide the
authorizing official (AO) with a complete set of independently-generated evidence. 27 Assessment
evidence obtained from ISCM is, at a minimum, provided to AOs as often as required by
organizational policy.

Primary Roles: Information System Owner/Common Control Provider, Information System
Security Officer

Supporting Roles: Senior Information Security Officer, Authorizing Official, Security Control
Assessor

Expected Input: Organizational risk tolerance information, organizational ISCM strategy, policy,
procedures, templates, system-specific threat information, and system information (e.g., System
Security Plan, Security Assessment Report, Plan of Action and Milestones, Security Assessment
Plan, System Risk Assessment, etc.28)

Expected Output: System-level ISCM strategy that complements the Tier 1 and 2 strategies and
the organizational security program and that provides security status information for all tiers and
real-time updates for ongoing system authorization decisions as directed by the organizational
ISCM strategy

3.1.3 PROCESS ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Tiers 1 and 2 officials have responsibilities throughout the ISCM process, including, but not
limited to, the following:
â€¢    Provide input to the development of the organizational ISCM strategy including
     establishment of metrics, policy, and procedures, compiling and correlating Tier 3 data into
     security-related information of use at Tiers 1 and 2, policies on assessment and monitoring
     frequencies, and provisions for ensuring sufficient depth and coverage when sampling
     methodologies are utilized [ISCM steps: Define, Establish, Implement].

     See NIST SP 800-53, CA-2, Control Enhancement 1, for specific assessor independence requirements. Assessors
     need only be independent of the operation of the system. They may be from within the organizational tier, the
     mission/business tier, or from within some other independent entity internal or external to the organization.
     Results of assessments done by system operators can be used if they have been validated by independent
     assessors.

     This system information is an outcome of the RMF. Electronic standardized templates and document management
     systems readily support frequent updates with data generated by continuous monitoring programs.
