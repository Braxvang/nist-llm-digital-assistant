Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, High), (availability, High)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of emergency response
information on the ability of responsible agencies to respond to a disaster. These actions include
providing mobile telecommunications, operational support, power generation, search and rescue,
and medical life saving actions. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of emergency
response information will usually have little or no adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In cases where an attack is
underway, unauthorized disclosure of emergency response information can provide information
that might permit terrorists or other adversaries to target emergency response assets, thus
jeopardizing emergency response resources and missions and public safety. Given the criticality
that much emergency response information has in terms of potential loss of human life and major
property damage, where unauthorized release of information can reasonably be expected to
facilitate interference with emergency response missions, the confidentiality impact level may be
moderate or high. The unauthorized disclosure of one agencyâ€™s emergency response by another
agency could result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within the critical
emergency services infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations tasked with
emergency response missions.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for emergency response information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of emergency response information
usually depends on whether the information is time-critical. Unauthorized modification or
destruction of emergency response information may pose a significant threat to major assets
and/or human life.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
emergency response information is normally high.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to emergency response information.
Generally, missions supported by emergency response information are not tolerant of delays.
Delays may cost lives and result in major property damage. Denial of access to emergency
response information may result in significant degradation in mission capability and resultant
catastrophic consequences for critical infrastructures, key national assets, and/or human life.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
emergency response information is high.
