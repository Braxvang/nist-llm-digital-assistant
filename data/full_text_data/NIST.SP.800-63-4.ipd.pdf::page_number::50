       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


1436       • An organization could choose to implement stricter auditing and transactional
1437         review processes on a payment application where verification processes using
1438         weaker forms of identity evidence were accepted due to availability of evidence
1439         in the end-user population.
1440   Where compensating controls are implemented, organizations SHALL demonstrate
1441   comparability of a chosen alternative or document residual risk incurred by deviating
1442   from normative requirements. Organizations SHALL implement procedures to document
1443   both the justification for any departure from normative requirements and detail the
1444   compensating controls employed. The inclusion of compensating controls does not
1445   imply that an organization must tailor to a lower xAL. The process of tailoring allows
1446   for agencies and service providers to make risk-based decisions in how they implement
1447   their xALs and provides a mechanism for documenting and communicating decisions
1448   through the Digital Identity Acceptance Statement described in Sec. 5.3.4.

1449   5.3.3. Identify Supplemental Controls
1450   Supplemental controls are those that may be added, in addition to those specified in the
1451   organizations tailored assurance level, in order to address specific threats or attacks.
1452   Organizations SHOULD identify and implement supplemental controls where they
1453   identify threats that may not be addressed in baseline controls. For example:
1454       • An organization could choose to verify an end user against additional pieces of
1455         identity evidence, beyond what is required by the assurance level, due to a high
1456         prevalence of fraudulent attempts to complete the proofing process.
1457       • An organization could choose to implement risk-scoring analytics, coupled with
1458         re-proofing mechanisms, to confirm a user’s identity when their access attempts
1459         exhibit certain risk factors.
1460   Where organizations implement supplemental controls, these SHALL be assessed for
1461   impacts based on the same factors used to tailor the organization’s assurance level.
1462   Supplemental controls SHALL be documented.

1463   5.3.4. Document Results - The Digital Identity Acceptance Statement
1464   The Digital Identity Acceptance Statement documents the results of the digital identity
1465   risk management process. This includes the Impact Assessment, Initial Assurance Level
1466   Selection, and Tailoring process.
1467   The statement SHALL include, at a minimum:
1468      1. Initial Impact Assessment Results
1469      2. Initially assessed xAL,
1470      3. Tailored xAL and rationale, if tailored xAL differs from initially assessed xAL,


                                                   38
