On the other hand, it may be reasonable to infer that the owner was in possession of the
correct private key for some period of time prior to the assurance_time; a relying party’s
organization must decide whether or not such an inference is acceptable.
For the purposes of this discussion, three levels of assurance are defined relative to the
assurance_time: HIGH, MEDIUM and LOW. An organization may choose to implement
additional or fewer assurance levels.
Figure 1 depicts a simple model for changes in the level of assurance of possession over
an extended period of time. In this figure, tA denotes the actual time when assurance of
private key possession is explicitly provided to the relying party. (In practice, one may
have to accommodate the use of an approximation.) The quantities a, b and c are values
selected by the relying party and/or the relying party’s organization:
      •   a and b are lengths of time before and after the point at which assurance of private
          key possession was explicitly provided to the relying party. In this model, the
          relying party has a HIGH level of assurance that the owner of the key pair is in
          possession of the private key between times tA − a and tA + b.
      •   c is a length of time after tA + b. Assurance that the owner possesses the private
          key degrades between times tA + b and tA + b + c to a LOW level of assurance.
      •   The relying party has a LOW level of assurance that the owner possesses the
          private key after time tA + b + c.
After degrading in level, the process of explicitly obtaining/providing assurance of
private key possession shall be repeated if a higher level of assurance is required.

6.2       Assurance of Possession Model with an Estimated assurance_time
Ideally, when assurance of private key possession is provided, the assurance_time would
be a precise time. However, in practice, an estimate may be used. To ensure that the
assigned assurance_time is a useful estimate, a pair of times must be obtained that will
“bracket” the actual time at which assurance was provided, restricting the possibilities to
