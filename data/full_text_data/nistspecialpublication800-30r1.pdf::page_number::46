3.3 COMMUNICATING AND SHARING RISK ASSESSMENT INFORMATION
The third step in the risk assessment process is to communicate the assessment results and share
risk-related information.47 The objective of this step is to ensure that decision makers across the
organization have the appropriate risk-related information needed to inform and guide risk
decisions. Communicating and sharing information consists of the following specific tasks:
•    Communicate the risk assessment results; and
•    Share information developed in the execution of the risk assessment, to support other risk
     management activities.

STEP 3: COMMUNICATE AND SHARE RISK ASSESSMENT RESULTS

COMMUNICATE RISK ASSESSMENT RESULTS
TASK 3-1: Communicate risk assessment results to organizational decision makers to support risk responses.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations can communicate risk assessment results in a variety of ways (e.g., executive
briefings, risk assessment reports, dashboards). Such risk communications can be formal or informal with the content
and format determined by organizations initiating and conducting the assessments. Organizations provide guidance on
specific risk communication and reporting requirements, included as part of preparing for the risk assessment (if not
provided in the risk management strategy as part of the risk framing task). Organizations prioritize risks at the same
level or with similar scores (see Appendix J). Appendix K provides an example of type of information that may be
included in a risk assessment report or the preferred vehicle for risk communication.

SHARE RISK-RELATED INFORMATION
TASK 3-2: Share risk-related information produced during the risk assessment with appropriate
organizational personnel.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations share source information and intermediate results and provide guidance on
sharing risk-related information. Information sharing occurs primarily within organizations, via reports and briefings,
and by updating risk-related data repositories with supporting evidence for the risk assessment results. Information
sharing is also supported by documenting the sources of information, analytical processes, and intermediate results
(e.g., the completed tables in Appendices D-I), so that risk assessments can be easily maintained. Information sharing
may also occur with other organizations.



              Summary of Key Activities – Communicating and Sharing Information

       •     Determine the appropriate method (e.g., executive briefing, risk assessment report, or
             dashboard) to communicate risk assessment results.
       •     Communicate risk assessment results to designated organizational stakeholders.
       •     Share the risk assessment results and supporting evidence in accordance with organizational
             policies and guidance.




47
   The risk assessment process entails ongoing communications and information sharing between those personnel
performing assessment activities, subject matter experts, and key organizational stakeholders (e.g., mission/business
owners, risk executive [function], chief information security officers, information system owners/program managers).
This communication and information sharing ensures that: (i) the inputs to risk assessments are as accurate as possible;
(ii) intermediate results can be used (e.g., to support risk assessments at other tiers); and (iii) results are meaningful and
useful inputs to risk response.
