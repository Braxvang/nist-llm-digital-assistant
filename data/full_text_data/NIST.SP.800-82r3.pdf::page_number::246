  (11)       INFORMATION TYPES

OT Discussion: The organization ensures that access enforcement mechanisms do not adversely
impact the operational performance of the OT. Example compensating controls include
encapsulation. The policy for logical access control to non-addressable and non-routable system
resources and the associated information is made explicit. Access control mechanisms include
hardware, firmware, and software that control the device or have device access, such as device
drivers and communications controllers. Physical access control may serve as a compensating
control for logical access control. However, it may not provide sufficient granularity when users
require access to different functions.
Control Enhancement: (11) OT Discussion: The organization identifies and restricts access to
information that could impact the OT environment and accounts for information types that are
sensitive, proprietary, contain trade secrets, or support safety functions.
Rationale for adding AC-3 (11) to HIGH baseline: The loss of availability, integrity, and
confidentiality of certain types of information that reside on a high-impact OT system may result
in severe or catastrophic adverse effects on operations, assets, or individuals, including severe
degradation or loss of mission capability, major damage to organizational assets, or harm to
individuals involving the loss of life or life-threatening injuries.

 AC-4 (4)                                                                                         Select
            ENCRYPTED INFORMATION

OT Discussion: Information flow policy may be achieved using a combination of logical and
physical flow restriction techniques. The inspection of message content may enforce information
flow policy. For example, industrial OT protocols may be restricted using inbound and outbound
traffic rules on a network control device between OT and IT networks. For non-routable
communication, such as serial connections, devices may be configured to limit commands to and
from specific tags within the OT device. The information flow policy may be supported by
labeling or coloring physical connectors to aid in connecting networks. Devices that do not have
a business need to communicate should not be connected (i.e., air gapped).
Control Enhancement: (4) No OT discussion for this control.
