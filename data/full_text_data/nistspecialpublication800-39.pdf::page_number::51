threats exploit vulnerabilities; (iv) likelihood estimates that threats exploit vulnerabilities; (v) a determination of risk to
organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation; (vi) risk response guidance from the organizational risk management strategy (see
Appendix H); and (vii) the general organizational directions and guidance on appropriate responses to risk. In addition
to the risk assessment and risk framing steps, the risk response step can receive inputs from the risk monitoring step
(e.g., when organizations experience a breach or compromise to their information systems or environments of operation
that require an immediate response to address the incident and reduce additional risk that results from the event). The
risk response step can also receive inputs from the risk framing step (e.g., when organizations are required to deploy
new safeguards and countermeasures in their information systems based on security requirements in new legislation or
OMB policies). The risk framing step also directly shapes the resource constraints associated with selecting an
appropriate course of action. Additional preconditions established at the risk framing step may include: (i) constraints
based on architecture and previous investments; (ii) organizational preferences and tolerances; (iii) the expected
effectiveness at mitigating risk (including how effectiveness is measured and monitored); and (iv) the time horizon for
the risk (e.g., current risk, projected risk—that is, a risk expected to arise in the future based on the results of threat
assessments or a planned changes in missions/business functions, enterprise architecture (including information
security architecture), or aspects of legal or regulatory compliance).

Activities
RISK RESPONSE IDENTIFICATION
TASK 3-1: Identify alternative courses of action to respond to risk determined during the risk assessment.
Supplemental Guidance: Organizations can respond to risk in a variety of ways. These include: (i) risk acceptance; (ii)
risk avoidance; (iii) risk mitigation; (iv) risk sharing; (v) risk transfer; or (vi) a combination of the above. A course of
action is a time-phased or situation-dependent combination of risk response measures. For example, in an emergency
situation, organizations might accept the risk associated with unfiltered connection to an external communications
provider for a limited time; then avoid risk by cutting the connection; mitigate risk in the near-term by applying
security controls to search for malware or evidence of unauthorized access to information that occurred during the
period of unfiltered connection; and finally mitigate risk long-term by applying controls to handle such connections
more securely.
Risk Acceptance
Risk acceptance is the appropriate risk response when the identified risk is within the organizational risk tolerance.
Organizations can accept risk deemed to be low, moderate, or high depending on particular situations or conditions. For
example, organizations with data centers residing in the northeastern portion of the United States may opt to accept the
risk of earthquakes based on known likelihood of earthquakes and data center vulnerability to damage by earthquakes.
Organizations accept the fact that earthquakes are possible, but given the infrequency of major earthquakes in that
region of the country, believe it is not cost-effective to address such risk—that is, the organizations have determined
that risk associated with earthquakes is low. Conversely, organizations may accept substantially greater risk (in the
moderate/high range) due to compelling mission, business, or operational needs. For example, federal agencies may
decide to share very sensitive information with first responders who do not typically have access to such information
due to time-sensitive needs to stop pending terrorist attacks, even though the information is not itself perishable with
regard to risk through loss of confidentiality. Organizations typically make determinations regarding the general level
of acceptable risk and the types of acceptable risk with consideration of organizational priorities and trade-offs
between: (i) near-term mission/business needs and potential for longer-term mission/business impacts; and (ii)
organizational interests and the potential impacts on individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.
Risk Avoidance
Risk avoidance may be the appropriate risk response when the identified risk exceeds the organizational risk tolerance.
Organizations may conduct certain types of activities or employ certain types of information technologies that result in
risk that is unacceptable. In such situations, risk avoidance involves taking specific actions to eliminate the activities or
technologies that are the basis for the risk or to revise or reposition these activities or technologies in the organizational
mission/business processes to avoid the potential for unacceptable risk. For example, organizations planning to employ
networked connections between two domains, may determine through risk assessments that there is unacceptable risk
in establishing such connections. Organizations may also determine that implementing effective safeguards and
countermeasures (e.g., cross-domain solutions) is not practical in the given circumstances. Thus, the organizations
decide to avoid the risk by eliminating the electronic or networked connections and employing an “air gap” with a
manual connection processes (e.g., data transfers by secondary storage devices).
Risk Mitigation
Risk mitigation, or risk reduction, is the appropriate risk response for that portion of risk that cannot be accepted,
avoided, shared, or transferred. The alternatives to mitigate risk depend on: (i) the risk management tier and the scope
