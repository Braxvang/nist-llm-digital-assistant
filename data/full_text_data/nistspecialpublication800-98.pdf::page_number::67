                                                                            SECTION 5: RFID SECURITY CONTROLS



 Information labels and notice can inform users of the intended purposes of the RFID system and
  simple methods users can employ to mitigate risk.
The sub-sections below discuss operational controls for RFID systems in more detail.

5.2.1   Physical Access Control

Control: Physical access controls include fences, gates, walls, locked doors, turnstiles, surveillance
cameras, and security guards. When the objective is to limit radio communication over a short distance,
room walls or partitioned stalls might provide adequate protection if they are opaque to the relevant radio
frequencies that the RF subsystem uses.

Applicability: All RFID implementations except those in which RFID tags or other system components
are in public areas.

Benefits: Physical access controls limit the ability of an adversary to get close enough to RFID system
components to compromise RFID data security or to modify, damage, or steal RFID system components.
Physical security applies to all RFID subsystems. In the RF subsystem, the primary objective of the
control is to prevent unauthorized radio communications. In the enterprise and inter-enterprise
subsystems, the primary objective is to prevent physical access to system components.

Examples of risks that are mitigated by physical access controls include:

 Unauthorized reading and writing of tag data,
 Rogue and cloned tags,
 Reader spoofing,
 Denial of service resulting from radio interference or unauthorized commands,
 Targeting,
 Physical destruction of RFID equipment, and
 HERF/HERO/HERP.
Weaknesses:

 Physical access controls are not a countermeasure for radio interference from legitimate radios
  located within a perimeter designed to block external emissions,
 The effective range of RF signals may be much longer than stated operating ranges, thereby allowing
  many attacks to occur using customized directional antennas and other technologies (see Section
  2.3.3.3 for additional information on relevant operating ranges),
 Physical access controls do not protect against attacks by insiders (i.e., those granted access to the
  area),
 HERF/HERO/HERP still exists with respect to radiation emitted within the physical perimeter, and
 Physical controls may fail to contain radio signals as expected if ductwork or other openings allow
  radio signals to escape.
