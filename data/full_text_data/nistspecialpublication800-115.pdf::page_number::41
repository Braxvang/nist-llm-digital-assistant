                                              TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



5.4   Summary

Each information security testing technique has its own strengths and weaknesses. Table 5-1 compares
the range of testing techniques discussed in Section 5.

                           Table 5-1. Target Vulnerability Validation Techniques

      Technique                                            Capabilities
 Password Cracking     •   Identifies weak passwords and password policies
                       •   Tests security using the same methodologies and tools that attackers employ
 Penetration Testing   •   Verifies vulnerabilities
                       •   Demonstrates how vulnerabilities can be exploited iteratively to gain greater access
 Social Engineering    •   Allows testing of both procedures and the human element (user awareness)



Risks are associated with all techniques and technique combinations. To ensure that each technique is
executed safely and accurately, testers should have a specific baseline skill set. Table 5-2 provides
guidance on the minimum skill sets needed for testing techniques presented in this guide.

                       Table 5-2. Security Testing Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities

      Technique                                            Baseline Skill Set
                       Knowledge of secure password composition and password storage for operating systems;
 Password Cracking
                       ability to use automated cracking tools
                       Extensive TCP/IP, networking, and OS knowledge; advanced knowledge of network and
 Penetration Testing
                       system vulnerabilities and exploits; knowledge of techniques to evade security detection
 Social Engineering    Ability to influence and persuade people; ability to remain composed under pressure
