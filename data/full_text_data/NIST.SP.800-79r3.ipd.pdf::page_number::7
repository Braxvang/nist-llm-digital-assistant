      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                   Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

135   Call for Patent Claims
136   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use
137   would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information
138   Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or requirements may be
139   directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another publication. This call also
140   includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending U.S. or foreign patent applications
141   relating to this ITL draft publication and of any relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.
142   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its behalf,
143   in written or electronic form, either:
144   assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not hold and does
145   not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
146   assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available to applicants
147   desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the guidance or requirements in
148   this ITL draft publication either:
149   under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination; or
150   without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of
151   any unfair discrimination.
152   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make assurances
153   on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents subject to the
154   assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the assurance are binding on
155   the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of
156   future transfers with the goal of binding each successor-in-interest.
157   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
158   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.
159   Such statements should be addressed to: piv_comments@nist.gov.
