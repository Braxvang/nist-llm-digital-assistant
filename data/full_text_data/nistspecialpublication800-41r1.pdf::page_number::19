                                                                   GUIDELINES ON FIREWALLS AND FIREWALL POLICY


 Latest updates to antimalware and personal firewall software
 Configuration settings for antimalware and personal firewall software
 Elapsed time since the previous malware scan
 Patch level of the operating system and selected applications
 Security configuration of the operating system and selected applications
These health checks require software on the userâ€™s system that is controlled by the firewall. If the user has
acceptable credentials but the device does not pass the health check, the user and device may get only
limited access to the internal network for remediation purposes.

2.1.8   Unified Threat Management (UTM)

Many firewalls combine multiple features into a single system, the idea being that it is easier to set and
maintain policy on a single system than on many systems that are deployed at the same location on a
network. A typical unified threat management (UTM) system has a firewall, malware detection and
eradication, sensing and blocking of suspicious network probes, and so on. There are pros and cons to
merging multiple, not-completely-related functions into a single system. For example, deploying a UTM
reduces complexity by making a single system responsible for multiple security objectives, but it also
requires that the UTM have all the desired features to meet every one of the objectives. Another tradeoff
is in performance: a single system handling multiple tasks has to have enough resources such as CPU
speed and memory to handle every task assigned to it. Some organizations will find the balance favors a
UTM, while other organizations will use multiple firewalls at the same location in their network.

2.1.9   Web Application Firewalls

The HTTP protocol used in web servers has been exploited by attackers in many ways, such as to place
malicious software on the computer of someone browsing the web, or to fool a person into revealing
private information that they might not have otherwise. Many of these exploits can be detected by
specialized application firewalls called web application firewalls that reside in front of the web server.

Web application firewalls are a relatively new technology, as compared to other firewall technologies,
and the type of threats that they mitigate are still changing frequently. Because they are put in front of
web servers to prevent attacks on the server, they are often considered to be very different than traditional
firewalls.

2.1.10 Firewalls for Virtual Infrastructures

Many virtualization solutions allow more than one operating system to run on a single computer
simultaneously, each appearing as if it were a real computer. This has become popular recently because it
allows organizations to make more efficient use of computer hardware. Most of these types of
virtualization systems include virtualized networking, which allows the multiple operating systems to
communicate as if they were on a standard Ethernet, even though there is no actual networking hardware.

Network activity that passes directly between virtualized operating systems within a host cannot be
monitored by an external firewall. However, some virtualization systems offer built-in firewalls or allow
third-party software firewalls to be added as plug-ins. Using firewalls to monitor virtualized networking is
a relatively new area of firewall technology, and it is likely to change significantly as virtualization usage
continues to increase.
