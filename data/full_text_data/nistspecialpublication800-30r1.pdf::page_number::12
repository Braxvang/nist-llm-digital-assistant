Special Publication 800-30                                                   Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments

     system evaluators, penetration testers, security control assessors, risk assessors, independent
     verifiers/validators, inspectors general, auditors).

1.3 RELATED PUBLICATIONS
The risk assessment approach described in this publication is supported by a series of security
standards and guidelines necessary for managing information security risk. In addition to this
publication, the Special Publications developed by the Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative
supporting the unified information security framework for the federal government include:
•    Special Publication 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and
     Information System View; 11
•    Special Publication 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal
     Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach;
•    Special Publication 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information
     Systems and Organizations; and
•    Special Publication 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal
     Information Systems and Organizations: Building Effective Security Assessment Plans.

The concepts and principles associated with the risk assessment processes and approaches
contained in this publication are intended to be similar to and consistent with the processes and
approaches described in International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and International
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards. Extending the concepts and principles of these
international standards for the federal government and its contractors and promoting the reuse of
risk assessment results, reduces the burden on organizations that must conform to ISO/IEC and
NIST standards.
