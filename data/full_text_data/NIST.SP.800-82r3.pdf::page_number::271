OT Discussion: Example compensating controls include physical access control and
encapsulating the OT to provide authentication external to the OT.
Control Enhancement: (1) (2) (6) No OT Discussion for this control.
IA-6     AUTHENTICATION FEEDBACK

 IA-6        Authentication Feedback                                   Select     Select      Select

OT Discussion: This control assumes a visual interface that provides feedback about
authentication information during the authentication process. When OT authentication uses an
interface that does not support visual feedback (e.g., protocol-based authentication), this control
may be tailored out.
