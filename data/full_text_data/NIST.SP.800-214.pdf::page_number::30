NIST defines a platform as a computer or hardware device or associated operating system, or
a virtual environment, on which software can be installed or run. The goal of the Trustworthy
Platforms focus area is to improve trust in the security and privacy of these systems and
infrastructures by providing guidance and technologies for the development and use of
secure platforms, including software, hardware, and firmware. The trustworthy platform is
a dynamic ecosystem that depends on multiple security and privacy technologies in order to
reliably deliver its services to the users. It is deployed and maintained in a measured state
that is known to protect the security and privacy of users and data, and it performs services
in a consistent and reliable manner. The desired outcome is to increase the adoption of
trustworthy platforms in order to improve trust in the security and privacy of systems and
infrastructures. NIST provides guidance and technologies for the development and use of
secure platforms and foundational components such as cryptography. NIST also helps to
develop quantifiable measurements that provide assurances for platform security, privacy,
and robustness.
Secure Software Development Framework
The software development life cycle (SDLC) is a methodology for designing, creating, and
maintaining software. Though there are many SDLC models, most do not explicitly address
software security.
