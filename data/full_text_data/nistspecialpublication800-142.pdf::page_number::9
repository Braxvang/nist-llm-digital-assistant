                                                         Practical Combinatorial Testing
 _______________________________________________________
1.3   Audience and Assumptions

     This document assumes that the readers have experience with software development
and testing, some familiarity with scripting languages, and basic knowledge of
programming, logic, and discrete mathematics equivalent to what would be acquired in an
undergraduate computer science or engineering program. Most of the material should be
readily understood by an undergraduate student with some programming experience.
Because of the constantly changing nature of the information technology industry, readers
are strongly encouraged to take advantage of other resources (including those listed in this
document) for more current and detailed information.


1.4   Organization: How to use this Document

     The document is divided into chapters, with background material covered in
appendices. Because it is intended to be self-contained, each chapter provides material that
will be used in later topics. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 will be needed by most testers, while the
material in later chapters is specialized for various topics. Appendices include a review of
basic combinatorics and a discussion of empirical data on software failures.

     Readers new to combinatorial testing may want to review the basics of combinatorics
in Appendix A and read chapters 2, 3, and 4. Other sections of the publication can be
reserved for later use as needed.
