2248             A.03.11.02.a[03]: the system is scanned for vulnerabilities periodically.
2249             A.03.11.02.a[04]: the system is scanned for vulnerabilities when new vulnerabilities that affect
2250             the system are identified.
2251             A.03.11.02.b: system vulnerabilities are remediated <A.03.11.02.ODP[01]: response times>.
2252             A.03.11.02.c[01]: system vulnerabilities to be scanned are updated periodically.
2253             A.03.11.02.c[02]: system vulnerabilities to be scanned are updated when new vulnerabilities
2254             are identified.
2255             A.03.11.02.c[03]: system vulnerabilities to be scanned are updated when new vulnerabilities
2256             are reported.
