SP 800-152                                                A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


   d) Computer security controls to protect the development and maintenance
      environment and to provide access control to permit authorized user access,
   e) Network security controls to protect the development and maintenance
      environment from hacking attempts,
   f) Cryptographic security control to protect the integrity of software and its control
      data under development, and
   g) The means used to ensure that the tools (e.g., editors, compiler, software linkers,
      loaders, etc.) are trustworthy and are not sources of malware.

PR:9.19                     A Federal CKMS service-providing organization shall verify
                            that the CKMS designer, developer, and implementer
                            followed the claimed procedures for the development and
                            maintenance environment documented in FR:9.13.
               MA-1         A Federal CKMS shall protect against physical, technical,
PR:9.20
               SA-18        and personnel threats during FCKMS maintenance activities.

9.9.4 Flaw Remediation Capabilities
The detection, reporting, and correction of FCKMS flaws must be done in an expeditious
and secure manner. Users should report potential and detected flaws to the FCKMS
management. An FCKMS that employs automated flaw-detection techniques is highly
desirable because it can continuously monitor its own security status, report potential
problems to an authorized person fulfilling an appropriate FCKMS role, and minimize
reliance on human monitoring of events that occur infrequently.

FR:9.14 The CKMS design shall specify the CKMS capabilities for detecting system
flaws, including:
   a) Known-answer tests,
   b) Error detection codes,
   c) Anomaly diagnostics, and
   d) Functional Testing.

FR:9.15 The CKMS design shall specify the CKMS capability for reporting flaws,
including: the capability to produce status report messages with confidentiality, integrity
and source authentication protections, and to detect unauthorized delays.

FR:9.16 The CKMS design shall specify the CKMS capability for analyzing flaws and
creating/obtaining fixes for likely or commonly known flaws.

FR:9.17 The CKMS design shall specify its capability to transmit fixes with
confidentiality, integrity and source authentication protections and to detect unauthorized
delays.

FR:9.18 The CKMS design shall specify its capability for implementing fixes in a timely
manner.
