 Example Observations and Recommendations:

 Observation 1.       Communications

      A plan identifying standardized systems for communicating with contingency plan members does not exist.

 Recommendations

                 The organization should consider developing a communications plan that establishes standardized
                  communications requirements, addresses how and where backup communication systems will be positioned,
                  and describes procedures for personnel to access backup communication systems.

                 The organization should identify redundant communications systems to ensure that essential personnel can be
                  contacted in the event of an emergency. Redundant communications systems may consist of home telephones,
                  cellular telephones, laptop computers, and other communications systems.

 Observation 2.       Flyaway Kits

      Essential personnel have not been issued flyaway kits, containing personal items and/or those items needed to perform
      their operations, to carry to relocation facilities in the event of an emergency.

 Recommendation

                 The agency should examine the possibility of developing flyaway kits and distributing them in advance to
                  personnel who would relocate during an emergency. In addition to personal items that personnel might need if
                  deployed for an extended period of time, flyaway kits should contain flash drives, diskettes or CD-ROMs with
                  information needed for essential personnel to carry out their essential functions.
