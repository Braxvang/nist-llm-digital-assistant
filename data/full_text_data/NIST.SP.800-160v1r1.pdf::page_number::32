           Characteristics of Systems
The characteristics of systems, their interrelationships with other systems, and their roles within
a system of systems all impact security and determinations of adequate security and system
trustworthiness. These system characteristics can include:
•     System type, function, and primary purpose
•     System technological, mechanical, physical, and human element characteristics
•     System states and modes of operation
•     Criticality or importance of the system
•     Ramifications of the system’s failure to meet its performance expectations, to function
      correctly, to produce only the intended behaviors and outcomes, and to provide for its own
      protection (i.e., self-protection) 27
•     System concept for the delivery of a capability
•     Approach to acquisition of the system
•     Approach to managerial and operational governance
•     Value, sensitivity, and criticality of assets entrusted to and used by the system
•     The system’s interfaces and the interfacing systems that interact through those interfaces
•     Role as a constituent system in one or more system of systems

           The Concept of Assets
An asset is an item of value. There are many different types of assets. Assets are broadly
categorized as either tangible or intangible. Tangible assets include physical items, such as
hardware, computing platforms, other technology components, and humans. Intangible assets
include humans, firmware, software, capabilities, functions, services, trademarks, intellectual
property, data, copyrights, patents, image, or reputation. 28 Within asset categories, assets can be
further identified and described in terms of common asset classes as illustrated in Table 1.
                                                    Table 1. Common Asset Classes

      ASSET CLASS                                    DESCRIPTION                                          LOSS PROTECTION CRITERIA

    MATERIAL                 This asset class includes physical property (e.g.,                  Material resources are protected from loss if
    RESOURCES AND            buildings, facilities, equipment) and physical                      they are not stolen, damaged, or destroyed
    INFRASTRUCTURE           resources (e.g., water, fuel). It also includes the basic           or are able to function or be used as
                             physical and organizational structures and facilities               intended, as needed, and when needed.
                             (i.e., infrastructure) needed for an activity or the                Infrastructure is protected from loss if it
                             operation of an enterprise or society. 29 An                        meets performance expectations while
                             infrastructure may be comprised of assets in other                  delivering only the authorized and intended
                             classes. For example, the National Airspace System

27
   To the extent feasible, self-protection is a required capability that enables the system to deliver the required stakeholder capabilities while also
protecting their assets against loss and the consequences of loss.
28
   Humans are perhaps the most important and valuable of all intangible assets. Safety and security explicitly consider the human asset.
