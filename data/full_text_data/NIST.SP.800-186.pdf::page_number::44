Implementations may take advantage of these mappings to carry out elliptic curve group
operations that were originally defined for a twisted Edwards curve on the corresponding
Montgomery curve, or vice-versa, and translating the result back to the original curve to
potentially allow code reuse.

B.2.   Mapping Between Montgomery Curves and Weierstrass Curves
One can map points on the Montgomery curve MA,B to points on the Weierstrass curve Wa,b ,
where a = (3−A2)/3B2 and b = (2A3−9A)/27B3. For the curves in this specification, this defines a
one-to-one correspondence, which is an isomorphism between MA,B and Wa,b, thereby showing
that the discrete logarithm problem in either curve model is equally hard.
For the Montgomery curves in this specification, the mapping from MA,B to Wa,b is defined by
mapping the point at infinity ∅ on MA,B to the point at infinity ∅ on Wa,b, while mapping every
other point (u, v) on MA,B to the point (x, y) = (u/B+A/3B, v/B) on Wa,b.
Note that not all Weierstrass curves can be mapped to Montgomery curves since the latter have a
point of order two and the former may not. In particular, if a Weierstrass curve has prime order –
as with the curves P-224, P-256, P-384, and P-521 specified in this Recommendation – this
mapping is not defined.
This mapping can be used to implement elliptic curve group operations that were originally
defined for a twisted Edwards curve or for a Montgomery curve using group operations on the
corresponding elliptic curve in short-Weierstrass form and translating the result back to the
original curve to potentially allow for code reuse.
Note that implementations for elliptic curves with short-Weierstrass form that hard-code the
domain parameter a to a = −3 cannot always be used this way since the curve Wa,b may not
always be expressed in terms of a Weierstrass curve with a = −3 via a coordinate transformation.
This is, unfortunately, the case with the Montgomery curves and twisted Edwards curves
specified in this Recommendation.
Specifically, for the curves in Section 3, the following is true:
The curve W-25519 is isomorphic to Curve25519, where the base point of Curve25519
corresponds to the base point of W-25519, the point at infinity ∅ of Curve25519 corresponds to
the point at infinity ∅ on W-25519, and the point (u, v) on Curve25519 corresponds to the point
(x, y) = (u+A/3, v) on Wa,b. Note that Curve25519 is not isomorphic with a Weierstrass curve
with domain parameter a = −3, although it is isogenous to such a Weierstrass curve (see
[IETF_draft_Struik]).
The curve W-448 is isomorphic to Curve448, where the base point of Curve448 corresponds to
the base point of W-448, the point at infinity ∅ of Curve448 corresponds to the point at infinity
∅ on W-448, and the point (u, v) on Curve448 corresponds to the point (x, y) = (u+A/3, v) on
Wa,b. Note that Curve448 is not isomorphic with a Weierstrass curve with domain parameter a =
−3. In particular, this means that one cannot reuse an implementation for curves with short-
Weierstrass form that hardcodes the domain parameter a to −3 to implement Curve448.
