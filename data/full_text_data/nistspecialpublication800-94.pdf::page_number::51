5.      Wireless IDPS

A wireless IDPS monitors wireless network traffic and analyzes its wireless networking protocols to
identify suspicious activity involving the protocols themselves. This section provides a detailed
discussion of wireless IDPS technologies. First, it contains a brief overview of wireless networking,
which is background material for understanding the rest of the section. Next, it covers the major
components of wireless IDPSs and explains the architectures typically used for deploying the
components. It also examines the security capabilities of the technologies in depth, including the
methodologies they use to identify and stop suspicious activity. The rest of the section discusses the
management capabilities of the technologies, including recommendations for implementation and
operation.

5.1     Wireless Networking Overview

Wireless networking enables devices with wireless capabilities to use computing resources without being
physically connected to a network. The devices simply need to be within a certain distance (known as the
range) of the wireless network infrastructure. A wireless local area network (WLAN) is a group of
wireless networking nodes within a limited geographic area that is capable of exchanging data through
radio communications. WLANs are typically used by devices within a fairly limited range, such as an
office building or corporate campus, and are implemented as extensions to existing wired local area
networks (LAN) to provide enhanced user mobility.

This section provides a brief introduction to wireless networking. Section 5.1.1 provides an overview of
the most commonly used WLAN standards. Section 5.1.2 discusses the fundamental components of
WLANs. Finally, Section 5.1.3 briefly examines the major threats against WLANs. This material is
intended only to provide a high-level overview of wireless networking as background information for the
wireless IDPS material in the rest of the section. 25

5.1.1     WLAN Standards

Most WLANs use the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 family of WLAN
standards. 26 The most commonly used WLAN radio transmission standards are IEEE 802.11b and IEEE
802.11g, which use the 2.4 gigahertz (GHz) band, and IEEE 802.11a, which uses the 5 GHz band. IEEE
802.11a, b, and g include security features known collectively as Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP).
Unfortunately, WEP has several well-documented security problems. To overcome these, IEEE 802.11i
was created; it specifies security components that work in conjunction with IEEE 802.11a, b, and g.

Another set of WLAN standards has been created by a non-profit industry consortium of WLAN
equipment and software vendors called the Wi-Fi Alliance. 27 While IEEE was working on finalizing the
802.11i standard, the Alliance created an interim solution called Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA).
Published in October 2002, WPA is essentially a subset of the draft IEEE 802.11i requirements available
at that time. WPA provides stronger security for WLAN communications than WEP. In conjunction

      This publication does not address IDPS technologies for other forms of wireless networking, such as Bluetooth. Bluetooth
      IDPS products have just started to become available, and as of late 2006 they offer few capabilities (device detection,
      service enumeration, limited vulnerability scanning). It also does not address technologies based on the IEEE 802.11n
      WLAN standard, which as of late 2006 has not been finalized. It is expected that the recommendations in this section
      should generally be applicable to wireless IDPS technologies for IEEE 802.11n-based WLANs.
