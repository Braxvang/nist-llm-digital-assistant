in a NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide – a publicly available description of the practical steps
needed to implement the cybersecurity reference designs for zero trust and a logical architecture
of a general Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) reference design (see Figure 1).

Security for 5G and Subsequent Generations
In October 2021, the NCCoE began a project focused on the technical aspects of cybersecurity for
5G (fifth-generation technology standard for broadband cellular networks). 5G refers to a recent
generation of wireless communications systems, which are faster and carry more data than
previous generations. The NCCoE project is a collaboration of 12 industry-leading organizations
that are contributing hardware and software valued at over $1 million. The expected outcome of
the project is an example 5G implementation that provides a holistic approach to 5G cybersecurity,
focusing on both standards-defined cybersecurity features as well as cloud technologies that
can provide foundational cybersecurity features outside of the scope of the existing 5G security
architecture. The resulting security reference architecture for 5G networks will bridge the gap
between IT and telecommunications cybersecurity. In FY 2021, the collaboration published a draft
executive summary (SP 1800-33A) for the project while successfully designing, planning, and
beginning the deployment of the commercial-grade 5G technology components.
The project continued the deployment of the 5G network testbed with the goal of getting the first
5G call early in calendar year 2022. The project will publish a preliminary draft of a practice guide
(SP 1800-33B) that highlights all of the cybersecurity capabilities offered by a 5G system and
enabled by the project’s reference architecture.
