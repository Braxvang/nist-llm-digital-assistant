                                                                                          GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



 Effort required for data reconstruction without data backup

 Other data backup or redundancy features of the server (e.g., Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks
  [RAID]).

For servers with highly dynamic data, standard backups may be insufficient to ensure the availability of
the server data. Some services have data modified on a continuous basis, and a server failure
necessitating restoration from a backup would cause the loss of all data changes made since the previous
backup. Some servers offer replication services that allow data changes from one server to be duplicated
on another server, either for individual changes or small batches of changes. Replication does place
additional load on servers and networks, so organizations need to weigh the costs of replication against
the costs of lost availability should a server failure occur. Replication is not intended to take the place of
standard backups, only to provide a capability to duplicate recent changes to data.

6.2.3     Maintain a Test Server

Most organizations will probably wish to maintain a test or development server for their most important
servers, at a minimum. 39 Ideally, this server should have hardware and software identical to the
production or live server and be located on an internal network segment (intranet) where it can be fully
protected by the organizationâ€™s perimeter network defenses. Although the cost of maintaining an
additional server is not inconsequential, having a test server offers numerous advantages:

 It provides a platform to test new patches and service packs before application on the production
  server.

 It provides a development platform for the server administrator to develop and test new content and
  applications.

 It provides a platform to test configuration settings before applying them to production servers.

 Software critical for development and testing but that might represent an unacceptable security risk
  on the production server can be installed on the development server (e.g., software compliers,
  administrative tool kits, remote access software).

6.3     Recovering From a Security Compromise

Most organizations eventually face a successful compromise of one or more hosts on their network.
Organizations should create and document the required policies and procedures for responding to
successful intrusions. 40 The response procedures should outline the actions that are required to respond to
a successful compromise of the server and the appropriate sequence of these actions (sequence can be
critical). Most organizations already have a dedicated incident response team in place, which should be
contacted immediately when there is suspicion or confirmation of a compromise. In addition, the




39
      Larger organizations sometimes have several test and development servers and environments for their most critical servers
      and systems. For example, there could be a server for developer testing, another server for quality assurance testing, and
      one or more externally accessible servers for testing from business partners.
