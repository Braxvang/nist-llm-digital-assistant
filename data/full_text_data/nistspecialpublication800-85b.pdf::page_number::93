Special Publication 800-85B                                   PIV Data Model Testing Specification


Test Steps            1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                      2. Set OID := <<Card Holder Fingerprints
                         (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.96.16)>>
                      3. Call pivGetData w/
                         • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                      4. Extract and parse the encapContentInfo field contents
                         from the CBEFF_SIGNATURE_BLOCK
Expected              The eContent field has been omitted and the eContentType asserts id-piv-
Result(s)             biometricObject in encapContentInfo.


10.2.1.5 Verify crls field omission

Purpose               Confirm that the crls field from the SignedData content type is omitted.
Reference(s)          1.      FIPS201, Section 4.4.2
                      2.      AS06.02.08
Precondition          1.      A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                      2.      A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and the
                              contact reader.
                      3.      The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                      4.      A valid card holder fingerprint object is present on the PIV card.
Test Steps            1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                      2. Set OID := <<Card Holder Fingerprints
                         (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.96.16)>>
                      3. Call pivGetData w/
                         • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                      4. Extract the crls field contents from the
                         CBEFF_SIGNATURE_BLOCK
Expected              The crls field is omitted from the SignedData.

10.2.1.6 Verify contents of signerInfos

Purpose               Confirms that the signerInfos in the SignedData is populated with a single
                      SignerInfo.
