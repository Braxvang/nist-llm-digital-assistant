                                                          TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



at the organization’s location. Placing assessors offsite, however, may make the test more realistic (e.g.,
when applying the covert testing approach). For examinations, assessors are generally located onsite so
they can easily access the organization’s security documentation, logs, and other information. For
assessments performed by third parties, the organization will need to determine the appropriate level of
physical access (e.g., unrestricted, escorted). For technical assessments conducted from within the
network—such as security configuration reviews and vulnerability scanning—assessors should be
provided network access either onsite, through an encrypted virtual private network (VPN) tunnel, or via
a dedicated connection from a trusted environment such as an approved test lab. 24

Assessors may require different levels of access to the network depending on the tools that they use.
Some tools require network or domain administrator privileges—if this is the case, organizations should
create new administrator accounts for use during assessments. Each assessor should have his or her own
account—administrator accounts should not be shared for any reason. This approach allows the
organization to monitor these accounts, which will be disabled or deleted at the assessment’s conclusion.

Technical assessments conducted from outside the network’s perimeter can be executed following a
number of scenarios, of which the most common are discussed here. The assessors’ systems can be
connected directly to a perimeter device (e.g., border router), which keeps the assessors within the
organization’s logical and physical boundaries. However, use of this location does not provide a true
evaluation of the organization’s security posture from an adversarial viewpoint. External tests can also be
executed from a test lab with an Internet connection that is independent from the network of the
organization being tested—and, if applicable, the organization conducting the testing (e.g., third-party
assessors conducting the tests from their own facility). 25 Organizations conducting external tests may
also choose to rent a server and an independent Internet connection. These services are provided by a
variety of vendors, typically for a monthly fee. If a rented server is used, assessors should securely delete
the data on the system and rebuild it before conducting a security test. Once testing is complete, the team
should follow the guidelines provided in Section 7.4 for data handling.

When selecting a location for assessment activities, organizations should consider the inherent risks of
using external locations. These typically offer less control over physical and logical access to external
locations than internal locations, and may place assessment systems and data at a greater risk of
compromise. Network traffic between the external location and the organization’s facilities is also at
greater risk of being monitored by unauthorized parties, which could expose security weaknesses detected
by tests. There may also be issues with performing certain types of testing, such as penetration testing,
over third-party networks—such tests may appear malicious in nature to security staff monitoring
network usage, and may even violate the security policies of the network provider.

As previously discussed in Section 5, the location of the assessment systems may affect the results of
certain types of tests. For example, if vulnerability scanning network traffic passes through a firewall,
that firewall might inadvertently block portions of the traffic and prevent certain vulnerabilities from
being detected. Also, intrusion detection and prevention systems and other security controls might block
network traffic perceived as malicious in nature, such as certain types of tests. These problems are
exacerbated when tests are run from an external location over a third-party network, in which case neither
assessors nor the organization may have knowledge of or control over the security features interfering
with test activities.

24
     Systems being tested may not be located on a production network, in which case the test team may need to be provided
     access to the non-production network used by those systems.
25
     Using an independent network is particularly advantageous if covert testing is being conducted. This can make it more
     difficult for the security staff to identify the source of the activity (i.e., the IP addresses are not associated with a test team or
     organization). Also, it prevents an inadvertent denial of service against legitimate users, which could occur if the security
     staff blocked access from the testers’ IP address range in response to the testing activity.
