An ISCM program is established to collect information in accordance with preestablished
metrics, utilizing information readily available in part through implemented security controls.
Organizational officials collect and analyze the data regularly and as often as needed to manage
risk as appropriate for each organizational tier. This process involves the entire organization,
from senior leaders providing governance and strategic vision to individuals developing,
implementing, and operating individual systems in support of the organization’s core missions
and business processes. Subsequently, determinations are made from an organizational
perspective on whether to conduct mitigation activities or to reject, transfer, or accept risk.

Organizations’ security architectures, operational security capabilities, and monitoring processes
will improve and mature over time to better respond to the dynamic threat and vulnerability
landscape. An organization’s ISCM strategy and program are routinely reviewed for relevance
and are revised as needed to increase visibility into assets and awareness of vulnerabilities. This
further enables data-driven control of the security of an organization’s information infrastructure,
and increase organizational resilience.

Organization-wide monitoring cannot be efficiently achieved through manual processes alone or
through automated processes alone. Where manual processes are used, the processes are
repeatable and verifiable to enable consistent implementation. Automated processes, including
the use of automated support tools (e.g., vulnerability scanning tools, network scanning devices),
can make the process of continuous monitoring more cost-effective, consistent, and efficient.
Many of the technical security controls defined in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800‐53,
Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, as
amended, are good candidates for monitoring using automated tools and techniques. Real‐time
monitoring of implemented technical controls using automated tools can provide an organization
with a much more dynamic view of the effectiveness of those controls and the security posture of
the organization. It is important to recognize that with any comprehensive information security
program, all implemented security controls, including management and operational controls, must
be regularly assessed for effectiveness, even if the monitoring of such controls cannot be
automated or is not easily automated.

Organizations take the following steps to establish, implement, and maintain ISCM:

•   Define an ISCM strategy;

•   Establish an ISCM program;
•   Implement an ISCM program;

•   Analyze data and Report findings;

•   Respond to findings; and

•   Review and Update the ISCM strategy and program.
A robust ISCM program thus enables organizations to move from compliance-driven risk
management to data-driven risk management providing organizations with information necessary
to support risk response decisions, security status information, and ongoing insight into security
control effectiveness.
