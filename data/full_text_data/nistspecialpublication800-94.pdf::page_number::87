8.2.2    Indirect IDPS Integration

Indirect IDPS integration is usually performed with security information and event management (SIEM)
software. 45 SIEM software is designed to import information from various security-related logs and
correlate events among them. 46 Log types commonly supported by SIEM software include IDPSs,
firewalls, antivirus software, and other security software; OSs (e.g., audit logs); application servers (e.g.,
Web servers, e-mail servers); and even physical security devices such as badge readers. SIEM software
generally works by receiving copies of the logs from the logging hosts over secure network channels,
converting the log data into standard fields and values (known as normalization), then identifying related
events by matching IP addresses, timestamps, usernames, and other characteristics. 47 SIEM products can
identify malicious activity such as attacks and malware infections, as well as misuse and inappropriate
usage of systems and networks. Some SIEM software can also initiate prevention responses for
designated events. SIEM products usually do not generate original event data; instead, they generate
meta-events based on their analysis of the imported event data.

Ways in which SIEM software complements IDPSs include the following:

 SIEM software can identify some types of events that individual IDPSs cannot because of its ability
  to correlate events logged by different technologies.
 The consoles for SIEM software can make data from many sources available through a single
  interface, which can save time for users that need to monitor multiple IDPSs. SIEM consoles also
  may offer analysis and reporting tools that certain IDPSsâ€™ consoles do not.
 Users can more easily verify the accuracy of IDPS alerts because the SIEM may be able to link each
  alert to supporting information from other logs. This can also help users to determine whether or not
  certain attacks succeeded.
Limitations of SIEM software in the context of IDPS include the following:

 There is often a considerable delay between the time an event begins and the time the SIEM sees the
  corresponding log data. Log data may be transferred from logging hosts to the SIEM in batch mode,
  such as every 5 or 10 minutes. As a result, malicious activity alerts are often displayed on an IDPS
  console earlier than on a SIEM console, and prevention actions are less timely.
 SIEM products typically transfer only some data fields from the original logs. For example, if a
  network-based IDPS records packets, the packets may not be transferred to the SIEM because of
  bandwidth and storage limitations. Also, the log normalization process that converts each data field
  to a standard format and labels the data consistently can occasionally introduce errors in the data or
  cause some data to be lost. Fortunately, SIEM products typically do not alter the original data
  sources, so they can be referenced to verify the accuracy of the data if needed.
 SIEM software may not offer agents for all IDPS products. This could require administrators to write
  custom agents to transfer IDPS data to the SIEM servers, or it could necessitate having the IDPSs
  perform logging using a different mechanism so that the SIEM software can understand the log
  format.

     SIEM is also sometimes known as security event management (SEM) or security information management (SIM).
47
     There are no widely accepted standards for IPS log formats or data fields. As a result, each IPS product uses its own schema
     for logging.
