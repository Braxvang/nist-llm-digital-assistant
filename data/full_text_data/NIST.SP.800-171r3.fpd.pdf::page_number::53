1388   3.8.7. Media Use
1389           REQUIREMENT: 03.08.07
1390           a. Restrict or prohibit the use of [Assignment: organization-defined types of system media].
1391           b. Prohibit the use of removable system media without an identifiable owner.

1392           DISCUSSION
1393           In contrast to requirement 03.08.01, which restricts user access to media, this requirement
1394           restricts the use of certain types of media, such as restricting or prohibiting the use of external
1395           hard drives, flash drives, or smart displays. This requirement also includes any potential
1396           restrictions on the use of removable system media in external systems. Organizations can use
1397           technical and non-technical measures (e.g., policies, procedures, and rules of behavior) to control
1398           the use of system media. For example, organizations may control the use of portable storage
1399           devices by using physical cages on workstations to prohibit access to external ports or disabling
1400           or removing the ability to insert, read, or write to devices.
1401           Organizations may limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices, including
1402           devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and
1403           devices that are not personally owned. Organizations may also control the use of portable storage
1404           devices based on the type of device — prohibiting the use of writeable, portable devices — and
1405           implement this restriction by disabling or removing the capability to write to such devices. Limits
1406           on the use of organization-controlled system media in external systems include restrictions on
1407           how the media may be used and under what conditions. Requiring identifiable owners (e.g.,
1408           individuals, organizations, or projects) for removable system media reduces the risk of using such
1409           technologies by allowing organizations to assign responsibility and accountability for addressing
1410           known vulnerabilities in the media (e.g., insertion of malicious code).

1416   3.8.9. System Backup – Cryptographic Protection
1417           REQUIREMENT: 03.08.09
1418           Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of CUI at backup
1419           storage locations.

1420           DISCUSSION
1421           Backup storage locations may include system-level information and user-level information.
1422           System-level information includes system state information, operating system software,
