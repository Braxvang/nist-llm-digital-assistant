                                                                                 GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



The default and traditional model that OpenPGP uses for key management is referred to as the “web of
trust,” which has no central key issuing or approving authority. The web of trust relies on the personal
decisions of users for management and control. For example, if Alice trusts Bob and Carol trusts Alice,
then Carol should trust Bob’s emails. While this is suitable for individual users and very small
organizations, the overhead of such a system is unworkable in most medium to large organizations. Some
organizations deploy keyservers that users can access to get others’ keys and store their own keys.
Although this does promote scalability, the process is typically controlled mainly by individual users, and
organizations are often not comfortable trusting keyservers to provide sufficient assurance of user
identity.

Conversely, S/MIME works on a classical, more hierarchical arrangement of authorities that the
organization chooses to trust. Typically, there is a master registration and approving authority, referred to
as a root Certificate Authority (CA), that issues a public key certificate for itself and any subordinate CAs
it sanctions. Subordinate CAs normally issue certificates to users and also to any other subordinate CAs
that they in turn sanction, forming a hierarchy. Such a public key infrastructure can be used to establish a
chain of trust between any two users holding valid certificates issued under it. By default, S/MIME-
enabled mail clients depend on the trust of their immediate master CA when processing S/MIME
transactions. This authority can be either a third-party CA 21 or a CA that is controlled by the organization
issuing the certificates.

Having an organization exchange OpenPGP or S/MIME-protected emails with other organizations is
usually extremely complicated, especially when attempting to maintain transparency for the users. The
biggest challenges are key exchange and establishing trust relationships between the organizations.
Organizations can connect their PKIs or use a mutually trusted third-party PKI, but in either case there are
often technical and legal or regulatory challenges. Also, support for OpenPGP and S/MIME varies
considerably depending on the mail client in use.

Third-party services are available that allow organizations to exchange encrypted email without having to
establish trust relationships or worry about mail application compatibility. However, the use of such
services necessitates placing sensitive messages on third-party servers, which itself can be a security
concern. The use of mail encryption gateways between two organizations typically has lesser key
management concerns because the keys are maintained on the gateways and a trust relationship already
exists between the gateways.

Work is currently underway on a possible method of reducing key management concerns for email
signing and encryption. Identity-based encryption (IBE) is a form of public key encryption that allows
any string to be used as a public key. By using email addresses as public keys, IBE could simplify key
management, making it much easier for senders to protect the emails that they send. However, there are
serious barriers to adoption of IBE, including no open standards for IBE and no FIPS-approved IBE
products. Informational Internet-Drafts have been started that propose how IBE could be performed
using S/MIME.

3.4     Issues with Email Encryption

Although encrypting email provides additional security, it does come at a cost, so organizations should
carefully weigh the issues associated with encrypting email messages:
