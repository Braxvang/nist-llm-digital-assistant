          Facilitating the ability of middleboxes (firewalls, IDS/IPS systems, etc.) to distinguish
           unencrypted ESP packets (referred to as ESP-NULL) from encrypted ones. For networks
           whose policy dictates that end-to-end encrypted packets must be dropped, this will allow high-
           speed processing and inspection of the ESP-NULL packets. Two approaches have been
           defined: a heuristics-based approach, requiring no alteration to the communicating peers; and
           the addition of a new protocol number for ESP-NULL, a more straightforward approach, but
           one that does require changes to the base ESP protocol. The latter approach, called Wrapped
           ESP (WESP), can be used with or without encryption
          Writing an IPsec roadmap document to help novices navigate the interconnected and ever-
           increasing maze of IPsec- and IKE-related documents.
These capabilities have been addressed IPsecME Working Group documents. Most have already
progressed to RFCs; the others are also expected to progress to RFCs:
 RFC 5996 Internet Key Exchange Protocol: IKEv2
 RFC 6071 IP Security (IPsec) and Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Document Roadmap
 RFC 5739 IPv6 Configuration in IKEv2
 RFC 5685 Re-direct mechanism for IKEv2
 RFC 5723 IKEv2 Session Resumption
 RFC 5840 Wrapped ESP for Traffic Visibility
 RFC 5879 Heuristics for Detecting ESP-NULL packets
 RFC 5998 An Extension for EAP-Only Authentication in IKEv2
 RFC 6027 IPsec Cluster Problem Statement
 A Quick Crash Detection Method for IKE43
 Protocol Support for High Availability of IKEv2/IPsec44


     5.3.5   Security Ramifications

IPsec has a potentially significant impact on any network’s performance. Security policy enforcement,
security association lookup, cryptographic operations, and key management are all necessary components
of any network employing IPsec. In some studies, it was shown that a security gateway implementing
IPsec required more resources for managing and looking up security associations than for performing
cryptographic operations. The proper implementation and configuration of these components is,
therefore, critical to network performance.

IPsec can use IKE for entity authentication and key management based on pre-shared secret keys, but as
the use of IPsec scales upward, this becomes unwieldy to deploy, keep secure, and update with fresh keys.
To avoid this, public-key-based methods are recommended. A fully compliant X.509 PKI can be used,
but this again involves expense and overhead—consider, for example, checking certificate revocation
