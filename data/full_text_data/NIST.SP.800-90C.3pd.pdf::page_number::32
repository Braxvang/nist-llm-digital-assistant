870   For the RBG3(RS) construction, the generate function is invoked using the following call:
871                      (status, returned_bits) = RBG3(RS)_Generate(state_handle,
872                               requested_number_of_bits, additional_input).

874                                     Fig. 11. RBG3(RS)_Generate function

875   The     RBG3(XOR)_Generate        function   (shown     in    Figure    10)    includes      a
876   prediction_resistance_request parameter to request a reseed of the RBG3(XOR)â€™s DRBG
877   instantiation, when desired. This parameter is not included as a parameter for the
878   RBG3(RS)_Generate function (shown in Figure 11) since this design always reseeds itself during
879   execution.
880   The generate functions result in calls to the entropy sources and the DRBG instantiation used by
881   the RBG3 construction. This call accesses the DRBG using the Generate_function call provided
882   in Section 2.8.1.2. The input parameters to the two generate functions are used when calling the
883   DRBG instantiation used by that RBG3 construction.
884   If the returned status code indicates a success, a bitstring that contains the newly generated bits is
885   returned. The RBG then uses the resulting bitstring as specified for each RBG3 construction (see
886   Section 6).
887   If the status code indicates an error (e.g., the entropy source has failed), an invalid (e.g., Null)
888   bitstring shall be returned as the returned_bits.
