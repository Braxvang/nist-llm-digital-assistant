With respect to possible use by terrorists of energy distribution information regarding petroleum,
natural gas, and other flammable or explosive products, a realistic impact assessment must
include energy distribution information from private companies. This information is also
susceptible to access by terrorists. Where distribution of hazardous energy products is involved,
there is a potential unauthorized disclosure consequence of loss of human life and major
property. In such cases the confidentiality impact level can be moderate or high. [Disclosure of
transportation routes and storage facilities is often (i) both authorized and necessary to mission
accomplishment and (ii) authorized, or even mandated, for public safety reasons.] Also, the
unauthorized disclosure of one agencyâ€™s energy supply information by another agency could
result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within the energy distribution
infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations tasked with energy supply.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most energy supply information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data and systems supporting
that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification to or destruction of information
or information system. The consequences of unauthorized modification to or destruction of
energy supply information or information systems, usually depends on whether the information
is mission-critical.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination:
Mission-critical systems:
Unauthorized modification of mission-critical information or information systems (e.g., electrical
power distribution, petroleum or gas pipelines) can result in severe impacts to the environment,
service, major assets and/or human safety. Consequently, the integrity impact level associated
with these types of mission-critical processes/systems may be high.
Non mission-critical systems:
For information or information systems that do not directly impact mission-critical functions, the
integrity impact level may be downgraded to low.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
energy supply information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to energy supply information.
Typically, disruption of access will have a limited adverse effect on agency operations
(including mission, functions, or public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or
individuals. Also, most energy supply information is not time-critical.
