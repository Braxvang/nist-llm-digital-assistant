                                                       TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



       Time. Security assessment is often incorporated into development or deployment with little
        notice and narrow timeframes when it should actually be made a regular part of the development
        or deployment cycle. Time is also a challenge when testing critical systems and networks that are
        in production—if testing techniques have the potential to cause loss of availability or other
        problems, systems and networks may need to be tested off-hours. Assessors are often restricted
        to testing timeframes, while real attackers are not limited to such constraints.
       Resources. Security assessment faces the continual challenge of obtaining and maintaining
        adequate resources (e.g., a skilled test team and up-to-date hardware and software). It is
        suggested that organizations designate security assessment equipment—such as laptops and
        wireless cards—to be used solely for assessments. 29 If commercial assessment software is used,
        the purchase of continuous licenses and support contracts should be considered. Assessors should
        schedule time before the assessment begins to ensure that all assessment software is properly
        patched and up to date. If internal assessors are not available or do not meet assessment
        requirements, it may be a challenge to find dependable, trustworthy outside assessors.
        Organizations should seek a firm with an established methodology, proven processes, comparable
        and sufficient past performance, and experienced personnel. If an organization is using internal
        assessors, it should continue to recruit and train skilled assessors and offer other challenging
        opportunities within the organization where assessors can become involved to avoid burnout.
       Evolving Technology. Assessors need to stay up to date on tools and testing techniques.
        Budgets should allow for annual training classes and conferences where assessors can update and
        refresh their skills.
       Operational Impact. Although assessments are planned to prevent or limit operational impact,
        there is always a chance of accidental or unexpected complications. Every test conducted should
        be recorded with a timestamp, test type, tool used, commands, the IP address of testing
        equipment, etc. It is recommended that a logging script be used to capture all commands and
        keystrokes used during the testing process. Terminal and GUI tools exist that can record a
        tester’s actions, and this type of recording can also assist in countering accusations that testing
        has negatively impacted operations and system performance. Because of the risk of operational
        impact, it is recommended that an established incident response plan be in place during testing.
7.3     Analysis

Although some analysis may be performed after an assessment has been completed (see Section 8.1),
most analysis occurs during the assessment itself. The primary goals in conducting analysis are to
identify false positives, categorize vulnerabilities, and determine the vulnerabilities’ causes. Automated
tools can produce a significant number of findings, but these findings often need to be validated to isolate
false positives. Assessors may validate vulnerabilities by manually examining the vulnerable system or
by using a second automated tool and comparing the results. Although this can be done quickly, these
comparison tools can often produce similar results—including the same false positives. Manual
examination typically provides more accurate results than comparing results from multiple tools, but it
also has the potential to be time-consuming.

Organizations may choose to categorize their findings according to the security controls and control
families in NIST SP 800-53, which organizes controls into families such as incident response and access
control. This categorization may facilitate vulnerability analysis, remediation, and documentation.

      Organizations may want to disconnect their dedicated test equipment from networks when testing is not taking place.
