Special Publication 800-85B                                PIV Data Model Testing Specification


TE07.01.04.01: The tester shall validate the correctness of the values of the parameters field of
the algorithm of the subjectPublicKeyInfo field in the PIV authentication certificate issued by the
vendor.

AS07.01.05: The keyUsage extension shall assert only the digitalSignature bit. No other bits
shall be asserted.
VE07.01.05.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the assertion of the
digitalSignature bit in the keyUsage extension as part of the PIV authentication certificate
profile.
TE07.01.05.01: The tester shall validate the assertion of the digitalSignature bit in the keyUsage
extension in the PIV authentication certificate issued by the vendor.

AS07.01.06: The policyIdentifier field in the certificatePolicies must assert id-fpki-
common-authentication (OID = 2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.3.13).
VE07.01.06.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the inclusion of the
certificatePolicies extension which asserts the id-fki-common-authentication OID as part of the
PIV authentication certificate profile.
TE07.01.06.01: The tester shall validate the presence of the id-fki-common-authentication OID
in the certificatePolicies extension in the PIV authentication certificate issued by the vendor.

AS07.01.07: The authorityInfoAccess field shall contain an id-ad-ocsp accessMethod. The
access location uses the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) name form to specify the
location of an Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) accessible Online Certificate Status
Protocol (OCSP) Server distributing status information for this certificate.
VE07.01.07.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the inclusion of an id-ad-ocsp
accessMethod in the authorityInfoAccess extension as part of the PIV authentication certificate
profile. Additionally, the accessLocation for this accessMethod uses the URI name form to
specify the location of an HTTP accessible OCSP server.
TE07.01.07.01: The tester shall validate the presence of an id-ad-ocsp accessMethod in the
authorityInfoAccess extension in the PIV authentication certificate issued by the vendor. The
tester shall also validate that the accessLocation for this accessMethod uses the URI name form
and points to an HTTP accessible OCSP server.

AS07.01.08: The FASC-N shall be populated in the subjectAltName extension using the
pivFASC-N attribute (OID = 2.16.840.1.101.3.6.6).
VE07.01.08.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the inclusion of the FASC-N in
the subjectAltName extension as part of the PIV authentication certificate profile.
TE07.01.08.01: The tester shall validate the presence of the FASC-N in the subjectAltName
extension in the PIV authentication certificate issued by the vendor.
