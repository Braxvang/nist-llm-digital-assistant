 Use secure protocols that can provide encryption for both passwords and data, such as secure shell
  [SSH] or Secure HTTP [HTTPS], and not less secure protocols (e.g., Telnet, FTP, NFS, HTTP)
  unless absolutely required and tunneled over an encrypted protocol such SSH, SSL or IPsec.
 Enforce the concept of least privilege on remote administration (e.g., attempt to minimize the access
  rights for the remote administration accounts).
 Do not allow remote administration from the Internet through the firewall unless accomplished via
  strong mechanisms such as VPNs.
 Change any default accounts or passwords from the remote administration utility or application.
 Do not mount any file shares on the internal network from the mail server or vice versa.
