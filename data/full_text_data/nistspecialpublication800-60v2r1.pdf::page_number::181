the Transportation Security information type under the Homeland Security mission area. Some
regulatory and tariff enforcement functions associated with the safe passage of passengers and
goods over land involve sensitive information. These are treated under Law Enforcement. In
most cases, unauthorized disclosure of air transportation information will have only a limited
adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of
information (e.g., investigations, maintenance) that has not been adequately researched,
coordinated, or edited can result in serious economic harm to individuals and to corporations.
Loss in public confidence is a further potential consequence. Additionally, some information
associated with air transportation functions is proprietary to corporations or subject to privacy
laws. In such cases, the confidentiality impact resulting from unauthorized disclosure can be
moderate. The sensitivity of air transportation information (e.g., aircraft positioning data)can be
time or event-driven. For example, passenger lists are not releasable to the general public before
a flight takes off, but are placed in the public domain in the event of a crash. In such cases, the
confidentiality impact resulting from unauthorized disclosure can be moderate.

Also, much military air transport information is national security information and is outside the
scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for air transportation information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Many air
transportation functions do not process time-critical information.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Some air transportation functions are time-
critical (e.g., air traffic control instructions, position reports, situational awareness, separation,
weather reports for the terminal area, microburst tracking, maintenance trouble reports).
Communications management (e.g., frequency management) information also needs to be
included in air transportation integrity impact considerations. There may be circumstances under
which erroneous frequency assignment information can result in a loss of communications with
aircraft that are affected by hazardous conditions (e.g., loss of communications with an aircraft in
a crowded air space.) Unauthorized modification or destruction of time-critical information
necessary to these functions can result in large-scale property loss and in loss of human lives.
The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) supplements the availability and integrity of
position information available from the DoD's Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Because of
the potential system-wide impacts from a loss of integrity of this system, a high integrity impact
level is recommended.

The following example illustrates the use of controls to address a high integrity impact level:
Systems designed for command and control for air traffic control (e.g., the NAS systems) have
been designed for robust operations. In the NAS, integrity and availability issues are closely
linked. The loss of integrity in a system is monitored continuously, and the loss of integrity is
