Additional, organizations may consider incorporating a DMZ as an enforcement boundary
between network segments, as depicted in Fig. 16. Implementing network segmentation utilizing
levels, tiers, or zones allows organizations to control access to sensitive information and
components while also considering operational performance and safety.

            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Whether using a risk-based approach, functional model, or other
            organizing principle, grouping components into levels, tiers, or zones is a
            precursor activity before organizations can consider applying isolation
            devices to protect and monitor communications between levels, tiers, or
            zones. When organizing assets, organizations should consider how the
            zone and isolation configuration impact their day-to-day operations,
            safety, and response capabilities.
When properly configured, network architectures support segmentation and isolation by
enforcing security policies and controlling network communications. Organizations typically
utilize their mapped data flows to identify required communications. These requirements are
then incorporated into the network architecture and configured into the policy engines of the
network devices to support monitoring communication between segments and permitting only
authorized communications. Network devices that support traffic enforcement capabilities (e.g.,
switches, routers, firewalls, and unidirectional gateways or data-diodes) can be used to
implement network segmentation and isolation.
