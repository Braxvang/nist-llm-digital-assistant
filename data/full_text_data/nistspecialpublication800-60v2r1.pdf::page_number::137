outside the scope of this guideline. The recommended categorization for unclassified anti-
terrorism information follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, High), (integrity, High), (availability, High)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of catastrophic defense
information on the ability of responsible agencies to monitor and assess the leadership,
motivations, plans, and intentions of foreign and domestic terrorist groups and their state and
non-state sponsors. The effects of unauthorized disclosure of this information can reasonably be
expected to jeopardize fulfillment of catastrophic defense missions. The consequent threat to
human life, critical infrastructures, and key national assets can be catastrophic.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for catastrophic defense information is normally high.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Unauthorized
modification or destruction of information affecting catastrophic defense activities may
adversely affect mission operations in a manner that results in loss of human life, unacceptable
damage to critical infrastructures, and/or damage to or loss of key national assets.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
catastrophic defense information is high.
Availability
The effects of disruption of access to or use of catastrophic defense information or The
availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to catastrophic defense information.
Generally, disruption of access will have a severe adverse effect on agency operations
(including mission functions and public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or
individuals. Also, catastrophic defense missions are not tolerant of delays, with consequences
of significant degradation in mission capability and resultant catastrophic consequences for
human life, critical infrastructures, and/or key national assets.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
catastrophic defense information is high.

D.2.4 Executive Functions of the Executive Office of the President (EOP) Information Type
