NIST SP 800-82r3                                           Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

   •   High-level overview of the process required to implement, operate, monitor, review,
       maintain, and improve the information security program
The costs and resources required to develop, implement, and maintain the security program
should be considered. The economic benefits of the cybersecurity program may be evaluated in
the same way that worker health and safety programs are. However, an attack on the OT system
could have significant consequences that far exceed monetary costs.

3.2.3. Resources for Building a Business Case
Helpful resources can be found through information sharing exchanges, trade and standards
organizations, consulting firms, and internal risk management programs or engineering and
operations. External organizations can also provide useful tips as to what factors most strongly
influenced management to support their efforts and what resources within their organizations
proved most helpful. While these factors may vary across industries, there may be similarities in
the roles that other risk management specialists can play. Appendix D lists some current
activities in OT security.
Internal resources in related risk management efforts (e.g., information security, health, safety
and environmental risk, physical security, business continuity) can provide tremendous
assistance in prioritizing threats and estimating business impacts. These resources can also
provide insight into which managers are focused on dealing with which risks and who may be
the most appropriate or receptive to serving as a champion.

3.2.4. Presenting the OT Cybersecurity Business Case to Leadership
In order to be successful, the OT cybersecurity program must have active participation from
senior management. Organization-level management in both IT and OT operations has the
perspective to understand the risks as well as the authority to assume responsibility for them.
Senior management will be responsible for approving and driving information security policies,
assigning security roles and responsibilities, and implementing the information security program
across the organization. Funding for the entire program can usually be done in phases. While
some funding may be required to start the program, additional funding can be obtained later as
the security vulnerabilities and needs of the program are better understood and additional
strategies are developed. Additionally, costs should be considered for retrofitting the OT for
security versus addressing security to begin with.
Often, a good approach to obtaining management buy-in is to base the business case on a
successful example of another organization that had a similar problem and how they solved it.
This will often prompt management to ask how that solution might be applicable to their
organization.
When presenting the business case to leadership, it may also be helpful to mention the specific
challenges in securing the OT systems:
   •   OT systems operate under different environments and requirements than IT systems. For
       example, OT systems tend to prioritize availability and safety over other factors like
       confidentiality.
