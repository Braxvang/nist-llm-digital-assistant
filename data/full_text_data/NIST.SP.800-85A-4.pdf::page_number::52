NIST SP 800-85A-4                                               PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                         INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

AS05.17: If the key reference is '00', '80', '96', or '97' and the current value of the retry
counter associated with the key reference is zero, then the comparison shall not be made and
the PIV Card Application shall return the status word '69 83'. In order to protect against
blocking over the contactless interface, PIV Card Applications that implement secure
messaging shall define an issuer-specified intermediate retry value for each of these key
references and return '69 83' if the command is submitted over the contactless interface (over
secure messaging or the VCI, as required for the key reference) and the current value of the
retry counter associated with the key reference is at or below the issuer-specified intermediate
retry value. If status word '69 83' is returned, then the comparison shall not be made, and the
security status and the retry counter of the key reference shall remain unchanged.

Required Vendor Information

VE05.17.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the reset value of the retry counters
associated with all the key references implemented on the card.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.17.01: The tester shall validate that the PIV Card Application returns '69 83' in response to the
VERIFY command when the retry counter associated with the key reference is zero.

AS05.18: The card command shall fail if the key reference is '00' or '80' and the VERIFY
command is not submitted over either the contact interface or the VCI or if the key reference
is '96', '97', or '98' and the VERIFY command is submitted over the contactless interface
without secure messaging. In either case, the security status and the retry counter of the key
reference shall remain unchanged.

Required Vendor Information

VE05.18.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation the conditions (and associated status
word) when the command will fail.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.18.01: The tester shall validate that if the key reference is '00' or '80' and the VERIFY
command is not submitted over either the contact interface or the VCI, or if the key reference is '96',
'97', or '98' and the VERIFY command is submitted over the contactless interface without secure
messaging, then the card command fails and the security status and the retry counter of the key
reference remain unchanged.

AS05.18A-R4: If the key reference is '96' or '97' and the authentication data in the command
data field is not of length 3N, where N satisfies the requirements for minimum and maximum
number of minutiae specified in the BIT, then the card command shall fail, and the PIV Card
Application shall return the status word '6A 80'. The security status and the retry counter of
the key reference shall remain unchanged.
