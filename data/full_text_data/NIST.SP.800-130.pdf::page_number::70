6.8.3 Key and Metadata Revocation
Keys are revoked for a number of reasons, including key compromise and the termination
of an employee or the employee’s role within an organization. A CKMS should have the
ability to rapidly replace keys (both asymmetric and symmetric) and the ability to notify
the relying parties (those who make use of the key) of compromise/revocation.

Compromised Key Lists (CKLs), Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) (see [RFC 5280]),
White Lists, Query White Lists, and the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) (see
[RFC 6960]) are examples of mechanisms in use for the promulgation of key revocation
information to the relying entities. Each mechanism has its benefits and drawbacks. For
example, CRLs and CKLs have problems with growing very large and becoming out of
date (i.e., stale). Growth adversely impacts communication, computing, and storage
requirements. The growth problems for the end entity can be mitigated by partitioning the
revocation information into smaller chunks, each chunk handling fewer keys. Staleness
cannot be fully eliminated, but can be mitigated by issuing lists more frequently. Note
that in some instances, more than one revocation mechanism can be used to meet the
security requirements and limitations of the relying parties.

Key revocation mechanisms should consider:
   a) Relying entity requirements for the timeliness of revocation information,
   b) Relying entity computing and communication limitations, and
   c) Infrastructure cost considerations.

FR:6.108 A CKMS design shall specify the key revocation mechanism(s) and associated
relying entity notification mechanism(s) used or available for use.

6.8.4 Cryptographic Module Compromise
Since a cryptographic module contains plaintext keys at some point in time, the
compromise of the module has the potential to compromise the symmetric and private
keys contained within the module (see Section 8.4). This could lead to the loss of
confidentiality, the loss of integrity, or the loss of the ability to authenticate, as described
in Section 6.8.1 above. Cryptographic modules can be compromised either physically
(i.e., obtaining direct access to the keys within the module) or by non-invasive methods
so that knowledge of the keys within the module is obtained by some external action. To
provide physical protection, modules should operate in a space where unauthorized
access is not permitted or where unauthorized access is quickly detected before a serious
compromise occurs. Some modules provide this protection at their cryptographic
boundary, but larger boundaries may also be involved. See [FIPS 140] for more
information on the physical protection of a cryptographic module’s contents. If access to
the contents of a cryptographic module is permitted, then an access control system may
be required to ensure that only authorized parties succeed.

Following an actual or suspected cryptographic module compromise, a secure state of the
module should be re-established. The actions required to return to this state are
collectively called recovery. Recovery sometimes requires the replacement of internal
