                                                                   GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



 Ability to control access to data on the server

 Ability to disable unnecessary network services that may be built into the OS or server software

 Ability to control access to various forms of executable programs, such as Common Gateway
  Interface (CGI) scripts and server plug-ins in the case of Web servers

 Ability to log appropriate server activities to detect intrusions and attempted intrusions

 Provision of a host-based firewall capability.

In addition, organizations should consider the availability of trained, experienced staff to administer the
server and server products. Many organizations have learned the difficult lesson that a capable and
experienced administrator for one type of operating environment is not automatically as effective for
another.
Although many Web servers do not host sensitive information, most Web servers should be considered
sensitive because of the damage to the organization’s reputation that could occur if the servers’ integrity
is compromised. In such cases, it is critical that the Web servers are located in areas that provide secure
physical environments. When planning the location of a Web server, the following issues should be
considered:

 Are the appropriate physical security protection mechanisms in place? Examples include—

       Locks

       Card reader access

       Security guards

       Physical IDSs (e.g., motion sensors, cameras).

 Are there appropriate environmental controls so that the necessary humidity and temperature are
  maintained?

 Is there a backup power source? For how long will it provide power?

 If high availability is required, are there redundant Internet connections from at least two different
  Internet service providers (ISP)?

 If the location is subject to known natural disasters, is it hardened against those disasters and/or is
  there a contingency site outside the potential disaster area?

3.2     Security Management Staff

Because Web server security is tightly intertwined with the organization’s general information system
security posture, a number of IT and system security staff may be interested in Web server planning,
implementation, and administration. This section provides a list of generic roles and identifies their
responsibilities as they relate to Web server security. These roles are for the purpose of discussion and
may vary by organization.
