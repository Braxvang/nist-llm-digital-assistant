5.4     Finger selection
This document recommends that different fingers should be imaged for off-card and on-card comparison. This
mitigates an attack where off-card templates are stolen (after PIN release) and used to prepare spoofs via [REVFING]
for use in on-card comparison (which is not preceded by PIN entry). This document nevertheless allows data from the
same fingers in on-card and off-card comparison operations for two reasons. First is to mitigate a usability issue,
namely that users might be confused as to which fingers should be presented. Second, there is always the possibility
that fingerprints are stolen from other sources (including latent acquisition) and used in a spoof attack.

5.5     Data objects
5.5.1      Biometric Information Template
Each submitted card shall be populated with Biometric Information Templates (BITs) grouped under the BIT Group
Template of Table 7 according to the requirements of [CARD-CMD, Tables 1 and 2]. The number of BITs shall be equal
to 2, one for each finger.
