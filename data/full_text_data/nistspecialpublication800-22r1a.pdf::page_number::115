A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



Appendix D—Description of Reference Pseudorandom Number Generators


The NIST Statistical Test Suite supplies the user with nine pseudo-random number generators. A brief
description of each pseudo-random number generator follows. The user supplied sequence length
determines the number of iterations for each generator.

D.1              Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)

The input parameter for the Fishman and Moore12 LCG13 is fixed in code but may be altered by the user.

Input Parameter:

z0 = 23482349

Description:

Given a seed z0, subsequent numbers are computed based on zi+1 = a*zi mod (231-1), where a is a function
of the current state. These numbers are then converted to uniform values in [0,1]. At each step, output ‘0’
if the number is ≤ 0.5, otherwise output ‘1’.

D.2              Quadratic Congruential Generator I (QCG-I)

The input parameters to the QCG-I are fixed in code, but may modified by the user.

Input Parameters:

p = 987b6a6bf2c56a97291c445409920032499f9ee7ad128301b5d0254aa1a9633fdbd378
d40149f1e23a13849f3d45992f5c4c6b7104099bc301f6005f9d8115e1

x0 = 3844506a9456c564b8b8538e0cc15aff46c95e69600f084f0657c2401b3c244734b62e
a9bb95be4923b9b7e84eeaf1a224894ef0328d44bc3eb3e983644da3f5


Description:

Using a 512-bit prime p, and a random 512-bit seed x0, construct subsequent elements (each 512-bit
numbers) in the sequence via the rule:

                                               xi+1 = xi2 mod p, for i ≥ 0.

D.3              Quadratic Congruential Generator II (QCG-II)

The input parameter to the QCG-II is fixed in code, but may be modified by the user.
