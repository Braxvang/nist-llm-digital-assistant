AS06.03.10: The SignerInfo type shall use the issuerAndSerialNumber choice for the sid
and this shall correspond to the issuer and serialNumber fields found in the X.509
certificate for the entity that signed the biometric data.
No requirement for vendor.
TE06.03.10.01: The tester shall validate that the issuerAndSerialNumber choice has been used
for the SignerIdentifier and it corresponds to the issuer and serialNumber fields found in the
X.509 certificate for the entity that signed the biometric data.

AS06.03.11: The SignerInfo type shall specify a digestAlgorithm in accordance with Table
3-3 of SP 800-78.
No requirement for vendor.
TE06.03.11.01: The tester shall validate that the digest algorithm in the SignerInfo is based on
the expiration date of the PIV card and is in accordance with Table 3-3 of SP80078.

AS06.03.12: The signedAttrs of the SignerInfo shall include the MessageDigest (OID =
1.2.840.113549.1.9.4) attribute containing the hash of the concatenated CBEFF_HEADER
and the STD_BIOMETRIC_RECORD.
No requirement for vendor.
TE06.03.12.01: The tester shall validate the presence of a MessageDigest attribute in the signed
attributes.
TE06.03.12.02: The tester shall validate the value of the MessageDigest attribute against the
hash of the concatenated CBEFF_HEADER and the STD_BIOMETRIC_RECORD.

AS06.03.13: The signedAttrs of the SignerInfo shall include the pivSigner-DN (OID =
2.16.840.1.101.3.6.5) attribute containing the subject name that appears in the X.509
certificate for the entity that signed the biometric data.
No requirement for vendor.
TE06.03.13.01: The tester shall validate the presence of a pivSigner-DN attribute in the signed
attributes.
TE06.03.13.02: The tester shall validate the value of the pivSigner-DN attribute is the same as
the subject name that appears in the certificate that signed the biometric data.

AS06.03.14: The signedAttrs of the SignerInfo shall include the pivFASC-N (OID =
2.16.840.1.101.3.6.6) attribute containing the FASC-N of the PIV card.
No requirement for vendor.
TE06.03.14.01: The tester shall validate the presence of a pivFASC-N attribute in the signed
attributes.
TE06.03.14.02: The tester shall validate the value of the pivFASC-N attribute is the same as the
FASC-N that is present in the CHUID.
