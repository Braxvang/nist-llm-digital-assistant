                                                                                COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE



Appendix F—Frequently Asked Questions

Users, system administrators, information security staff members, and others within organizations may
have questions about incident response. The following are frequently asked questions (FAQ).
Organizations are encouraged to customize this FAQ and make it available to their user community.
     1. What is an incident?
          In general, an incident is a violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or
          standard computer security practices. Examples of incidents are:
           An attacker commands a botnet to send high volumes of connection requests to one of an
            organization’s web servers, causing it to crash.
           Users are tricked into opening a “quarterly report” sent via email that is actually malware;
            running the tool has infected their computers and established connections with an external
            host.
           A perpetrator obtains unauthorized access to sensitive data and threatens to release the details
            to the press if the organization does not pay a designated sum of money.
           A user provides illegal copies of software to others through peer-to-peer file sharing services.
     2. What is incident handling?
          Incident handling is the process of detecting and analyzing incidents and limiting the incident’s
          effect. For example, if an attacker breaks into a system through the Internet, the incident handling
          process should detect the security breach. Incident handlers will then analyze the data and
          determine how serious the attack is. The incident will be prioritized, and the incident handlers
          will take action to ensure that the progress of the incident is halted and that the affected systems
          return to normal operation as soon as possible.
     3. What is incident response?
          The terms “incident handling” and “incident response” are synonymous in this document.50
     4. What is an incident response team?
          An incident response team (also known as a Computer Security Incident Response Team
          [CSIRT]) is responsible for providing incident response services to part or all of an organization.
          The team receives information on possible incidents, investigates them, and takes action to ensure
          that the damage caused by the incidents is minimized.
     5. What services does the incident response team provide?
          The particular services that incident response teams offer vary widely among organizations.
          Besides performing incident handling, most teams also assume responsibility for intrusion
          detection system monitoring and management. A team may also distribute advisories regarding
          new threats, and educate users and IT staff on their roles in incident prevention and handling.
     6. To whom should incidents be reported?
          Organizations should establish clear points of contact (POC) for reporting incidents internally.
          Some organizations will structure their incident response capability so that all incidents are
          reported directly to the incident response team, whereas others will use existing support
50
     Definitions of “incident handling” and “incident response” vary widely. For example, CERT®/CC uses “incident handling”
     to refer to the overall process of incident detection, reporting, analysis, and response, whereas “incident response” refers
     specifically to incident containment, recovery, and notification of others. See http://www.cert.org/csirts/csirt_faq.html for
     more information.
