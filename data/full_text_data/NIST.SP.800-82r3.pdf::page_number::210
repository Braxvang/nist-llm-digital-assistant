D.1.8.2.       NIST SP 1800 Series Cybersecurity Practice Guides
NIST SP 1800 series presents practical and usable solutions for applying standards-based
cybersecurity approaches and best practices in the real world. The guides are designed to help
organizations gain efficiencies in implementing cybersecurity technologies while saving them
research and proof-of-concept costs. An 1800 document can map capabilities to the
Cybersecurity Framework and outline the steps needed for another entity or organization to
recreate an example solution.
