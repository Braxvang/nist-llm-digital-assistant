                                 GUIDE TO MALWARE INCIDENT PREVENTION AND HANDLING FOR DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS


Being able to alter application configuration settings quickly can be very beneficial in remediating
vulnerabilities very quickly, including temporary remediation measures. For example, a configuration
change could disable a vulnerable service temporarily while the service’s vendor prepares and releases a
patch that permanently fixes the vulnerability. Once the patch is available and deployed, the organization
can reverse the configuration change to reactivate the no longer vulnerable service. Organizations should
consider in advance how configuration settings could be changed in response to a malware emergency
and establish and maintain appropriate procedures.

3.4     Threat Mitigation

Organizations should perform threat mitigation to detect and stop malware before it can affect its targets.
Even if virtually all vulnerabilities in a host have been mitigated, threat mitigation is still critically
important—for example, for stopping instances of malware that do not exploit vulnerabilities, such as
attacks that rely on social engineering methods to trick users into running malicious files. Threat
mitigation is also critical for situations where a major new threat is likely to attack an organization soon
and the organization does not have an acceptable vulnerability mitigation option. For example, there
might not be a patch available for a new vulnerability.

This section describes several types of security tools that can mitigate malware threats: antivirus software,
intrusion prevention systems (IPS), firewalls, content filtering/inspection, and application whitelisting.
For each of these categories, the section also describes typical features, the types of malware and attack
vectors the tools address, and the methods they use to detect and stop malware. Recommendations and
guidance for implementing, configuring, and maintaining the tools are also provided, as well as
explanations of the tools’ shortcomings and the ways in which they complement other tools. In addition,
the section discusses client and server application settings that can be helpful in mitigating threats.

3.4.1     Antivirus Software

Antivirus software is the most commonly used technical control for malware threat mitigation. There are
many brands of antivirus software, with most providing similar protection through the following
recommended capabilities:

       Scanning critical host components such as startup files and boot records.
       Watching real-time activities on hosts to check for suspicious activity; a common example is
        scanning all email attachments for known malware as emails are sent and received. Antivirus
        software should be configured to perform real-time scans of each file as it is downloaded, opened,
        or executed, which is known as on-access scanning.
       Monitoring the behavior of common applications, such as email clients, web browsers, and
        instant messaging software. Antivirus software should monitor activity involving the applications
        most likely to be used to infect hosts or spread malware to other hosts.
       Scanning files for known malware. Antivirus software on hosts should be configured to scan all
        hard drives regularly to identify any file system infections and, optionally, depending on
        organization security needs, to scan removable media inserted into the host before allowing its
        use. Users should also be able to launch a scan manually as needed, which is known as on-
        demand scanning.
       Identifying common types of malware as well as attacker tools.
