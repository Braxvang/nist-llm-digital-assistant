A concern with both BYOD and CYOD devices is the lack of supply-chain management. The
enterprise has little to no knowledge of the device’s origination or if it has been modified. A
BYOD/CYOD device may be rooted or jailbroken with untrusted apps installed. The device may
be infected with malware without the user’s knowledge. The lack of a baseline leaves the
enterprise at a disadvantage when it allows a user to access enterprise data via their device.
For the organization, CYOD offers the opportunity to limit the hardware supply chain risk and to
control access to enterprise data and backend systems through enterprise protection software
(e.g., an EMM or MTD agent). The advantage of CYOD over BYOD is that employees are
informed in advance of the devices that are capable of running the necessary enterprise
protection software and, thus, will be permitted to access enterprise resources. When IT staff
members decline to allow a BYOD device because it is unable to run an enterprise EMM agent,
then BYOD equals CYOD but with the appearance of IT management inconsistency and
capricious application of unstated policies.

5.1.4. Select Devices
The organizational mission and constraints, such as cost and deployment models, are considered
in the selection of mobile devices [18]. That is why Section 5.1.1, an approach for assessing an
organization’s mission needs for mobile solutions is needed. Understanding the impact of mobile
devices on mission needs can help an organization to focus its selection process by narrowing it
to a small set of candidate devices that satisfy the organization’s requirements.
Costs and security concerns related to mobile devices can impact purchasing decisions. Costs can
be minimized by limiting the deployment of devices to only users who need them to support an
organization’s mission and by selecting devices with only the necessary capabilities (e.g.,
choosing a previous model rather than the “latest model”). For security, it is important to select
device models that are current enough to be well supported by the manufacturer and can
accommodate OS and application updates and patches.

5.1.5. Determine EMM Capabilities
Identifying the EMM capabilities required to work effectively within an enterprise is an
important activity to perform before acquiring an EMM. This step requires organizational leaders
to use the information gathered in the previous sections to define the capability requirements for
their EMM solution. For example, the EMM must support the devices selected to meet the
mission needs and, potentially, existing devices in the current inventory. Other commonly
required EMM capabilities are options for integrating the EMM infrastructure into the
enterprise’s infrastructure. These options include “on prem” operations (i.e., running on servers
hosted on-premises within the enterprise data center), support for a software as a service (SaaS)
model, or product certifications/accreditations and third-party service integrations. Section 4.2
discusses many other important capabilities for EMMs and other enterprise technologies
designed to support mobile computing for the enterprise. The list of required EMM capabilities
will support the well-reasoned selection of an EMM for the enterprise, ensuring that it provides
the necessary functional and security capabilities.
