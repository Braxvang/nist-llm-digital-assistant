   ensure the consistent and accurate exchange of SCAP-conformant content and the
   ability to reliably use the content with SCAP-conformant products.

   SCAP is a suite of specifications that standardize the format and nomenclature by
   which software flaw and security configuration information is communicated, both to
   machines and to humans. SCAP is a multi-purpose framework of specifications that
   support automated configuration, vulnerability and patch checking, technical control
   compliance activities, and security measurement. Goals for the development of SCAP
   include standardizing system security management, promoting interoperability of
   security products, and fostering the use of standard expressions of security content.

    Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Lengths, January 2011,
    http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
    SP 800-131A is intended to provide more detail about the transitions associated with
    the use of cryptography by Federal government agencies for the protection of
    sensitive, but unclassified information. The Recommendation addresses the use of
    algorithms and key lengths. (See also Implementation Guidance for FIPS 140-2 and
    the CMVP Program, G14 and G15, June 2012).

    SP 800-132 specifies a family of password-based key derivation functions (PBKDFs)
    for deriving cryptographic keys from passwords or passphrases for the protection of
    electronically stored data or for the protection of data protection keys.

    SP 800-147: BIOS Protection Guidelines, April 2011,
    http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
    SP 800-147 provides guidelines for preventing the unauthorized modification of
    Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) firmware on PC client systems. Unauthorized
    modification of BIOS firmware by malicious software constitutes a significant threat
    because of the BIOSâ€™s unique and privileged position within the PC architecture. A
    malicious BIOS modification could be part of a sophisticated, targeted attack on an
