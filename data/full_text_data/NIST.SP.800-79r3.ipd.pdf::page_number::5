      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                 Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                        and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



 90   Abstract
 91   The document provides appropriate and useful guidelines for assessing the reliability of issuers
 92   of PIV Cards and derived PIV credentials. These issuers store personal information and issue
 93   credentials based on OMB policies and the standards published in response to HSPD-12. The
 94   reliability of an issuer is of utmost importance when an organization (e.g., a federal agency) is
 95   required to trust identity credentials that were created and issued by another organization. This
 96   trust relies on having the necessary level of assurance that the reliability of the issuing
 97   organization has been established through a formal authorization process.
