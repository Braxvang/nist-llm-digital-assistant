                                                                                                organization may require that certain types of locked-out user accounts be unlocked only in person, but
                                                                                                this may not be viable for teleworkers who are on travel or on long-term assignments in external

                                                                                                 Existing remote access used by the organization, such as remote control systems used by IT staff;
                                                                                                 Software already installed on telework devices that can be used for remote access; and
                                                                                                 Capabilities available in firewalls that are already installed at the edge of the organization's network.
                                                                                                The policy for which types of remote access are permitted for telework should be closely tied to the
                                                                                                organization's overall security policy. If one of the forms of remote access under consideration cannot be
                                                                                                secured in a fashion that is required by the organization's security policy, such as using approved
                                                                                                cryptographic algorithms to protect sensitive data, then that form of remote access should not be used by
                                                                                                the organization. The overall security policy should take priority when creating a telework security policy.

                                                                                                A telework security policy can limit the types of client devices that teleworkers are allowed to use. For a

                                                                                                organization-controlled PCs to be used. Some organizations have tiered levels of access, such as allowing
                                                                                                organization-controlled PCs to access many resources, BYOD PCs and third-party-controlled PCs to
                                                                                                access a limited set of resources, and BYOD mobile devices to access only one or two resources, such as
                                                                                                webmail. This allows an organization to limit the risk it incurs by permitting the most-controlled devices
                                                                                                to have the most access and the least-controlled devices to have minimal access or no access at all.

                                                                                                Each organization should make its own risk-based decisions about what levels of remote access should be
