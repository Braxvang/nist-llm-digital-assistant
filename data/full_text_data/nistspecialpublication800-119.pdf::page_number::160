6.9     IPv6 Deployment

This document discusses IPv6 deployment, rather than IPv6 transition. The basic assumption is that, for
the foreseeable future, organizations will either operate dual stack networks or accommodate both IPv4
and IPv6 networking through other means. However, the eventual goal is to transition to an IPv6 only
network, or at least an IPv6-centric one. This section is written with that ultimate goal in mind.

This section covers the deployment of IPv6. The IPv6 deployment should follow the NIST guidelines for
a secure information system life cycle68 and should include the following stages:

          Initiation Phase
          Acquisition/Development Phase
          Implementation Phase
          Operations/Maintenance Phase
          Disposition Phase.
The framework calls for a phased approach or a gradual transition from IPv4 to IPv6. The use of a
phased implementation will enable an organization to implement IPv6 with as little disruption to the
current environment as possible. Existing users should be unaware of the new protocol until they require
its use. The phased approach will minimize the affect on day-to-day operations. There are two main
approaches to transition deployment:

          Pervasive IPv6 deployment
          Sparse IPv6 deployment.
In a pervasive approach, the organization enables dual (IPv4/IPv6) stack equipment rapidly throughout
the entire enterprise. This scenario is appropriate when an organization has mostly new equipment that
supports both IPv4 and IPv6. After the organization validates core services and translation mechanisms
are functioning properly, IPv4 is disabled on all equipment, leaving an IPv6 dominant network.

Edge to core describes a sparse IPv6 deployment. In this approach, organizations enable groups or
islands of IPv6 equipment in an IPv4 dominant network. After most of the edge devices transition to
IPv6, the network core transitions to either dual stack or IPv6 only. A sparse IPv6 deployment requires
supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic throughout the duration of the deployment life cycle. This
approach makes extensive use of IPv4/IPv6 and IPv6/IPv4 tunneling. This scenario is appropriate when
an organization has a large installed base of older equipment or services that cannot transition to IPv6.

Software or applications may be more important than equipment when selecting a transition approach.
Upgrades for hardware and embedded operating systems can be quicker than custom or off the shelf
applications. The hardware vendors have been working towards IPv6 support for longer than application
software vendors have. Many vendors may not be able or willing to upgrade software to support IPv6
and many organizations do not have the expertise in house to upgrade the code base. The more legacy
applications and custom code an organization supports (either developed in house or highly customized
off the shelf software) the greater the risk that the software will not support IPv6. Transition planners
