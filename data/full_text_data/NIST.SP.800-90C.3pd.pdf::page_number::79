       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                        Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

2219       •    Access to a second sub-DRBG (Sub-DRBG2) that provides output for a second application
2220            that requires a security strength of 256 bits

2221   B.3.1. Instantiation of the Sub-DRBGs
2222   Each sub-DRBG is instantiated using output from an RBG1 construction that is discussed in
2223   Appendix 62B.2.

2224   B.3.1.1.        Instantiating Sub-DRBG1
2225   Sub-DRBG1 is instantiated using the following Instantiate_function call (see Section 2.8.1.1):
2226       (status, sub-DRBG1_state_handle) = Instantiate_function (128, prediction_resistance_flag
2227                                  = FALSE, “Sub-DRBG App 1”).
2228       •    A security strength of 128 bits is requested from the DRBG indicated by the
2229            RBG1_state_handle.
2230       •    Setting “prediction_resistance_flag = FALSE” indicates that a consuming application will
2231            not be allowed to request prediction resistance. Optionally, the parameter can be omitted.
2232       •    The personalization string to be used for sub-DRBG1 is “Sub-DRBG App 1.”
2233       •    The returned state handle for sub-DRBG1 will be sub-DRBG1_state_handle.
2234   The randomness input for establishing the 128-bit security strength of sub-DRBG1 is requested
2235   using the following Generate_function call to the RBG1 construction):
2236           (status, randomness-source_input) = Generate_function(RBG1_state_handle, 192, 128,
2237                         prediction_resistance_request = FALSE, additional_input).
2238       •    192 bits are requested from the source RBG (indicated by RBG1_state_handle) at a security
2239            strength of 128 bits (192 = 128 + 64 = 3s/2).
2240       •    Setting “prediction_resistance_flag = FALSE” indicates that the source RBG (the RBG1
2241            construction) will not need to reseed itself before generating the requested output.
2242            Alternatively, the parameter can be omitted.
2243       •    Additional input is optional.
2244   If status = SUCCESS is returned from the Generate_function, the HMAC_DRBG in sub-DRBG1
2245   is seeded using the randomness-source_input obtained from the RBG1 construction and the
2246   personalization_string provided in the Instantiate_function call (i.e., “Sub-DRBG App 1”). The
2247   internal state is recorded for Sub-DRBG1 (including the 128-bit security strength), and status =
2248   SUCCESS is returned from the Instantiate_function along with a state handle of sub-
2249   DRBG1_state_handle.
2250   If status = FAILURE is returned from the Generate_function call, then the internal state is not
2251   created, status = FAILURE and a Null state handle are returned from the Instantiate_function,
2252   and the sub-DRBG1 cannot be used to generate bits.
