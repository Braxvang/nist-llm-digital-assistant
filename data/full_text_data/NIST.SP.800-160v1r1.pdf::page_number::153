NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                              Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems

         achieved. This includes completing acceptance tests defined in agreements. These tests include
         security aspects associated with physical connections between the system and the environment.
         TR-2.5 Provide security training for the operators, users, and other stakeholders necessary for
                system utilization and support.
         TR-2.6 Perform security activation and checkout of the system.
         Note: Security activation and checkout shows that the system can initialize to its initial secure
         operational state for all defined modes of operation and accounts for all interconnections to
         other systems across physical, virtual, and wireless interfaces.
         TR-2.7 Demonstrate that the installed system can deliver its required functions in a trustworthy
                secure manner.
         TR-2.8 Demonstrate that the security functions provided by the system and the effects of the
                security functions are sustainable by enabling systems.
         TR-2.9 Review the security trustworthiness of the system for operational readiness.
         Note: The results of installation, operational, and enabling system checkouts are reviewed to
         determine whether the security performance and effectiveness are sufficient to justify
         operational use.
         TR-2.10 Commission the system for secure operation.
         Note: This includes providing security support to users and operators at the time of the system
         commissioning.

TR-3     MANAGE RESULTS OF TRANSITION
         TR-3.1 Record the security aspects of transition results and any anomalies encountered.
         TR-3.2 Record the security aspects of operational incidents and problems, and track their
                resolution.
         TR-3.3 Maintain traceability of the security aspects of transitioned system elements.
         Note: Bidirectional traceability is maintained between all identified security aspects and the
         supporting data associated with the transition strategy and the system requirements, system
         architecture, and system design.
         TR-3.4 Provide the security-relevant artifacts that have been selected for baselines.

H.11. Validation
The purpose of the Validation process is to provide objective evidence that the system, when in
use, fulfills its business or mission objectives and stakeholder requirements, achieving its
intended use in its intended operational environment.
