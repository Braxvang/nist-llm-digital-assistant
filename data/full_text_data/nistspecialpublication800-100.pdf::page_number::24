CHAPTER 2                                                            Information Security Governance


    Over time, policies and procedures may become inadequate because of changes
in agency mission and operational requirements, threats, environment, deterioration
in the degree of compliance, changes in technology or infrastructure, or business
processes. Periodic assessments and reports on activities can be a valuable means of
identifying areas of noncompliance, reminding users of their responsibilities and
demonstrating management's commitment to the security program. While an
organization’s mission does not frequently change, the agency may expand its
mission to secure agency programs and assets and, by extension, require
modification to its information security requirements and practices. It is important
that a change in an organization’s internal requirements is checked against external
federal requirements as, for example, a change to an information system’s security
posture may alter its subsequent reporting requirements.
    To facilitate ongoing monitoring, the SAISO and other officials can compare and
correlate a variety of real-time and static information available from a number of
ongoing activities within and outside of their programs. FISMA requires agencies to
perform an annual assessment of their information security programs and report
information security performance measures quarterly and annually. The intent of
these reporting requirements is to facilitate close to real-time assessment and
monitoring of information security program activities. Ongoing monitoring combines
the use of existing data to oversee a security program, and typically occurs
throughout all phases of the program life cycle. Agencies can use a variety of data
originating from the ongoing information security program activities to monitor
performance of programs under their purview, including POA&Ms, performance
measurements and metrics, continuous assessment, configuration management and
control, network monitoring, and incident statistics.
  Table 2-1 provides a broad overview of key ongoing activities that can assist in
monitoring and improving an agency’s information governance activities.
