Besides memory, SD cards may also incorporate other types of peripherals such as wireless
communications or camera cards.

The architecture for Palm OS devices is organized into the following layers: Application,
Operating System, Software API and Hardware Drivers, and Hardware. Figure 2 illustrates
the relationship between layers. The software Application Programming Interface (API) gives
software developers a degree of hardware independence, allowing applications to execute
under different hardware environments by recompiling the application. Developers have the
freedom to bypass the API and directly access the processor, providing more control of the
processor and its functionality. However, this comes at the expense of increased security risks
due to malicious applications. The Palm OS does not implement permissions on code and
data. Therefore, any application can access and modify data [Kin01].

Other handheld device manufacturers have licensed the Palm OS for use in their own line of
equipment. Versions of the Palm OS can be divided into three ranges: those before version
4.0, those from version 4.0 to 5.0, and those from 5.0 onward to version 6. Initially Palm OS
supported simple multitasking whereby applications could run only one at a time, and were
single-threaded. More recent versions support full multitasking and multi-threaded
applications. A number of vulnerabilities were identified in versions before 4.0 and
subsequently fixed. In particular, the user login password was shown to be vulnerable and
easily reversed [Kin01]. Version 4.0 also introduced initial support for filesystems on
removable memory cards. Versions before 5.0 execute only a single program at a time, while
5.0 and after support multiprocessing. Versions 5.0 and above switched emphasis away from
the DragonBall family of microprocessors to the StrongArm family7, with emulation support
of legacy applications previously developed for DragonBall.

Palm OS devices offer built-in security features to provide protection for individual
entries/records and the ability to lock the device when the user turns the device off. Locking
individual records allow users to mark records as private and not be displayed unless the
proper password is provided. However, records marked private can be accessed, read, and
copied through other means [Ket00]. The ability to lock a device requires users to enter the
correct password before access is granted to the application screen. In early versions of Palm
OS, weak password encoding is easily reversed and the encoded block of data that contains the
