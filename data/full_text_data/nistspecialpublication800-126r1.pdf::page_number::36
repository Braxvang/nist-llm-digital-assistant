               The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



5.2   Vulnerability Scanning

SCAP content can be used to scan operating systems and applications to look for known software flaws
that introduce security exposures. The content enables consistent detection and reporting of these flaws.

The SCAP source data stream component that MUST be included for vulnerability scanning is the
XCCDF Benchmark, which expresses the checklist of the flaws to be checked for. Each rule in the
XCCDF Benchmark SHALL reference one of the following:

 An OVAL vulnerability definition. This definition SHALL be contained in an OVAL Vulnerability
  component, which holds the definitions of the vulnerability checks used by the checklist. The OVAL
  Vulnerability component SHALL have at least one OVAL definition of class vulnerability, MAY
  have one or more additional OVAL definitions of classes vulnerability and/or inventory, and SHALL
  NOT have any other classes of OVAL definitions. An XCCDF Benchmark‘s rules MAY reference
  one or more OVAL vulnerability definitions in an OVAL Vulnerability component.
 An OCIL questionnaire. This questionnaire SHALL be contained in an OCIL Questionnaire
  component, which holds the questionnaires that collect information that OVAL is not being used to
  collect, such as giving a system administrator step-by-step directions for manually examining a
  system for a vulnerability that cannot be detected with OVAL, and then collecting information on the
  results of that manual examination. An XCCDF Benchmark‘s rules MAY reference one or more
  OCIL questionnaires in an OCIL Questionnaire component.
 An OVAL Patch component. The OVAL Patch component holds definitions for patch compliance
  checks. These checks may be needed if an organization includes patch verification in its vulnerability
  scanning activities. The OVAL Patch component SHALL have at least one OVAL definition of class
  patch, MAY have one or more additional OVAL definitions of classes compliance and/or inventory,
  and SHALL NOT have any other classes of OVAL definitions. An XCCDF Benchmark MAY
  reference an OVAL Patch component through a patches up-to-date rule in a manner consistent with
  Section 3.2.6.4.
Each XCCDF Benchmark SHALL have at least one rule that references either an OVAL vulnerability
definition in the OVAL Vulnerability component or an OCIL questionnaire in the OCIL Questionnaire
component.

All OVAL Vulnerability, OCIL Questionnaire, and OVAL Patch components referenced by the XCCDF
Benchmark SHALL be included in the SCAP source data stream.

If the XCCDF Benchmark component references any CPE names, then the SCAP source data stream
MUST include the following components, in addition to those already mentioned:

 CPE Dictionary: specifies the products or platforms of interest.
 CPE Inventory: contains the technical procedures for determining whether or not a specific target
  asset has a product or platform of interest. The CPE Inventory component SHALL have one or more
  OVAL definitions of class inventory and SHALL NOT have any other classes of OVAL definitions.

5.3   Inventory Scanning

SCAP content can be used to collect information on the software installed on systems. One example of
how this could be used is to verify that a group of systems all have required security software programs
installed. This could help verify compliance with technical security control requirements. Another
