NIST SP 800-82r3                                         Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

OT organizations should familiarize themselves with NIST SP 800-161, Supply Chain Risk
Management Practices for Federal Information Systems and Organizations [SP800-161], and
begin or continue to implement the key practices, C-SCRM security controls, and C-SCRM risk
management process activities described in that publication. There is extensive guidance about
how to establish a C-SCRM program using a phased approach that begins with putting the
foundational elements in place and expanding upon that foundation over time to ensure sustained
effectiveness and the ability to enhance program capabilities. There is also guidance about
conducting supply chain risk assessments, incorporating C-SCRM into procurement
requirements, the importance of an integrated and inter-disciplinary risk management approach,
supplemental C-SCRM security control guidance, and templates that organizations can leverage.

4.2.2. Safety Systems
The culture of safety and safety assessments is well established within much of the OT user
community. Information security risk assessments should complement such assessments, though
they may use different approaches and cover different areas. Safety assessments are primarily
concerned with the physical world, while information security risk assessments consider the
digital world. However, in an OT environment, the physical and the digital are intertwined, and
significant overlap may occur.
Organizations should, therefore, consider all aspects of risk management for safety (e.g., risk
framing, risk tolerances) and the safety assessment results when carrying out risk assessments for
information security. The personnel responsible for the information security risk assessment
must be able to identify and communicate identified risks that could have safety implications.
Conversely, the personnel charged with safety assessments must be familiar with the potential
physical impacts and their likelihood.
Safety systems may reduce the impact of a cyber incident on the OT and are often deployed to
perform specific monitoring and control functions to ensure the safety of people, the
environment, processes, and assets. While these systems are traditionally implemented to be
fully redundant and independent from the primary OT, some architectures combine control and
safety functions, components, or networks. Combining control and safety could allow a
sophisticated attacker access to both control and safety systems if the OT were compromised.
Organizations should ensure the adequate separation of components consistent with the risk of
compromise and evaluate the impact of the implemented security controls on the safety system to
determine whether they negatively impact the system.

       Applying the Risk Management Framework to OT Systems
The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) applies the risk management process and
concepts (i.e., framing risk, assessing risk, responding to risk, and monitoring risk) to systems
and organizations. The following subsections describe the process of applying the RMF to OT
and include a brief description of each step and task, the intended outcome of each task, task
mappings to other standards and guidelines applicable to OT (e.g., the Cybersecurity Framework
and IEC 62443), and OT-specific implementation guidance. Some tasks are optional, and not all
tasks include OT-specific considerations or guidance.
