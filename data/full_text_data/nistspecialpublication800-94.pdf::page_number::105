                                                     GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



challenging to capture the cost benefits provided by IDPSs. The criteria presented below focus on the
basic costs of the IDPS solution itself and do not take into account any cost savings achieved by IDPS
use.

 Initial Costs. The initial costs of acquiring and deploying a solution typically include the following:

      –    Hardware, including appliances, additional network equipment (e.g., management network,
           network taps, IDS load balancers), and hosts for non-appliance components (e.g., consoles)

      –    Software and software licensing fees for IDPS components and supporting software (e.g.,
           reporting tools, database software)

      –    Installation and initial configuration costs, which could include external assistance as well as
           internal labor

      –    Customization costs, such as having programmers develop custom scripts or reports

      –    Training costs, if the necessary training is not included as part of the initial hardware and
           software purchase.
 Maintenance Costs. Expected maintenance costs for IDPS solutions typically include the following:

      –    Labor. This includes the cost of staff performing IDPS administration and analysis.

      –    Software licensing fees, subscription fees, or maintenance contracts. These costs, typically
           incurred on an annual basis, usually provide the purchaser with IDPS software and signature
           updates.

      –    Technical support fees. Many organizations purchase technical support contracts for their IDPS
           products; these contracts are typically annual. Some organizations pay a fee per technical support
           call instead of an annual contract.

      –    Training costs. Training might be needed periodically in preparation for deploying new versions
           of an IDPS product, as well as for new IDPS users and administrators. Organizations might want
           to have customized training classes that focus on the elements of the IDPS product that are most
           important to the organization, and also take into account certain aspects of the organization’s
           environment and needs.

      –    Customization costs. During the use of an IDPS product, users and administrators might need the
           product to be further customized, such as having programmers develop additional custom reports
           or modify existing reports, and having programmers or administrators create custom analyzers
           and signatures.

      –    Professional services or technical support that falls outside the technical support contract.
           Examples include designing IDPS implementations, performing product installations, tuning
           sensors or agents, creating and customizing reports, and assisting with incident response efforts.
           Organizations can perform these services themselves, or they can purchase services from IDPS
           vendors and third parties.
9.6       Evaluating Products

After collecting requirements and selecting criteria, evaluators need to find sources of information about
the products to be evaluated. Common product data sources include the following:



                                                       9-13
