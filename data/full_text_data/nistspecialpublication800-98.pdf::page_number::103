6.7   Industry Resources Addressing RFID Privacy

The EPCglobal Guidelines on EPC for Consumer Products are a set of principles that are intended to
address the need for privacy and consumer trust (i.e., Consumer Notice, Consumer Choice, Consumer
Education, and Record Use, Retention and Security). The Guidelines were created to provide a
responsible basis for the use of EPC technology for consumer items. It is anticipated that these principles
will continue to evolve with advances in EPCglobal technology and its applications. Additional
