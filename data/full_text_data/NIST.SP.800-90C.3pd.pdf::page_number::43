       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                                                      Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

1173   If the randomness source is an RBG3 construction (as shown in Figure 14), the Get_randomness-
1174   source_input call shall be replaced by the appropriate RBG3 generate function (see Sections
1175   2.8.3.2, 6.2.1.2, and 6.3.1.2 and steps 1b, 1c, 2b, and 2c below).

1178   Let s be the security strength to be instantiated. The DRBG within an RBG1 construction is
1179   instantiated as follows:
1180        1. When an RBG1 construction is instantiating a CTR_DRBG without a derivation function,
1181           s + 128 bits 13 shall be obtained from the randomness source as follows:
1182                   If the randomness source is an RBG2(P) construction (see Figure 13), the
1183                   Get_randomness-source_input call is replaced by:
1184                      (status, randomness-source_input) = Generate_function(RBG2_state_handle, s +
1185                               128, s, prediction_resistance_request = TRUE, additional_input).
1186                   Note that the DRBG within the RBG2(P) construction must be reseeded before
1187                   generating output. 14 This may be accomplished by requesting prediction resistance
1188                   (i.e., setting prediction_resistance_request = TRUE). See Requirement 17 in Section
1189                   4.4.1.



       13
          For AES, the block length is 128 bits, and the key length is equal to the security strength s. SP 800-90A requires the randomness input from the
       randomness source to be key length + block length bits when a derivation function is not used.

          See Requirement 11 in Section 5.4.1.
