the adverse effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of legislation tracking
information on overall agency mission functions will be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
legislation tracking information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the legislation tracking information.
Legislation tracking processes are generally tolerant of limited delays. In most cases, disruption
of access to legislation tracking information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
legislation tracking information is low.
C.2.7.2 Legislation Testimony Information Type

Legislation Testimony involves activities associated with providing testimony/evidence in
support or, or opposition to, legislation from conception to adoption. Subject to exception
conditions described below, the recommended security categorization for the legislation
testimony information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of legislation testimony
information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide testimony/evidence in support or, or
opposition to, legislation from conception to adoption. Most testimony regarding legislation is in
the public domain, and even premature release should result in no more than limited harm to
agency assets, personnel, or operations.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The effects of loss of confidentiality
of some information applicable to pending testimony may result in attempts by competing
interests to influence and/or impede a specific legislative process. The consequences to agency
programs and of the ability of an agency to perform its mission can be very serious. Premature
public release of draft testimony before internal coordination and review has been conducted can
result in unnecessary criticism of the proposed testimony and damage public confidence in the
agency. These consequences are particularly likely where the release includes unedited internal
commentary and discussion. The results of unauthorized disclosure of information to the public
can imperil specific agency programs, but a consequent loss of public confidence can do
persistent harm to an agencyâ€™s ability to effectively perform its mission. This can result in
assignment of a moderate impact level to such information. Some information associated with
legislative testimony is classified national security information and is outside the scope of this
guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for legislation testimony information is low.
