               The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



as defined in the CPE Name Matching specification [CPE-M]. Only non-deprecated names SHOULD be
used.
Checklist authors SHOULD ensure that each CPE name [CPE-N] they specify in an
<xccdf:platform> or <cpe2:fact-ref> element within an XCCDF document has a check
associated with its CPE name. If a corresponding check does not exist, then it will not be possible to fully
detect the presence of the product and determine platform applicability. Because there may be a lag
between the time that a new product is available and the Official CPE Dictionary is updated to include a
CPE name for that product, third-party dictionaries would need to be used to compensate for the lag.
[CPE-D] provides the defining structure of a CPE dictionary. A <cpe2_dict:cpe-item> element
MAY contain one or more <cpe2-dict:check> elements that reference OVAL inventory class
definitions using the following format:
<cpe2_dict:check system="http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5"
      [href="oval_URL"]>oval_inventory_definition_id</cpe2_dict:check>
For example:
<cpe2_dict:cpe-list xmlns="http://cpe.mitre.org/dictionary/2.0"
          xmlns:cpe2_dict="http://cpe.mitre.org/dictionary/2.0">
   <cpe2_dict:cpe-item
       name="cpe:/a:sun:java_system_messaging_server:6.2:-:sparc">
      <cpe2_dict:title>Sun Java System Messaging Server 6.2 sparc</title>
      <cpe2_dict:check
          system=http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5
          href="example-sunjavamsg62-oval.xml">oval:org.mitre.oval:def:128
      </cpe2_dict:check>
      <cpe2-dict-ext:cpe23-item
    name="cpe:2.3:a:sun:java_system_messaging_server:6.2:-:-:-:-:-:sparc:-"/>
   </cpe2_dict:cpe-item>
</cpe2_dict:cpe-list>

The referenced OVAL inventory class definition SHALL specify the technical procedure for determining
whether or not a specific target asset is an instance of the CPE name specified by the
<cpe2_dict:cpe-item> element. This usage is encouraged for CPE components.
When creating a subset of the Official CPE Dictionary or a third-party dictionary, a
<cpe2_dict:check> element on an entry MAY be added or modified if the existing check does not
provide satisfactory content to test the presence of the CPE name.
If a <cpe2_dict:cpe-item> element contained in a CPE component references an OVAL inventory
class definition, then that definition SHALL be resolved by an @href attribute referencing an OVAL
source data stream component in the same data stream.

3.6   Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE)
To maintain consistency and accuracy, SCAP content referencing a configuration setting SHALL use the
official CCE identifier if a CCE entry for a particular configuration setting exists in the official CCE list.
If no CCE entry exists for the configuration setting of interest, the content author SHOULD seek to have
a CCE identifier issued for the configuration setting. See the OVAL compliance class definition
requirements in Section 3.3 and the <xccdf:ident> requirements in Section 3.2.4.1 for additional
requirements involving CCE identifier references.
The current official CCE list is available at http://cce.mitre.org/lists/cce_list.html and new CCEs can be
requested from the CCE Content Team. Submitters should review the information provided at
