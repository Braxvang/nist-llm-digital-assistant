Special Publication 800-39                                                 Managing Information Security Risk
                                                                           Organization, Mission, and Information System View
________________________________________________________________________________________________

the trustworthiness of another organization does not permit the complete sharing of information
or use of external services, the organization can: (i) mitigate risk, transfer risk, or share risk by
employing one or more compensating controls; (ii) accept a greater degree of risk; or (iii) avoid
risk by performing missions/business functions with reduced levels of functionality or possibly
no functionality at all.


     Explicit understanding and acceptance of the risk to an organization’s operations and assets,
     individuals, other organizations, and the Nation by senior leaders/executives (reflecting the
     organization’s risk tolerance) are made in accordance with the organization’s risk management
     strategy and a prerequisite for establishing trust relationships among organizations.



2.6.2 Trustworthiness of Information Systems
The concept of trustworthiness can also be applied to information systems and the information
technology products and services that compose those systems. Trustworthiness expresses the
degree to which information systems (including the information technology products from which
the systems are built) can be expected to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
the information being processed, stored, or transmitted by the systems across the full range of
threats. Trustworthy information systems are systems that have been determined to have the level
of trustworthiness necessary to operate within defined levels of risk despite the environmental
disruptions, human errors, and purposeful attacks that are expected to occur in their environments
of operation. Two factors affecting the trustworthiness of information systems are:
•      Security functionality (i.e., the security features/functions employed within the system); and
•      Security assurance (i.e., the grounds for confidence that the security functionality is effective
       in its application).52

Security functionality can be obtained by employing within organizational information systems
and their environments of operation, a combination of management, operational, and technical
security controls from NIST Special Publication 800-53.53 The development and implementation
of needed security controls is guided by and informed by the enterprise architecture established
by organizations.

Security assurance is a critical aspect in determining the trustworthiness of information systems.
Assurance is the measure of confidence that the security features, practices, procedures, and
architecture of an information system accurately mediates and enforces the security policy.54
Assurance is obtained by: (i) the actions taken by developers and implementers55 with regard to
the design, development, implementation, and operation of the security functionality (i.e.,
security controls); and (ii) the actions taken by assessors to determine the extent to which the
functionality is implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome

52
  Assurance also represents the grounds for confidence that the intended functionality of an information system is
correct, always invoked (when needed), and resistant to bypass or tampering.
53
   The employment of appropriate security controls for information systems and environments of operation is guided by
the first three steps in the Risk Management Framework (i.e., categorization, selection, and implementation).
54
     A security policy is set of criteria for the provision of security services.
55
  In this context, a developer/implementer is an individual or group of individuals responsible for the design,
development, implementation, or operation of security controls for an information system or supporting infrastructure.
