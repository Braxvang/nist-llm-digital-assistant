Table D.1 summarizes the effects of bit errors in a ciphertext block or IV on the decryption of the
ciphertext for each of the five confidentiality modes.

Table D.1e five confidentiality modes.

           RBE: random bit errors, i.e., bit errors occur independently in any bit position with an
           expected probability of ½.
           SBE: specific bit errors, i.e., bit errors occur in the same bit position(s) as the original bit
           error(s).
           * Bit errors in the jth counter block, Tj, result in RBE in the decryption of Cj.

The deletion or insertion of bits into a ciphertext block (or segment) spoils the synchronization of
the block (or segment) boundaries; in effect, bit errors may occur in the bit position of the
inserted or deleted bit, and in every subsequent bit position. Therefore, the decryptions of the
subsequent ciphertext blocks (or segments) will almost certainly be incorrect until the
synchronization is restored. When the 1-bit CFB mode is used, then the synchronization is
automatically restored b+1 positions after the inserted or deleted bit. For other values of s in the
CFB mode, and for the other confidentiality modes in this recommendation, the synchronization
must be restored externally.
