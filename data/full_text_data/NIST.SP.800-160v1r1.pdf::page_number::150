NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                  Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems

       mock-up, prototype, procedure, plan, or other information item), the verification method
       (including any adversity emulation), and the expected result as defined by the success criteria.
       The security criteria may reflect considerations of strength of function/mechanism, resistance to
       tamper, misuse or abuse, penetration resistance, level of assurance, absence of flaws,
       weaknesses, and the absence of unspecified behavior and outcomes.
       VE-1.2 Identify the constraints that can potentially limit the feasibility of the security-focused
              verification actions.
       Note: Constraints include technical feasibility; the availability of qualified personnel and
       verification enablers; the availability of sufficient, relevant, and credible threat data; technology
       employed (including adversity emulation); the size and complexity of the system element or
       artifact; and the cost and time allotted for the verification.
       VE-1.3 Select appropriate security verification methods and the associated success criteria for
              each security verification action.
       Note: The methods and techniques are selected to provide the evidence required to achieve the
       expected results with the desired level of assurance.
       VE-1.4 Define the security aspects of the verification strategy.
       Note: This includes the approach used to incorporate security considerations into all verification
       actions while considering the trade-offs between scope, depth, and rigor needed for the desired
       level of assurance and the given constraints.
       VE-1.5 Identify the security-relevant constraints and objectives that result from the security
              aspects of the verification strategy to be incorporated into the system requirements,
              architecture, and design.
       VE-1.6 Identify the security aspects for enabling systems or services needed to support
              verification.
       VE-1.7 Identify and plan for enabling systems or services needed to support the security
              aspects of verification.
       VE-1.8 Obtain or acquire access to the security aspects of enabling systems or services to be
              used in verification.

VE-2   PERFORM VERIFICATION
       VE-2.1 Define the security aspects of the verification procedures, each supporting one or a set
              of verification actions.
       Note: The procedures identify the security purpose of verification, the success criteria (expected
       results), the verification method to be applied, the necessary enabling systems (e.g., facilities,
       equipment), and the environmental conditions to perform each verification procedure (e.g.,
       resources, qualified personnel, adversity emulations).
       VE-2.2 Perform security verification procedures.
