                                                                               GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



or otherwise exposing it to untrusted users. To adequately detect and correct these vulnerabilities, Web
server administrators should do the following:

 Create, document, and implement a patching process. 17

 Identify vulnerabilities and applicable patches. 18

 Mitigate vulnerabilities temporarily if needed and if feasible (until patches are available, tested, and
  installed).

 Install permanent fixes (commonly called patches, hotfixes, service packs, or updates).

Administrators should ensure that Web servers, particularly new ones, are adequately protected during the
patching process. For example, a Web server that is not fully patched or not configured securely could be
compromised by threats if it is publicly accessible while it is being patched. When preparing new Web
servers for deployment, administrators should do either of the following:

 Keep the servers disconnected from networks or connect them only to an isolated “build” network
  until all patches have been transferred to the servers through out-of-band means (e.g., CDs) and
  installed, and the other configuration steps listed in Section 4.1 have been performed.

 Place the servers on a virtual local area network (VLAN) 19 or other network segment that severely
  restricts what actions the hosts on it can perform and what communications can reach the hosts—only
  allowing those events that are necessary for patching and configuring the hosts. Do not transfer the
  hosts to regular network segments until all the configuration steps listed in Section 4.1 have been
  performed.

Administrators should generally not apply patches to Web servers without first testing them on another
identically configured system because patches can inadvertently cause unexpected problems with proper
system operation. Although administrators can configure Web servers to download patches
automatically, the servers should not be configured to install them automatically so that they can first be
tested.

4.1.2     Remove or Disable Unnecessary Services and Applications

Ideally, a Web server should be on a dedicated, single-purpose host. When configuring the OS, disable
everything except that which is expressly permitted—that is, disable all services and applications, re-
enable only those required by the Web server, and then remove the unneeded services and applications. If
possible, install the minimal OS configuration and then add or remove services and applications as
needed. Choose the “minimal installation” option, if available, to minimize the effort required in
removing unnecessary services. Furthermore, many uninstall scripts or programs are far from perfect in
completely removing all components of a service; therefore, it is always better not to install unnecessary

     is available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/. A single patch management process can be put into place for both
     operating systems and applications (including Web server software).

     VLANs can easily be misconfigured in ways that reduce or eliminate their effectiveness as a security control. Organizations
     planning to use VLANs should ensure that they are configured properly and that any configuration changes are carefully
     verified.
