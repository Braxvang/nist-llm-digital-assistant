SC-19     VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL

          Control: The organization: (i) establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for
          Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies based on the potential to cause damage to the
          information system if used maliciously; and (ii) authorizes, monitors, and controls the use of VoIP
          within the information system.
          Supplemental Guidance: NIST Special Publication 800-58 provides guidance on security
          considerations for VoIP technologies employed in information systems.
          Control Enhancements: None.

SC-20     SECURE NAME / ADDRESS RESOLUTION SERVICE (AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE)

          Control: The information system that provides name/address resolution service provides additional
          data origin and integrity artifacts along with the authoritative data it returns in response to
          resolution queries.
          Supplemental Guidance: This control enables remote clients to obtain origin authentication and
          integrity verification assurances for the name/address resolution information obtained through the
          service. A domain name system (DNS) server is an example of an information system that
          provides name/address resolution service; digital signatures and cryptographic keys are examples
          of additional artifacts; and DNS resource records are examples of authoritative data. NIST Special
          Publication 800-81 provides guidance on secure domain name system deployment.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system, when operating as part of a distributed, hierarchical namespace, provides
                the means to indicate the security status of child subspaces and (if the child supports secure
                resolution services) enable verification of a chain of trust among parent and child domains.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: An example means to indicate the security status of child
                subspaces is through the use of delegation signer resource records.

SC-21     SECURE NAME / ADDRESS RESOLUTION SERVICE (RECURSIVE OR CACHING RESOLVER)

          Control: The information system that provides name/address resolution service for local clients
          performs data origin authentication and data integrity verification on the resolution responses it
          receives from authoritative sources when requested by client systems.
          Supplemental Guidance: A resolving or caching domain name system (DNS) server is an example of
          an information system that provides name/address resolution service for local clients and
          authoritative DNS servers are examples of authoritative sources. NIST Special Publication 800-81
          provides guidance on secure domain name system deployment.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system performs data origin authentication and data integrity verification on all
                resolution responses whether or not local clients explicitly request this service.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Local clients include, for example, DNS stub resolvers.
