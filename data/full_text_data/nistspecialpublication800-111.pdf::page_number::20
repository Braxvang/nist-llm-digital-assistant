authenticates to the encryption solution. Once this authentication occurs, then any process being run on
the device (such as malware) with access to the user’s files can get the decrypted information. Because
the files are only protected until successful authentication occurs, it may be beneficial to use a solution
that is configured to encrypt only the necessary files (e.g., using file/folder encryption to encrypt 10
sensitive files instead of using volume encryption to encrypt 10 sensitive files and 1000 non-sensitive
files). The more files that are protected, the sooner the user is likely to authenticate to the storage
encryption solution, which increases the window of exposure for the decrypted files.

Some products also permit storage to be encrypted either for a single user or for multiple users of a
device. If encrypted for a single user, the confidentiality of that user’s encrypted storage is protected
from other users of the device, including (in most cases) the device’s administrators. Encrypting for
multiple users allows sensitive data to be shared by those users, while still protecting it from other users
of the device. This provides some protection against insider threats.

In some cases, multiple types of technology can be used concurrently to protect against different classes
of threats; for example, FDE could be used to protect all data on a device from device loss or theft, and
volume, virtual disk, or file/folder encryption could be used to provide additional protection for a subset
of data that is more sensitive than the rest of the data. 26

When thinking about threats, organizations should be aware that after storage encryption technology has
been implemented, there may be residual data on the device that remains unprotected. For example, when
a file is encrypted using file/folder encryption and the original file is deleted, the remnants of the original
plaintext file might still be present on the storage media. Another example is FDE and volume encryption
products that encrypt only the disk sectors that contain current files, not disk sectors that only contain
deleted files or other remnants of data. These remnants may be recoverable using forensic tools by an
attacker who gets physical access to the computer, without having to provide any authentication.
Organizations should take into account threats against both the files and remnants of the files.

Organizations should be aware that if an end user device is compromised at any time, any storage
encryption technologies on it may become partially or wholly ineffective. For example, when the device
is in use and the user has been authenticated to the storage encryption solution, malware could access
decrypted files and transfer copies of them to external hosts or extract sensitive information from them.
Other examples are an attacker disabling or reconfiguring storage encryption, malware installing a
keylogger that captures passwords used for storage encryption authentication, or malware acquiring a
copy of a storage encryption key from the device’s memory (for software-based storage encryption
solutions).

Organizations should also be aware that they should not rely on storage encryption technologies to protect
data without regularly maintaining the encryption solution. For example, if an attacker acquires a lost,
stolen, or retired device protected by storage encryption technology, and a vulnerability in the storage
encryption technology is discovered in the future, the attacker may be able to exploit it to access the
protected data.

3.3     Comparison of Storage Encryption Technologies

Table 3-1 lists several characteristics of storage encryption technologies as a means for comparing the
types of technologies described in this publication.

      When multiple encryption methods are used simultaneously, the cryptographic keys used by the encryption methods are
      usually different.
