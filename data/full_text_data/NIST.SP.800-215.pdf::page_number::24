NIST SP 800-215                                                           Guide to a Secure Enterprise
November 2022                                                                     Network Landscape

   2. Information about the device from which access is being requested – Establishing trust in
      the device through a combination of health and risk profiles of the device. For example,
      the risk profile of the device can be obtained through an out-of-the-box posture check
      (risk of the device [28]) with or without integrating with an endpoint protection tool for
      the device. Other crucial information (provided by telemetry data) needed to assess the
      security status of the endpoint devices [29] include (a) device support label (the device is
      managed or corporate-owned) and (b) device posture information (whether it has been
      compromised). All of these factors go into a policy evaluation for determining the level
      of trust and must be channeled into authentication and monitoring decisions [30].
   3. Information about real-time contextual data – Date, time, and geolocation at which the
      access request occurs
   4. Information about IT services (e.g., app, data) being accessed
   5. Information about the security of the environment hosting the IT services being accessed
The requirements for contextual information [27]:
   •   Should include not only that which is collected by the native platform (the platform on
       which the application is hosted) but also that which can be obtained from third-party
       platforms and can provide more detailed information
   •   Should be available in real time so that user experience with access is not affected
   •   Should be prioritized based on the value each provides
   •   Should be consistent with the level of risk associated with each access request
No application and/or data access in the modern enterprise network context can be deemed
secure by ignoring relevant contextual information when the access scenario involves allowing a
user, device, or service from any network channel (e.g., corporate network, home network,
public network, or branch office) to access a resource located anywhere (on-premises or cloud).

4.2 Network Configuration for Device Management
With the disappearance of the network perimeter (Section 2.1) and the distribution of the
application targets (being a hybrid application environment), enterprises should adopt an
“endpoint is the perimeter” paradigm and have a device management system in place.
HAE-NCF-1: There should be a unified endpoint management (UEM) [48] solution in place to
manage and secure all endpoints that will access on-premises and cloud-based applications. The
minimal managed tasks and capabilities of UEM should include:
   a. Ability to support endpoint devices with different operating systems
   b. Installation and maintenance of device and service authentication certificates
   c. Installation and maintenance of device health applications
   d. Updates of patches on the devices
   e. Enables admins to track, audit, and report endpoints for content and applications
