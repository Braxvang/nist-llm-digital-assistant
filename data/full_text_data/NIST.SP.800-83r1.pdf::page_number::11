                            GUIDE TO MALWARE INCIDENT PREVENTION AND HANDLING FOR DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS


        analysis, as well as contacting trusted parties such as incident response organizations and
        antivirus vendors when guidance is needed on handling new threats.

    –   Organizations should be prepared to shut down or block services used by malware to contain
        an incident and should understand the consequences of doing so. Organizations should also
        be prepared to respond to problems caused by other organizations disabling their own
        services in response to a malware incident.

    –   Organizations should be prepared to place additional temporary restrictions on network
        connectivity to contain a malware incident, such as suspending Internet access or physically
        disconnecting hosts from networks, recognizing the impact that the restrictions might have on
        organizational functions.
 Eradication. The primary goal of eradication is to remove malware from infected hosts. Because
  of the potential need for extensive eradication efforts, organizations should be prepared to use
  various combinations of eradication techniques simultaneously for different situations.
  Organizations should also consider performing awareness activities that set expectations for
  eradication and recovery efforts; these activities can be helpful in reducing the stress that major
  malware incidents can cause.
 Recovery. The two main aspects of recovery from malware incidents are restoring the
  functionality and data of infected hosts and removing temporary containment measures.
  Organizations should carefully consider possible worst-case scenarios and determine how
  recovery should be performed, including rebuilding compromised hosts from scratch or known
  good backups. Determining when to remove temporary containment measures, such as
  suspension of services or connectivity, is often a difficult decision during major malware
  incidents. Incident response teams should strive to keep containment measures in place until the
  estimated number of infected hosts and hosts vulnerable to infection is sufficiently low that
  subsequent incidents should be of little consequence. However, even though the incident response
  team should assess the risks of restoring services or connectivity, management ultimately should
  be responsible for determining what should be done based on the incident response team’s
  recommendations and management’s understanding of the business impact of maintaining the
  containment measures.
 Post-Incident Activity. Because the handling of malware incidents can be extremely expensive,
  it is particularly important for organizations to conduct a robust assessment of lessons learned
  after major malware incidents to prevent similar incidents from occurring. Capturing the lessons
  learned from the handling of such incidents should help an organization improve its incident
  handling capability and malware defenses, including identifying needed changes to security
  policy, software configurations, and malware detection and prevention software deployments.
