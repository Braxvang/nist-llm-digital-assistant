NIST SP 800-82r3                                           Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

   •   Disabled antivirus or other security controls
   •   Requests for information about the system or architecture (e.g., social engineering or
       phishing attempts)
Operational Events
   •   Unauthorized configuration changes
   •   Unauthorized patching of systems
   •   Unplanned shutdowns
Physical Access Events
   •   Physical intrusions
Networking Events
   •   Unexpected communication, including new ports or protocols being used without
       appropriate change management
   •   Unusually heavy network traffic
   •   Unauthorized devices connecting to the network
   •   Unauthorized communication to external IPs
Organizations should consider that not all events and anomalies are malicious or require
investigation. Organizations should define incident alerting thresholds and response requirements
for the events and anomalies that affect their systems and environment to establish an efficient
incident detection capability.
Organizations should consider collecting and correlating event data from multiple sources and
sensors using automated mechanisms where possible to improve detecting and alerting
capabilities. For example, a centralized intrusion detection system could accept data feeds and
logs from multiple devices and network segments to identify organization- or environment-
specific events and sound an alarm. Detection tools should also be integrated with asset
management tools. This integration can provide additional context to an event (e.g., where the
system is located, which firmware version it runs, what the criticality of the system is) to help an
organization determine the event impact.
Supplemental guidance can be found in the following documents:
   •   NIST SP 800-92, Guide to Computer Security Log Management
   •   NIST SP 800-94, Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems
   •   NIST SP 1800-7, Situational Awareness for Electric Utilities
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should consider OT-specific events and anomalies for
            their processes and environments. Organizations should also note that
            some tools and alerts for behaviors or events that could indicate an
            intrusion may be normal behaviors and events within the OT
            environment. To reduce false positive and nuisance alarms, organizations
