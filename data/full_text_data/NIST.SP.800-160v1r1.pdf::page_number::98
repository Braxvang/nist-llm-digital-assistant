Appendix E. Principles for Trustworthy Secure Design
This appendix describes the design principles that serve as the foundation for engineering
trustworthy secure systems. 75 The principles provide a basis for reasoning about a system. They
should not be applied as rules to be complied with, nor should they be prioritized, sequenced, or
ordered for prescriptive application or used as a basis for making judgments on conformance.

The use of the design principles is subject to various priorities and constraints that may restrict or
preclude their application within a specific context. 76 The principles may conflict with other
principles, and that conflict must be understood. In practice, the principles can be satisfied or
implemented in various and often equally effective ways. The use of specific principles may
change in response to changes and variances in requirements, architecture, design, and risk
acceptability. Therefore, their application should be planned for, appropriately scoped, and
revisited throughout the engineering effort.


                                                     KEY SECURITY OBJECTIVE
                An important objective for security is the reduction of uncertainty regarding the
                occurrence and effects of adverse events. Reducing the uncertainty of adverse
                events is achieved by eliminating hazards, susceptibility, and vulnerability to the
                extent possible. Where elimination cannot occur, their effects should be
                controlled to the extent possible. Applying the design principles for trustworthy
                secure systems is a means of achieving the elimination and control of the hazards,
                susceptibility, and vulnerability that lead to adverse events [39].




The principles for trustworthy secure design are representative of the practices of the safety,
security, reliability, survivability, and resilience communities and the specialty engineering
disciplines associated with those communities. Collectively, the goals of these practices
represent the end objectives that the system must satisfy for trustworthy control of adverse
effects. The principles are grounded in research, development, and application experience
starting with the early incorporation of mechanisms into trusted operating systems to today’s
components, environments, and systems and are expected to remain universally applicable for
new, emerging, and maturing approaches. The concepts and theorems from the disciplines of
computer science, computer engineering, systems engineering, control systems, fault/failure
tolerance, software engineering, and mathematics – as employed across the communities and
specialties – constitute the means to achieve the end objectives. 77 The principles for trustworthy
secure design are listed in Table 4.

   Engineering judgment considerations for the application of the principles for trustworthy secure systems are described in [39].

   For example, trustworthiness requires that mechanisms be evaluatable (Section D.4.2). Consequently, many principles deal with reducing and
managing complexity and creating systems that can be more easily evaluated. See [41] for discussions on how systems may be too complex to be
analyzed for adequate assurance.
