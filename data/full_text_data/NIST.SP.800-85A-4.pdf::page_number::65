NIST SP 800-85A-4                                                PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                          INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

Required Vendor Information

VE05.41-R4.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation whether the card implements secure
messaging.

Required Test Procedures

Note: This assertion is tested as a part of establishing the VCI interface.

AS05.42-R4: When implemented, SM for non-card-management operations shall only be
established using the PIV Secure Messaging key specified in Table 4b of SP 800-73-4, Part 1,
and the SM protocol in accordance with the specifications in SP 800-73-4 Section 4 of Part 2.

Required Vendor Information

VE05.42-R4.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation that secure messaging is
implemented in accordance with AS05.42-R4.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.42-R4.01: The tester shall review the vendor’s documentation and validate that the SM for
non-card-management operations shall only be established using the PIV Secure Messaging key.

AS05.43-R4: The SW protocol is the status byte of the overall secure messaging command and
response processing. It indicates if the secure messaging was performed successfully. If the
processing was successful, it shall be '90 00'; otherwise, it shall be as follows: '68 82' if secure
messaging is not supported; '69 82' if the security status is not satisfied; '69 87' if the expected
secure messaging data objects are missing; and '69 88' if the secure messaging data objects are
incorrect. If the command processing was unsuccessful, the card shall return one of the above
errors without performing further secure messaging.

Required Vendor Information

VE05.43-R4.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation that the card conforms to the
assertion stated in AS05.43-R4.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.43-R4.01: The tester shall review the vendor’s documentation and validate that the PIV Card
returns the applicable SW identified in AS05.43-R4 without performing further secure messaging if
the command processing was unsuccessful.

AS05.44-R4: If the PIV Card supports secure messaging, the PIV Secure Messaging key shall
be generated on the PIV Card and the PIV Card shall not permit exportation of the PIV
Secure Messaging Key.
