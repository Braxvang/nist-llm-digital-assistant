                                                              CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



8.4.1   Lack of Visibility

Consumers may lack visibility into how clouds operate. If so, they will likely be unable to tell if their
services are being undertaken and delivered in a secure manner. Different models of cloud service
delivery add or remove different levels of control from the consumer and provide different degrees of
visibility. However, the option for a consumer to request that additional monitoring mechanisms are
deployed at a provider’s site is plausible and currently used in a variety of non-cloud systems.

8.4.2   Physical Data Location

Providers make business decisions on where to physically set up their data centers based on a number of
parameters that may include construction costs, energy costs, safety and security concerns, availability of
an educated work force, employee costs, and the quality of public infrastructure.

Consumers, however, may have to comply with international, Federal, or state statutes and directives that
prohibit the storage of data outside certain physical boundaries or borders. Although technologists may
have logical control over the data and employ cryptographic mechanisms to mitigate the risk of
unauthorized disclosure, consumers must still comply with these statutes and regulations [NIST SP800-
144].

8.4.3   Jurisdiction and Regulation

Consumers may be subjected to a variety of regulations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), the
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), the Health Information Protection and
Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, or the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). Consumers, who are ultimately responsible for their data processed
on provider’s systems, will need to require assurances from providers that they are aiding in compliance
of the appropriate regulations.

Consumers also require assurance that appropriate legal jurisdiction exists for cloud services so that if
providers fail to comply; legal remedies are understood in advance. These needs are complicated because
providers typically view the implementation and configuration of their offerings as proprietary
information, and do not offer consumers visibility into such details. This lack of visibility makes it
difficult for consumers to be confident that providers are in compliance with regulations unless the
provider obtains an independent audit from a trusted third party. Even here, the frequency of third party
audits may limit the overall assurance offered, since a cloud system could quietly drift out of compliance,
and continuous monitoring of cloud configurations and health may be desirable.

8.4.4   Support for Forensics

As part of an incident response effort, the goal of digital forensics is to: (1) discern what happened, (2)
understand what portions of the system were affected, (3) learn how to prevent such incidents from
happening again, and (4) collect information for possible future legal actions. Forensics in the cloud,
however, raises a number of new issues, such as:

 How are incident handling responsibilities defined in service agreements? (see Appendix A)
 How are clocks synchronized across data centers to help reconstruct a chain of events?
 How are data breach notifications laws handled in different countries?
 What data can a cloud provider look at when capturing an image of a shared hard drive?
