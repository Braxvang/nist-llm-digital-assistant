Special Publication 800-73-4      Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification – Part 1: PIV
                               Card Application Namespace, Data Model and Representation

Paring Code             An 8 digit code used to establish a relationship between the PIV Card and a
                        device for the purpose of creating the virtual contact interface after secure
                        messaging has been established.

PIV Key Type            The type of a key. The PIV Key Types are 1) PIV Authentication key, 2)
                        Card Authentication key, 3) digital signature key, 4) key management key, 5)
                        retired key management key, 6) PIV Secure Messaging key, and 7) PIV Card
                        Application Administration key.

Relying Party           An entity that relies upon the subscriber’s credentials, typically to process a
                        transaction or grant access to information or a system.

Status Word             Two bytes returned by an integrated circuit card after processing any
                        command that signify the success of or errors encountered during said
                        processing.
