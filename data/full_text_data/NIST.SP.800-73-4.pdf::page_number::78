Special Publication 800-73-4                              Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification – Part 2:
                                                          PIV Card Application Card Command Interface

2.        Overview: Concepts and Constructs

SP 800-73-4 Parts 2 and 3 define two interfaces to an ICC that contains the PIV Card Application: a low-
level card command interface (Part 2) and a high-level client API (Part 3).

The information processing concepts and data constructs on both interfaces are identical and may be
referred to generically as the information processing concepts and data constructs on the PIV interfaces
without specific reference to the client API or the card command interface.

The client API provides task-specific programmatic access to these concepts and constructs and the card
command interface provides communication access to concepts and constructs. The client API is used by
client applications using the PIV Card Application. The card command interface is used by software
implementing the client API (middleware).

The client API is thought of as being at a higher level than the card command interface because access to
a single entry point on the client API may cause multiple card commands to traverse the card command
interface. In other words, it may require more than one card command on the card command interface to
accomplish the task represented by a single call on an entry point of the client API.

The client API is a program execution, call/return style interface whereas the card command interface is a
communication protocol, command/response style interface. Because of this difference, the representation
of the PIV concepts and constructs as bits and bytes on the client API may be different from the
representation of these same concepts and constructs on the card command interface.

  2.1.1      Platform Requirements

The following are the requirements that the PIV Card Application places on the ICC platform on which it
is implemented or installed:

      +    global security status that includes the security status of a global cardholder PIN
      +    application selection using a truncated Application Identifier (AID)
      +    ability to reset the security status of an individual application
      +    indication to applications as to which physical communication interface – contact versus
           contactless – is in use
      +    support for the default selection of an application upon warm or cold reset


2.2       Namespaces of the PIV Card Application

AID, names, Tag-Length-Value (BER-TLV) tags [ISO8825], ASN.1 Object Identifiers (OIDs) [ISO8824]
and Proprietary Identifier eXtensions (PIXes) of the NIST Registered Application Provider IDentifier
(RID) used on the PIV interfaces are specified in Part 1. Part 1 also specifies that all unspecified names,
BER-TLV tags, OIDs, and values of algorithm identifiers, key references, and cryptographic mechanism
identifiers, are reserved for future use.
