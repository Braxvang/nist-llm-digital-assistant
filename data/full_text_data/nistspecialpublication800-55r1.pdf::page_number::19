or averages are most common. Absolute numbers are sometimes useful, depending on the
activity that is being measured.

Data required for calculating measures must be readily obtainable, and the process that is under
consideration needs to be measurable. Only processes that can be consistent and repeatable
should be considered for measurement. Even though the processes may be repeatable and stable,
measurable data may be difficult to obtain if the processes and their performance have not been
documented. Measures must use easily obtainable data to ensure that the burden of measurement
on the organization does not defeat the purpose of measurement by absorbing resources that may
be needed elsewhere. Examples of information security activities that can provide data for
measurement include risk assessments, penetration testing, security assessments, and continuous
monitoring. Other assessment activities (such as the effectiveness of a training and awareness
program) can also be quantified and used as data sources for measures.

To be useful in tracking performance and directing resources, measures need to provide relevant
performance trends over time and point to improvement actions that can be applied to problem
areas. Management should use measures to review performance by observing trends, identifying
and prioritizing corrective actions, and directing the application of those corrective actions based
on risk mitigation factors and available resources. The measures development process, described
in Section 5, ensures that measures are developed with the purpose of identifying causes of poor
performance and point to appropriate corrective actions.

3.2    Benefits of Using Measures

An information security measurement program provides a number of organizational and
financial benefits. Major benefits include increasing accountability for information security
performance; improving effectiveness of information security activities; demonstrating
compliance with laws, rules and regulations; and providing quantifiable inputs for resource
allocation decisions.

Increase Accountability: Information security measures can increase accountability for
information security by helping to identify specific security controls that are implemented
incorrectly, are not implemented, or are ineffective. Data collection and analysis processes can
facilitate identification of the personnel responsible for security controls implementation within
specific organizational components or for specific information systems.

Improve Information Security Effectiveness: An information security measurement program
will enable organizations to quantify improvements in securing information systems and
demonstrate quantifiable progress in accomplishing agency strategic goals and objectives.
Information security measures can assist with determining the effectiveness of implemented
information security processes, procedures, and security controls by relating results of
information security activities and events (e.g., incident data, revenue lost to cyber attacks) to
security controls and information security investments.

Demonstrate Compliance: Organizations can demonstrate compliance with applicable laws,
rules, and regulations by implementing and maintaining an information security measurement
program. Information security measures will assist in satisfying the annual FISMA reporting
