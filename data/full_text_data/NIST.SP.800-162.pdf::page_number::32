                                                                                                 •   Second, define the rules or policies that govern their protection.
                                                                                                 •   Third, identify and define the subject and object attributes, along with their associated authorities,
                                                                                                     in coordination with the access control rule developers.

                                                                                                     managed.

                                                                                                     how attribute, policy, and decision requests and responses will be rendered.
