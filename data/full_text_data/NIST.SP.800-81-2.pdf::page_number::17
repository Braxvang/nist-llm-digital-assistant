2.        Securing Domain Name System

This document provides deployment guidelines for securing the Domain Name System (DNS) in an
organization. The deployment guidelines follow from an analysis of security objectives and consequent
protection approaches for all DNS components. The rationale for security objectives and mechanics for
development of deployment guidelines are given below:

      •    Security objectives for each DNS component are developed on the basis of analysis of operating
           environment and associated threats.

      •    Secure deployment guidelines for each DNS component are provided through a combination of
           configuration options and checklists that are based on policies or best practices.
The primary security specifications (with associated mechanisms) for which this document provides
deployment guidelines are as follows:

      •    Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)
           specifications, covered by Request for Comments (RFC) 4033, 4034, 4035, and 3833 [RFC4033],
           [RFC4034], [RFC4035], [RFC3833].

      •    IETF Transaction Signature (TSIG) specifications, covered by RFCs 2845 and 3007 [RFC2845],
           [RFC3007].
2.1       What is the Domain Name System (DNS)?

The Internet is the world’s largest computing network, with more than 580 million users. From the
perspective of a user, each node or resource on this network is identified by a unique name: the domain
name. Some examples of Internet resources are:

      •    Web servers—for accessing Web sites

      •    Mail servers—for delivering e-mail messages

      •    Application servers—for accessing software systems and databases remotely.
From the perspective of network equipment (e.g., routers) that routes communication packets across the
Internet, however, the unique resource identifier is the Internet Protocol (IPv4 or IPv6) address,
represented as a series of four numbers separated by dots (e.g., 123.67.43.254). To access Internet
resources by user-friendly domain names rather than these IP addresses, users need a system that
translates these domain names to IP addresses and back. This translation is the primary task of an engine
called the Domain Name System (DNS).

Users access an Internet resource (e.g., a Web server) through the corresponding client or user program
(e.g., a Web browser) by typing the domain name. To contact the Web server and retrieve the appropriate
Web page, the browser needs the corresponding IP address. It calls DNS to provide this information. This
function of mapping domain names to IP addresses is called name resolution. The protocol that DNS uses
to perform the name resolution function is called the DNS protocol.

The DNS function described above includes the following building blocks. First, DNS should have a data
repository to store the domain names and their associated IP addresses. Because the number of domain
names is large, scalability and performance considerations dictate that it should be distributed. The
