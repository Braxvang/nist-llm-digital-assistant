NIST SP 800-82r3                                         Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            adjusting the ZTA implementations to minimize latency and ensure
            adequate redundancy to minimize risks to OT and safety operations.
            Another important aspect of ZTA implementations is the identity of
            person and non-person entities accessing resources. Within OT
            environments, shared credentials may be utilized, which could impact
            the ability to fully implement a ZTA solution.

5.2.4. Layer 4 – Hardware Security
Hardware security protection mechanisms provide the foundation for supporting security and
trust for the devices within an environment. Once device trust is established, the state must be
maintained and tracked in accordance with the system model and policy. To support these
capabilities, some vendors provide embedded technology, such as the Trusted Platform Module
(TPM), or hardware implementation for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and the
Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA). Overall, hardware security capabilities enhance endpoints to
provide specific function and security requirements, including:
   •   Monitoring and analysis
   •   Secure configuration and management
   •   Endpoint hardening
   •   Integrity protection
   •   Access control
   •   Device identity
   •   Root of trust
   •   Physical security
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should review available hardware security and automated
            capabilities to determine how they can support OT environments without
            impacting operational performance, safety, or capabilities.

5.2.5. Layer 5 – Software Security
Software security protection mechanisms provide organizations with capabilities to ensure that
applications and services supporting OT are used and maintained properly. Overall, software
security capabilities can enhance endpoint security when organizations incorporate:
   •   Application allowlisting
   •   Patching
   •   Secure code development
   •   Configuration management, including application hardening
