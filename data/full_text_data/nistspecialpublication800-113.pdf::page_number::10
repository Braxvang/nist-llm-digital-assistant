                                                                                         GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



Organizations should use a phased approach to SSL VPN planning and implementation.

A successful SSL VPN deployment can be achieved by following a clear, step-by-step planning and
implementation process. The use of a phased approach can minimize unforeseen issues and identify
potential pitfalls early in the process. The five phases of the recommended approach are as follows:

1. Identify Requirements. Identify the requirements for remote access and determine how they can
   best be met.
2. Design the Solution. Make design decisions in five areas: access control, endpoint security,
   authentication methods, architecture, and cryptography policy.
3. Implement and Test a Prototype. Test a prototype of the designed solution in a laboratory, test, or
   production environment to identify any potential issues.
4. Deploy the Solution. Gradually deploy the SSL VPN solution throughout the enterprise, beginning
   with a pilot program.
5. Manage the Solution. Maintain the SSL VPN components and resolve operational issues. Repeat
   the planning and implementation process when significant changes need to be incorporated into the
   solution.
Organizations should be familiar with the limitations of SSL VPN technology.

SSL VPNs, although a maturing technology, continue to face several challenges. These include
limitations on their ability to support a large number of applications and clients, the methods of
implementing network extension and endpoint security, the ability to provide clientless access, the use of
the SSL VPN from public locations, and product and technology education.

Organizations should implement other measures that support and complement SSL VPN
implementations.

These measures help to ensure that the SSL VPN solution is implemented in an environment with the
technical, management, and operational controls necessary to provide sufficient security for the SSL VPN
implementation. Examples of supporting measures include:

 Establishing and maintaining control over all entry and exit points for the protected network, which
  helps to ensure its integrity
 Incorporating SSL VPN considerations into organizational policies (e.g., identity management,
  remote access)
 Ensuring that all SSL VPN endpoints are secured and maintained properly to reduce the risk of SSL
  VPN compromise or misuse.
Although SSL VPNs are flexible enough to meet many needs, there are certain cases when other types of
VPNs may provide a better solution. Network layer VPN protocols, primarily IPsec; data link layer VPN
protocols, such as Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP), and
Layer 2 Forwarding (L2F); and application layer security protocols, including OpenPGP and Secure Shell
(SSH), are all effective alternatives to SSL VPNs for particular needs and environments.
