audio recorders, and digital cameras can also serve this purpose.38 Documenting system events,
conversations, and observed changes in files can lead to a more efficient, more systematic, and less error-
prone handling of the problem. Every step taken from the time the incident was detected to its final
resolution should be documented and timestamped. Every document regarding the incident should be
dated and signed by the incident handler. Information of this nature can also be used as evidence in a
court of law if legal prosecution is pursued. Whenever possible, handlers should work in teams of at least
two: one person can record and log events while the other person performs the technical tasks. Section
3.3.2 presents more information about evidence.39

The incident response team should maintain records about the status of incidents, along with other
pertinent information.40 Using an application or a database, such as an issue tracking system, helps ensure
that incidents are handled and resolved in a timely manner. The issue tracking system should contain
information on the following:

 The current status of the incident (new, in progress, forwarded for investigation, resolved, etc.)
 A summary of the incident
 Indicators related to the incident
 Other incidents related to this incident
 Actions taken by all incident handlers on this incident
 Chain of custody, if applicable
 Impact assessments related to the incident
 Contact information for other involved parties (e.g., system owners, system administrators)
 A list of evidence gathered during the incident investigation
 Comments from incident handlers
 Next steps to be taken (e.g., rebuild the host, upgrade an application).41
The incident response team should safeguard incident data and restrict access to it because it often
contains sensitive information—for example, data on exploited vulnerabilities, recent security breaches,
and users that may have performed inappropriate actions. For example, only authorized personnel should
have access to the incident database. Incident communications (e.g., emails) and documents should be
encrypted or otherwise protected so that only authorized personnel can read them.

     Consider the admissibility of evidence collected with a device before using it. For example, any devices that are potential
     sources of evidence should not themselves be used to record other evidence.

     NIST SP 800-86, Guide to Integrating Forensic Techniques Into Incident Response, provides detailed information on
     establishing a forensic capability, including the development of policies and procedures.

     Appendix B contains a suggested list of data elements to collect when incidents are reported. Also, the CERT®/CC
     document State of the Practice of Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) provides several sample incident
     reporting forms. The document is available at http://www.cert.org/archive/pdf/03tr001.pdf.

     The Trans-European Research and Education Networking Association (TERENA) has developed RFC 3067, TERENA's
     Incident Object Description and Exchange Format Requirements (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3067.txt). The document
     provides recommendations for what information should be collected for each incident. The IETF Extended Incident
     Handling (inch) Working Group (http://www.cert.org/ietf/inch/inch.html) created an RFC that expands on TERENA’s
     work—RFC 5070, Incident Object Description Exchange Format (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5070.txt).
