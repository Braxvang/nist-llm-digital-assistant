implementation. These specifications are known as "Request for Comments"1 (RFCs). The
IETF RFCs for S/MIME reference important standards issued by the International Organization
for Standardization (ISO) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). In addition,
the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has issued certain Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS) that are used to specify requirements for cryptographic
algorithms and related hardware/software modules used by S/MIME. Thus, implementers and
users must adhere to a very large set of “standards.”

Furthermore, because standards developers allow many options within communications systems,
even if all standards are rigidly adhered to, interoperability may not be possible due to differing
choices of options selected by different vendors. For example, if vendor A chooses to implement
signed receipts and vendor B chooses not to, then the signed receipts requested by the user of
vendor A's products will never be sent by vendor B's product although neither implementation
violates the standards.

To help assure that S/MIME products can interoperate and meet the e-mail security needs of
federal agencies both with respect to security features, and adequate cryptographic algorithms,
NIST has developed this Federal S/MIME V3 Client Profile. This profile states requirements for
implementing sets of cryptographic algorithm suites specified elsewhere by the standards
development organizations. The profile specifies a set of e-mail security features (e.g.,
encrypted e-mail, signed receipts) that are mandatory to be implemented. In the definition of this
Profile, NIST’s intention is never to violate underlying S/MIME standards, but rather to provide
additional specificity within the standards.

While NIST believes that use of this profile will help assure interoperability of the near term
secure e-mail products, NIST anticipates that future revisions of the profile will be required to
reflect new cryptographic algorithms and related attacks, new underlying S/MIME standards,
and new e-mail security features required by federal agencies.

The use of S/MIME requires the establishment of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to support
each sender and recipient of S/MIME messages. While the details of PKI are out of scope for
this document, it is important to note that PKI is used to provide mechanisms to establish the
identity of S/MIME users (known as authentication) and to provide for digital signatures,
confidentiality, non-repudiation of sender, etc. X.509 Certificates are used to bind an entity’s
identity and public key for secure operations for S/MIME and other PKI-enabled secure
applications. For a further understanding of PKI, see [Kuhn01], [Housley01], or [Adams00] in
the References clause.
