753   The Generate_function (shown in Figure 5) requests that a DRBG generate a specified number
754   of bits. The request may indicate the DRBG instance to be used (using the state handle returned
755   by an Instantiate_function call; see Section 2.8.1.1), the number of bits to be returned, the security
756   strength that the DRBG needs to support for generating the bitstring, and whether or not prediction
757   resistance is to be obtained during this execution of the Generate_function. Optional additional
758   input may also be incorporated into the function call. As stated in Section 2.4.1, the ability to
759   handle and use additional input is recommended.
760   The Generate_function returns status information – either an indication of success or an error. If
761   the returned status code indicates a success, the requested number of bits is returned.
762       •   If requested_number_of_bits is equal to or greater than the instantiated security strength,
763           the security strength that the returned_bits can support (if used as a key) is:
764                                     ss_key = the instantiated security strength,
765           where ss_key is the security strength of the key.
766       •   If the requested_number of bits is less than the instantiated security strength, and the
767           returned_bits are to be used as a key, the key is capable of supporting a security strength
768           of:
769                                      ss_key = requested_number_of_bits.
770   If the status code indicates an error, the returned_bits shall consist of an invalid (e.g., Null)
771   bitstring that must not be used. Examples of conditions in which an error indication shall be
772   returned include the following:
773       •   The requested_security_strength exceeds the instantiated security strength for the DRBG
774           (i.e., the security strength recorded in the DRBG’s internal state during instantiation).
775       •   Prediction resistance has been requested but cannot be obtained at this time.
776   Details about the Generate_function are provided in Section 9.3 of [SP800-90A].

777   2.8.1.3.        DRBG Reseed Request
778   The reseeding of a DRBG instantiation is intended to insert additional entropy into that DRBG
779   instantiation (e.g., to recover from a possible compromise or to provide prediction resistance). This
780   is accomplished using the following call (note that this does not increase the security strength of
781   the DRBG):
