SP 800-130                                                             August 2013



1.1 Scope of this Framework
A CKMS will be a part of a larger information system that executes information
processing applications. While the CKMS supports these applications by providing
cryptographic key management services, the particular applications or particular classes
of applications are beyond the scope of this Framework.

Some introductory material is provided to describe the Framework topics and to justify
the requirements; however, this Framework assumes that the reader has a working
knowledge of the principles of key management or is able to find that information
elsewhere (e.g., in [SP 800-57-part1]). Appendix A contains a list of references that are
useful in understanding cryptography and cryptographic key management and their
application to information security.

1.2 Audience
This Framework is primarily intended for CKMS designers. However, it may also be
used by anyone interested in a Cryptographic Key Management System design and
related design specifications. It is anticipated that CKMS security analysts, procurement
officials, implementers, integrators, operators, and responsible managers would be
interested in the CKMS design specifications and products conforming to this
Framework.

CKMS designers are expected to use this Framework as a checklist for addressing all the
topics covered, for considering all the aspects of a comprehensive CKMS, for selecting
those policies, components, and devices to be included in a CKMS, for specifying all the
decisions made in the design, and for documenting the decisions with detailed
specifications and justifications. The resulting design documentation should be adequate
for implementers to create the product, for integrators to incorporate the product in other
products or sub-systems, and for procurement officials to understand, evaluate, and
compare the product with others having similar characteristics.

1.3 Organization
Section 1 Introduction provides an introduction to the Key Management Framework
and the motivation behind it.

Section 2 Framework Basics covers basic concepts of this Framework and provides an
overview of the Framework.

Section 3 Goals defines the goals of a robust CKMS.

Section 4 Security Policies discusses the structure, typical contents, and need for
information management, information security, CKMS security, and other related
security policies.

Section 5 Roles and Responsibilities presents the roles and responsibilities that support
a CKMS.
