Maximizing Partnerships: Agencies have more options from which to choose than to simply decide if
they will develop training course material with existing resources or outsource. Agencies can establish
(or maximize existing) partnerships with other agencies to develop material or coordinate training events
that meet their IT security training needs. For example, several agencies may combine resources and
expertise and develop a training course for a particular audience. If agency-specific material is contained
in, and limited to, a single module in the course, all involved agencies can use the majority of the material
developed. Agencies would then have to modify or tailor-fit only the module that contains the agency-
specific material.

Similarly, an agency might organize an IT security day or an annual or regional conference and announce
that the events are open to other agencies’ personnel. While the material presented might not match
exactly what is needed by both agencies, it can be a fairly inexpensive way to meet some of a particular
audience’s training needs. If such an arrangement is made, a process must be established to allow each
participating agency to track attendance, ensure applicability of the training material, determine
accountability, and address other administrative and management issues.

Agencies can explore the use of training material that has been developed by other agencies and that can
be edited inexpensively rather than developing a completely new course. Care should be taken that the
available material is applicable to the intended audience, and that the material addresses what prospective
attendees need to know to satisfy their IT security responsibilities.

Within an agency, IT security program managers can build new partnerships, or reinforce existing ones,
with the organization’s training function or with functional managers who coordinate or conduct their
own training. Functional training developed in-house (e.g., financial applications, personnel
management) often lacks adequate discussion of related IT security issues. Through a partnership, the IT
security program manager can offer to review existing references to security in the training material,
checking for completeness and accuracy. The IT security program manager can also assist the training or
functional manager by developing a security module for that functional material that has no security
component. The IT security program manager can also review contract specifications for functional
training development to be outsourced, ensuring that the appropriate security issues are addressed in
sufficient detail and complexity for the intended audience.
