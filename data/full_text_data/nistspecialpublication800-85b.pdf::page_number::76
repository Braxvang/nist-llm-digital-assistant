Special Publication 800-85B                                 PIV Data Model Testing Specification


Test Scenario       1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                    2. Set OID := <<Card Holder Fingerprints
                       (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.96.16)>>
                    3. Call pivGetData w/
                        • (IN) cardHandle
                         • (IN) OID
                         • (OUT) data
                    4. Extract the value field for tag 0xBC, parse the first 88
                    bytes (CBEFF Header) to obtain the BDB length and then continue
                    on to parse the View Header of the BDB
                    a. Extract Finger View Header field
                    b. Extract contents of Finger Position.
                    c. Extract contents of View Number.
                    d. Extract contents of Impression Type.
                    e. Extract contents of Finger Quality.
                    f. Extract contents of Number of Minutiae.

                    5.Repeat steps 4a through 4f for the second view header.

Expected            The expected values for each of the fields parsed in Step 4 above are given
Result(s)           below:
                    a. Finger View Header shall have the value ‘A’
                    b. Finger Position value shall be between 0 and 14.
                    c. View Number shall be 0 if there is only one minutiae record for a finger.
                    d. Impression Type is 0 or 2.
                    e. Finger Quality value shall be between 60 and 100.
                    f. Number of Minutiae value shall be between 0 and 128.

                    The expected values for each of the fields parsed in Step 5 is the same as
                    above.

9.3.3   Fingerprint Minutiae Data
Purpose             Verify that each instance of Fingerprint Minutiae data conforms to
                    specifications in Table 3 of SP80076.
Reference(s)        1. SP80076, Table 3
                    2. AS05.02.02
                    3. AS05.02.17
                    4. AS05.02.19
Precondition(s)     1. A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                    2. A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and
                       the contact reader.
                    3. The test application is currently connected to the card application
                        which is accessible through card handle.
                    4. A valid Card Holder Fingerprints object is present on the PIV card.
                    5. Security conditions to read the object are met.
