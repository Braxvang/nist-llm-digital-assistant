Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of undetected or unauthorized modification or destruction of lifecycle/change
management information depends on the maximum aggregate sensitivity and criticality of the
information and processes associated with the system.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: The Recommended Integrity Impact Level
can range from low to high to national security information (outside the scope of this guideline).

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
lifecycle/change management information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to lifecycle/change management
information. Functions and processes supported by most lifecycle/change management
information are not time-critical. That is, temporary disruption of access to lifecycle/change
management information will usually have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations (including mission functions and public confidence in the agency), agency assets,
or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
lifecycle/change management information is low.
C.3.5.3 System Maintenance Information Type

System Maintenance supports all activities associated with the maintenance of in-house designed
software applications. The recommended security categorization for the system maintenance
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of system maintenance
information on the ability of responsible agencies to maintain in-house designed software
applications. In most cases, system maintenance information is not particularly sensitive and is
distributed to the users. In general, disclosure of system maintenance information is likely to
result in only limited adverse effects on the confidentiality of system information and processes.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional impact level recommended for system
maintenance information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of system maintenance information
