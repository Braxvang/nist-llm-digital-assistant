D.23.2 Direct Transfers to Individuals Information Type

Direct Transfers to Individuals involves the disbursement of funds from the Federal Government
directly to beneficiaries (individuals or organizations) who satisfy Federal eligibility
requirements with no restrictions imposed on the recipient as to how the money is spent. Direct
Transfers include both earned and unearned Federal Entitlement programs such as Medicare,
Social Security, unemployment benefits, etc. The recommended provisional security
categorization for the direct transfers to individuals information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of direct transfers to
individuals information on the ability of responsible agencies to disburse funds from the Federal
Government directly to beneficiaries (individuals or organizations) who satisfy Federal eligibility
requirements with no restrictions imposed on the recipient as to how the money is spent. In the
majority of cases, unauthorized disclosure of direct transfers to individuals will have only a
limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Many of the records associated with
the disbursements may include information subject to privacy restrictions (e.g., the Privacy Act
of 1974, HIPAA of 1996). (The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are
documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type.) In such cases,
punitive consequences and/or loss of public confidence can have a seriously disruptive effect on
an agencyâ€™s operations and mission. The consequent confidentiality impact level could be
moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Therefore, the provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for direct transfers to individuals is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Federal
disbursement activities are not generally time-critical. In most cases, the monetary amounts
involved are not large (on a governmental budgetary scale). Also, the adverse effects of
unauthorized modification or destruction of direct transfers to individuals on agency mission
functions or public confidence in the agency will be limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: There are significant differences between
the ability to modify a document authorizing a payment and the modification of the payment
itself. The unauthorized modification of a document authorizing a payment is less time critical
than the modification of the payment itself while the payment is in transit. Modifications to
payments in transit will result in immediate inaccurate payments. This can result in assignment
of a moderate impact level to such information.
