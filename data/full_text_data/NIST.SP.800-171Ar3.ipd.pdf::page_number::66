2072   3.10.1. Physical Access Authorizations
2073             REQUIREMENT: 03.10.01

2074             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
2075             Determine if:
2076             A.03.10.01.a[01]: a list of individuals with authorized access to the physical location where the
2077             system resides is developed.
2078             A.03.10.01.a[02]: a list of individuals with authorized access to the physical location where the
2079             system resides is approved.
2080             A.03.10.01.a[03]: a list of individuals with authorized access to the physical location where the
2081             system resides is maintained.
2082             A.03.10.01.b: authorization credentials are issued for facility access.
2083             A.03.10.01.c: the physical access list is reviewed periodically.
2084             A.03.10.01.d: individuals from the physical access list are removed when access is no longer
2085             required.

2086             ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
2087             Examine
2088             [SELECT FROM: physical protection policy and procedures; procedures for physical access
2089             authorizations; authorized personnel access list; physical access list reviews; physical access
2090             termination records; authorization credentials; system security plan; other relevant documents
2091             or records]
2092             Interview
2093             [SELECT FROM: personnel with physical access authorization responsibilities; personnel with
2094             physical access to the facility where the system resides; personnel with information security
2095             responsibilities]
2096             Test
2097             [SELECT FROM: processes for physical access authorizations; mechanisms for supporting
2098             and/or implementing physical access authorizations]
