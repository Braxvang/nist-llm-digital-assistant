1799   7.   Session Management
1800   This section is normative.
1801   Once an authentication event has taken place, it is often desirable to allow the subscriber
1802   to continue using the application across multiple subsequent interactions without
1803   requiring them to repeat the authentication event. This requirement is particularly true
1804   for federation scenarios — described in [SP800-63C] — where the authentication event
1805   necessarily involves several components and parties coordinating across a network.
1806   To facilitate this behavior, a session MAY be started in response to an authentication
1807   event, and continue the session until such time that it is terminated. The session MAY be
1808   terminated for any number of reasons, including but not limited to an inactivity timeout,
1809   an explicit logout event, or other means. The session MAY be continued through a
1810   reauthentication event — described in Sec. 7.2 — wherein the subscriber repeats some or
1811   all of the initial authentication event, thereby re-establishing the session.
1812   Session management is preferable over continual presentation of credentials as the poor
1813   usability of continual presentation often creates incentives for workarounds such as
1814   caching of activation factors, negating authentication intent and obscuring the freshness of
1815   the authentication event.

1816   7.1. Session Bindings
1817   A session occurs between the software that a subscriber is running — such as a browser,
1818   application, or operating system (i.e., the session subject) — and the RP or CSP that
1819   the subscriber is accessing (i.e., the session host). A session secret SHALL be shared
1820   between the subscriber’s software and the service being accessed. This secret binds the
1821   two ends of the session, allowing the subscriber to continue using the service over time.
1822   The secret SHALL be presented directly by the subscriber’s software or possession of the
1823   secret SHALL be proven using a cryptographic mechanism.
1824   Continuity of authenticated sessions SHALL be based upon the possession of a session
1825   secret issued by the verifier at the time of authentication and optionally refreshed during
1826   the session. The nature of a session depends on the application, such as:
1827        • a web browser session with a “session” cookie, or
1828        • an instance of a mobile application that retains a session secret.
1829   Session secrets SHALL NOT be persistent (retained across a restart of the associated
1830   application or a reboot of the host device).
1831   The secret used for session binding SHALL be generated by the session host in direct
1832   response to an authentication event. A session SHOULD inherit the AAL properties of
1833   the authentication event which triggered its creation. A session MAY be considered at a
