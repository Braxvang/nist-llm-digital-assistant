shared system services. Local users log into the server through networked client machines to access
resources that the server provides.

5.2.1   Client/Server Systems Contingency Considerations

Contingency considerations for client/server systems should emphasize data availability, confidentiality,
and integrity at both the server system level and the client level. To address these requirements, regular
and frequent backups of data should be stored offsite. Specifically, the system manager should consider
each of the following practices for client/server systems:

       Store backups offsite or at an
        alternate site. As mentioned in Section         CLIENT/SERVER AND PORTABLE SYSTEM
        3.4.2, backup media should be stored            CONTINGENCY STRATEGIES:

        recovery. Similarly, vendor names and
        emergency contact information for
        vendors that supply essential hardware, software, and other components should be listed in the
        contingency plan so that replacement components may be purchased quickly.
       Coordinate with security policies and system security controls. Client/server contingency
        solutions should be coordinated with security policies and system security controls. In choosing
        the appropriate technical contingency solution, similar security controls and security-related
        activities (e.g., risk assessment, vulnerability scanning) applied in the production system should
        be implemented in the contingency solution to ensure that executing the system contingency
        solution does not compromise or disclose sensitive data during a system disruption or emergency.
       Use results from the BIA. Impacts and priorities of associated information systems discovered
        through the BIA should be reviewed to determine related requirements.

Additional considerations for client computers include:
       Minimize the amount of data stored on a client computer. Critical user data should be stored
        on central servers that are backed up as part of an organization’s enterprise backup strategy,
        rather than on the client computer hard drive.
