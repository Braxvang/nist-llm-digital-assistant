FR:8.1 The CKMS design shall specify each of its CKMS devices and their intended
purposes.

FR:8.2 The CKMS design shall specify the physical security controls for protecting each
device containing CKMS components.

8.2 Operating System and Device Security Controls
This section addresses the computer security controls for operating systems and CKMS
devices. Note that the devices of a CKMS that incorporate a general-purpose operating
system should also have computer security controls.

8.2.1 Operating System Security
A secure operating system is the foundation of a secure computer system. Without a
secure operating system, the security of the programs and data on the computer system
cannot be assured. A secure operating system has the following security features:
   i.  BIOS protection features to ensure the proper instantiation of the operating
       system at start-up (see [SP 800-147]).
  ii.  Self-protection features to protect the operating system from unauthorized
       modification by users and user processes;
 iii. Isolation features to provide and maintain separate domains of execution for the
       users and user processes so that they do not interfere with each other and thus
       compromise a security policy requirement for data separation;
 iv.   Access controls and operating system features that allow users to share data based
       on user, group or other metadata elements;
  v.   Event-logging capabilities in order to support personal accountability and to
       investigate anomalies; and
 vi. User CKMS account management, including entity identification and
       authentication.
