1715           REQUIREMENT: 03.06.03

1716           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
1717           Determine if:
1718           A.03.06.03: the effectiveness of the incident response capability is tested periodically.

1719           ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS
1720           Examine
1721           [SELECT FROM: incident response policy and procedures; contingency planning policy and
1722           procedures; procedures for incident response testing; procedures for contingency plan testing;
1723           incident response testing material; incident response test results; incident response test plan;
1724           incident response plan; contingency plan; system security plan; other relevant documents or
1725           records]
1726           Interview

1731   3.6.4. Incident Response Training
1732           REQUIREMENT: 03.06.04

1733           ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
1734           Determine if:
1735           A.03.06.04.ODP[01]: a time period within which incident response training is to be
1736           provided to system users is defined.
1737           A.03.06.04.ODP[02]: events that initiate a review of the incident response training content
1738           are defined.
1739           A.03.06.04.a.01: incident response training for system users consistent with assigned roles and
1740           responsibilities is provided within <A.03.06.04.ODP[01]: time period> of assuming an incident
1741           response role or responsibility or acquiring system access.
1742           A.03.06.04.a.02: incident response training for system users consistent with assigned roles and
1743           responsibilities is provided when required by system changes.
1744           A.03.06.04.a.03: incident response training for system users consistent with assigned roles and
1745           responsibilities is provided periodically after initial and event-driven training.
1746           A.03.06.04.b[01]: incident response training content is reviewed periodically.
1747           A.03.06.04.b[02]: incident response training content is reviewed following <A.03.06.04.ODP[02]:
1748           events>.
