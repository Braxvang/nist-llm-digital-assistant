CHAPTER THREE

THE PROCESS
APPLYING RISK MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS ACROSS AN ORGANIZATION




T       his chapter describes a process for managing information security risk including: (i) a
        general overview of the risk management process; (ii) how organizations establish the
        context for risk-based decisions; (iii) how organizations assess risk considering threats,
vulnerabilities, likelihood, and consequences/impact; (iv) how organizations respond to risk once
determined; and (v) how organizations monitor risk over time with changing mission/business
needs, operating environments, and supporting information systems . The risk management
process, introduced in Chapter Two, is described in this chapter along with its applicability across
the three tiers of risk management. Each of the steps in the risk management process (i.e., risk
framing, risk assessment, risk response, and risk monitoring) is described in a structured manner
focusing on the inputs or preconditions necessary to initiate the step, the specific activities that
compose the step, and the outputs or post conditions resulting from the step.60 The effect of the
risk concepts described in Chapter Two (e.g., risk tolerance, trust, and culture) are also discussed
in the context of the risk management process and its multitiered application. Figure 4 illustrates
the risk management process as applied across the tiersâ€”organization, mission/business process,
and information system. The bidirectional arrows in the figure indicate that the information and
communication flows among the risk management components as well as the execution order of
the components, may be flexible and respond to the dynamic nature of the risk management
process as it is applied across all three tiers.
