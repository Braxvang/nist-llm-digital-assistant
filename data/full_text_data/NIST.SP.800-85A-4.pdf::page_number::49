NIST SP 800-85A-4                                                 PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                           INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

Required Test Procedures

TE05.12A.01: For implementations without the Discovery Object or implementations with the
Discovery Object implemented and Bit 6 of the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy set to zero, the
tester shall validate that all data objects that require a PIN are only accessible after a successful
validation of the PIV Card Application PIN through the VERIFY command.

TE05.12A.02: For implementations with the Discovery Object implemented and Bit 6 of the first
byte of the PIN Usage Policy set to one: 1) the tester shall validate that all data objects are accessible
after a successful VERIFY with the PIV Card Application PIN; and 2) the tester shall validate that
all data objects that require a PIN are accessible after a successful VERIFY with the Global PIN.

TE05.12A.02A-R4: For implementations with the Discovery Object implemented and Bit 5 of the
first byte of the PIN Usage Policy set to one, the tester shall validate that the appropriate data objects
are accessible after a successful VERIFY with OCC.

TE05.12A.03: The tester shall validate that all data objects whose access rule is “Always” are
accessible with or without PIV Card Application PIN validation, Global PIN validation (if
implemented as indicated in the Discovery Object), or OCC validation (if implemented as indicated
in the Discovery Object) using the permitted interface.


A.5.2       PIV Card Application Card Commands for Authentication

A.5.2.1     VERIFY Card Command

AS05.13: PIV Card Applications for which both the PIV Card Application PIN and the Global
PIN satisfy the PIV ACRs for PIV data object access and command execution shall implement
the Discovery Object with the PIN Usage Policy set to 0x60 zz, 0x6C zz, 0x70 zz, or 0x7C zz,
where zz is either 0x10 or 0x20, and may optionally implement the Discovery Object with the
PIN Usage Policy set to 0x68 zz or 0x78 zz, where zz is either 0x10 or 0x20.

Required Vendor Information

VE05.13.01: The vendor shall confirm that the PIV Card Application PIN can be used for PIV data
object access and command execution. If the Global PIN (in addition to the PIV Card Application
PIN) is used for data access and command execution while the PIV Card Application is the currently
selected application, the vendor shall state in its documentation that the card supports the assertion
made in AS05.13.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.13.01: The tester shall validate that the PIV Card Application PIN can be used for PIV data
object access and command execution. The tester shall validate that when the Global PIN satisfies
the PIV ACRs for PIV data object access and command execution then: 1) the Discovery Object is
implemented with the PIN Usage Policy set to 0x60 zz, 0x68 zz, 0x6C zz, 0x70 zz, 0x78 zz, or 0x7C
