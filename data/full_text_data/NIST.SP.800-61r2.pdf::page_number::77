Appendix Gâ€”Crisis Handling Steps

This is a list of the major steps that should be performed when a technical professional believes that a
serious incident has occurred and the organization does not have an incident response capability available.
This serves as a basic reference of what to do for someone who is faced with a crisis and does not have
time to read through this entire document.
1. Document everything. This effort includes every action that is performed, every piece of evidence,
   and every conversation with users, system owners, and others regarding the incident.
2. Find a coworker who can provide assistance. Handling the incident will be much easier if two or
   more people work together. For example, one person can perform actions while the other documents
   them.
3. Analyze the evidence to confirm that an incident has occurred. Perform additional research as
   necessary (e.g., Internet search engines, software documentation) to better understand the evidence.
   Reach out to other technical professionals within the organization for additional help.
4. Notify the appropriate people within the organization. This should include the chief information
   officer (CIO), the head of information security, and the local security manager. Use discretion when
   discussing details of an incident with others; tell only the people who need to know and use
   communication mechanisms that are reasonably secure. (If the attacker has compromised email
   services, do not send emails about the incident.)
5. Notify US-CERT and/or other external organizations for assistance in dealing with the incident.
6. Stop the incident if it is still in progress. The most common way to do this is to disconnect affected
   systems from the network. In some cases, firewall and router configurations may need to be modified
   to stop network traffic that is part of an incident, such as a denial of service (DoS) attack.
7. Preserve evidence from the incident. Make backups (preferably disk image backups, not file system
   backups) of affected systems. Make copies of log files that contain evidence related to the incident.
8. Wipe out all effects of the incident. This effort includes malware infections, inappropriate materials
   (e.g., pirated software), Trojan horse files, and any other changes made to systems by incidents. If a
   system has been fully compromised, rebuild it from scratch or restore it from a known good backup.
9. Identify and mitigate all vulnerabilities that were exploited. The incident may have occurred by
   taking advantage of vulnerabilities in operating systems or applications. It is critical to identify such
   vulnerabilities and eliminate or otherwise mitigate them so that the incident does not recur.
10. Confirm that operations have been restored to normal. Make sure that data, applications, and
    other services affected by the incident have been returned to normal operations.
11. Create a final report. This report should detail the incident handling process. It also should provide
    an executive summary of what happened and how a formal incident response capability would have
    helped to handle the situation, mitigate the risk, and limit the damage more quickly.
