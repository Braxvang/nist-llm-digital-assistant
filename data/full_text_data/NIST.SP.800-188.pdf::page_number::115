Appendix C. Glossary

Selected terms used in the publication are defned below. Where noted, the defnition is
sourced from another publication.
accuracy Closeness of computations or estimates to the exact or true values that the statis-
     tics were intended to measure. (OECD Glossary)
ambiguity rule See p,q rule.
anonymity Condition in identifcation whereby an entity can be recognized as distinct,
     without suffcient identity information to establish a link to a known identity. (ISO/IEC
     24760-1:2011)
anonymization A process that removes the association between the identifying dataset
     and the data subject. (ISO 25237-2008)
anticipated re-identifcation rate When an organization contemplates performing re-identifcation,
      the re-identifcation rate that the resulting de-identifed data are likely to have.
attacker A person who seeks to exploit potential vulnerabilities of a system.
attribute Characteristic or property of an entity that can be used to describe its state, ap-
      pearance, or other aspect. (ISO/IEC 24760-1:2011)[84]
attribute disclosure Re-identifcation event in which an entity learns confdential infor-
      mation about a data principal, without necessarily identifying the data principal.
      (ISO/IEC 20889:2018)
brute force attack In cryptography, an attack that involves trying all possible combina-
     tions to fnd a match.
characteristic Distinguishing feature. (ISO 8000-2:2012(E))
coded 1. Identifying information (such as name or social security number) that would
     enable the investigator to readily ascertain the identity of the individual to whom
     the private information or specimens pertain has been replaced with a number, let-
     ter, symbol, or combination thereof (i.e., the code); 2. A key to decipher the code
     exists, enabling linkage of the identifying information to the private information or
     specimens. [124]
confdentiality Data confdentiality is a property of data, usually resulting from legisla-
     tive measures, which prevents it from unauthorized disclosure. (OECD Glossary of
     Statistical Terms)
