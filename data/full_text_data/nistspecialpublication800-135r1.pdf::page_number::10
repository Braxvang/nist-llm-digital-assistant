specified in SP 800-56A and SP 800-56B . Figure 1 below shows the relationship of
the E-E procedure in SP 800-56C with the approved KDFs in SP 800-108. In Figure
1, the randomness extraction step outputs a key derivation key, which is then used as
input to the key expansion step. Any approved KDFs in SP 800-108 can be used as
the key expansion step that derives keying material and can also be used to derive
more keying material from the key expansion step’s derived key(s)/keying material.
The following sections discuss protocols that use the E-E procedure. Note that even
though the KDFs in these protocols use the E-E procedure for key derivation, their
specific randomness extraction and/or key expansion step(s) do not meet all
specification of SP 800-56C. These KDFs are only approved for use within the
limitations described in the corresponding sections later in this document.
