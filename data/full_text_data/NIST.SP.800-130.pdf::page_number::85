or secure in all cases. Thus, the value of passing a test suite is directly related to the
comprehensiveness and representation of the selected test cases.

A CKMS device may undergo tests in the categories listed below.

9.1 Vendor Testing
Device vendors test their devices to detect and eliminate errors and then to verify that
they work as expected. The techniques and specifics of this category of testing are often
considered proprietary information by the vendor and are generally not made public.

FR:9.1 A CKMS design shall specify the non-proprietary vendor testing that was
performed on the system and passed.

9.2 Third-Party Testing
A vendor or customer may request that a third-party test a CKMS device for conformance
to a particular standard. Third-party testing provides confidence that the vendor did not
overlook some flaw in its own testing procedures. For example, the National Institute of
Standards and Technology has established several programs for validating the
conformance of products to its cryptographic standards and recommendations.

FR:9.2 The CKMS design shall specify all third-party testing programs that have been
passed to date by the CKMS or its devices.

9.3 Interoperability Testing
Interoperability testing, in its most general form, merely tests that two or more devices
can be interconnected and operate with one another. This means that the data exchanged
between the devices is in a format that each device can process. Interoperable devices
may be interconnected to form a system, and interoperable systems may be
interconnected to form a network. Note that this type of testing does not necessarily test
the internal functioning of the individual device. If a device performs a unique function,
interoperability testing may not verify the correct operation of that function.

Another form of interoperability testing is used to verify that a device (i.e., the device-
under-test) appears to be working properly. If another device that performs the same or
complementary functions (i.e., the assured-baseline device) has been tested and verified
to operate correctly, the device-under-test may be tested to verify that it interoperates
with the assured-baseline device; this provides some assurance that the device-under-test
operates correctly. For example, a device performing key establishment could be tested
against another such device that is believed to operate correctly. If the two devices agree
on the established key, then the test is passed. This testing produces more credible results
when the device-under-test and the assured-baseline device are independently designed
and built by different organizations or by individuals working independently of those
involved with designing and implementing the device-under-test. This is because two
devices built by the same group may interoperate consistently, but incorrectly, with each
other. The NIST Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP) performs
