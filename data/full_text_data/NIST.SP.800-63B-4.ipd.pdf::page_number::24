628   mandatory requirements, the CSP SHALL conduct a risk management process, including
629   assessments of privacy and security risks, to determine how long records should be
630   retained and SHALL inform the subscriber of that retention policy.

631   4.4. Privacy Requirements
632   The CSP SHALL employ appropriately tailored privacy controls defined in [SP800-53]
633   or equivalent industry standard.
634   If CSPs process attributes for purposes other than identity proofing, authentication, or
635   attribute assertions (collectively “identity service”), related fraud mitigation, or to comply
636   with law or legal process, CSPs SHALL implement measures to maintain predictability
637   and manageability commensurate with the privacy risk arising from the additional
638   processing. Measures MAY include providing clear notice, obtaining subscriber consent,
639   or enabling selective use or disclosure of attributes. When CSPs use consent measures,
640   CSPs SHALL NOT make consent for the additional processing a condition of the identity
641   service.
642   Regardless of whether the CSP is an agency or private sector provider, the following
643   requirements apply to a federal agency offering or using the authentication service:
644      1. The agency SHALL consult with their Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)
645         and conduct an analysis to determine whether the collection of PII to issue or
646         maintain authenticators triggers the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974
647         [PrivacyAct] (see Sec. 9.4).
648      2. The agency SHALL publish a System of Records Notice (SORN) to cover such
649         collections, as applicable.
650      3. The agency SHALL consult with their SAOP and conduct an analysis to determine
651         whether the collection of PII to issue or maintain authenticators triggers the
652         requirements of the E-Government Act of 2002 [E-Gov].
653      4. The agency SHALL publish a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) to cover such
654         collection, as applicable.
