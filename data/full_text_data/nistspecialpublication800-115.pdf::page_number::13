                                                      TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



       Planning. Critical to a successful security assessment, the planning phase is used to gather
        information needed for assessment execution—such as the assets to be assessed, the threats of
        interest against the assets, and the security controls to be used to mitigate those threats—and to
        develop the assessment approach. A security assessment should be treated as any other project,
        with a project management plan to address goals and objectives, scope, requirements, team roles
        and responsibilities, limitations, success factors, assumptions, resources, timeline, and
        deliverables. Section 6 of this guide covers planning.
       Execution. Primary goals for the execution phase are to identify vulnerabilities and validate
        them when appropriate. This phase should address activities associated with the intended
        assessment method and technique. Although specific activities for this phase differ by
        assessment type, upon completion of this phase assessors will have identified system, network,
        and organizational process vulnerabilities. This phase is discussed in more depth in Section 7.
       Post-Execution. The post-execution phase focuses on analyzing identified vulnerabilities to
        determine root causes, establish mitigation recommendations, and develop a final report. Section
        8 of this guide addresses reporting and mitigation.
Several accepted methodologies exist for conducting different types of information security assessments.
References to several of these methodologies are found in Appendix E. 2 For example, NIST has created a
methodology—documented in Special Publication (SP) 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the Security
Controls in Federal Information Systems—which offers suggestions for assessing the effectiveness of the
security controls outlined in NIST SP 800-53. 3 Another widely used assessment methodology is the
Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM). 4 Because there are numerous reasons
to conduct assessments, an organization may want to use multiple methodologies. This publication offers
recommendations for technical testing and examination techniques that can be used for many assessment
methodologies and leveraged for many assessment purposes.

2.2     Technical Assessment Techniques

Dozens of technical security testing and examination techniques exist that can be used to assess the
security posture of systems and networks. The most commonly used techniques from the standpoint of
this document will be discussed in more depth later in this guide, and are grouped into the following three
categories:

       Review Techniques. These are examination techniques used to evaluate systems, applications,
        networks, policies, and procedures to discover vulnerabilities, and are generally conducted
        manually. They include documentation, log, ruleset, and system configuration review; network
        sniffing; and file integrity checking. Section 3 provides additional information on review
        techniques.
       Target Identification and Analysis Techniques. These testing techniques can identify systems,
        ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities, and may be performed manually but are generally
        performed using automated tools. They include network discovery, network port and service

      NIST does not endorse one methodology over another; the intent is to provide organizations with options that will allow
      them to make informed decisions to adopt an existing methodology or combine several to develop a unique methodology
      that suits the organization.

      NIST SP 800-53A discusses the framework for development of assessment procedures, describes the process of assessing
      security controls, and offers assessment procedures for each control. NIST SP 800-53A was developed to be used in
      conjunction with NIST SP 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems.
      NIST SPs 800-53, 800-53A, and 800-37 are available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.
