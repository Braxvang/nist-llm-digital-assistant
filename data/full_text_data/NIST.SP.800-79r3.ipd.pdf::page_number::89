       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                     Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                                            and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

                          (iv) The operator has undergone a training program to detect potential
                               fraud and to properly perform a supervised remote identity proofing
                               session (review).
                           (v) The operator monitors the entire identity proofing session using at
                               least one continuous, high-resolution video transmission of the
                               applicant (observe).
                          (vi) All actions taken by the applicant during the identity proofing
                               session are clearly visible to the operator (observe).
                         (vii) The operator validates the physical or cryptographic security
                               features of the primary and secondary identity source documents
                               using scanners and sensors that are integrated into the station
                               (review, observe).
                        (viii) All communications from the remote station to the identity
                               management system occur over a mutually authenticated protected
                               channel (review, observe, test).
            EI-15      If during supervised remote identity proofing, applicant biometric data        [FIPS201], Sec. 2.7.1 –Supervised
           (NEW)       cannot be collected per the criteria defined in [SP800-76] or if validation of Remote Identity Proofing
                       the identity evidence is inadequate, identity proofing and enrollment needs
                       to be halted and performed in-person at the issuer’s facility.

                       Assessment
                       Determine that:
                          (i) The organization has a formally documented operating procedure
                              on how to perform supervised remote identity proofing (including
                              reasons for termination of the remote identity session, if required)
                              (review).
                         (ii) Supervised remote identity proofing is terminated if applicant
                              biometric data cannot be collected per the criteria defined in
                              [SP800-76] or if validation of the identity evidence is inadequate
                              (review, observe).

            AP-1       Prior to PIV Card issuance, the organization ensures that, at a minimum,    [FIPS201], Sec. 2.7 – PIV Identity
         (UPDATED)     (a) a completed and favorably adjudicated Tier 1 investigation — formerly   Proofing and Registration
                       called a National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) — or (b) the Requirements
                       appropriate required investigation is initiated with the authorized federal
                       investigative service provider, and the FBI NCHC portion of the background OPM Memorandum [CSP]
                       investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated for individuals for
                       whom no prior investigation exists.

                       Assessment:
                       Determine that:
                          (i) The organization references a completed and favorably adjudicated
                              Tier 1 investigation or the appropriate required investigation is
                              initiated with the authorized federal investigative service provider,
                              and the FBI NCHC portion of a background investigation is
                              completed and favorably adjudicated for the applicant prior to PIV
                              Card issuance (review, interview, observe).
                         (ii) If the required investigation completes with an unfavorable
                              adjudication after PIV Card issuance, termination procedures are
                              followed, and the PIV identity account is updated with the results of
                              the investigation (review, interview).
