SP 800-152                                             A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


                             c) A review of the results of security tests conducted by
                                third-party testing organizations;
                             d) Functional and security testing;
                             e) Penetration testing (when required);
                             f) An assessment to ensure that the FCKMS supports the
                                FCKMS security policies of its service-using
                                organizations;
                             g) An assessment of the FCKMS security controls as
                                described and required in Section 8.5; and
                             h) An overall assessment of the security of the FCKMS.

               CA-2      A Federal CKMS shall undergo and pass a full security
PR:11.2
                         assessment under the following circumstances:
                          a) Before initial operation,
                          b) After a significant change to any policy affecting the
                             security of the FCKMS,
                          c) After major system changes, and
                          d) Immediately after the occurrence or suspected
                             occurrence of a compromise.

                         A Federal CKMS should support all interfaces that are
PA:11.2
                         needed for testing by a security-assessment team.

11.1.1 Review of Third-Party Testing and Verification of Test Results
Even though no formal validation programs for the security of an entire FCKMS
currently exist, certain programs have been established to test parts of the FCKMS,
including:
   a) NIST’s Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP), which tests NIST-
      approved cryptographic algorithms against their specifications,
   b) NIST’s Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP), which tests
      cryptographic modules against the requirements in [FIPS 140], and
   c) The National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP), which tests non-
      cryptographic software and hardware against the Common Criteria Standard (see
      [ISO 15408 Parts 1- 3]).
Even though these programs do not guarantee security, they can significantly increase
confidence in the security and integrity of an FCKMS.

FR:11.3 The CKMS design shall specify all validation programs under which any of the
CKMS devices have been validated.
