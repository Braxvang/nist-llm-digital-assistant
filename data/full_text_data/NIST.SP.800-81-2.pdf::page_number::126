SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



 Appendix Bâ€”Vendor Specific Steps to Meet Checklist Items

This publication does not attempt to list configuration examples for every DNS component available. The
authors have made the decision to only include major open-source implementations to use in the
examples. Other implementations may have vendor specific features or configuration options available to
achieve the same set of recommendations in this guide. In some cases, implementations may not contain
every features described in this publication and so those checklist items would not apply when installing
and configuring those implementations.

Whenever possible, a shorthand guide on how to meet the checklist items using a specific implementation
will be produced as a separate documents. These documents are not official NIST Special Publications,
but supplemental guidance for specific implementations.

The repository for these supplemental documents can be found at http://www.dnsops.biz/vendors
