total from HG, HA, and MG, yields a running total of $1,395,125. With $604,875
remaining in the corrective action budget, the agency would proceed with
prioritization into cells MB and LA. Totaling those two cells yields $2,619,505.
Clearly, this total exceeds the remaining corrective action budget, so stakeholders
will have to decide on how to allocate the remaining dollars. Should stakeholders
determine that the corrective action impact order (G, A, B) is the driving factor, the
corrective actions in cell LA will be implemented. If the stakeholders determine that
the system and security control category (H, M, L) is the driving factor, the
corrective actions from cell MB will be implemented until the remaining $604,875 is
expended. 42

5.7 Develop Supporting Materials
    Once prioritizing against requirements is completed, operating units are poised to
select their investments for the budget year and begin the process of requesting
funding from OMB for the next year to implement the corrective actions and security
controls.
    The Exhibit 300 is the capture mechanism for all of the analyses and activities
required for full internal review (e.g., IRB, CIO). More importantly, Exhibit 300 is
the document that OMB uses to assess investments and ultimately make funding
decisions, and therefore should be leveraged by agencies to clearly demonstrate the
need for life cycle and annual funding requests. The Exhibit 300 is completed for
new IT investments and is resubmitted annually for mixed life-cycle and steady-state
investments. Operating units should evaluate their prioritized corrective actions and
security controls identified during the prioritization process and determine whether
the outputs need to be incorporated into an existing investment’s Exhibit 300 or
whether they will need to create an independent Exhibit 300 for a new investment.

5.8 IRB and Portfolio Management
   The IRB reviews and selects investments for the agency portfolio based on the
Exhibit 300s forwarded by the operating units. Like the prioritization that occurs at
the operating-unit level, the IRB typically uses strategic selection criteria to rank-
order the investment pool and usually makes decisions based on agency mission and
goals, not just on cost. While security is not the typical driving force behind portfolio
management, it is a critical element in the investment strategy because it serves as
a qualifier for receiving funding and as a business enabler for those functions which
support the agency’s mission. After prioritizing and approving select Exhibit 300s,
the IRB creates an investment portfolio request for review by OMB.

5.9 Exhibits 53 and 300 and Program Management
    Following selection into the agency’s IT portfolio, the agency aggregates Exhibit
300s into the Exhibit 53. The Exhibit 53 provides an overview of the agency’s entire
IT portfolio by listing every IT investment, life cycle, and budget-year cost
information.
   In addition to containing all investments with Exhibit 300s, the Exhibit 53 also
contains other IT investments that do not have Exhibit 300s (e.g., legacy systems
with costs below agency thresholds). OMB evaluates an agency’s Exhibit 53 and
