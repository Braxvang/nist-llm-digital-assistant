                                                                         Guidelines on PDA Forensics



5. Preservation

     Evidence preservation is the process of seizing suspect property without altering or changing
     the contents of data that reside on devices and removable media. It is the first step in digital
     evidence recovery. The section begins with a generic introduction to preservation then
     provides a more in-depth look at PDA-specific guidance.

     Preservation involves the search, recognition, documentation, and collection of electronic-
     based evidence. In order to use evidence successfully, whether in a court of law or a less
     formal proceeding, it must be preserved. Failure to preserve evidence in its original state could
     jeopardize an entire investigation, potentially losing valuable information about an incident
     permanently.

     The DOJâ€™s Electronic Crime Scene Investigation report covers this subject in detail [DOJ01].
     The guide offers principles, policies, and procedures to follow when encountering a digital
     evidence scene. The reader is directed to that report for additional information. The following
     is a summary of the key points to observe.

             Securing and Evaluating the Scene

                  Ensure the safety of all individuals at the scene.

                  Protect the integrity of traditional and electronic evidence.

                  Evaluate the scene and formulate a search plan.

                  Identify potential evidence.

                  All potential evidence should be secured, documented, and/or photographed.

                  Conduct interviews.

             Documenting the Scene

                  Create a permanent historical record of the scene.

                  Accurately record the location and condition of computers, storage media, other
                  digital devices, and conventional evidence.

                  Document the condition and location of the computer system, including power
                  status of the computer (on, off, or in sleep mode).

                  Identify and document related electronic components that will not be collected.

                  Photograph the entire scene to create a visual record as noted by the first
                  responder.
