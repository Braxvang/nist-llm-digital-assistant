                                                        CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



Effective escalation and notification procedures should define and describe the events, thresholds, or
other types of triggers that are necessary for additional action. Actions would include additional
notifications for more recovery staff, messages and status updates to leadership, and notices for additional
resources. Procedures should be included to establish a clear set of events, actions and results, and should
be documented for teams or individuals as appropriate.

4.4       Reconstitution Phase

The Reconstitution Phase is the third and final phase of ISCP implementation and defines the actions
taken to test and validate system capability and functionality. During Reconstitution, recovery activities
are completed and normal system operations are resumed. If the original facility is unrecoverable, the
activities in this phase can also be applied to preparing a new permanent location to support system
processing requirements. This phase consists of two major activities: validating successful recovery and
deactivation of the plan. Validation of recovery typically includes these steps:

         Concurrent Processing. 33 Concurrent processing is the process of running a system at two
          separate locations concurrently until there is a level of assurance that the recovered system is
          operating correctly and securely.

         Validation Data Testing. Data testing is the process of testing and validating recovered data to
          ensure that data files or databases have been recovered completely and are current to the last
          available backup.

         Validation Functionality Testing. Functionality testing is a process for verifying that all system
          functionality has been tested, and the system is ready to return to normal operations.

At the successful completion of the validation testing, ISCP personnel will be prepared to declare that
reconstitution efforts are complete and that the system is operating normally. This declaration may be
made in a recovery/reconstitution log or other documentation of reconstitution activities. The ISCP
Coordinator, in coordination with the Information System Owner, ISSO, SAISO and with the concurrence
of the Authorizing Official, must determine if the system has undergone significant change and will
require reassessment and reauthorization. 34 The utilization of a continuous monitoring strategy/program
can guide the scope of the reauthorization to focus on those environment/facility controls and any other
controls which would be impacted by the reconstitution efforts. Assessment and authorization guidance is
available in NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 1 Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal
Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach.
Deactivation of the plan is the process of returning the system to normal operations and finalizing
reconstitution activities to prepare the system against another outage or disruption. These activities
include:

         Notifications. Upon return to normal operations, users should be notified by the ISCP
          Coordinator (or designee) using predefined notification procedures.

         Cleanup. Cleanup is the process of cleaning up work space or dismantling any temporary
          recovery locations, restocking supplies, returning manuals or other documentation to their
          original locations, and readying the system for another contingency event.


33
   According to NIST SP 800-53 Contingency Plan security controls, information systems are not required to have concurrent
   processing capabilities.
34
   Examples of significant changes that would possibly apply in a contingency situation are: 1) new or upgraded hardware
   platform, and 2) moving to a new facility.
