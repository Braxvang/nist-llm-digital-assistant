accuracy of the dataset since the use of selective redaction may result in the introduction of
non-ignorable bias.
Anonymization is a “process that removes the association between the identifying dataset
and the data subject” [85]. This term is reserved for de-identifcaiton processes that cannot
be reversed.
Some authors use the terms de-identifcation and anonymization interchangeably. In some
contexts, the term anonymization is used to describe the destruction of a table that maps
pseudonyms to real identifers.11 Both of these uses are potentially misleading, as many
de-identifcation procedures can be readily reversed if a dataset is discovered that maps a
unique attribute or combination of attributes to identities. For example, a medical dataset
may contain a list of names, medical identifers, the rooms where a patient was seen, the
time that the patient was seen, and the results of a medical test. Such a dataset could
be de-identifed by removing the name and medical identifcation numbers. However, the
dataset of medical test results should not be considered anonymized because the tests can
be re-identifed if the dataset is joined with a second dataset of room numbers, times, and
names. Since it is not possible to know whether such an auxiliary dataset exists, this publi-
cation recommends avoiding the word anonymization and using the word de-identifcation
instead. Because of the inconsistencies in the use and defnitions of the word “anonymiza-
tion,” this document avoids the term except in this section and in the titles of some refer-
ences.
Pseudonymization is a “particular type of [de-identifcation]12 that both removes the as-
sociation with a data subject and adds an association between a particular set of charac-
teristics relating to the data subject and one or more pseudonyms” [85]. The term coded
is frequently used in healthcare settings to describe data that have been pseudonymized.
Pseudonymization is commonly used so that multiple observations of an individual over
time can be matched and so that an individual can be re-identifed if there is a policy reason
to do so. Although pseudonymous data are typically re-identifed by consulting a key that
may be highly protected, the existence of the pseudonym identifers frequently increases
the risk of re-identifcation through other means.
Non-public personal information is used to describe personal information that is in a dataset
that is not publicly available. Non-public personal information is not necessarily identify-
ing.
The defnition of identifying information above suggests that it is easy – or at least pos-
sible – to distinguish personal information from identifying information. However, many
11 For example, “Anonymization is a step subsequent to de-identifcation that involves destroying all links

   between the de-identifed datasets and the original datasets. The key code that was used to generate the new
   identifcation code number from the original is irreversibly destroyed (i.e., destroying the link between the
   two code numbers)” [157].
12 Here, the word anonymization in the ISO 25237 defnition is replaced with the more accurate and descrip-

   tive term de-identifcation.
