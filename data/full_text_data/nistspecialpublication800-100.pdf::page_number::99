CHAPTER 10                                                                         Risk Management


                                   Table 10-1. Risk Level Matrix




Because the determination of risk ratings for impact and threat likelihood is largely
subjective, it is best to assign each rating a numeric value for ease of calculation.
The rationale for this justification can be explained in terms of the probability
assigned for each threat likelihood level and a value assigned for each impact level.
For example:
   • The probability assigned for each threat likelihood level is 1.0 for high, 0.5 for
     moderate, and 0.1 for low.
   • The value assigned for each impact level is 100 for high, 50 for moderate, and
     10 for low.

    Table 10-2, below, describes the risk levels shown in the above matrix. This risk
scale, with its ratings of high, moderate, and low, represents the degree of risk to
which an information system, facility, or procedure might be exposed if a given
vulnerability were exploited. It also describes the type of action senior managers
must take for each risk level.

             If an observation or finding is evaluated as high risk, there is a strong need for corrective
  High       measures. An existing system may continue to operate, but a corrective action plan must be
             put in place as soon as possible.
             If an observation is rated as moderate risk, corrective actions are needed and a plan must be
Moderate
             developed to incorporate these actions within a reasonable period of time.
             If an observation is described as low risk, the system’s authorizing official must determine
   Low
             whether corrective actions are still required or decide to accept the risk.


10.1.5 Step 5 – Control Recommendations
    The goal of the control recommendations is to reduce the level of risk to the
information system and its data to a level the organization deems acceptable. These
recommendations are essential input for the risk mitigation process, during which the
recommended procedural and technical security controls are evaluated, prioritized,
and implemented. This step is designed to help agencies identify and select controls
appropriate to the organization’s operations and mission that could mitigate or
eliminate the risks identified in the preceding steps. The following factors should be
considered in recommending controls and alternative solutions to minimize or
eliminate identified risks:
   • Effectiveness of recommended options (e.g., system compatibility);
   • Legislation and regulation;
