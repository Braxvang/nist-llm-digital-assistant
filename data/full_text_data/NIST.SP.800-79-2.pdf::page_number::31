                      Maintenance Process (MP)
                     Table 1 - IATs and Associated Authorization Focus Areas

Table G.1 and Table G.2 contain required issuer controls grouped by IAT and associated
Authorization Focus Area for a PCI and a DPCI respectively. Each issuer control represents how
one or more requirements from FIPS 201-2 and its related documents can be satisfied. Issuer
controls are sequentially numbered using the two-character identifier assigned to the
Authorization Focus Area under which they are listed. Identifiers for issuer controls applicable to
both PCIs and DPCIs are aligned for ease of reference. In addition, controls for DPCIs are
marked with (DC) for quick identification. For example, DO-1 applies to a PCI and DO(DC)-1
applies to a DPCI. Both these issuer controls are targeted at assessing the same requirement.

Table 2 shows the relationships between IATs, Authorization Focus Areas, and issuer controls
for a PIV Card Issuer.
