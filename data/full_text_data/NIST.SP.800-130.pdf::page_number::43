SP 800-130                                                           August 2013



      protections should be verified before the key and metadata are operationally used.
      Generally, a single cryptographic function (e.g., HMAC or digital signature) is
      used to provide both integrity protection and source authentication.

      This element may have several sub-elements:
         i. The mechanism used for integrity protection (e.g., hash value, MAC, or
              digital signature),
         ii. The mechanism used for confidentiality protection (e.g., key wrapping or
              key transport),
         iii. The mechanism used for source authentication (e.g., MAC or digital
              signature), and
         iv. An indication of the protections that are enforced by a particular non-
              cryptographic trusted process.

   t) Metadata Protections (can be a subset of the key protections or can be
      different): This element specifies the mechanisms used to provide integrity,
      confidentiality, and source authentication to the associated metadata. Generally,
      the same mechanism will be used to protect the key and its metadata, especially if
      the key and metadata are transmitted or stored together.

      This element may have several sub-elements:
         i. The mechanism used for integrity protection (e.g., hash value, MAC, or
              digital signature),
         ii. The mechanism used for confidentiality protection (e.g., encryption),
         iii. The mechanism used for source authentication, and
         iv. An indication of the protections that are enforced by a particular non-
              cryptographic trusted process.

   u) Trusted Association Protections (i.e., how the trusted association of metadata
      to the key is protected) (can be part of key protection in item s) above): This
      information is implicitly provided if the key and metadata are protected as one
      aggregated item using the protection listed in item s) above. Otherwise, the
      following should be provided for each trusted association protection:
          i. The mechanism used for integrity protection (e.g., hash value, MAC,
              digital signature, or trusted process), and
          ii. The mechanism used for source authentication (e.g., cryptographic
              mechanism or non-cryptographic trusted process).

   v) Date-Times: There are several important date-times for the lifecycle state
      transitions of a key:
          i. The generation date: The date-time that a key was generated,
          ii. The association date: The date-time that a key was associated with its
                metadata for the first time,
          iii. The activation date: The date-time that a key was first used,
          iv. The future activation date: The date-time that a key is first to be used,
