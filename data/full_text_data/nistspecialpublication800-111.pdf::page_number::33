                                            GUIDE TO STORAGE ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES FOR END USER DEVICES



 Receiving notifications from vendors of security problems with storage encryption components, and
  responding appropriately to those notifications

 Preparing devices for retirement or disposal. Devices and media that use storage encryption
  technologies should be sanitized or destroyed, even for devices using FDE. As mentioned in Section
  3.2, relying on storage encryption to protect data without regularly maintaining the encryption
  solution is not recommended. Another problem with relying on storage encryption to protect data on
  retired or disposed devices is that all copies of all keys used for storage encryption would need to be
  destroyed, which may be very difficult.

User files on the device should be backed up before major maintenance actions are performed, such as
installing or upgrading storage encryption software and changing encryption algorithms or key sizes.
