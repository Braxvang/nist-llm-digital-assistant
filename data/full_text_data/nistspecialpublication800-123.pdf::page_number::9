                                                                           GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



 Configure resource controls
 Install and configure additional security controls, if needed
 Perform security testing of the operating system.
Organizations should ensure that the server application is deployed, configured, and managed to
meet the security requirements of the organization.

In many respects, the secure installation and configuration of the server application will mirror the
operating system process discussed above. The overarching principle is to install the minimal amount of
services required and eliminate any known vulnerabilities through patches or upgrades. If the installation
program installs any unnecessary applications, services, or scripts, they should be removed immediately
after the installation process concludes. Securing the server application would generally include the
following steps:

 Patch and upgrade the server application
 Remove or disable unnecessary services, applications, and sample content
 Configure server user authentication and access controls
 Configure server resource controls
 Test the security of the server application (and server content, if applicable).
Many servers also use authentication and encryption technologies to restrict who can access the server
and to protect information transmitted between the server and its clients. Organizations should
periodically examine the services and information accessible on the server and determine the necessary
security requirements. Organizations should also be prepared to migrate their servers to stronger
cryptographic technologies as weaknesses are identified in the serversâ€™ existing cryptographic
technologies. For example, NIST has recommended that use of the Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) be
phased out by 2010 in favor of SHA-224, SHA-256, and other larger, stronger hash functions.
Organizations should stay aware of cryptographic requirements and plan to update their servers
accordingly.

Organizations should commit to the ongoing process of maintaining the security of servers to
ensure continued security.

Maintaining a secure server requires constant effort, resources, and vigilance from an organization.
Securely administering a server on a daily basis is an essential aspect of server security. Maintaining the
security of a server will usually involve the following actions:

 Configuring, protecting, and analyzing log files on an ongoing and frequent basis
 Backing up critical information frequently
 Establishing and following procedures for recovering from compromise
 Testing and applying patches in a timely manner
 Testing security periodically.
