                                     GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



         examples include briefing materials, participant manuals, instructor and facilitator guides, test
         plans and scripts, and evaluation criteria.
       Conduct the event. In this phase, the event—the training, exercise, or test—is actually
        conducted. The details of this vary greatly by event type and scope.
       Evaluate lessons learned from the event. The evaluation phase is used to analyze the event and
        identify lessons learned, both to improve the IT plans and their execution, and to improve the
        TT&E process. Evaluation is performed somewhat differently by event type, as follows:

         –    Training: Participants typically complete an evaluation/critique form on the success of the
              event and areas where enhancements can be made in terms of the personnel’s knowledge of
              the trained subject matter. Feedback is analyzed and documented in a training analysis
              report, and future sessions are modified as needed.

         –    Exercise or test: Participants typically engage in a facilitated debrief, also called a hotwash,
              to discuss areas that went particularly well and areas where enhancements can be made in
              terms of the plan’s contents and/or the tested systems. Findings discussed during the debrief,
              observations made during the course of the event, and considerations for enhancement are
              documented in an after action report.
Although the details of each phase typically vary based on the type of event conducted, the same phases
should be used for each event. Details pertaining to each type of event can be found within Sections 4
through 6.

2.5     Recommendations

Organizations should consider having a TT&E program that validates the effectiveness of IT plans such
as contingency plans and computer security incident response plans, and manages their maintenance. The
TT&E program should include a TT&E plan, policy, and event methodology. Using these elements
should cause TT&E events to be performed more consistently and effectively. The TT&E plan should
