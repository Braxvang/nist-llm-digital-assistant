Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of conflict resolution
information on the ability of responsible agencies to mitigate and prevent disputes stemming
from inter and intra-state disagreements. Unauthorized disclosure of conflict resolution
information can reasonably be expected to jeopardize fulfillment of conflict resolution missions.
This is particularly true of premature release of resolution factors, personnel profiles, and
proposed solutions to adversaries. Some information that has supported a conflict resolution
process may undo the results of successful conflict resolution processes. The loss of public
confidence in the agency may cause a catastrophic adverse effect on an agency’s mission
capability. Where information includes candid opinions of agency personnel, or involvement of
agency personnel in specific prior activities, the effectiveness of those personnel for many future
agency missions may be permanently impaired. The consequences of failed conflict resolution
activities may pose threats to human life and major property assets

The level of confidentiality impact assigned to treaties and agreements information is determined
by the ability of responsible agencies to negotiate and implement accords with foreign
governments and organizations in efforts related to arms reduction and regulation, trade matters,
criminal investigations and extraditions, and other types of foreign policy. Unauthorized
disclosure of information associated with treaties and agreements can reasonably be expected to
prevent successful negotiation and/or ratification of treaties and agreements. This is particularly
true of prematurely released resolution factors, personality assessments, and proposed solutions
to adversaries. Some information that has supported a treaty or other international agreement
process may undo the results of a successfully completed treaty or agreement. The subsequent
threat to public confidence in the agency can cause a catastrophic adverse effect on an agency’s
mission capability. When the disclosed information includes candid opinions of agency
personnel, or background information on agency personnel, the effectiveness of those personnel
for future agency missions may be permanently impaired. The consequences of failure to
successfully conclude treaties and other international agreements often pose threats to human life
and major property assets.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for foreign affairs information is high.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of conflict resolution information
depend on whether the information is time-critical.

The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of information associated with
treaties and agreements also depend on the time-critical nature of the information. The
unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g.,
web pages, electronic mail) may affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the
damage to the mission would usually be limited.
