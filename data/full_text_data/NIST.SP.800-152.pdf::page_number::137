Compromise (noun)         The unauthorized disclosure, modification, substitution, or use
                          of sensitive data (e.g., keys, metadata, or other security-related
                          information) or the unauthorized modification of a security-
                          related system, device or process in order to gain unauthorized
                          access.
Compromise (verb)         To reduce the trust associated with a key, its metadata, a
                          system, device or process.
Compromise recovery       The procedures and processes of restoring a system, device or
                          process that has been compromised back to a secure or trusted
                          state, including destroying compromised keys, replacing
                          compromised keys (as needed), and verifying the secure state
                          of the recovered system.
Compromised state         A lifecycle state for a key that is known or suspected of being
                          known by an unauthorized entity.
Computer Security         The high-level policy for the security services that are to be
Policy                    supported by a computer for protecting its applications, stored
                          data, and communications, and the rules to be followed in
                          verifying user identities and authorizing their requests before
                          they are granted.
Confidentiality           The property that sensitive information is not disclosed to
                          unauthorized entities.
Configurable              A characteristic of a system, device, or software that allows it
                          to be changed by an entity authorized to select or reject
                          specific capabilities to be included in an operational,
                          configured version.

Copy (data)               To replicate data in another location while maintaining it in its
                          original location.

COTS product              A product that is commercially available.
Cryptographic algorithm A well-defined computational procedure that takes variable
                        inputs, often including a cryptographic key, and produces an
                        output.
