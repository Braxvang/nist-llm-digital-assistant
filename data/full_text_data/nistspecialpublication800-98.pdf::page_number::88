GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



5.4             Summary

Organizations should use a combination of management, operational, and technical controls to mitigate
the business risks of implementing RFID systems. Table 5-1 maps the presented controls to the
categories of risks that they mitigate. Because each RFID implementation is highly customized and each
organizationâ€™s requirements are different, the security controls discussed in this section are not all
applicable or effective for all RFID applications. Organizations need to assess the risks their RFID
implementations face and choose the appropriate controls, taking into account factors such as regulatory
requirements, the magnitude of threats, and cost and performance implications of the controls. For
example, a remote warehouse may have little need to protect against eavesdropping, but it may require
redundant processes in case of system failure. Traditional security controls are often preferable to RFID-
specific controls. For example, if RFID data can be stored in an enterprise database rather than on tags,
then physical and network security controls for the database server probably are more practical than using
tags with cryptographic capabilities.
