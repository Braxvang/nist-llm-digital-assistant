Special Publication 800-85B                                   PIV Data Model Testing Specification


Precondition            1.    A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                        2.    A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and
                              the contact reader.
                        3.    The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                        4.    A digital signature key and corresponding certificate are present on
                              the PIV card.
Test Steps              1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                        2. Set OID := <<Digital Signature Certificate
                           (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.1.0)>>
                        3. Call pivGetData w/
                           • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                        4. Extract validity->notAfter->utcTime field value from
                           the certificate
                        5. Extract subjectPublicKeyInfo->algorithm->algorithm
                           field value
                        6. Extract the subjectPublicKeyInfo->subjectPublicKey
                           from the certificate
                        7. Match the key size to Table 3-3 of SP80078 based on the
                           algorithm obtained from the step 3 and the date
                           obtained from step 2

                        Note: - Since the ECDSA keys do not have any size
                        restrictions based on dates, this test case does not apply
                        to these types of keys

Expected Result(s)      The key sizes used adhere to the time period for use requirement.


11.2.2 Data Integrity Checks

11.2.2.1 Verify key usage extension

Purpose                 Confirms that the digital signature certificate asserts the appropriate
                        purpose of the key contained in the certificate.

Precondition            1.    A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                        2.    A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and
                              the contact reader.
                        3.    The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                        4.    A digital signature key and corresponding certificate are present on
                              the PIV card.
