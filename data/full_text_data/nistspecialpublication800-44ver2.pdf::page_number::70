      trick the user through social engineering into clicking on the maliciously crafted URL. If the user’s
      Web browser was vulnerable to the exploit, the user’s machine could be compromised. Since this
      attack does require some level social engineering, it is considered somewhat less dangerous than
      attacks on persistent vulnerabilities.

The solution to XSS attacks is to validate all user input and remove any unexpected or potentially risky
data. Another solution is to use an HTML-quoted version 45 of any user input that is presented back to
other users. This will prevent the Web browsers of other users from interpreting that input and acting on
any embedded commands present.
