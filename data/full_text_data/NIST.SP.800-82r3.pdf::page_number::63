Together, each of the risk management components (i.e., frame, assess, respond, and monitor)
are applied across the risk management levels, resulting in organization-wide risk awareness and
the traceability and transparency of risk-based decisions.

4.1.1. Framing OT Risk
The framing component consists of the processes for establishing the required assumptions,
constraints, risk tolerances, and risk management strategies for organizations to make consistent
risk management decisions. Specifically, risk framing supports the overall risk management
strategy by incorporating elements from the organizational governance structure, legal/regulatory
environment, and other factors to establish how the organization intends to assess, respond to,
and monitor risk to all IT and OT systems.
                     OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
                     For OT system operators, safety directly affects decisions on how
                     systems are engineered and operated. Safety can be defined as “freedom
                     from conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational illness,
                     damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the
                     environment.” 7 Based on this, human safety impacts are typically
                     evaluated based on the degree of injury, disease, or death that could
                     result from the OT system malfunctioning after a cyber incident, taking
                     into consideration any previously performed safety impact assessments
