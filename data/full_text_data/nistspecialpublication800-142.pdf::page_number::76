Appendix C - TOOLS FOR COMBINATORIAL TESTING

         A variety of software tools are available to assist with combinatorial testing
     projects. Here we summarize those available from the NIST ACTS project. The
     ACTS covering array generator is generally faster and produces smaller test arrays
     than others, based on comparisons we have done in 2009. The other tools, to the best
     of our knowledge, have functions that are not available elsewhere.

       • ACTS covering array generator – produces compact arrays that will cover 2-way
         through 6-way combinations. It also supports constraints that can make some
         values dependent on others, and mixed level covering arrays which offer different
         strength coverage for subsets of the parameters (e.g., 2-way coverage for one
         subset but 4-way for another subset of parameters). Output can be exported in a
         variety of formats, including human-readable, numeric, and spreadsheet. Either
         “don’t care” or randomized output can be specified for tests that include
         combinations already fully covered by previous tests.

       • Coverage measurement tool – produces a comprehensive set of data on the
         combinatorial coverage of an existing set of tests, as explained in Chapter 6.
         Output can be generated in spreadsheet format to allow easy processing and
         graphing.

       • Sequence covering array generator – produces sequence covering arrays as
         defined in Chapter 5. It includes an option for constraints in the form of
         prohibited sequences.

     To obtain any of these, see the ACTS web site at csrc.nist.gov/acts.
