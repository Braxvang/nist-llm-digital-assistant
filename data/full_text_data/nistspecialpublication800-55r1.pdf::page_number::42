            Field                                                    Data
   Responsible       Indicate the following key stakeholders:
   Parties           •      Information Owner: Identify organizational component and individual who owns
                            required pieces of information;
                     •      Information Collector: Identify the organizational component and individual
                            responsible for collecting the data. (Note: If possible, Information Collector should
                            be a different individual or even a representative of a different organizational unit
                            than the Information Owner, to avoid the possibility of conflict of interest and ensure
                            separation of duties. Smaller organizations will need to determine whether it is
                            feasible to separate these two responsibilities.); and
                     •      Information Customer: Identify the organizational component and individual who
                            will receive the data.
   Data Source       Location of the data to be used in calculating the measure. Include databases, tracking
                     tools, organizations, or specific roles within organizations that can provide required
                     information.
   Reporting         Indication of how the measure will be reported, such as a pie chart, line chart, bar graph,
   Format            or other format. State the type of format or provide a sample.



Candidate measures provided in Appendix A are examples of information security measures and
may or may not be required for regulatory or organizational reporting at any point in time (e.g.,
FISMA). The purpose of listing these measures is to demonstrate examples of measures that can
be:
      •   Used as stated;

      •   Modified and tailored to a specific organization’s requirement; or

      •   Used as a template for other information security measures.

Organizations are encouraged, but not required, to use these measures as a starting point for their
information security measurement efforts.

5.7       Feedback Within the Measures Development Process

Measures that are ultimately selected for implementation will be useful not only for measuring
performance, identifying causes of unsatisfactory performance, and pinpointing improvement
areas, but also for facilitating consistent policy implementation, effecting information security
policy changes, redefining goals and objectives, and supporting continuous improvement. This
relationship is depicted by the feedback arrows in Figure 5-1, which are marked as
Goal/Objective Redefinition, Policy Update, and Continuous Improvement. Once measurement
of security control implementation begins, subsequent measures can be used to identify
performance trends and determine whether the implementation rate is appropriate. A specific
frequency of each measure collection will depend on the life cycle of a measured event. For
example, a measure that pertains to the percentage of completed or updated system security plans
should not be collected more often than semiannually, while a measure that pertains to crackable
passwords should be collected more frequently. Over time, measurements will point to
