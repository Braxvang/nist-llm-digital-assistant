NIST SP 800-82r3                                              Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

CISA promotes a cohesive effort between government and industry to improve their ability to
anticipate, prioritize, and manage national-level OT risk. CISA assists OT system vendors and
asset owners, operators, and other vendors across all critical infrastructure sectors to identify
security vulnerabilities and develop sound, proactive mitigation strategies that strengthen their
OT systems’ cybersecurity posture.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations may want to consider incorporating resources such as the
            NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and the MITRE ATT&CK
            for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) framework [ATTACK-ICS] into
            their processes for assessing risks to the mission and OT systems.
            Additionally, the nature of OT systems requires organizations to consider
            additional factors that may not exist when conducting risk assessment for
            a traditional IT system. For example, OT will have different threat
            sources, vulnerabilities, and compensating controls than IT. The impact
            of a cyber incident in an OT environment may include both physical and
            digital effects that risk assessments need to incorporate, including:
                   •   Impacts on safety and the use of safety assessments
                   •   Physical impacts of a cyber incident on an OT, including the
                       larger physical environment, and the effect on the process
                       controlled
                   •   The consequences for risk assessments of non-digital control
                       components within an OT
During risk framing, organizations should select appropriate risk assessment methodologies that
include OT. When evaluating the potential physical damage from a cyber incident, organizations
with OT systems may consider i) how a cyber incident could manipulate the operation to impact
the physical environment, ii) what design features exist in the OT system to prevent or mitigate
an impact, and iii) how a physical incident could emerge based on these conditions.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            When framing risks within an OT environment, organizations may
            discover that cybersecurity threats are not always as well understood or
            predictable as OT hazards. Organizations may consider incorporating
            cyber attack and IT failure scenarios into their process hazard analysis
            (PHA) or failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) processes. By
            including risks due to cyber attacks and cyber risk management measures
            in these processes, organizations may gain a better understanding of the
            cyber risks to the OT operational environment.
            As part of risk framing, organizations may also need to consider:
                   •   Assumptions about how risk is assessed, responded to, and
                       monitored across the organization
                   •   The risk tolerance for the organization, the level of risk that can
                       be accepted as part of achieving strategic goals and objectives,
