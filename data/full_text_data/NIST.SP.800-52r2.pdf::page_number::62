NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                                               GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


 Appendix E—Future Capabilities

This section identifies emerging concepts and capabilities that are applicable to TLS. As these
concepts mature and commercial products are available to support them, these guidelines will be
revised to provide specific recommendations.

E.1          U.S. Federal Public Trust PKI

The Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) Subcommittee of the Federal CIO
Council’s Information Security and Identity Management Committee is developing a new public
trust root and issuing CA infrastructure to issue TLS server certificates for federal web services
on the public Internet. The intent is for this new root to be included in all of the commonly used
trust stores so that federal agencies can obtain their TLS server certificates from this PKI rather
than from commercial CAs. The certificate policy for this PKI is being developed at
https://devicepki.idmanagement.gov.

Once this PKI is operational and is included in the commonly used trust stores, federal agencies
should consider obtaining their TLS server certificates from this PKI.

E.2          DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE)

DANE leverages DNS security extensions (DNSSEC) to provide mechanisms for securely
obtaining information about TLS server certificates from the DNS. RFC 6698 [34] specifies a
resource record that may be made available in DNS that includes a certificate (or the public key
of a certificate) along with an indicator of how the certificate is to be used. There are four
options:

      1. The DNS record contains an end-entity certificate. In addition to the server public-key
         certificate validation, as specified in Section 4.5, the client verifies that the TLS server
         certificate matches the certificate provided in the DNS records.
      2. The DNS record contains a domain-issued end-entity certificate. 37 The client can use the
         certificate if it verifies that the TLS server certificate matches the one provided in the
         DNS records (i.e., the client forgoes server public-key certificate validation as specified
         in Section 4.5).
      3. The DNS record contains a CA certificate. In addition to the server public-key certificate
         validation, as specified in Section 4.5, the client verifies that the certification path for the
         TLS server certificate includes the CA certificate provided in the DNS records.
      4. The DNS record contains a certificate that is to be used as a trust anchor. The client
         validates the TLS server certificate, as specified in Section 4.5, using the trust anchor
         provided in the DNS records instead of the trust anchors in the client’s local trust anchor
         store.



37 In this context, a “domain-issued” certificate is one that is issued by the domain name administrator without involving a third-

      party CA. It corresponds to usage case 3 in Section 2.1.1 of RFC 6698.
