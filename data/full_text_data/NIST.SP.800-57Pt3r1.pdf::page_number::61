TSIG-shared secret strings should be random for use in providing integrity protection for
DNS message transactions, and generated at appropriate security strengths. The system
installers using the TSIG secret string shall agree on which TSIG algorithm to use.

8.3 Procurement Guidance
The following recommendations are for any individual that makes a purchasing decision
for acquiring DNSSEC-capable components for their network infrastructure.

1. Ensure that DNSSEC utilities use FIPS140-2 validated cryptographic modules [FIPS
   140-2].
2. DNS server software should generate and serve NSEC3 RRs, if required by zone
   policy.
3. Ensure that DNS server software use an approved random bit generator to generate
   random strings for use with TSIG message authentication using HMAC that is
   consistent with the hash-algorithm security-strength recommendations in Part 1.
4. Ensure that DNSSEC-enabled versions of network applications are purchased as
   required by security policy, if available.
5. Ensure that DNSSEC software implementing SHA-256 is included in procurements
   when available.

8.4 Recommendations for System Installers
The system installer is the individual(s) that installs a DNS component and performs the
initial configuration of the component.


8.4.1 Recommendations for System Installers (Authoritative Servers)
1. Authoritative server installers shall configure a DNS authoritiative server to serve
   DNSSEC-signed zone data.

2. Authoritiative server installers shall use an approved random bit generator (as
   discussed in [SP 800-90A]) to create and configure an initial, random secret string for
   use with TSIG in transactions.

3. Authoritative servers shall be configured to generate and sign zone data with a key
   pair that is consistent with the key size recommendations for digital signatures as
   specified in Part 1.
4. Authoritative servers shall be configured to generate and sign the key set with a key
   pair that is consistent with the key sizes recommended for digital signatures, as
   specified in Part 1.
5. Authoritative servers shall be configured to generate and use a random secret string
   for zone transfer-message authentication (via TSIG) between primary and secondary
   servers. The security strength of the random bit generator process shall support the
   security strength required by the servers.
6. Authoritative servers shall be configured to generate and use a separate shared secret
