IPsec allows the individual selection of security algorithms. As an example, an
implementer using Table 3-2 and following the guidance of Part 1 [SP 800-57 Part 1],
could select the following algorithms to form an IPsec suite with an overall security
strength of 112 bits:
      ESP Encryption: AES in CBC mode
      ESP Integrity Protection: HMAC-SHA1
      IKEv2 Encryption: AES in CBC mode
      IKEv2 Pseudo-random function: HMAC-SHA1
      IKEv2 Diffie-Hellman group: 2048-bit MODP
      IKEv2 Integrity: HMAC-SHA1
      IKEv2 Peer Authentication: 2048-bit RSA with SHA-256.

The Suite-B-GCM-128 and Suite-B-GCM-256 suites are both defined in [RFC 6379]. At
present, these cipher suites are not widely available or deployed. [SP 500-267] states that
support for these cipher suites is optional. However, wherever practical, implementations
should be procured that support these cipher suites, and they should be selected for use
wherever very high performance and security strength are required. As discussed above,
AES-GCM is a combined-mode algorithm that provides both encryption and integrity
protection; therefore these suites provide integrity, despite the fact that the integrity
mechanism is listed in [RFC 6379] as NULL for both suites.

3.2.2 Additional Recommendations
1. The Authentication Header (AH) should not be used in IPsec version 3.

2. IKE should be used for automated key management to ensure a re-keying capability
   and scalability.

3. Once an ESP Security Association has expired or is no longer in use, its ESP
   encryption keys shall continue to be protected by the system and kept secret as long
   as the data they were used to protect needs to be kept secret.


3.3 Procurement Guidance
These recommendations are written to assist individuals responsible for selecting security
products that include IPsec for the security of the IP layer.

1. Any IPsec system for use within the Federal Government should include an IKE
   implementation for automated key management.

2. Ensure that IPsec implementations include approved algorithms for each IPsec
   security component.
