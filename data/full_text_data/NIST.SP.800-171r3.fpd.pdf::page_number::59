       NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                      Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information

1610             b. Remediate system vulnerabilities within [Assignment: organization-defined response times].
1611             c.   Update system vulnerabilities to be scanned periodically and when new vulnerabilities are
1612                  identified and reported.

1613             DISCUSSION
1614             Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for system components and ensure
1615             that potential sources of vulnerabilities (e.g., networked printers, scanners, and copiers) are not
1616             overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software may require additional approaches, such
1617             as static analysis, dynamic analysis, or binary analysis. Organizations can use these approaches
1618             in source code reviews and tools (e.g., static analysis tools, web-based application scanners,
1619             binary analyzers). Vulnerability scanning includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for
1620             functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and
1621             scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating flow control mechanisms.
1622             To facilitate interoperability, organizations consider using products that are Security Content
1623             Automated Protocol (SCAP)-validated and that employ the Extensible Configuration Checklist
1624             Description Format (XCCDF). Organizations also consider using scanning tools that express
1625             vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and
1626             that employ the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL). Sources for vulnerability
1627             information also include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing, the National
1628             Vulnerability Database (NVD), and the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).

1636   3.12.1. Security Assessment
1637             REQUIREMENT: 03.12.01
1638             Assess the security requirements for the system and its environment of operation periodically to
1639             determine if the requirements have been satisfied.

1640             DISCUSSION
1641             By assessing the security requirements, organizations determine whether the necessary
1642             safeguards and countermeasures are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and
1643             producing the desired outcome. Security assessments identify weaknesses and deficiencies in
1644             the system and provide the essential information needed to make risk-based decisions. Security
1645             assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by the
1646             organization to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports. Security assessment
1647             results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being
1648             conducted.
