must be logically or cryptographically linked together and then protected, either
cryptographically or physically. These operations are further discussed in Section 6.4.10.

A metadata element for a key could be implicitly known by the FCKMS, but is often
explicitly associated and stored with the key. Some metadata elements are sensitive to
unauthorized disclosure and, therefore, require confidentiality protection. Like keys,
metadata needs protection against unauthorized modification, and the source should be
authenticated before the metadata is used. The amount of protection provided to a key and
its metadata should be commensurate with the [FIPS 199] security category and [FIPS 200]
information-system impact-level of the data being protected by that key and its metadata.

Keys are considered as being either static or ephemeral. Static keys are typically used
multiple times and are considered as being “long-term” keys. Ephemeral keys are usually
generated when needed and used only once; they are considered to be “short-term” keys.

A trusted association must be established between each static key and its metadata when they
are created by the FCKMS, and this association should be maintained throughout the lifetime
of the key. A trusted association can be established by a cryptographic binding between a key
and its metadata (e.g., a digital signature computed on a key and its metadata), or by a trusted
process (e.g., a face-to-face handover of metadata from an entity who is known and trusted).
An FCKMS should provide cryptographic binding and verification functions that are used in
the key and metadata distribution and management processes.

2.4    FCKMS Functions

An FCKMS provides key and metadata management functions for cryptographic-based
security in user applications, such as secure data communication and storage. These
functions include the generation, distribution and destruction of cryptographic keys and their
associated metadata (see Section 6.4).

2.5    CKMS Design

In accordance with the Framework, any CKMS design should describe how it provides
cryptographic keys to the entities that will use those keys to protect sensitive data. The
CKMS design documentation should specify the use of each key type, where and how keys
can be generated, how they can be protected in storage and during delivery, and the types of
entities to whom they can be delivered.

FR:2.3 A compliant CKMS design shall describe design selections and provide
documentation as required by the requirements of the Framework.

FR:2.4 The CKMS design shall specify a high-level overview of the CKMS system that
includes:
   a) The use of each key type,
   b) Where and how the keys are generated,
   c) The metadata elements that are used in a trusted association with each key type,
   d) How keys and/or metadata are protected in storage at each entity where they reside,
