1087       •   Step 3.2 checks whether or not the status returned in step 3.1 indicated a success. If the
1088           status did not indicate a success, the status is returned along with an invalid bitstring as the
1089           returned_bitstring (e.g., invalid_bitstring is Null).
1090       •   Step 3.3 invokes the conditioning function for processing the entropy_bitstring obtained
1091           from step 3.1. The input_parameters for the selected Conditioning_function are specified
1092           in Sections 3.3.1.2 or 3.3.1.3, depending on the conditioning function used.
1093       •   Step 3.4 concatenates the conditioned_output received in step 3.3 to the temporary bitstring
1094           (temp), and step 3.5 increments the counter for the number of full-entropy bits that have
1095           been produced so far.
1096       •   If at least n full-entropy bits have not been produced, repeat the process starting at step 3.1.
1097       •   Step 4 truncates the full-entropy bitstring to n bits.
1098       •   Step 5 returns an n-bit full-entropy bitstring as the returned_bitstring.
