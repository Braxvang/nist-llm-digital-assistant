      NIST SP 800-92r1 ipd                                                  Cybersecurity Log Management
      October 2023                                                                         Planning Guide

619             TS-4, Define Target State for Log Access
620   [Tasks]                                                              [Previous Play] [Next Play]
621   Summary: Define your organization’s log access-related requirements and goals. This should
622   take the access needs of auditors, law enforcement, courts, and other government agencies into
623   account. The desired outcome is a comprehensive set of prioritized requirements and goals for
624   cybersecurity log access that help define your organization’s target state.
625   Tasks to perform include the following (not necessarily in order):
626      1. TS-4.1: Identify the access-related policy requirements for log sources and transferred
627         logs for each type of log event.
628                a. TS-4.1a: Determine who/what should or must be able to locally and remotely
629                   access log data.
630                b. TS-4.1b: Determine who/what should or must be able to directly access logs
631                   versus indirectly access logs (e.g., through a SIEM, through a read-only
632                   interface).
633                c. TS-4.1c: Determine how local and remote access to log data itself should or must
634                   be logged.
635                d. TS-4.1d: Determine how local and remote access to log data should or must be
636                   protected (e.g., encryption).
637      2. TS-4.2: Determine how log preservation orders, such as a legal requirement to protect
638         and prevent the alteration and destruction of particular log records, must be handled from
639         a technical standpoint.
640      3. TS-4.3: Determine how inadvertent and intentional disclosures of sensitive information
641         recorded in logs must be handled.
642      4. TS-4.4: Determine how the protection of log access should or must be monitored and
643         validated to ensure that only authorized parties can access the appropriate logs.

644             TS-5, Define Target State for Log Disposal
645   [Tasks]                                                              [Previous Play] [Next Play]
646   Summary: Define your organization’s log disposal-related requirements and goals. The desired
647   outcome is a comprehensive set of prioritized requirements and goals for cybersecurity log
648   disposal that help define your organization’s target state.
649   Tasks to perform include the following (not necessarily in order):
650      1. TS-5.1: Identify the disposal-related policy requirements for each type of log event at the
651         log source level. Determine how and when each type of log event should or must be
652         disposed of.
653      2. TS-5.2: Identify the disposal-related policy requirements for each type of log event at the
654         log infrastructure level. Determine how and when each type of log event should or must
655         be disposed of.
