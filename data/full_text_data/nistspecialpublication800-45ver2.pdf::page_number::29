Many free and commercial products that use the OpenPGP standard are currently available. The software
can be downloaded or purchased from a variety of Web sites. 15 Some OpenPGP-based products fully
support the cryptographic algorithms recommended to the Federal government by NIST in FIPS PUB
140-2 and other publications, including 3DES and AES for data encryption, Digital Signature Algorithm
(DSA) 16 and RSA for digital signatures, and SHA for hashing. 17 Some implementations of OpenPGP
support other encryption schemes not addressed here.

Although certain aspects of OpenPGP do use public key cryptography, such as digitally signed message
digests, the actual encryption of the message body is performed with a symmetric key algorithm, as
outlined earlier. The following is a brief description of signing and encrypting a message with OpenPGP
(some steps may occur in a different order):

 OpenPGP compresses the plaintext, which reduces transmission time and strengthens cryptographic
  security by obfuscating plaintext patterns commonly searched for during cryptanalysis.
 OpenPGP creates a random session key (in some implementations of OpenPGP, users are required to
  move their mouse at will within a window to generate random data).
 A digital signature is generated for the message using the sender’s private key, and then added to the
  message.
 The message and signature are encrypted using the session key and a symmetric algorithm (e.g.,
  3DES, AES).
 The session key is encrypted using the recipient’s public key and added to the beginning of the
  encrypted message.
 The encrypted message is sent to the recipient.
The recipient reverses the steps to recover the session key, decrypt the message, and verify the signature.
Popular mail clients such as Mozilla Thunderbird, Apple Mail, Eudora, and Microsoft Outlook require the
installation of plug-ins to enable the user to send and receive OpenPGP-encrypted messages. The
OpenPGP distribution sites listed earlier in this section contain instructions on how to use OpenPGP with
various mail client applications.

There are also security gateway servers available that can use OpenPGP to encrypt, decrypt, sign, and
verify signatures on email messages on behalf of users. If two organizations exchanging emails both use
compatible security gateway servers, then the use of OpenPGP is essentially transparent to users. If only
one organization has such a gateway, it can still be used to protect messages, but it is not a transparent
process at all to users at other organizations. If a gateway user sends an email to a recipient at another
organization, that recipient will actually receive a notification email from the gateway that explains how
to retrieve the protected email, typically through an SSL-encrypted HTTP session. Some gateways can
also perform these functions for emails sent to lists of users. For example, a single user could send an
encrypted and signed email to a mailing list address. The gateway would decrypt the email and re-
