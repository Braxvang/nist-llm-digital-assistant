SP 800-89                                                                   November 2006



intended for other purposes as well. The message shall be signed using the private key
for which the assurance is to be provided, thus producing the assurance signature. The
signatory should generate and provide the assurance signature immediately after the
trusted timestamp, nonce, and/or other data included in the assurance message are made
available. See Appendix A for an example of an assurance message that is instantiated
using a certificate request message.
6.3.1.2    Assigning the assurance_time for an Assurance Signature
Following the successful verification of an assurance signature, the assignment of a value
to assurance_time is affected by the form of the assurance message and the
trustworthiness of the sources for the times t1 and t2 that bracket the actual time (tG) at
which the assurance signature was generated (see Section 6.2 and Figure 2.)
As defined in Section 6.2, t1 is a time that either precedes or is equal to the time that the
assurance signature was generated. There may be several possibilities for t1, including
one or more of the following:
   •      If the assurance message includes a timestamp from a TTA (trusted by the relying
          parties), the timestamp_time in that timestamp is a candidate for t1.
   •      If the assurance message includes a verifier-supplied time (for example, as a
          timestamp component of a verifier-supplied nonce), that time is a candidate for t1.
   •      If the assurance message includes a verifier-supplied nonce, and the verifier has
          recorded the time that the nonce was first made available to the claimed signatory,
          the recorded time is a candidate for t1.
The candidate time whose source is considered most trustworthy by the relying parties
should be used as t1. To choose between equally trustworthy candidates, preference
should be given to the latest time that is included in the assurance message.
As defined in Section 6.2, t2 is a time that either follows or is equal to the time that the
assurance signature was generated. There may be multiple possibilities for t2, including
one or more of the following:
   •      If the assurance signature is included as part of the timestamped_data in a TST
          obtained from a TTA (trusted by the relying parties), the timestamp_time in that
          timestamp is a candidate for t2.
   •      If the verifier has recorded the time that the assurance signature was received, the
          recorded time of receipt is a candidate for t2.
   •      If the verifier has recorded the time that the assurance signature was verified, the
          recorded verification time is a candidate for t2.
The candidate whose source is considered most trustworthy by the relying parties should
be used as t2. To choose between equally trustworthy candidates, preference should be
given to the earliest time.
Assuming that the assurance signature has been successfully verified, and that an
acceptable degree of accuracy (d) has been selected by the relying parties, the estimated
assurance_time (tA) shall be determined as follows:

                                              20
