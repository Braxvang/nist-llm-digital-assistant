SP 800-89                                                                  November 2006



imply that the owner actually knows the (correct) key; therefore, assurance shall be
obtained that a key pair owner is actually in possession of the correct private key.
A digital signature key pair may be:
   1. Generated and maintained in such a way that the private key is known only by its
      owner,
   2. Generated by an owner with the assistance of a TTP in such a way that the private
      key is known only by its owner,
   3. Generated by a TTP and provided to the owner,
   4. Generated using method 1, and provided to a TTP, who may act as a key server.
   5. Generated using method 2, and provided to a (possibly different) TTP, who may
      act as a key server.
Methods 4 and 5 are distinct from the case of a TTP (e.g., a CA) that is provided only
with the public key.
In the latter three methods, the trusted party knows the private key and must be relied
upon not to use that key to generate digital signatures. This trust must be shared by the
owner of the key pair, potential signature verifiers, and any other parties relying on the
validity of the owner’s signatures. The relying parties must, in effect, be willing to ignore
the fact that the trusted party knows the private key, so that any entity that can
demonstrate knowledge of the private key is assumed to be its owner. Therefore, methods
3, 4 and 5 are less desirable than methods 1 and 2, where, by design, only the owner
knows the private key.
Assurance of the owner’s possession of the (correct) private key is required by:
   •   The key pair owner. Assurance shall be obtained prior to or concurrently with the
       generation of a digital signature.
   •   A verifier. Assurance shall be obtained prior to accepting a verified digital
       signature as valid. The verifier shall obtain assurance of the identity of the party
       claiming to be the signatory prior to or concurrently with obtaining assurance that
       the claimed signatory possesses the private key.
   •   A TTP who will be required to provide assurance to others of the owner’s
       possession of the private key. The TTP shall obtain assurance of the owner’s
       identity prior to or concurrently with obtaining assurance that the owner possesses
       the private key. In the case of a certification authority (CA), the CA shall have
       both assurance of the (intended) owner’s identity and assurance of the (intended)
       owner’s possession of the private key prior to issuing a digital signature certificate
       containing the public key corresponding to that private key.
   •   A TTP that provides a key pair to the owner. In this case, the TTP shall obtain
       assurance of the owner’s identity prior to providing the key pair to the owner and
       shall subsequently obtain assurance that the owner actually possesses the correct
       private key.
