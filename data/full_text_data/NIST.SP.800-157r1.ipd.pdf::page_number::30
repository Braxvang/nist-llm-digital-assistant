      NIST SP 800-157r1 ipd                           Derived PIV Credentials (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


821   Security Object
822      The security object SHALL be present in the derived PIV application if the discovery
823      object, the key history object, or the optional pairing code reference data container
824      is present. The requirements for the security object are as described in Sec. 3.1.7 of
825      [SP800-73] Part 1, except for the following:
826         • The security object for a derived PIV application is signed using a private key
827           whose corresponding public key is contained in a PIV content signing certificate
828           that satisfies the requirements for certificates used to verify signatures on
829           cardholder unique identifiers (CHUID), as specified in Sec. 4.2.1 of [FIPS201].
830         • The signature field of the Security Object, tag 0xBB, SHALL include the derived
831           PIV credential issuer’s certificate.
832         • All unsigned data objects (i.e., the discovery object, the key history object, and
833           the pairing code reference data container) within the derived PIV application
834            SHALL be included in the security object.


835   Secure Messaging Certificate Signer
836      Derived PIV credential applications that support the virtual contact interface (VCI)
837      capability SHALL include the secure messaging certificate signer object described in
838      Sec. 3.3.7 of [SP800-73] Part 1.

839   Pairing Code Reference Data Container
840      Derived PIV credential applications that support the virtual contact interface (VCI)
841      using a pairing code SHALL include the pairing code reference data container
842      described in Sec. 3.3.8 of [SP800-73] Part 1.
