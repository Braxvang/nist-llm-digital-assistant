                                                                GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6




                              Figure 5-1. Example of IPv6 Privacy Addressing

As an example of privacy addressing, Figure 5-1 shows an Ethernet interface with a /24 non-routable
IPv4 address, a /64 globally routable IPv6 address generated with privacy addressing, a second /64
globally routable IPv6 address based on its IEEE address, and link local IPv6 address based on its IEEE
address.

For several reasons, this privacy extension mechanism should be used with care, if it is used at all:

 How much privacy is actually provided is questionable. Particularly on small networks that do not
  change much, anyone who can observe network traffic can also correlate activity fairly accurately
  regardless of whether or not addresses change periodically. An observer may even be able to
  determine how often each interface is generating such new addresses.
 On some networks, administrators may want to have better control of what is connected and
  correspondingly, which addresses are used. Local security policy may dictate that for audit or
  forensic purposes, all addresses must be centrally assigned and logged. In such cases, it is better not
  to allow either privacy addresses or stateless address autoconfiguration but to require using DHCPv6
  for address assignments.
 In general, enterprise security policy does not extend the right of private communications to a user
  who is on an enterprise computer or accessing an enterprise network. In these cases, the goals of
  forensics and security may be viewed as more crucial than the goal of protecting a user’s privacy
  while using the Internet. This is a policy decision that should be left up to the individual department
  or agency.
 Good networking practice is to apply ingress filtering, that is, not allow packets without valid source
  addresses into the core of the network. Some distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks have used
  forged source addresses with valid prefixes. Privacy addresses may be difficult to distinguish from
  addresses used in these attacks without additional measures such as rate limiting or complete reverse
  path checking.
