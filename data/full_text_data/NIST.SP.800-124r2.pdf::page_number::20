compromise the device [25]. An example exploitation is using vulnerabilities in the voice
assistance or quick access features to bypass the lock screen and gain unauthorized access to a
mobile device.

3.1.2. Device Loss and Theft
Mobile devices are used in a variety of locations outside of an organization’s control, such as
employee dwellings, coffee shops, hotels, and taxis. Some organizations have strict rules for
mobile devices that state that they are only allowed to be used within an organization’s
perimeters. Yet many organizations have multiple sites, so mobile devices are transported from
building to building. The portability of mobile devices makes them more likely to be lost or
stolen than traditional desktop systems, and the sensitive data on these devices adds an increased
risk of compromise to the organization.

3.1.3. Exploitation of Supply Chain Vulnerabilities
Within the supply chain or the process of development and distribution of devices, there is the
potential for the insertion of malicious hardware or malware. Mobile devices may contain
malicious functionality and be vulnerable due to threats to the supply chain. These supply chain
threats can include an adversary intercepting the hardware/firmware of mobile devices while the
devices are in transit between a supplier and acquirer, or an adversary inserting malicious code
into open-source code that is commonly used for mobile applications. The vulnerabilities that
arise due to supply chain threats could be exploited and cause major issues when several devices
within an organization are impacted. The vulnerabilities could include backdoors that provide an
attacker with remote root access to the device.

3.1.4. Accessing Enterprise Resources Via a Misconfigured Device
Similar to most other information systems, mobile devices can be misconfigured. The mobile OS
contains many security- and privacy-relevant configuration options, such as the use of a
passcode, user tracking, VPNs, or other practices that allow for a secure connection to enterprise
resources. Unfortunately, not all security- and privacy-relevant settings are located within the
security options area of the mobile OS interface. Apps installed on the device can also be
configured, sometimes within the administrative area of the device but also within the app itself.
Relevant configurations include authentication to the app, tracking users, and the proper use of
encryption. Connecting an improperly configured device to an enterprise resource, such as an
enterprise file share, could expose information to entities monitoring the network or improperly
accessing the device directly.
