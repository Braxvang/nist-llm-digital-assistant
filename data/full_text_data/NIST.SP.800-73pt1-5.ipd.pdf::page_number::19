      NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1
      September 2023                                 PIV Card Application Namespace, Data Model, and Representation

454                o Specify a digestAlgorithm in accordance with [SP800-78]
455                o Include, at a minimum, the following signed attributes:
456                            A MessageDigest attribute containing the hash computed in accordance
457                             with [SP800-78]
458                            A pivSigner-DN attribute containing the subject name that appears in the
459                             PKI certificate for the entity that signed the CHUID
460                o Include the digital signature
461   The public key required to verify the digital signature SHALL be provided in the certificates
462   field of the CMS external digital signature in a content signing certificate, which SHALL be
463   issued under the id-fpki-common-pivcontentSigning policy of [COMMON]. The content signing
464   certificate SHALL also include an extended key usage (extKeyUsage) extension asserting id-
465   PIV-contentsigning. The content signing certificate SHALL NOT expire before the expiration of
466   the card authentication certificate.

467   3.1.3. X.509 Certificate for PIV Authentication
468   The X.509 Certificate for PIV Authentication and its associated private key, as defined in FIPS
469   201, is used to authenticate the card and the cardholder. The PIV Authentication private key and
470   its corresponding certificate are only available over the contact interface or virtual contact
471   interface (VCI). The read access control rule for the X.509 Certificate for PIV Authentication is
472   “Always,” meaning that the certificate CAN be read without access control restrictions. The
473   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) cryptographic function (see Table 5) is protected with a
474   Personal Identification Number (PIN) or on-card biometric comparison (OCC) access rule. In
475   other words, private key operations using the PIV Authentication key require the PIN or OCC
476   data to be submitted and verified, but a successful submission enables multiple private key
477   operations without additional cardholder consent.

478   3.1.4. X.509 Certificate for Card Authentication
479   FIPS 201 specifies the mandatory asymmetric Card Authentication key (CAK) as a private key
480   that MAY be used to support physical access applications. The read access control rule of the
481   corresponding X.509 Certificate for Card Authentication is “Always,” meaning that the
482   certificate CAN be read without access control restrictions. The PKI cryptographic function (see
483   Table 5) is under an “Always” access rule so private key operations CAN performed without
484   access control restrictions. The asymmetric CAK is generated by the PIV Card Issuer in
485   accordance with FIPS 140-2 requirements for key generation. An asymmetric CAK MAY be
486   generated on-card or off-card. If an asymmetric CAK is generated off-card, the result of each key
487   generation SHALL be injected into at most one PIV Card.

488   3.1.5. Cardholder Fingerprints
489   The fingerprint data object specifies the primary and secondary fingerprints for off-card
490   matching in accordance with FIPS 201 and [SP800-76].
