familiarize contingency personnel with the facility and available resources and to evaluate the siteâ€™s
capabilities to support contingency operations.

(3) The organization employs automated mechanisms to more thoroughly and effectively
test/exercise the contingency plan by providing more complete coverage of contingency issues,
selecting more realistic test/exercise scenarios and environments, and more effectively stressing the
information system and supported missions.

CP-6 ALTERNATE STORAGE SITE

Control: The organization establishes an alternate storage site including necessary agreements to permit
the storage and recovery of information system backup information.

Supplemental Guidance: Related controls: CP-2, CP-9, MP-4.

Control Enhancements:

(1) The organization identifies an alternate storage site that is geographically separated from the
primary storage site so as not to be susceptible to the same hazards.

(2) The organization configures the alternate storage site to facilitate recovery operations in
accordance with recovery time and recovery point objectives.

(3) The organization identifies potential accessibility problems to the alternate storage site in the
event of an area-wide disruption or disaster and outlines explicit mitigation actions.

        Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Explicit mitigation actions include, for example,
        duplicating backup information at another alternate storage site if access to the first alternate site
        is hindered; or, if electronic accessibility to the alternate site is disrupted, planning for physical
        access to retrieve backup information.
