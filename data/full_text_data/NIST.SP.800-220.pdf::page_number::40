Collaborators and researchers are an important force behind NISTâ€™s cybersecurity and privacy
programs. NIST depends on developers, providers, and everyday users of cybersecurity and
privacy technologies and information to guide priorities in serving the public and private sectors.
These stakeholders are also vital when it comes to decisions about the best methods and formats
for delivering information and services.
NIST engages in the public and private sectors in many ways, both formal and informal. NIST
participates in various forums, communities of interest (COI), joint research efforts, standards
development organizations, student programs, and other partnership opportunities that are
available; hosts/sponsors various cybersecurity and privacy events; and gathers public feedback
on NIST publications, blogs, and social media.

Guest Researcher Opportunities at NIST
Many NIST projects are supported by guest researchers, both foreign and domestic. The Domestic
Guest Researcher (DGR) Program provides access for technically qualified U.S. citizens to NIST
facilities and equipment while working with the NIST staff on projects of mutual interest. The
Foreign Guest Researcher Program offers scientists from around the world the opportunity to work
collaboratively with NIST scientists. Guest researcher support generally comes from sponsoring
companies or organizations, including the home organizations of the researchers.
The Pathways Program offers clear paths to federal internships for students from high school
through post-graduate school and to careers for recent graduates, as well as meaningful training
and career development opportunities for individuals who are at the beginning of their federal
service.
