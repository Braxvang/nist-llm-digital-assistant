timeframe. As part of continuous monitoring, 22 a number of NIST SP 800-53 security controls must also
be constantly tested. 23

Assessment frequency is often driven by an organization’s requirements to demonstrate compliance with
specific regulations or policies. For example, FISMA requires periodic testing depending on risk, to be
done at least annually. NIST SPs 800-53 and 800-53A provide organizations with recommendations
regarding the frequency of conducting security assessments. Since an assessment provides a snapshot of
security at a given point in time, organizations may choose to require more frequent assessments.

Important technical considerations can also help determine testing frequency. For example, if a system is
believed to have several weaknesses, testing might be conducted sooner to confirm the presence of the
weaknesses—or delayed until the weaknesses have been mitigated, to confirm they have been resolved.
The timing used depends on the testing objective. Another consideration is whether any system or
network activities required by the testing may impact the functionality or security of the environment—
for example, if a major upgrade is about to be conducted, testing might be delayed until the upgrade has
been completed. Another example of a technical consideration is when an organization wants to identify
rogue devices on wired networks. This could be accomplished using one or more techniques, such as
performing network discovery through passive sniffing or active scanning, or reviewing data collected by
network management software, network intrusion detection sensors, or other devices that routinely
monitor network activity. If these monitoring devices are able to generate alerts as soon as a new,
potentially rogue device is observed on the network, there may be little or no need to perform periodic
testing for rogue devices because effective testing is continuously being performed.

Organizations also need to carefully consider resource availability. Resources should first be identified
for high-priority systems, after which lower-priority systems may be tested with less frequency and in
descending order. If a gap exists between required and available resources, the organization may need to
allocate additional resources and consider reducing the scope of its planned assessments. Examples of
scoping elements that may be relevant include:

      The size of what is being assessed, in terms of number of components (e.g., single database, all
       user systems, or entire architecture) and network size (e.g., Local Area Network [LAN] or Wide
       Area Network [WAN], number of network locations that a tester will need to physically plug into
       for testing).
      The complexity of what is being assessed. More heterogeneous environments generally require
       larger amounts of resources because more diverse skill sets and tools are needed.
      The feasibility of using a sample for assessment, along with the sample size and its makeup. For
       example, it may be much more efficient—and nearly as effective—to port scan a small sample of
       hosts rather than thousands of hosts, especially if the hosts are managed and similarly configured.
      The level of resources needed to conduct specific testing or examination techniques. For
       example, it could take many hours for a skilled assessor to review a system’s complete security
       documentation.

     Continuous monitoring activities include configuration management and control of information system components, security
     impact analyses of changes to the system, ongoing assessment of security controls, and status reporting. NIST SP 800-53
