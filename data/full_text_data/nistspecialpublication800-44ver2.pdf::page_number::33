Virtualization allows organizations to reduce costs by running multiple Web servers on a single host
computer and by providing a mechanism for quickly responding to attacks against a Web server. The list
below defines the three main types of virtual machine technology. Note that some virtualization software
may be a hybrid implementation, depending on the hardware and guest OSs.

 Full virtualization, which simulates all of the hardware required by the guest OS. Full virtualization
  is useful in situations where the guest OS runs on a different machine architecture than the host. Full
  virtualization results in a significant performance hit because all commands must be emulated by
  software.

 Native virtualization, which simulates only the hardware necessary to run an unmodified guest OS.
  In native virtualization, most commands can be passed unmodified to the host computer processing
  unit (CPU), which reduces the performance hit.

 Paravirtualization, which does not simulate hardware. Instead, it offers an application programming
  interface (API) that can be used by a modified guest OS, or it takes advantage of virtualization
  capabilities supported by the processor.

Virtualization adds another layer of complexity to the Web server setup. Both the host OS and guest OS
need to be secured. If the virtualization technology supports it, a copy of each guest OS and installed
Web server application should be backed up to allow restoration if an attack or other disruption occurs.
The Web server and its guest OS, the host OS, and the virtualization software should all be patched in a
timely manner. It is important to note that if the guest OS or applications become compromised, the guest
virtual machine can infect other hosts on the network as if it were a standalone physical host. Each guest
OS and associated Web server software should be configured and maintained following the
recommendations in this publication.

                             Plan the configuration and deployment of the Web server
                             Identify functions of the Web server
                             Identify categories of information that will be stored, processed, and
                             transmitted through the Web server
                             Identify security requirements of information
                             Identify how information is published to the Web server
                             Identify the security requirements of other hosts involved (e.g., backend
                             database or Web service)
                             Identify a dedicated host to run the Web server
                             Identify network services that will be provided or supported by the Web
                             server
                             Identify the security requirements of any additional services provided or
                             supported by the Web server
                             Identify how the Web server will be managed
                             Identify users and categories of users of the Web server and determine
                             privilege for each category of user
                             Identify user authentication methods for the Web server and how
                             authentication data will be protected
                             Identify how access to information resources will be enforced
