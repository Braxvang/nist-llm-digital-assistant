1240   3.1.1. The Importance of the Analysis Phase
1241   There are many reasons why the analysis phase is rushed or skipped entirely. For example,
1242   organizations may think it will take too much time, personnel may be unavailable, or the
1243   necessary funding may be lacking. Most often, organizations believe they already know what
1244   they need. However, critical problems can arise by skipping the analysis phase, such as:
1245      •   Wasted spending when learning materials are developed that do not meet the required
1246          knowledge or skill gaps
1247      •   Misunderstanding the knowledge and skills gaps of the employee participants, which may
1248          require personnel, technology, or other resources to remedy
1249      •   Using training to solve an issue that is not a knowledge or skill gap. For example, an
1250          employee is unable to perform “additional as assigned” duties. Conducting an analysis
1251          will help to determine if it is a systematic or structural gap instead of a learning gap.
1252      •   Providing the right personnel with the wrong information, such as giving privileged users
1253          only basic training rather than information specific to their additional rights
1254      •   Providing the wrong personnel with the right information, such as giving privileged user
1255          training to general users
1256      •   Providing the right information through an ineffective medium or providing the wrong
1257          information through a flashy medium
1258      •   Repeating the same learning material even if previous efforts have failed
1259   It may be tempting or even overwhelming to think about setting aside time to analyze the
1260   organization’s needs. Even if the only option is to conduct an informal discussion and review
1261   with a few individuals, it is still important to have the conversation and document what is
1262   needed. The analysis phase establishes a clear vision for the next steps of the Learning Program’s
1263   development.

1264   3.1.2. The Steps of the Analysis Phase
1265   While there are many ways that a Learning Program Manager can evaluate the learning needs of
1266   the organization, the process for identifying Learning Program needs from a strategic point of
1267   view tends to be a repeatable process, regardless of the specific learning goal or audience. The
1268   steps are:
1269      1. Identify the learning needs
1270      2. Determine the learning audience
1271      3. Identify the knowledge or skills relevant to the goals per audience
1272      4. Assess the audience’s current knowledge or skill level
1273      5. Identify knowledge or skill gaps
1274   Using a specific example, such as implementing multi-factor authentication, the Learning
1275   Program Manager can develop an awareness program for all users in the organization so that
1276   they understand their roles in the program. All users will be expected to adopt multi-factor
