NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                           Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                  Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


another purpose requires a security strength of 256 bits, then the DRBG needs to be instantiated
to support the 256-bit security strength.

8.5 DRBG Mechanism Boundaries

As a convenience, this Recommendation uses the notion of a “DRBG mechanism boundary” to
explain the operations of a DRBG mechanism and its interaction with and relation to other
processes; a DRBG mechanism boundary contains all DRBG mechanism functions and internal
states required for a DRBG. Data enters a DRBG mechanism boundary via the DRBG’s public
interfaces, which are made available to consuming applications.
The DRBG mechanism boundary should not be confused with a cryptographic module
boundary, as specified in [FIPS 140]; the relationship between a cryptographic module
boundary and a DRBG boundary is mentioned below, but is more fully discussed in [SP
800-90C].
Within a DRBG mechanism boundary,
   1. The DRBG internal state and the operation of the DRBG mechanism functions shall only
      be affected according to the DRBG mechanism specification.
   2. The DRBG internal state shall exist solely within the DRBG mechanism boundary. The
      internal state shall not be accessible by non-DRBG functions or other instantiations of
      that DRBG or other DRBGs.
   3. Information about secret parts of the DRBG internal state and intermediate values in
      computations involving these secret parts shall not affect any information that leaves the
      DRBG mechanism boundary, except as specified for the DRBG pseudorandom bit
      outputs.
Each DRBG mechanism includes one or more cryptographic primitives (i.e., a hash function or
block cipher algorithm). Other applications may use the same cryptographic primitive, but the
DRBG’s internal state and the DRBG mechanism functions shall not be affected by these other
applications. For example, a DRBG mechanism may use the same hash-function code as a
digital-signature application.
A DRBG mechanism’s functions may be contained within a single device, or may be distributed
across multiple devices (see Figures 3 and 4). Figure 3 depicts a DRBG for which all functions
are contained within the same device. As further discussed in [SP 800-90C], the DRBG
mechanism boundary (in this case) is contained within a cryptographic module boundary.
