                                                    CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



Table summarizes the criteria that can be employed to determine which type of alternate site meets the
organization’s requirements. Sites should be analyzed further by the organization, including
considerations given to business impacts and downtime defined in the BIA. As sites are evaluated, the
ISCP Coordinator should ensure that the system’s security, management, operational, and technical
controls are compatible with the prospective site. Such controls may include firewalls, physical access
controls, and personnel security requirements of the staff supporting the site.

                                    Table 3-34: Sample Alternate Site Criteria

                                    Hardware
    Site              Cost                         Telecommunications        Setup Time       Location
                                    Equipment
Cold Site        Low               None            None                      Long            Fixed
Warm Site        Medium            Partial         Partial/Full              Medium          Fixed
Hot Site         Medium/High       Full            Full                      Short           Fixed

Alternate sites may be owned and operated by the organization (internal recovery), or commercial sites
may be available under contract. If contracting for the site with a commercial vendor, adequate testing
time, work space, security requirements, hardware requirements, telecommunications requirements,
support services, and recovery days (how long the organization can occupy the space during the recovery
period) must be negotiated and clearly stated in the contract. Customers should be aware that multiple
organizations may contract with a vendor for the same alternate site; as a result, the site may be unable to
accommodate all of the customers if a disaster affects enough of those customers simultaneously. The
vendor’s policy on how this situation should be addressed and how priority status is determined should be
negotiated.

Two or more organizations with similar or identical system configurations and backup technologies may
enter into a formal agreement to serve as alternate sites for each other or enter into a joint contract for an
alternate site. This type of site is set up via a reciprocal agreement or memorandum of understanding
(MOU). A reciprocal agreement should be entered into carefully because each site must be able to
support the other, in addition to its own workload, in the event of a disaster. This type of agreement
requires the recovery sequence for the systems from both organizations to be prioritized from a joint
perspective, favorable to both parties. Testing should be conducted at the partnering sites to evaluate the
extra processing thresholds, compatible system and backup configurations, sufficient telecommunications
connections, compatible security measures, and the sensitivity of data that might be accessible by other
privileged users, in addition to functionality of the recovery strategy. Consideration should also be given
to system interconnections and possible interconnection security agreements (ISAs). NIST SP 800-47,
Security Guide for Interconnecting Information Technology Systems, provides guidance for planning,
establishing, maintaining, and terminating interconnections between information systems that are owned
and operated by different organizations.

An MOU or an SLA for an alternate site should be developed specific to the organization’s needs and the
partner organization’s capabilities. The legal department of each party must review and approve the
agreement. In general, the agreement should address at a minimum, each of the following elements:

          Contract/agreement duration;
          Cost/fee structure for disaster declaration and occupancy (daily usage), administration,
           maintenance, testing, annual cost/fee increases, transportation support cost (receipt and return of
           offsite data/supplies, as applicable), cost/expense allocation (as applicable), and billing and
           payment schedules;
          Disaster declaration (i.e., circumstances constituting a disaster, notification procedures);
