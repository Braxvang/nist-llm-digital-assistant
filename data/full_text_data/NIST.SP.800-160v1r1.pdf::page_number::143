DE-3     EVALUTE THE SYSTEM DESIGN
         DE-3.1 Analyze each system design alternative against criteria developed from expected
                trustworthy secure design properties and characteristics.
         DE-3.2 Assess each system design alternative for how well it meets stakeholder protection
                needs and the security aspects of the system requirements.
         Note: Assessment includes assessing configuration and procedures to ensure security
         mechanism behavior specified by system-level policy and enforced by configuration and
         procedures (Appendix C.3).
         DE-3.3 Combine the security analyses and assessments in the overall evaluation to select a
                preferred design solution.

DE-4     MANAGE THE RESULTS OF DESIGN DEFINITION
         DE-4.1 Obtain agreement on the security aspects of the design.
         DE-4.2 Map the trustworthy secure design characteristics to the system elements.
         DE-4.3 Record the trustworthy secure design decisions and the rationale.
         DE-4.4 Maintain traceability of the security aspects of the system design.
         Note: Traceability is maintained between the trustworthy secure design characteristics and the
         security architectural entities, system element requirements, interface definitions, analysis
         results, and verification and validation methods or techniques.
         DE-4.5 Provide the security-relevant artifacts that have been selected for baselines.
