NORMATIVE NOTES:
1. The 0x0005 value indicates one of two definitions for reporting locations of minutiae defined in the ISO standard.
This one requires that the endings of ridges be reported at the point of the valley bifurcation (versus at the ridge tip
itself). These are the semantics required by INCITS 378:2004. The on-card comparison templates might reasonably be
produced from the parent INCITS 378 templates.
2. Which fingers are present is encoded using integers from Table 8. The finger position codes differ in the
fingerprint vs. smart-card standards. For on-card comparison data, ISO/IEC 19785-3:2007 finger position codes shall be
used (column B). For the PIV mandatory off-card comparison templates, [MINUSTD] finger positions shall be used
(column A). Card issuance processes shall transcode using the mapping of Table 8.

PIV readers involved in on-card and off-card authentication attempts shall heed Table 8 to correctly prompt users for
which finger to present.
Note that the penultimate (i.e., FDIS) draft of ISO/IEC 19785-3:2007 erroneously set bit six to 1. The final standard and
the PIV specification require that bits 6, 7 and 8 shall be 0.

5.5.2      Minutiae data for on-card comparison
This Section defines the data to be used for on-card comparison implementations. It is included here because ISO/IEC
                                                                     13
19794-2:2011 [CARD-MIN] and its antecedents defined multiple variants .
On-card comparison data in PIV shall conform to the ISO/IEC 19794-2:2011, Clause 9 compact on-card comparison
format [CARD-MIN]. This format encodes the x and y coordinates, minutia type, and minutia angle of each minutia
point in 3 bytes. This format also allows encoding of cores, deltas and ridge counts. Two cases exist:
―    Data stored on-card (i.e., enrollment data): Neither this document nor [800-73] regulate what data must be
     stored on card; instead this specification only requires that the authentication instruction of [800-73, Part 2] shall
     be operable. Thus a card might validly be populated with minutiae, cores, and ancillary proprietary data.
―    Data sent to card during operations (for comparison): This minutia data shall be included in the APDU specified
     in [800-73, Part 2] and shall consist of exactly 3N bytes from N minutia as specified in [CARD-MIN]. No leading
     tagged header information is necessary. Extended and proprietary data shall not be sent to the card.
The BITs of Section 5.5.1 shall parameterize the production of templates that a reader, or other system, sends to the
PIV Card – see Section 5.6.2. This applies to both the reference templates stored on the card, and those produced
during, for example, an authentication transaction.

  Particularly the ISO/IEC 19794-2:2005 standard includes three encodings (record, card-normal, card-compact), has versions with
 and without headers, has variants differing in their minutia placement semantics, has presence of standardized extended data
 (zonal quality etc.) and of non-standard, proprietary, extended data.
