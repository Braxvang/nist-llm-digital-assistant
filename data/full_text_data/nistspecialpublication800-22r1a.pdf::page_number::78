A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



For a given sequence sn = (ε1, …,εn), its linear complexity L(sn) is defined as the length of the shortest
LFSR that generates sn as its first n terms. The possibility of using the linear complexity characteristic for
testing randomness is based on the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm, which provides an efficient way to
evaluate finite strings.

When the binary n-sequence sn is truly random, formulas exist [2] for the mean, µn = EL(sn), and the
                    ( ( )) of the linear complexity L(s ) = L when the n-sequence s is truly random.

The Crypt-X package [1] suggests that the ratio ( Ln − µn ) /σ n is close to a standard normal variable, so
that the corresponding P-values can be found from the normal error function. Indeed, Gustafson et al. [1]
(p. 693) claim that “for large n, L(sn) is approximately normally distributed with mean n/2 and a variance

the mean value µn does not behave asymptotically precisely as n/2, and in view of the boundedness of the
variance, this difference becomes significant. More importantly, the tail probabilities of the limiting
distribution are much larger than those of the standard normal distribution.
                                      €
The asymptotic distribution of ( Ln − µn ) /σ n along the sequence of even or odd values of n is that of a
discrete random variable obtained via a mixture of two geometric random variables (one of them taking
only negative values). Strictly speaking, the asymptotic distribution as such does not exist. The cases n
even and n odd must be treated separately with two different limiting distributions arising.
