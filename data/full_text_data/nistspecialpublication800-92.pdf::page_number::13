The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency
Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental

guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2   Purpose and Scope

This publication seeks to assist organizations in understanding the need for sound computer security log
management. It provides practical, real-world guidance on developing, implementing, and maintaining
effective log management practices throughout an enterprise. The guidance in this publication covers
several topics, including establishing log management infrastructures, and developing and performing
robust log management processes throughout an organization. The publication presents log management
technologies from a high-level viewpoint, and it is not a step-by-step guide to implementing or using log
management technologies.

1.3   Audience

This publication has been created for computer security staff and program managers; system, network,
and application administrators; computer security incident response teams; and others who are responsible
for performing duties related to computer security log management.

1.4   Publication Structure

The remainder of this publication is organized into four major sections. Section 2 provides an
introduction to computer security log management, including an explanation of log management needs an
organization might have and the challenges involved in log management. Section 3 discusses the
components, architectures, and functions of log management infrastructures. Section 4 provides
recommendations for planning log management, such as defining roles and responsibilities and creating
feasible logging policies. Section 5 explains the processes that an organization should develop and
perform for log management operations.

The publication also contains several appendices with supporting material. Appendices A and B contain a
glossary and acronym list, respectively. Appendix C lists tools and online and print resources that are
