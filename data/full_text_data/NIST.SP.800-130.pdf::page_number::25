3.4.1 Accommodate User Ability and Preferences
Ease-of-use is very subjective. Something easy or obvious for one person may not be
easy or obvious for another. Designers should keep in mind that users are not usually
security experts, so they may not understand the purpose of the security feature that they
are using. Since security is not usually the primary purpose of the product, transparent
security is desirable. Negative experiences will likely affect the acceptance and use of a
product. Therefore, a large segment of the potential user population needs to be satisfied
that a security product is easy to use.

FR:3.10 The CKMS design shall specify all user interfaces to the system.

FR:3.11 The CKMS design shall specify the results of any user-acceptance tests that
have been performed regarding the ease of using the proposed user interfaces.

3.4.2 Design Principles of the User Interface
While ease-of-use may be highly subjective and difficult to evaluate, several design
principles for achieving this goal have been established. Ease-of-use design goals should
assure that:
    a) It is intuitive and easy to do the right thing using the CKMS. For example, key
        management function calls should be intuitively named.
    b) It is difficult to do the wrong thing using the system. For example, the CKMS
        should not permit encryption using a signature-only key.
    c) It is intuitive and easy to recover when a wrong thing is done. For example, the
        CKMS should provide an undo function that reverses the previous function.

This approach reduces the total lifecycle cost by reducing user support costs.

FR:3.12 The CKMS design shall specify the design principles of the user interface.

FR:3.13 The CKMS design shall specify all human error-prevention or failsafe features
designed into the system.

3.5 Performance and Scalability
Performance improvements in computing and communications are major success stories
in the computer industry. As performance improves, new applications require that even
faster processing and communications be available. In the past, large key-distribution
centers often serviced a maximum of several thousand security subscribers. Now,
millions of people use the Internet regularly with ever-increasing demands, including new
demands for security and for cryptographic keys. The need for secure processing, data
storage and communications will continue to grow. This growth will require a CKMS to
be scalable in order to meet the growing workload.

FR:3.14 The CKMS design shall specify the performance characteristics of the CKMS,
including the average and peak workloads that can be handled for the types of functions
