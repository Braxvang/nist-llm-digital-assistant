250   Call for Patent Claims

251   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims
252   whose use would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this
253   Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or
254   requirements may be directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another
255   publication. This call also includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending
256   U.S. or foreign patent applications relating to this ITL draft publication and of any
257   relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.
258   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its
259   behalf, in written or electronic form, either:
260      a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not
261         hold and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
262     b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available
263        to applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the
264        guidance or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:
265            i. under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
266               discrimination; or
267           ii. without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
268               demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.
269   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make
270   assurances on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents
271   subject to the assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the
272   assurance are binding on the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include
273   appropriate provisions in the event of future transfers with the goal of binding each
274   successor-in-interest.
275   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
276   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.
277   Such statements should be addressed to: mailto:dig-comments@nist.gov.
