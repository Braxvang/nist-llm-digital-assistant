NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

3.3.5. Establish a Cybersecurity Awareness Training Program for the OT
       Environment
Organizations should ensure that all personnel who interact with OT systems – including
employees, contractors, consultants, and vendors – receive cybersecurity training that is relevant
to the OT environment in addition to general IT cybersecurity awareness training. This training
is used to inform personnel of basic cybersecurity principles, teach them about their potential
impacts on security and safety, and outline the steps that they need to follow when interacting
with OT systems. Cybersecurity awareness training should be required for new employees at the
time of hire and at regular intervals, as dictated by regulatory requirements and organizational
policies.
Further guidance for OT cybersecurity awareness training can be found in Section 6 and
Appendix D. Additional information with specific examples for OT cybersecurity awareness
training are also provided in NIST IR 8183A, Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile
Low Impact Level Example Implementations Guide [IR8183A].

3.3.6. Implement a Risk Management Framework for OT
OT system risk is another risk confronting an organization (e.g., financial, safety, environmental,
IT). In each case, managers responsible for the mission or business function establish and operate
a risk management program in coordination with senior management. NIST SP 800-39,
Managing Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and Information System View
[SP800-39], provides a framework for an enterprise-level risk management program, which is
also detailed in Section 4 of this document. OT personnel should be involved in developing the
OT cybersecurity risk management program and communicating with senior management.
NIST SP 800-37, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations: A
System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy [SP800-37r2], provides a structured
process for managing security and privacy risk. This includes preparing for organization-wide
risk management; system categorization; control selection, implementation, and assessment;
system and common control authorizations; and continuous monitoring.
Applying the Risk Management Framework (RMF) to OT systems is detailed in Section 4.

3.3.7. Develop a Maintenance Tracking Capability
Establish processes and implement tools to ensure that routine and preventative maintenance and
repairs (both local and remote) of OT assets are performed consistent with OT organizational
policies and procedures. The tools used for maintenance logging and tracking should be
controlled and managed. Ensure that the processes and tools allow for scheduling, authorizing,
tracking, monitoring, and auditing maintenance and repair activities for OT assets. If the ability
for remote maintenance is required, ensure that the remote access tool supports the authentication
of maintenance personnel, connection establishment at the beginning of maintenance activities,
and immediate teardown once the maintenance activities are performed. Also ensure that the tool
can log the remote maintenance activities that are performed.
