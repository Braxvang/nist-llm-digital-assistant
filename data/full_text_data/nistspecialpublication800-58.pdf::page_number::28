      or other endpoints are unavailable, but for now we will concentrate on the
      availability of the edges: the bandwidth of the VOIP system.

      As in data networks, bandwidth congestion can cause packet loss and a host of
      other QoS problems. Thus, proper bandwidth reservation and allocation is
      essential to VOIP quality. One of the great attractions of VOIP, data and voice
      sharing the same wires, is also a potential headache for implementers who must
      allocate the necessary bandwidth for both networks in a system normally designed
      for one. Congestion of the network causes packets to be queued, which in turn
      contributes to the latency of the VOIP system. Low bandwidth can also
      contribute to non-uniform delays (jitter), since packets will be delivered in spurts
      when a window of opportunity opens up in the traffic.

      Because of these issues, VOIP network infrastructures must provide the highest
      amount of bandwidth possible. On a LAN, this means having modern switches
      running at 100M bit/sec and other architectural upgrades that will alleviate
      bottlenecks within the LAN. Percy and Hommer [13] suggest that if network
      latencies are kept below 100 milliseconds, maximum jitter never more than 40
      milliseconds, then packet loss should not occur. With these properties assured,
      one can calculate the necessary bandwidth for a VOIP system on the LAN in a
      worst case scenario using statistics associated with the worst-case bandwidth
      congesting codec [13]. This is fine when dealing simply with calls across the
      LAN, but the use of a WAN complicates matters. Bandwidth usage varies
      significantly across a WAN, so a much more complex methodology is needed to
      estimate required bandwidth usage. Chuah [9] provides an analysis of the
      aggregate bandwidth needed in terms of the amount of traffic and its rate of flow.

      Methods for reducing the bandwidth usage of VOIP include RTP header
      compression and Voice Activity Detection (VAD). RTP compression condenses
      the media stream traffic so less bandwidth is used. However, an inefficient
      compression scheme can cause latency or voice degradation, causing an overall
      downturn in QoS. VAD prevents the transmission of empty voice packets (i.e.
      when a user is not speaking, their device does not simply send out white noise).
      However, by definition VAD will contribute to jitter in the system by causing
      irregular packet generation.

      The bandwidth requirements put forth by Chuah are designed for a basic VOIP
      system. Adding security constraints significantly increases the bandwidth usage,
      causing more latency and jitter, thereby degrading the overall QoS of the network.
      In addition, these requirements do not explicitly take into account the
      heterogeneous data flow over the network. Since voice and data streams are
      sharing the same finite bandwidth, and data streams tend to contain much larger
      packets than VOIP, significant amounts of data can congest the network and
      prevent voice traffic from reaching its destination in a timely fashion. For this
      reason, most new hardware devices deployed on networks support QoS for VOIP.
      These devices, such as routers and firewalls, make use of the IP protocolâ€™s Type
