6.4 VM Configuration Management

The configuration of every VM should be monitored and managed throughout its lifecycle. In most instances,
this is accomplished using dedicated third-party tools in addition to native features that come with the
hypervisor. The desired features for these tools are provided in the form of security recommendation below:

Security Recommendation HY-SR-17: VM configuration management tools should have the capability
to compile logs and alert administrators when configuration changes are detected in any VM that is
being monitored.

6.5 Fine-grained Administrative Privileges for VM Management

Having the ability to assign fine-grained administrative permissions for the virtualized infrastructure enables
the establishment of different administrative models and associated delegations. To see the need for granular
permissions, it would be helpful to look at some use-case scenarios for administrative operations in the
virtualized infrastructure:

     •   VM Administration Use Case 1: A quality assurance group wants to set up a few virtual machines
         with some definite profiles (resource quotas such as Memory, CPUs) to test some applications that
         may soon go into production. In this situation, it may be useful for one or more administrators
         assigned exclusively to the quality assurance group to be given administrative permissions on
         specific virtual machines set up for testing purposes.

     •   VM Administration Use Case 2: A capacity planner assigned the task of determining the operating
         loads on various virtualized servers and the need for additional virtualized hosts may need
         permission to view the list of virtual machines in each of the virtualized hosts but not permissions
         to perform any administrative operations on those VMs. In this situation, it is desirable to have the
         ability to grant view rights to the list of VMs in a virtualized host but deny the user the rights to
         interact with any of the visible objects.

     •   VM Administration Use Case 3: In virtualized data centers where VMs of different sensitivity
         levels are run on the same virtualized host, an administrator who is given administrative privileges
         at the hypervisor level should sometimes be prevented from accessing a specific VM because of
         the sensitive nature of the workload (i.e., set of applications) running on that VM. The desired
         capability in this scenario is to negate a permission, obtained through inheritance, for a specific
         child object.

     •   VM Administration Use Case 4: In some cases, assign permissions are needed for a group of
         administrators controlling a set of VMs for a particular organizational division or department. A
         corollary to this type of administrative entity is the need for a class of administrators wanting to
         administer VMs running a particular type of work load (e.g., web server), irrespective of its location
         within the organizational structure. This class of administrators may not require the entire set of
         administrative functions on a VM but rather some arbitrary set of management functions such as
         Configure CD Media, Configure Floppy Media, Console Interaction, Device Connection, Power
         On, Power Off, Reset, or Suspend. This scenario calls for the capability to create custom roles that
         can contain an arbitrary set of permissions relating to a VM as well as the ability to create a custom
         object that contains an arbitrary set of VMs carrying a particular type of workload (e.g., web server).

Summing up the capabilities required in all four administrative scenarios, the overall security recommendation
with required permission granularity is as follows:
