            Question                                                  Analysis
Does the WLAN solution need to      Organizations that want to use WLAN technology to provide connectivity to
support guest users?                business partners, customers, and guests need an RSN solution based on
                                    an EAP method for which there is nearly universal support across potential
                                    clients. This requirement effectively limits the selection of EAP methods to
                                    those that are supported natively by Microsoft Windows, given its widespread
                                    use. Microsoft Windows (XP or newer) supports PEAP and a native version
                                    of EAP-TLS. PEAP provides the best support for guest users because it
                                    does not require the presence of a client certificate. However, it does not
                                    eliminate the requirement to deploy the root certificate on the client. Also,
                                    the guest user’s PEAP must be compatible with the organizational server’s
                                    PEAP, and care should be taken that neither version contains known
                                    vulnerabilities. EAP-TTLS provides better support for guest users, since it
                                    does not require client certificates, does not have PEAP’s version
                                    incompatibilities, and EAP-TTLS/PAP can be used with any user
                                    authentication database.

                                    available, then the organization should obtain a server certificate from an

Does the organization deploy        If a smart card infrastructure is already in place, EAP-TLS generally offers

                                    native to recent versions of Microsoft Windows. Alternatively, the session
