      NIST SP 800-217 ipd                         Guidelines for PIV Federation (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


825   5.2.2. RP Subscriber Accounts
826   It is common practice for the RP to associate that login with a local account record, which
827   is defined as the RP subscriber account in [SP800-63C].
828   The RP subscriber account SHALL be uniquely associated with a single federated
829   identifier, as described in Sec. 6.2.1. The RP subscriber account SHALL NOT rely on
830   any other identifiers within the PIV data record (e.g., card UUID or email address) for
831   uniqueness or tracking a PIV identity account over time.
832   The presentation of two distinct federated identifiers to the same RP SHALL be treated as
833   two distinct PIV identity accounts from the perspective of that RP.
834   To minimize the amount of information sent to the RP, RPs SHOULD use just-in-time
835   provisioning for the RP subscriber account, as defined in [SP800-63C], when possible. To
836   avoid data duplication and synchronization issues, the RP SHOULD minimize the amount
837   of data stored in the RP subscriber account.
838   The RP SHALL NOT allow access to the RP account outside of the context of a verified
839   assertion from a trusted IdP. This includes local authentication with an authenticator
840   known to the RP.
841   Note that it is possible for an RP to associate the same set of authorizations and attributes
842   to two different RP subscriber accounts, depending on the needs of the RP. The means
843   and details of doing so are outside the scope of this specification.

844   5.2.3. Session Management
845   The RP SHALL create a secure session with the subscriber upon successfully processing
846   the assertion from the IdP. The RP SHALL NOT tie the session lifetime to the lifetime of
847   the assertion. In common practice, the session lifetime at the RP is expected to outlive the
848   validity window of the assertion.
849   The RP SHALL follow all session management requirements for RPs defined in
850   [SP800-63C].

851   5.2.4. Changing the Federated Identiﬁer
852   To facilitate recovery of an account when a federated PIV identity account can no longer
853   be used, an RP MAY change the federated identifier bound to an RP subscriber account
854   in limited circumstances to be recorded in the trust agreement:
855       • A change of PIV IdP for the issuing agency of a PIV identity account
856       • A change of configuration that alters the subject identifier or issuer identifier
857         portion of the federated identifier for a PIV identity account
