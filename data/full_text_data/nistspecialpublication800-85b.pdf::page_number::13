Special Publication 800-85B                                PIV Data Model Testing Specification


2.3     Test Set-up
The test system consists of the following components:

A test toolkit application software that resides on a personal computer.
An ISO7816 and Personal Computer / Smart Card (PC/SC) compliant contact-based smart card
reader.
A mechanism to input PIN that can be transmitted to the smart card reader. Examples of such
mechanisms are a PIN pad or a keyboard.
A set of test personalized PIV cards whose applications and interfaces are compliant with
SP80073. All personalized biometric information is assumed to be collected and processed by
template generation and matching implementations that have been tested against minimum
performance qualification criteria established by NIST, OMB, and by Federal agencies, as
appropriate.

2.4     Test Areas
The test assertions in this document will validate that all PIV data objects conform to their
respective requirements. Conformance criteria includes correct formatting and, when
appropriate, context specific content. Additionally, conformance will be based on correct
computation of content such as digital signatures. The DTRs and test assertions are designed to
validate each PIV data object such that the following three statements are true for the objects:

PIV containers are formatted correctly,
Field values are in accordance with the specifications, and
Data consistency and value computations such as signatures are accurate.
Again, these requirements are not designed to test business processes or to verify external
compliance with applicable standards. For further clarification of the document scope, refer to
Section 1.2, Purpose and Scope.


2.4.1    BER-TLV Format Conformance
The tags and lengths in various data objects shall conform to specifications in Appendix A of
SP80073.


2.4.2    Digital Signature Blocks Conformance
For all signed objects the fields in the signature block shall conform to the CMS syntax specified
in FIPS201.
