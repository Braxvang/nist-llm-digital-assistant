                                                                  GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6




The next eight bits in a multicast address specify the flags and scope. The final 112 bits in the multicast
address are called the Group ID and are used to specify the set of nodes that are members of a multicast
group. In a previous version, the Group ID was only 32 bits, and some implementations still stick to 32
bits.

In the IPv6 specification, multicast addresses always have a scope that limits the set of receiving nodes.
The scope is the group of nodes for which the packet is intended relative to its source. Its values are
shown in Table 4-1.

                          Table 4-1. IPv6 Scoped Multicast Values (from RFC 4291)

                            Value                           Scope
                              1                        Interface Local
                              2                            Link Local
                              4                        Admin. Local
                              5                            Site Local
                              8                      Organization Local
                              E                             Global


Some well-known multicast Group IDs are defined for variable scopes. A good example is the ―All NTP
[Network Time Protocol] Servers‖ address:

        FF02::101        All NTP Servers          Link Local
        FF04::101        All NTP Servers          Admin Local
        FF05::101        All NTP Servers          Site Local
        FF08::101        All NTP Servers          Organization Local
        FF0E::101        All NTP Servers          Global

RFC 2375 contains a list of well-known IPv6 multicast addresses categorized by scope, and that list has
been extended by newer specifications. The complete and current version is at
http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv6-multicast-addresses.

The flags specify, first, whether a multicast address is a well-known, pre-defined address, or whether it is
a transient address not permanently defined. Second, the flags specify whether a transient multicast
address has an authorized and properly scoped unicast prefix embedded in it, and, if so, whether it also
specifies a rendezvous point (RFC 3956). The unicast prefix eliminates the need for an additional
protocol to allocate unique multicast addresses.

A rendezvous point for a multicast group is the root of a tree used with Protocol Independent Multicast—
Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) (RFC 4601), a sophisticated multicast routing protocol. PIM-SM builds a tree of
senders and group members. Then, traffic from senders is first routed upstream towards the rendezvous
point and then downstream to group members (receivers).

For well-known multicast addresses, the four flag bits are always all zeros. The first flag bit is reserved
and must be 0. The remaining three flag bits are called R, P, and T (for rendezvous, prefix, and transient)
and are non-zero for transient multicast addresses:
