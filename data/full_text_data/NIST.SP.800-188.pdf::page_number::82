be combined with additional privacy protections. For example, query interfaces should
incorporate privacy mechanisms, such as adding noise to results with differential privacy,
and log both queries and query results in order to deter and detect malicious use.
When formal privacy is desired, an advantage of synthetic data is that the privacy loss
budget can be spent on creating the synthetic dataset rather than on responding to interactive
queries. This approach can also result in consistent query results for all users of the query
interface.

4.6.     Validating a De-Identifed Dataset
Agencies should validate datasets after they are de-identifed to ensure that the resulting
dataset meets the agency’s goals in terms of both data usefulness and privacy protection.

4.6.1.    Validating Data Usefulness
De-identifcation can decrease the usefulness of the resulting dataset. It is, therefore, im-
portant to ensure that the de-identifed dataset is still useful for the intended application.
Otherwise, there is no reason to go through the expense of de-identifcation and added risk
of releasing the de-identifed data.
There are several approaches to validating data usefulness. For example, insiders can
perform statistical calculations on both the original dataset and the de-identifed dataset
and compare the results to see if the de-identifcation resulted in unacceptable changes.
Agencies can engage trusted outsiders to examine the de-identifed dataset and determine
whether the data could be used for the intended purpose.
Recognizing that there is an inherent trade-off between data accuracy and privacy protec-
tion, agencies can adopt accuracy goals for the data that they make available to a broad
audience. An accuracy goal specifes how accurate the data must be in order to be ft for an
intended use. Limiting data accuracy to this goal is an important technique for protecting
the privacy of data subjects.

4.6.2.    Validating Privacy Protection
There are several approaches to validating the privacy protection provided by de-identifcation,
including:
    • Examining the resulting data fles to make sure that no identifying information is
      unintentionally included in fle data or metadata.
    • Examining the resulting data fles to make sure that the data satisfy k-anonymity, if
      such a standard is desired.

 budget nears exhaustion. This can result in equity issues if the frst users to query the dataset obtain better
 answers than later users.
