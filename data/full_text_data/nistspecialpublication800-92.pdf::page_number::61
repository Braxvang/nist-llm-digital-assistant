Appendix A—Glossary

Selected terms used in the Guide to Computer Security Log Management are defined below.

Aggregation: See “Event Aggregation”.

Computer Security Log Management: Log management for computer security log data only.

Correlation: See “Event Correlation”.

Event: Something that occurs within a system or network.

Event Aggregation: The consolidation of similar log entries into a single entry containing a count of the
number of occurrences of the event.

Event Correlation: Finding relationships between two or more log entries.

Event Filtering: The suppression of log entries from analysis, reporting, or long-term storage because
their characteristics indicate that they are unlikely to contain information of interest.

Event Reduction: Removing unneeded data fields from all log entries to create a new log that is smaller.

Facility: The message type for a syslog message.

Log: A record of the events occurring within an organization’s systems and networks.

Log Analysis: Studying log entries to identify events of interest or suppress log entries for insignificant
events.

Log Archival: Retaining logs for an extended period of time, typically on removable media, a storage
area network (SAN), or a specialized log archival appliance or server.

Log Clearing: Removing all entries from a log that precede a certain date and time.

Log Compression: Storing a log file in a way that reduces the amount of storage space needed for the
file without altering the meaning of its contents.

Log Conversion: Parsing a log in one format and storing its entries in a second format.

Log Entry: An individual record within a log.

Log File Integrity Checking: Comparing the current message digest for a log file to the original
message digest to determine if the log file has been modified.

Log Management: The process for generating, transmitting, storing, analyzing, and disposing of log
data.

Log Management Infrastructure: The hardware, software, networks, and media used to generate,
transmit, store, analyze, and dispose of log data.

Log Normalization: Converting each log data field to a particular data representation and categorizing it
consistently.
