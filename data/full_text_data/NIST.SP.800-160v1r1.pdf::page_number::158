NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                 Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

       OP-1.7 Assign the trained and qualified personnel needed for secure system operation.

OP-2   PERFORM OPERATION
       OP-2.1 Securely use the system in its intended operational environment.
       OP-2.2 Apply materials and other resources as required to securely operate the system and
              sustain its product and service capabilities.
       Note 1: Materials and resources are provided by logistical actions. Logistics is discussed as part
       of the maintenance process.
       Note 2: Operational personnel may perform system modification and support activities, such as
       software updates.
       OP-2.3 Monitor system operations for deviations from intended behavior and outcomes.
       Note: This includes (1) managing adherence to the operation strategy and operational
       procedures (the operations conducted by personnel), (2) monitoring that the system is operated
       in a secure manner and compliant with regulations, procedures, and directives, and (3)
       monitoring for anomalies that may not be directly observable as system behavior and may or
       may not be obviously security relevant.
       OP-2.4 Use the measures defined in the strategy and analyze them to confirm that system
              security performance is within acceptable parameters.
       Note: System monitoring includes reviewing whether the performance is within established
       security-relevant thresholds (loss margins), periodic instrument readings are acceptable, and
       service and response times are acceptable. Operator feedback and suggestions are useful input
       for improving the security aspects of system operational performance.
       OP-2.5 Identify and record when system security or service performance is not within
              acceptable parameters.

OP-3   MANAGE RESULTS OF OPERATION
       OP-3.1 Record the results of secure operations and any anomalies encountered.
       Note: Anomalies include those associated with the operation strategy, the operation of enabling
       systems, the execution of the operation, and incorrect system definition, all of which may be
       due to security issues or may result in security issues.
       OP-3.2 Record the security aspects of operational incidents and problems, and track their
              resolution.
       OP-3.3 Maintain traceability of the security aspects of the operation elements.
       OP-3.4 Provide the security-relevant artifacts that have been selected for baselines.

OP-4   SUPPORT STAKEHOLDERS
       OP-4.1 Provide security assistance and consultation to stakeholders as requested.
