                                                                                             For the first determination, an organization acknowledges the lack of a device cybersecurity
                                                                                             requirement but accepts the deficiency. In some instances, the goal of the security control and the

                                                                                             the security control as will other elements of the system. Alternatively, the organization may

                                                                                             documented by organizations.

                                                                                             The second and third determinations involve the use of an alternative capability and/or security
                                                                                             control than originally intended by the organization. The second determination is the simpler of
                                                                                             the two since it does not require a change in security control but rather a different capability to

                                                                                             to verify a person’s identity that is of a different, but acceptable, modality than the mechanism
                                                                                             the organization typically uses (e.g., the IoT device uses derived PIV credentials rather than PIV
                                                                                             cards to authenticate a person’s identity). The organization may determine that the IoT device’s
                                                                                             alternate modality will satisfy the security control even though it initially appeared as a gap in
                                                                                             requirements.

                                                                                             The third determination involves the organization selecting a compensating security control for
                                                                                             the information system. This compensating security control better matches the capability(ies)

                                                                                             However, selecting a compensating security control may not be possible for a variety of reasons.
                                                                                             The compensating security control may be too costly to implement in the system or may not
