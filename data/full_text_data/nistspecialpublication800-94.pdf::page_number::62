GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



5.4.2    Operation and Maintenance

The operation and maintenance of a wireless IDPS solution is nearly identical to that of a network-based
IDPS solution. Wireless IDPS consoles offer similar management, monitoring, analysis, and reporting
capabilities. One significant difference is that wireless IDPS consoles can display the physical location of
threats. A minor difference is that because wireless IDPS sensors detect a relatively small variety of
events, compared to other types of IDPSs, they tend to have signature updates less frequently.

5.5     Summary

A wireless IDPS monitors wireless network traffic and analyzes its wireless networking protocols to
identify suspicious activity. The typical components in a wireless IDPS are the same as a network-based
IDPS: consoles, database servers (optional), management servers, and sensors. However, unlike a
network-based IDPS sensor, which can see all packets on the networks it monitors, a wireless IDPS
sensor works by sampling traffic because it can only monitor a single channel at a time. The longer a
single channel is monitored, the more likely it is that the sensor will miss malicious activity occurring on
other channels. To avoid this, sensors typically change channels frequently, so that they can monitor each
channel a few times per second.

Wireless sensors are available in multiple forms. A dedicated sensor is a fixed or mobile device that
performs wireless IDPS functions but does not pass network traffic from source to destination. The other
wireless sensor forms are bundled with access points (AP) or wireless switches. Because dedicated
sensors can focus on detection and do not need to carry wireless traffic, they typically offer stronger
detection capabilities than wireless sensors bundled with access points or wireless switches. However,
dedicated sensors are often more expensive to acquire, install, and maintain than bundled sensors because
bundled sensors can be installed on existing hardware, whereas dedicated sensors involve additional
hardware and software. Organizations should consider both security and cost when selecting wireless
IDPS sensors.

Wireless IDPS components are typically connected to each other through a wired network. Because there
should already be a strictly controlled separation between the wireless and wired networks, using either a
management network or a standard network should be acceptable for wireless IDPS components.
Choosing sensor locations for a wireless IDPS deployment is a fundamentally different problem than
choosing locations for any other type of IDPS sensor. If the organization uses wireless local area
networks (WLAN), wireless sensors should be deployed so that they monitor the range of the WLANs.
Many organizations also want to deploy sensors to monitor parts of their facilities where there should be
no WLAN activity, as well as channels and bands that the organizationâ€™s WLANs should not use. Other
considerations for selecting sensor locations include physical security, sensor range, wired network
connection availability, cost, and AP and wireless switch locations.

Wireless IDPSs provide several types of security capabilities. Most can collect information on observed
wireless devices and WLANs and perform extensive logging of event data. Wireless IDPSs can detect
attacks, misconfigurations, and policy violations at the WLAN protocol level. Organizations should use
wireless IDPS products that use a combination of detection techniques to achieve broader and more
accurate detection. Examples of events detected by wireless IDPSs are unauthorized WLANs and WLAN
devices, poorly secured WLAN devices, unusual usage patterns, the use of active wireless network
scanners, denial of service attacks, and impersonation and man-in-the-middle attacks. Most wireless
IDPS sensors can also identify the physical location of a detected threat by using triangulation.

Compared to other forms of IDPS, wireless IDPS is generally more accurate; this is largely due to its
limited scope (analyzing wireless networking protocols). Wireless IDPSs usually require some tuning
