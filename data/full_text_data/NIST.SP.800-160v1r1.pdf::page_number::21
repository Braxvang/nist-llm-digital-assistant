       How to Use this Publication
This publication is intended to serve as a reference and educational resource for systems
engineers, engineering specialties, architects, designers, and any individuals involved in the
development of trustworthy secure systems and system components. It is meant to be flexible in
its application to meet the diverse needs of organizations. There is no expectation that all of the
technical content in this publication will be used as part of a systems engineering effort. Rather,
the concepts and principles for trustworthy secure design in Appendices D through F as well as
the systems life cycle processes and security-relevant activities and tasks in Appendices G
through K can be selectively employed by organizations – relying on the experience and
expertise of the engineering teams to determine what is correct for their purposes. Applying the
content of this publication enables the achievement of security outcomes that are consistent with
the systems engineering perspective on system life cycle processes.

The system life cycle processes described in this publication can take advantage of any system or
software development methodology. The processes are equally applicable to waterfall, spiral,
DevOps, agile, and other approaches. The processes can be applied recursively, iteratively,
concurrently, sequentially, or in parallel and to any system regardless of its size, complexity,
purpose, scope, operational environment, or special nature. The full extent of the application of
the content in this publication is guided by stakeholder capability needs, protection needs, and
concerns with particular attention paid to considerations of cost, schedule, and performance.

       Organization of this Publication
The remainder of this publication is organized as follows:
•   Chapter 2 presents an overview of systems engineering and the fundamental concepts
    associated with engineering trustworthy secure systems. This includes basic concepts that
    address the structure and types of systems, systems engineering foundations, and the
    concepts of trust and trustworthiness of systems and system components.
•   Chapter 3 describes foundational system security concepts and an engineering perspective to
    building trustworthy secure systems. This includes the concepts of security and system
    security, the nature and character of systems, the concepts of assets and asset loss, reasoning
    about asset loss, defining protection needs, system security viewpoints, demonstrating system
    security, and an introduction to systems security engineering.
•   Chapter 4 provides a systems security engineering framework that includes a problem
    context, solution context, and trustworthiness context.

The following sections provide additional information to support the engineering of trustworthy
secure systems:

•   Appendix A: Glossary
•   Appendix B: Acronyms
•   Appendix C: Security Policy and Requirements
