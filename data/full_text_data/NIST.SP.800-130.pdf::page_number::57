FR: 6.63 The CKMS design shall specify how, where, and the circumstances under
which, public key domain parameters are validated.

6.4.22 Validate Public Key
This function performs certain validity checks on a public key to provide some assurance
that it is arithmetically correct. These tests typically depend on the public key algorithm
for which the key is intended, but do not depend on knowledge of the private key (see
[SP 800-89], [SP 800-56A], and [SP 800-56B]). Note that Sections 6.4.22, 6.4.23, and
6.4.28 are related to providing an overall trust scenario for the validation of these keys.

FR: 6.64 The CKMS design shall specify how, where, and the circumstances under
which, public keys are validated.

6.4.23 Validate Public Key Certification Path
This function validates the certification path (also known as a certificate chain), from the
trust anchor of the relying entity to a public key in which the relying entity needs to
establish trust (i.e., the public key of the other entity in a transaction). The validation of
the certification path provides assurance that the subject identity that is given in the
certificate is, in fact, the identity of the owner of the static public key and the holder of
the corresponding static private key (assuming that proof of private key possession was
verified by the certificate authority or some other entity trusted by the relying entity).

FR: 6.65 The CKMS design shall specify how, where, and the circumstances under
which, a key certification path are validated.

6.4.24 Validate Symmetric Key
This function performs tests on the symmetric key and its metadata. For example, tests
may include checking for the proper length and format of the key. This command may
also verify any error detection/correction codes or integrity checks placed upon the key
and/or its metadata.

FR: 6.66 The CKMS design shall specify how, where, and the circumstances under
which, symmetric keys and/or metadata are validated.

6.4.25 Validate Private Key (or Key Pair)
This function performs certain tests on a private key to provide assurance that it meets its
specifications. The test can only be performed by the private-key owner or by a trusted
third-party acting on behalf of the private-key owner. This test may also involve a pair-
wise consistency test that verifies that the private key performs a complementary function
to the public key. For example, in the case of an RSA key pair, applying the private key
to a given input block, followed by applying the public key to the result should always
yield the given input block (see Section 6.4.1 of [SP 800-56B] for more information).
