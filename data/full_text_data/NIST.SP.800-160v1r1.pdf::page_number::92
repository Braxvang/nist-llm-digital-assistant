     -     Example: Procedures and training address the proper use of the system function of
           interest, the use of mediated access functions, and the relevant warnings, cautions, and
           warning systems.


                                                   ON USING SECURITY CONTROLS
                Common practice in some communities is to select and overlay systems with
                security controls (i.e., management, operational, and technical safeguards or
                countermeasures) as a primary means to address security concerns [67] [68]. But
                as observed in [69], “Poor systems security engineering is very difficult to mitigate
                by overlaying security controls, whereas security controls overlaid on a sound,
                secure design can be quite effective.”
                The Security Design Order of Precedence, as part of a systems engineering practice,
                helps to ensure a proper integration of technical controls and operational controls.




D.4.       Functional Design Considerations
This section describes the functional design considerations for trustworthy secure systems. These
considerations include (1) assured functions that provide control enforcement, control decision,
and control infrastructure; (2) design criteria for mechanisms; (3) security function failure
analysis; (4) situational awareness; and (5) trade space considerations.

D.4.1. Roles for Security-Relevant Control
All functions have the potential to influence behaviors and outcomes beyond themselves and are
relevant to security. 70 However, some functions have dedicated security purposes (e.g., functions
that support audit capabilities). Examples include the protection control functions.

Protection control functions enforce or contribute to the control of or otherwise directly influence
system or system element behaviors and outcomes. These functions may be characterized and
evaluated by using the following designations:
•    Protection Control Decision Functions: These functions make authorization decisions or take
     other actions for protection control enforcement functions. For example, a function that
     decides to grant or deny access to a resource based on a request (e.g., from a protection
     control enforcement function).
•    Protection Control Enforcement Functions: These functions enforce a constraint to ensure
     that the system or system element exhibits only authorized and intended behaviors or



70
   Historically, the term security relevance has been used in secure system design and evaluation to differentiate the role of system functions that
either singularly or in combination exhibit a behavior, produce an outcome, or provide a capability to enforce authorized and intended system
behaviors or outcomes. However, from the security perspective (Section 3.8) and the possibility of loss due to weaknesses and defects in any
system function, all functions have loss-related concerns and, thus, protection concerns.
