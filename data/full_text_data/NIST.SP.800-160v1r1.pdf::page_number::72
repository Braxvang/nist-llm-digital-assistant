outcome
Result of the performance (or non-performance) of a function or process(es). [84]

party
Organization entering into an agreement. [4]

penetration testing
Testing used in vulnerability analysis for vulnerability assessment, trying to reveal vulnerabilities of the system
based on the information about the system gathered during the relevant evaluation activities. [85]

problem
Difficulty, uncertainty, or otherwise realized and undesirable event, set of events, condition, or situation that
requires investigation and corrective action. [4]

process
Set of interrelated or interacting activities that use inputs to deliver an intended result. [78]

process purpose
High-level objective of performing the process and the likely outcomes of effective implementation of the process.
[4]
         Note: The purpose of implementing the process is to provide benefits to the stakeholders.

process outcome
Observable result of the successful achievement of the process purpose. [86]

product
Result of a process. [78]
         Note: There are four generic product categories: hardware (e.g., engine mechanical part); software (e.g.,
         computer program); services (e.g., transport); and processed materials (e.g., lubricant). Hardware and
         processed materials are generally tangible products, while software or services are generally intangible.

project
Endeavor with defined start and finish criteria undertaken to create a product or service in accordance with specified
resources and requirements. [4]
         Note: A project is sometimes viewed as a unique process comprising co-coordinated and controlled
         activities and composed of activities from the Technical Management and Technical Processes defined in
         this document.

protection needs
Informal statement or expression of the stakeholder security requirements focused on protecting information,
systems, and services associated with mission and business functions throughout the system life cycle.
         Note: Requirements elicitation and security analyses transform the protection needs into a formalized
         statement of stakeholder security requirements that are managed as part of the validated stakeholder
         requirements baseline.

qualification
Process of demonstrating whether an entity is capable of fulfilling specified requirements. [86]

quality assurance
Part of quality management focused on providing confidence that quality requirements will be fulfilled. [78]

quality characteristic
Inherent characteristic of a product, process, or system related to a requirement. [78]
         Note: Critical quality characteristics commonly include those related to health, safety, security, assurance,
         reliability, availability, and supportability.
