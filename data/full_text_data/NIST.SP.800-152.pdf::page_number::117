FR:10.3 The CKMS design shall specify the communications and computation
redundancy present in the design and required to be available during operation in order to
assure continued operation of services commensurate with the anticipated needs of users,
enterprises, and CKMS applications.

                 CP-11       available that can be activated as needed.

10.4 FCKMS Hardware Failure

Since an FCKMS is critical for the secure operation of the information-management
system that it supports, it is desirable to minimize the impact of hardware failures of
FCKMS components and devices. Replacement parts should be available for critical
devices, or complete system redundancy should be available to obtain assurance that the
operational impact of a hardware failure is minimal, i.e., limited to reduced performance
and response time. Some backup systems maintain real-time synchronization with the
primary system. Such systems are capable of immediately taking over the responsibilities
of the primary system. Other systems synchronize periodically and have a catch-up
procedure to bring the backup system up to the state that the primary system had just
before the failure occurred.

It is essential that backup systems have as much independence from the primary system
as possible so that a failure to the primary system does not also result in the same failure
to the backup. Multiple backup systems could be used to provide error-detection
capabilities.

Redundant FCKMS devices can be used to provide error-detection and correction
capabilities. Two FCKMS devices performing the same services can detect discrepancies
in the results of a key-management function; three systems, all performing the same
function, can detect a failure in one system and correct a single failure using the results of
the other two devices, assuming that the results are the same. Since redundancy
multiplies the cost of providing key-management services, FCKMS service-providing
organizations should attempt to find an optimum trade-off between redundancy and cost.
