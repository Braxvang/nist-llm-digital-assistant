       INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING MATRIX                           ~ Cell 3.6E
 Training Area: System Life Cycle Security           — Termination
 Functional Specialty: Review & Evaluate

 Definition    —      The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an FT system
                      from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                      model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                      Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                      ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                      needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                      The termination phase comprises the series of steps taken to retire a system
                      when it is no longer needed and to securely and properly archive or dispose
                      of its assets.

 Behavioral Outcome       —   Individuals responsible for review and evaluation are able to verify
                              the appropriateness of the termination plan and processes used to
                              terminate the IT system securely.
