In FY 2021, the NIST Smart Grid Program published guidance documents and a mapping tool for
improving cybersecurity in power systems. The fourth revision of NIST’s Smart Grid Interoperability
Framework described complementary approaches to ensuring cybersecurity: one based on
assessing and mitigating organizational risk by applying concepts from NIST’s Framework for
Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity to utility organizations and the second based
on examining the specific logical interfaces introduced through distributed energy resources to
characterize the cybersecurity requirements necessary to explore individual assets. This provided
guidance has become a foundation for cybersecurity training offered by the National Association
of Regulatory Utility Commissioners to government officials, as well as technical working groups
in industry organizations.
NIST also collaborated in the development of a mapping tool and an associated guidance document
that clarify the relationship between the cybersecurity outcomes and best practices described in
the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the latest version of the North American Electric Reliability
Corporation (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Standards. This mapping is critical to
the industry, as NERC CIP standards are the enforceable cybersecurity standards for the grid, and
the relationship between NERC CIP and NIST cybersecurity best practices is not always clear.
Network Security Research
This third topic area looks beyond the horizon of current and emerging networks to address
the security and resilience challenges of future networks by exploring potentially disruptive
technologies.
AI Applications to Network Security
In FY 2021, NIST’s Trustworthy Intelligent Networks project researched the application of AI
techniques to detect malicious botnet traffic in both data centers and the public internet. Botnets
and their ability to launch large-scale, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks remain a serious
threat to all forms of networked critical infrastructure. NIST developed deep learning techniques
to detect botnet command and control channels that exploit the domain name system (DNS).
NIST researched advanced state-of-the-art algorithms to detect botnet abuse through domain-
generation algorithms in the DNS.
Formal Verification of Security Protocols
The complexity and pace of innovation of new network security protocols in numerous realms
challenge industries’ ability to conduct careful reviews of their designs. To address that challenge,
NIST is exploring the use of formal methods to verify the security properties of protocol designs early
in their standardization process. NIST’s Trustworthy Internet of Things project is one such effort
that explores the application of formal methods to verify the security properties of emerging IoT
on-boarding technologies (see Figure 2). In FY 2021, NIST published research on the automated
formal verification of Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructures (BRSKI) protocol. Ongoing
efforts are exploring additional formal verification methods and their applications to an expanded
scope of emerging designs for IoT on-boarding protocols.
