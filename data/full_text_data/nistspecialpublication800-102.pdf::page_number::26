1. Entity B sends a newly generated Nonce to entity A.
2. Entity A generates SIGA(M, Nonce) and sends it (and possibly other information)
   to the TTA in a timestamp request, i.e., user_supplied_info = SIGA(M, Nonce),
   other_info. Note that other_info may be Null.

                                    A                             B
                                                  4. D = M, TSP

3. The TTA returns a TSP to entity A:
       TSP = timestamped_data, timestamp_signatureTTA
   where:
       user_supplied_info = SIGA(M, Nonce), other_info.
       timestamped_data = user_supplied_info, TTA_supplied_info, timestamp.
       timestamp_signatureTTA = SIGTTA(user_supplied_info, TTA_supplied_info,
          timestamp).
   If there is a mutual agreement between entity A and the TTA, the following
   information may be omitted from the TSP data transmitted by the TTA:
       •    Any portion of the user_supplied_info may be omitted, since it is known
            by entity A. However, if SIGA(M, Nonce) is omitted from the TSP, it must
            be inserted back into the TSP when sent to entity B (see step 4).
       •    Any portion of the TTA_supplied_info may be omitted if this information
            is already known or can be determined by entity A.
