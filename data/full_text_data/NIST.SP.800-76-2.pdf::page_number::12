―     PIV Card read times are replaced with network transmission times.
―     PIN entry times are eliminated but the something-you-know additional factor is lost.
―     The remote server is subject to physical or logical attack (e.g., a denial-of-service attack). Many kinds of
      templates stored on a server can be reversed to produce a matchable-sample [REVFING, REVIRIS, REVFACE].
      Formal template protection schemes, which mitigate the effect of compromise of a database, require further
      testing.
―     If the PIV Card is not used to make an explicit claim to one of the N enrolled identities, the biometric-only one-to-
      many authentication loses the something-you-have factor, and necessitates mitigation of a N-fold increase in false
      match rates.
―     Such use cases are not addressed by this specification.

1.6     Second generation standards
Since the first publication of SP 800-76 in 2005, considerable effort has been dedicated to the development of second-
generation biometric data interchange standards. These are the various parts of ISO/IEC 19794, as revised, and
updates to the analogous INCITS standards in c. 2009. These standards have not been adopted here as replacements
for the extant PIV biometric standards - INCITS 385:2004 (face), INCITS 381:2004 (fingerprint image), and INCITS
378:2004 (fingerprint minutiae) – because
―     they are not binary compatible with the earlier standards,
―     deployed infrastructure (readers) would need to be updated to support both the legacy and second generation
      standards, and
―     they confer essentially no performance advantages over the earlier standards.
For data elements that were not included in the 2005 PIV specifications, i.e., images to support iris recognition and
minutia data to support on-card comparison, this specification adopts the latest ISO/IEC 19794 Part 2 and Part 6
standards [CARD-MIN, IRISSTD].
