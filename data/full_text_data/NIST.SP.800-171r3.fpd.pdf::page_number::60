1652   3.12.2. Plan of Action and Milestones
1653             REQUIREMENT: 03.12.02
1654             a. Develop a plan of action and milestones for the system:
1655                 1. To document the planned remediation actions to correct weaknesses or deficiencies
1656                    noted during security assessments; and
1657                 2. To reduce or eliminate known system vulnerabilities.
1658             b. Update the existing plan of action and milestones periodically based on the findings from
1659                security assessments, independent audits or reviews, and continuous monitoring activities.

1660             DISCUSSION
1661             Plans of action and milestones (POAMs) are important documents in organizational security
1662             programs. Organizations use POAMs to describe how unsatisfied security requirements will be
1663             met and how planned mitigations will be implemented. Organizations can document system
1664             security plans and POAMs as separate or combined documents and in any format. Federal
1665             agencies may consider system security plans and POAMs as inputs to risk-based decisions on
1666             whether to process, store, or transmit CUI on a system hosted by a nonfederal organization.

1670   3.12.3. Continuous Monitoring
1671             REQUIREMENT: 03.12.03
1672             Develop and implement a system-level continuous monitoring strategy that includes ongoing
1673             monitoring and security assessments.

1674             DISCUSSION
1675             Continuous monitoring at the system level facilitates ongoing awareness of the system security
1676             posture to support risk management decisions. The terms continuous and ongoing imply that
1677             organizations assess and monitor their systems at a frequency that is sufficient to support risk-
1678             based decisions. Different types of security requirements may require different monitoring
1679             frequencies.
