     FOCUS AREA 2



       •   Participation in the Federal Acquisition Security Council (created as a requirement
           of the U.S. Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act of 2018). The council
           helps to develop policies and processes for agencies to use when purchasing
           technology products. It works closely with many federal entitities (such as the
           Department of Homeland Security’s National Risk Management Center) to
           support supply chain-related risks in acquisition of items such as: IT, including
           cloud computing services of all types; telecommunications equipment or
           telecommunications services; information processing; and IT hardware, systems,
           devices, software, or services that include embedded or incidental information
           technology.
       •   Development of a draft NISTIR 8276, Key Practices in Cyber Supply Chain Risk
           Management: Observations from Industry, to provide a high-level summary of
           practices deemed by subject matter experts to be foundational to an effective
           cyber supply chain risk management program [15]. This work builds on the
           Roadmap for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, a companion
           document to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Since NIST has researched
           industry practices in cyber supply chain risk management (C-SCRM) through
           engagement with industry leaders, the group was able to identify some helpful
           practices. The NISTIR is based on an analysis of interviews with companies over
           several years (leading to the development of 24 case studies), prior NIST research
           in cyber supply chain risk management, and several standards and industry best
           practices documents.
