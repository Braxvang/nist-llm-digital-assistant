NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                  HASH_DRBG                 Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                   Generation Using Deterministic RBGs

10.1.1.1     Hash_DRBG Internal State

The internal_state for Hash_DRBG consists of:
   1. The working_state:
       a. A value (V) of seedlen bits that is
          updated during each call to the
          DRBG.
       b. A constant (C) of seedlen bits that
          depends on the seed.
       c. A counter (reseed_counter) that
          indicates the number of requests for
          pseudorandom bits since new
          entropy_input was obtained during
          instantiation or reseeding.


   2. Administrative information:
       a. The security_strength of the DRBG
          instantiation.
       b. A prediction_resistance_flag that
          indicates whether or not a
          prediction resistance capability is
          available for the DRBG
          instantiation.
The values of V and C are the critical values of
the internal state upon which the security of
this DRBG mechanism depends (i.e., V and C
are the “secret values” of the internal state).
10.1.1.2 Instantiation of Hash_DRBG                            Figure 8: Hash_DRBG

Notes for the instantiate function specified in Section 9.1:
   The instantiation of Hash_DRBG requires a call to the Instantiate_function specified in
   Section 9.1. Process step 9 of that function calls the instantiate algorithm in this section.
   The values of highest_supported_security_strength and min_length are provided in Table 2
   of Section 10.1. The contents of the internal state are provided in Section 10.1.1.1.
The instantiate algorithm:
   Let Hash_df be the hash derivation function specified in Section 10.3.1 using the selected
   hash function. The output block length (outlen), seed length (seedlen) and appropriate
   security_strengths for the implemented hash function are provided in Table 2 of Section
   10.1.
