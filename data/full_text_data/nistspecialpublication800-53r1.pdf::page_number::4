Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1                Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________


                     Compliance with NIST Standards and Guidelines

NIST develops and issues standards, guidelines, and other publications to assist federal agencies
in implementing the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 and in
managing cost-effective programs to protect their information and information systems.
     •    Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are developed by NIST in accordance
          with FISMA. FIPS are approved by the Secretary of Commerce and are compulsory and
          binding for federal agencies. Since FISMA requires that federal agencies comply with
          these standards, agencies may not waive their use.
     •    Guidance documents and recommendations are issued in the NIST Special Publication
          (SP) 800-series. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policies (including OMB
          FISMA Reporting Instructions for the Federal Information Security Management Act and
          Agency Privacy Management) state that for other than national security programs and
          systems, agencies must follow NIST guidance. 1
     •    Other security-related publications, including interagency and internal reports (NISTIRs),
          and ITL Bulletins, provide technical and other information about NIST's activities.
          These publications are mandatory only when so specified by OMB.

                   Schedule for Compliance with NIST Standards and Guidelines
     •    For legacy information systems, agencies are expected to be in compliance with NIST
          security standards and guidelines within one year of the publication date unless otherwise
          directed by OMB or NIST. 2
     •    For information systems under development, agencies are expected to be in compliance
          with NIST security standards and guidelines immediately upon deployment of the
          system.




1
  While agencies are required to follow NIST guidance in accordance with OMB policy, there is flexibility within
NIST’s guidance in how agencies apply the guidance. Unless otherwise specified by OMB, the 800-series guidance
documents published by NIST generally allow agencies some latitude in their application. Consequently, the
application of NIST guidance by agencies can result in different security solutions that are equally acceptable,
compliant with the guidance, and meet the OMB definition of adequate security for federal information systems.
When assessing agency compliance with NIST guidance, auditors, evaluators, and/or assessors should consider the
intent of the security concepts and principles articulated within the particular guidance document and how the agency
applied the guidance in the context of its specific mission responsibilities, operational environments, and unique
organizational conditions.
2
 The one-year compliance date for revisions to NIST Special Publications applies only to the new and/or updated
material in the publications resulting from the periodic revision process. Agencies are expected to be in compliance
with previous versions of NIST Special Publications within one year of the publication date of the previous versions.
