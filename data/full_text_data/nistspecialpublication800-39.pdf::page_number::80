GOVERNANCE MODELS
APPROACHES TO INFORMATION SECURITY GOVERNANCE




T       hree approaches to information security governance can be used to meet organizational
        needs: (i) a centralized approach; (ii) a decentralized approach; or (iii) a hybrid approach.
        The authority, responsibility, and decision-making power related to information security
and risk management differ in each governance approach. The appropriate governance structure
for an organization varies based on many factors (e.g., mission/business needs; culture and size of
the organization; geographic distribution of organizational operations, assets, and individuals; and
risk tolerance). The information security governance structure is aligned with other governance
structures (e.g., information technology governance) to ensure compatibility with the established
management practices within the organization and to increase its overall effectiveness.

Centralized Governance
In centralized governance structures, the authority, responsibility, and decision-making power are
vested solely within central bodies. These centralized bodies establish the appropriate policies,
procedures, and processes for ensuring organization-wide involvement in the development and
implementation of risk management and information security strategies, risk, and information
security decisions, and the creation inter-organizational and intra-organizational communication
mechanisms. A centralized approach to governance requires strong, well-informed central
leadership and provides consistency throughout the organization. Centralized governance
structures also provide less autonomy for subordinate organizations that are part of the parent
organization.

Decentralized Governance
In decentralized information security governance structures, the authority, responsibility, and
decision-making power are vested in and delegated to individual subordinate organizations within
the parent organization (e.g., bureaus/components within an executive department of the federal
government or business units within a corporation). Subordinate organizations establish their own
policies, procedures, and processes for ensuring (sub) organization-wide involvement in the
development and implementation of risk management and information security strategies, risk
and information security decisions, and the creation of mechanisms to communicate within the
organization. A decentralized approach to information security governance accommodates
subordinate organizations with divergent mission/business needs and operating environments at
the cost of consistency throughout the organization as a whole. The effectiveness of this approach
is greatly increased by the sharing of risk-related information among subordinate organizations so
that no subordinate organization is able to transfer risk to another without the latterâ€™s informed
consent. It is also important to share risk-related information with parent organizations as the risk
decisions by subordinate organizations may have an effect on the organization as a whole.

Hybrid Governance
In hybrid information security governance structures, the authority, responsibility, and decision-
making power are distributed between a central body and individual subordinate organizations.
The central body establishes the policies, procedures, and processes for ensuring organization-
wide involvement in the portion of the risk management and information security strategies and
decisions affecting the entire organization (e.g., decisions related to shared infrastructure or
