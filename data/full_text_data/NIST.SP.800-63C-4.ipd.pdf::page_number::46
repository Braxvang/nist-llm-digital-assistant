       NIST SP 800-63C-4 ipd                                                    Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                                            Federation and Assertions


1215   6.     Assertions
1216   This section is normative.
1217   An assertion used for authentication is a packaged set of attribute values or derived
1218   attribute values about or associated with an authenticated subscriber that is passed
1219   from the IdP to the RP in a federated identity system. Assertions contain a variety of
1220   information, including: assertion metadata, attribute values and derived attribute values
1221   about the subscriber, information about the subscriber’s authentication at the IdP, and
1222   other information that the RP can leverage (e.g., restrictions and validity time window).
1223   While the assertion’s primary function is to authenticate the user to an RP, the information
1224   conveyed in the assertion can be used by the RP for a number of use cases — for example,
1225   authorization or personalization of a website. These guidelines do not restrict RP use
1226   cases nor the type of protocol or data payload used to federate an identity, provided the
1227   chosen solution meets all mandatory requirements contained herein.
1228   Assertions SHALL represent a discrete authentication event of the subscriber at the IdP
1229   and SHALL be processed as a discrete authentication event at the RP.
1230   All assertions SHALL include the following attributes:
1231        1. Subject identifier: An identifier for the party to which the assertion applies (i.e., the
1232           subscriber).
1233        2. Issuer identifier: An identifier for the issuer of the assertion (i.e., the IdP).
1234        3. Audience identifier: An identifier for the party intended to consume the assertion
1235           (i.e., the RP).
1236        4. Issuance time: A timestamp indicating when the IdP issued the assertion.
1237        5. Validity time window: A period of time outside of which the assertion SHALL NOT
1238           be accepted as valid by the RP for the purposes of authenticating the subscriber and
1239           starting an authenticated session at the RP. This is usually communicated by means
1240           of an expiration timestamp for the assertion in addition to the issuance timestamp.
1241        6. Assertion identifier: A value uniquely identifying this assertion, used to prevent
1242           attackers from replaying prior assertions.
1243        7. Signature: Digital signature or message authentication code (MAC), including key
1244           identifier or public key associated with the IdP, covering the entire assertion.
1245        8. Authentication time: A timestamp indicating when the IdP last verified the presence
1246           of the subscriber at the IdP through a primary authentication event (if available).
1247        9. IAL: Indicator of the IAL of the subscriber account being represented in the
1248           assertion, or an indication that no IAL is asserted.
1249    10. AAL: Indicator of the AAL used when the subscriber authenticated to the IdP, or an
1250        indication that no AAL is asserted.
