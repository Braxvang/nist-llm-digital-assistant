1068                                                 Table 10. Card Holder Unique Identifier

             Card Holder Unique Identifier                                        0x3000
                        Data Element (TLV)                            Tag                             Type                           Max. Bytes

            Issuer Asymmetric Signature                              0x3E        Variable                                          2816 18
            Error Detection Code                                     0xFE        LRC                                               0

1069   Note that the Buffer Length, Organizational Identifier, and DUNS data elements have been
1070   eliminated in this version of SP 800-73.
1071   The Error Detection Code is the same element as the Longitudinal Redundancy Code (LRC) in
1072   [TIG SCEPACS]. It is present in the CHUID because TIG SCEPACS makes the LRC
1073   mandatory. However, this document makes no use of the Error Detection Code, and therefore the
1074   length of the TLV value is set to 0 bytes (i.e., no value will be supplied).
1075                                          Table 11. X.509 Certificate for PIV Authentication

             X.509 Certificate for PIV Authentication                            0x0101

            Error Detection Code                                     0xFE        LRC                                              0

1076   Note that the MSCUID data element has been eliminated in this version.
1077                                                     Table 12. Cardholder fingerprints

                       Data Element (TLV)                            Tag                            Type                            Max. Bytes
            Fingerprint I & II                                      0xBC       Variable                                           4000 20

1078                                                          Table 13. Security Object

              Security Object                                                  0x9000
                       Data Element (TLV)                          Tag                             Type                           Max. Bytes
             Mapping of DG to ContainerID                         0xBA       Variable                                           30

          The values in the “Max. Bytes” columns denote the lengths of the value (V) fields of BER-TLV elements.
       19
          This is the recommended length. The certificate size can exceed the indicated length value.
       20
          This is the recommended length. The certificate that signed the Fingerprint I & II data element in the Cardholder Fingerprints data object can
       either be stored in the CHUID or in the Fingerprint I & II data element itself. For the latter, the “Max. Bytes” value quoted is a recommendation,
       and the signer certificate in CBEFF_SIGNATURE_BLOCK can exceed the “Max. Bytes.” Note that the use of separate content signing keys for
       biometric data and CHUID has been deprecated in FIPS 201-3. In future revisions, the CHUID and biometric elements will be signed with the
       same key. The content signing certificate will not be found in this data element but instead will be contained in the CHUID data element. Hence,
       the size will be as indicated in the table.
