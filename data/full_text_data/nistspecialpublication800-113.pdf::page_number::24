same time. If one device fails, the other device will service all connections if it has been properly sized to
do so. High availability allows the SSL VPN to survive the loss of a device or device component.

In either active/passive or active/active mode, one of the challenges of high availability is properly
propagating and sharing information between the devices. Another challenge is maintaining state
information about existing connections in the event of a failure. SSL VPN proxying and network
extension functionality each handle state information differently. Another consideration is transparency
of failover to the users. Depending on how state information is shared, the user may or may not need to
re-authenticate after a failure.

SSL VPNs support scalability with load-balancing features. Both high availability and load balancing
often use a virtual IP address that is shared across multiple SSL VPN devices. In an active/passive
architecture, the passive device has the ability to take over the virtual IP address and associated traffic if
the active device fails. In an active/active architecture, both devices service the virtual IP address. SSL
VPN devices configured as active/passive typically are not providing any scalability features, whereas
active/active configurations use either an integrated load balancer or an external load balancer to
distribute connections across multiple VPN devices. However, for the VPN to maintain functionality
when one of the devices fails, it is essential to ensure that the VPN traffic load does not exceed the
throughput capability of a single device.

3.3.3   Portal Customization

Portal customization is a feature that allows an administrator to control the appearance of the SSL VPN
Web interface that the end users see and with which they interact. Note that both SSL portal VPNs and
SSL tunnel VPNs usually have portal pages: SSL tunnel VPNs often have portal pages for users to change
their settings, request help from a system administrator, and so on.

Some products lack portal customization features; nevertheless, finding the right files on the SSL VPN
device and editing them may allow customization of the look and feel of the portal. Other products have
built-in configuration settings to control the colors, icons, and layout of the portal. Some products only
provide system-wide customization, while others allow portal customization on a per-group basis.
Besides layout and color preferences, customized portals are often necessary to support PDAs and smart
phones over SSL VPNs. Some products allow portal customization per system type to accommodate the
limited functionality of PDAs and smart phones. Portal customization sometimes integrates with the
endpoint security controls and access control. If an end system does not pass all of the endpoint security
checks and access is restricted, the user may be presented with a limited portal.

Some advanced products also have the capability to allow users to control the layout and customization of
their own portals. This includes creating bookmarks, adding icons, and saving passwords.

3.3.4   Authentication

SSL VPNs support the authentication security service either directly through an integrated authentication
method, or indirectly via an external authentication server, or both. Traditional SSL Web page
authentication relies on server-side authentication, so that users trust the server with which they are
communicating. SSL VPN authentication takes this a step further by requiring both server-side and
client-side authentication. SSL VPNs support flexible client authentication methods, such as username
and password, smart cards, two-factor authentication, and X.509 digital certificates. For the use of
methods involving tokens, the SSL VPN must be able to handle the various messages, such as PIN
change requests, that are involved in token solutions.
