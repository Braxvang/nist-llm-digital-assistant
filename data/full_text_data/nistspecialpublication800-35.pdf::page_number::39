                                                                                 NIST Special Publication 800-35



 Service provider’s interface to organization’s management
 Organization’s responsibilities with respect to making information and resources available to service
  provider
 Procedures and protections for commingling organization and service provider data
 Explicit rules for handling sensitive data.
Too often, service arrangements fail because one or more of these were not considered. Organizations
should clearly state what they need, and service providers should clearly understand what is expected of
them.

4.4.2    Finalize and Execute the Implementation Plan

Now that the service provider and service levels have been finalized, the organization can complete the
implementation plan and begin to execute the plan. Some details may have changed during the service
agreement negotiation, and managers should be aware of how the plan should be changed.

4.4.3    Manage Expectations

As the new service, service arrangement, and/or service provider is implemented, all parties should
manage expectations. There may be some conflict as each party adapts to the new security and
organizational environment and learns to operate within it. Lines of communication lines should be kept
open to ensure close monitoring and cooperation between the managers and service providers.

A few important guidelines are:

 Address problems openly, whether the conflict is internal to the organization or between internal
  groups and external service providers.
 Allow the service provider to perform its job while still ensuring accountability.
 Maintain the security services life cycle.
4.5     Phase 5: Operations

The operations phase begins once the service provider and service have been fully implemented. During
this phase, the organization, its security, and the security service provider are monitored to ensure the
service arrangement best meets the firm’s needs. This assessment will continue until a trigger occurs to
initiate closeout of this life cycle and start of a new life cycle. Open communications should be continued,
so that the organization and the service provider can address the problems that arise.

Throughout the operations phase, the organization’s project managers should ensure that the service
provider meets its stated service levels and complies with internal security procedures and policies.
Often, for example, organizations do not ensure external service providers handle sensitive (whether
personal, private, or mission sensitive) material as internal service providers do; if internal service
providers needed personnel clearances, it is very likely the external service provider would also need a
personnel clearance. Figure 4-6 illustrates Phase 5, Operations, of the IT security services life cycle.
