       NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                             Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
       November 2023

2833   sanitization
2834   Actions taken to render data written on media unrecoverable by ordinary and — for some forms of sanitization —
2835   extraordinary means.
2836   A process to remove information from media such that data recovery is not possible, including the removal of all
2837   classified labels, markings, and activity logs.

2838   security
2839   A condition that results from the establishment and maintenance of protective measures that enable an organization
2840   to perform its mission or critical functions despite risks posed by threats to its use of systems. Protective measures
2841   may involve a combination of deterrence, avoidance, prevention, detection, recovery, and correction that should
2842   form part of the organization’s risk management approach. [78]

2843   security assessment
2844   See security control assessment.

2845   security control
2846   The safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for an information system or an organization to protect the
2847   confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information. [13]

2848   security control assessment
2849   The testing or evaluation of security controls to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented
2850   correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security
2851   requirements for an information system or organization. [13]

2852   security domain
2853   A domain that implements a security policy and is administered by a single authority. Adapted from [78]

2854   security functions
2855   The hardware, software, or firmware of the system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and
2856   supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based.

2857   security requirement
2858   A requirement levied on a system or an organization that is derived from applicable laws, Executive Orders,
2859   directives, regulations, policies, standards, procedures, or mission/business needs to ensure the confidentiality,
2860   integrity, and availability of information that is being processed, stored, or transmitted. Adapted from [7] and [8].

2861   split tunneling
2862   The process of allowing a remote user or device to establish a non-remote connection with a system and
2863   simultaneously communicate via some other connection to a resource in an external network. This method of
2864   network access enables a user to access remote devices (e.g., a networked printer) at the same time as accessing
2865   uncontrolled networks.

2866   system
2867   See information system.

2868   system component
2869   A discrete identifiable information technology asset that represents a building block of a system and may include
2870   hardware, software, and firmware. [41]

2871   system security plan
2872   A document that describes how an organization meets or plans to meet the security requirements for a system. In
2873   particular, the system security plan describes the system boundary, the environment in which the system operates,
2874   how the security requirements are implemented, and the relationships with or connections to other systems.
