1686   3.12.5. Information Exchange
1687             REQUIREMENT: 03.12.05
1688             a. Approve and manage the exchange of CUI between the system and other systems using
1689                [Selection (one or more): interconnection security agreements; information exchange
1690                security agreements; memoranda of understanding or agreement; service level
1691                agreements; user agreements; nondisclosure agreements].
1692             b. Document, as part of the exchange agreements, interface characteristics, security
1693                requirements, and responsibilities for each system.
1694             c.   Review and update the exchange agreements periodically.

1695             DISCUSSION
1696             The types of agreements selected are based on factors such as the relationship between the
1697             organizations exchanging information (e.g., government to government, government to
1698             business, business to business, government or business to service provider, government or
1699             business to individual) and the level of access to the organizational system by users of the other
1700             system. Types of agreements can include interconnection security agreements, information
1701             exchange security agreements, memoranda of understanding or agreement, service-level
1702             agreements, or other types of agreements. Organizations may incorporate agreement
1703             information into formal contracts, especially for information exchanges established between
1704             federal agencies and nonfederal organizations (e.g., service providers, contractors, system
1705             developers, and system integrators). Examples of the types of information contained in
1706             exchange agreements include the interface characteristics, security requirements, controls, and
1707             responsibilities for each system.
