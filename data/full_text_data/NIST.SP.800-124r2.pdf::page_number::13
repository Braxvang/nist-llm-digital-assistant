NIST SP 800-124r2                                                  Guidelines for Managing the Security
May 2023                                                            of Mobile Devices in the Enterprise

management technology available for traditional desktop environments and those afforded to
security professionals to secure their mobile devices, although they are constantly evolving and
maturing.

       Purpose
The purpose of this publication is to assist organizations with managing and securing mobile
devices. This publication provides recommendations for selecting, implementing, and managing
devices throughout their life cycle via centralized management technologies. Additionally,
security concerns inherent to mobile devices are explored alongside mitigation strategies. This
approach includes protecting enterprise information such as email, contacts, calendar, and web
browsing, which are some of the most commonly used applications in the workplace. This can be
expanded to include the protection of enterprise-developed and third-party applications and the
sensitive enterprise data they store and process. Recommendations are also provided for the
deployment, use, and disposal of devices throughout the mobile device life cycle. This
publication can be used to inform risk assessments, build threat models, enumerate the attack
surface of the mobile infrastructure, and identify mitigations for mobile deployments.

       Scope
This publication is scoped to the management of mobile devices in the enterprise. Mobile
devices primarily include mobile phones and tablets but also include other devices that run a
modern mobile OS, such as Chromebooks which can run Android apps. Laptops are specifically
excluded from the scope of this publication as the security controls available today for laptops
are quite different than those available for mobile phones, tablets, and other mobile device types.
Mobile devices with minimal computing capability are excluded, including feature phones,
wearables, and other devices included under the Internet of Things (IoT) umbrella. This
document does not discuss the mechanisms needed to evaluate the security of mobile
applications [2] or to securely deploy and maintain a cellular network [3]. Unique feature sets
available in specialized areas (e.g., construction, public safety, medical) are not analyzed or
discussed.

       Audience
This document is intended for information security officers, information security engineers,
security analysts, system administrators, chief information officers (CIOs), and chief information
security officers (CISOs). Other organization personnel may find this document helpful, such as
security managers, engineers, analysts, administrators, and others who are responsible for
planning, implementing, and maintaining the security of mobile devices. This document assumes
that readers have a basic understanding of mobile device technologies, networking, and
enterprise security principles.
