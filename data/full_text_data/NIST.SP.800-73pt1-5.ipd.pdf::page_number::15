      NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1
      September 2023                                 PIV Card Application Namespace, Data Model, and Representation

317       PIV Card Application Namespaces

318           Namespaces of the PIV Card Application
319   Names used on the PIV interfaces are drawn from three namespaces managed by NIST:
320       1. Proprietary Identifier eXtension (PIX) of the NIST Registered Application Provider
321          IDentifier (RID)
322       2. ASN.1 object identifiers (OIDs) in the personal identity verification subset of the OIDs
323          managed by NIST
324       3. Basic Encoding Rules — Tag Length Value (BER-TLV) tags of the NIST PIV coexistent
325          tag allocation scheme
326   All unspecified names in these managed namespaces are reserved for future use.
327   All interindustry tags defined in ISO/IEC 7816, Information Technology – Identification Cards –
328   Integrated Circuit(s) Card with Contacts [ISO7816], and used in the NIST coexistent tag
329   allocation scheme without redefinition have the same meaning as they have in [ISO7816].
330   All unspecified values in the following identifier and value namespaces are reserved for future
331   use:
332       •   Algorithm identifiers
333       •   Key reference values
334       •   Cryptographic mechanism identifiers

335           PIV Card Application AID
336   The Application IDentifier (AID) of the Personal Identity Verification Card Application (PIV
337   Card Application) SHALL be:
338           'A0 00 00 03 08        00 00 10 00       01 00'
339   The AID of the PIV Card Application consists of the NIST RID ('A0 00 00 03 08') followed by
340   the application portion of the NIST PIX indicating the PIV Card Application ('00 00 10 00') and
341   then the version portion of the NIST PIX ('01 00') for the first version of the PIV Card
342   Application. All other PIX sequences on the NIST RID are reserved for future use.
343   The PIV Card Application CAN be selected as the current application by providing the full AID
344   as listed above or by providing the right-truncated version (i.e., without the two-byte version), as
345   follows:
346           'A0 00 00 03 08        00 00 10 00'
