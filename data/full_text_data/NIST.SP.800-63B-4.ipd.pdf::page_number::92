2620   Appendix A.      Strength of Memorized Secrets
2621   This appendix is informative.
2622   Throughout this appendix, the word “password” is used for ease of discussion. Where
2623   used, it should be interpreted to include passphrases and PINs as well as passwords.

2624   A.1. Introduction
2625   Despite widespread frustration with the use of passwords from both a usability and
2626   security standpoint, they remain a very widely used form of authentication [Persistence].
2627   Humans, however, have only a limited ability to memorize complex, arbitrary secrets, so
2628   they often choose passwords that can be easily guessed. To address the resultant security
2629   concerns, online services have introduced rules in an effort to increase the complexity
2630   of these memorized secrets. The most notable form of these is composition rules, which
2631   require the user to choose passwords constructed using a mix of character types, such as
2632   at least one digit, uppercase letter, and symbol. However, analyses of breached password
2633   databases reveal that the benefit of such rules is not nearly as significant as initially
2634   thought [Policies], although the impact on usability and memorability is severe.
2635   Complexity of user-chosen passwords has often been characterized using the information
2636   theory concept of entropy [Shannon]. While entropy can be readily calculated for data
2637   having deterministic distribution functions, estimating the entropy for user-chosen
2638   passwords is difficult and past efforts to do so have not been particularly accurate. For
2639   this reason, a different and somewhat simpler approach, based primarily on password
2640   length, is presented herein.
2641   Many attacks associated with the use of passwords are not affected by password
2642   complexity and length. Keystroke logging, phishing, and social engineering attacks are
2643   equally effective on lengthy, complex passwords as simple ones. These attacks are outside
2644   the scope of this Appendix.

2645   A.2. Length
2646   Password length has been found to be a primary factor in characterizing password
2647   strength [Strength] [Composition]. Passwords that are too short yield to brute force
2648   attacks as well as to dictionary attacks using words and commonly chosen passwords.
2649   The minimum password length that should be required depends to a large extent on the
2650   threat model being addressed. Online attacks where the attacker attempts to log in by
2651   guessing the password can be mitigated by limiting the rate of login attempts permitted.
2652   In order to prevent an attacker (or a persistent claimant with poor typing skills) from
2653   easily inflicting a denial-of-service attack on the subscriber by making many incorrect
2654   guesses, passwords need to be complex enough that rate limiting does not occur after a
2655   modest number of erroneous attempts, but does occur before there is a significant chance
2656   of a successful guess.
