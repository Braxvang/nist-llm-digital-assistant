   SIGA(M,TSP1), other_info2. Note that other_info2 may be Null.
   TSP1 is defined to be the TSP used for the scheme in 4.3.1, 4.3.2 or 4.3.3.
 4. TTA2 returns TSP2 to entity A:
       TSP2 = timestamped_data2, timestamp_signatureTTA2
   where:
       user_supplied_info2 = SIGA(M, TSP1), other_info2.
       timestamped_data2 = user_supplied_info2, TTA_supplied_info2, timestamp2.
       timestamp_signatureTTA2 = SIGTTA2(user_supplied_info2, TTA_supplied_info2,
                                 timestamp2).
   If there is a mutual agreement between entity A and TTA2, the following
   information may be omitted from the TSP2 data transmitted by TTA2:
       •    Any portion of the user_supplied_info2 may be omitted, since it is known
            by entity A. However, if SIGA(M, TSP1) is omitted from the TSP2 data, it
            must be inserted back into the TSP2 data when sent to entity B (see step 5).
       •    Any portion of the TTA_supplied_info2 may be omitted when the
            information is known or can be determined by entity A.
   However, even if they are omitted from the transmitted TSP2 data,
   both the entire user_supplied_info2 and the entire TTA_supplied_info2 shall be
   included in the timestamped_data2 that is used in the generation / verification of
   timestamp_signatureTTA2 = SIGTTA2 (timestamped_data2).
   Upon receiving TSP2 from TTA2, entity A should 1) check that the transmitted
   portions of user_supplied_info2 are correct and 2) verify the
   timestamp_signatureTTA2 using the TTA2’s public signature verification key.
5. Entity A assembles D and sends it to entity B:
            D = M, TSP1, TSP2
   where TSP1 is defined in the appropriate subsection of Section 4.3, and TSP2 is as
   defined in step 4. Note that if SIGA(M, TSP1) was not transmitted in the
   timestamped_data2 of the TSP2 data sent from TTA2, it shall be inserted into the
   TSP2 data used in the assembly of D.
   If omitted from the TSPs received from the TTAs, the entire user_supplied_info1
   and the entire TTA_supplied_info1 shall be inserted into TSP1, and the entire
   user_supplied_info2 and the entire TTA_supplied_info2 shall be inserted into TSP2
   unless there is a mutual agreement between entity A and entity B, in which case
   the following may be omitted from the transmitted TSP1 and TSP2 data in D:
       •    Any portion of user_supplied_info1 that is present in TSP1 may be omitted
            if it is known or can be determined by entity B.
       •    Any portion of user_supplied_info2 that is present in TSP2 may be omitted
