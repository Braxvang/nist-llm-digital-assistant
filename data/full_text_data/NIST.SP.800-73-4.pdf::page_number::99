14 If the public key needed to verify the signature on C
                                                         ICC appears in an Intermediate CVC, then verify the signatures on both CICC
and the Intermediate CVC and, using standards-compliant PKI validation, validate the content signing certificate needed to verify
the signature on the Intermediate CVC.
15 Validation of the content signing certificate does not need to be performed at the time of signature verification if the certificate

has been previously validated or if the public key needed to verify the signature on CICC has been previously obtained from a
trusted source.
