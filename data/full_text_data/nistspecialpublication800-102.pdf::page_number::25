5.1      The Basic Scheme
As shown in Figure 7, the scheme proceeds as follows:
      1. Entity B sends a newly
         generated Nonce to entity A.
      2. Entity A signs (M, Nonce),
         assembles D, and sends it to
         entity B, where:
             D = M, SIGA(M, Nonce).          Figure 7: Using Verifier Supplied Data
      3. Upon receiving D, entity B then
         verifies SIGA(M, Nonce) using entity A’s public signature verification key.
Because of the verification performed in step 3, entity B knows (and/or has assurance of)
the following:
      a. M could have been assembled either before or after the Nonce was received from
         entity B.
      b. SIGA(M, Nonce) was generated at some time after the Nonce was received by
         entity A.
      c. D was assembled by entity A after the Nonce was received.
If a more precise time is required for the generation of SIGA(M, Nonce), a trusted
timestamp may be acquired as specified in Section 5.2; the timestamp will provide
assurance that SIGA(M, Nonce) was generated by (at least) the time indicated in the
timestamp.

5.2      Using a Timestamp to Obtain More Precision
When verifier-supplied data is used, a more precise time for the generation of a digital
signature can be provided by requesting a timestamp. Any entity could make the request,
although requests by entity A and entity B are discussed below. This procedure has the
most value if the timestamp request is made as close to the generation of entity A’s
signature as possible, since it may be used to establish a minimal time interval during
which entity A’s signature was generated. The discussions assume that entities A and B
successfully verify all digital signatures.

5.2.1 Entity A Requests the Timestamp
Entity A may request a timestamp before sending a message to entity B. The TTA that
provides the timestamp must be trusted by both parties.
Figure 8 depicts the case where entity A provides more precision as to when SIGA(M,
Nonce) was generated. Note that the Nonce supplied by entity B could include a
timestamp, in which case, this (additional) timestamp could establish an interval during
which SIGA(M, Nonce) was generated.
The scheme is as follows:


                                             25
