SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


              AC-4 (20)     A Federal CKMS could support protocols that obtain an
PF:4.5
                            FCKMS Security Policy from a different security domain,
                            compare the obtained policy to the local FCKMS Security
                            Policy, and establish whether the obtained policy is
                            equivalent to or compatible with the local FCKMS Security
                            Policy.
                            The domain authorities of Federal CKMSs could negotiate
PF:4.6
                            and institute a common FCKMS Security Policy for
                            protecting the data of both domains using the following
                            actions:
                                a) Agree on the common FCKMS Security Policy,
                                b) Notify all entities of the planned FCKMS Security
                                   Policy change, and
                                c) Verify that each domain enforces the common
                                   FCKMS Security Policy.

4.11.4 Third-Party Sharing
When two domain authorities examine each other’s FCKMS Security Policy for equivalence
to or compatibility with their own FCKMS Security Policy, they should carefully examine
each other’s policies for sharing keys, metadata and other information with other third-party
entities. For example, if domain A shares keys with domain B, can domain B share the same
key and metadata with an equivalent domain C? See the Framework for further discussion.

4.11.5 Multi-level Security Domains
A security domain could contain information having more than one impact-level (e.g.,
Moderate and High). In this case, an FCKMS must support key management for protecting
the information at both impact-levels. For this multi-level situation, the security domain acts
much like two separate security domains because it must distinguish between the two levels
of protection. Each entity in the domain must ensure 1) that keys and/or metadata protected
by the higher-level policy are always provided with the higher level of protection, 2) that
keys and/or metadata protected by the lower-level policy cannot be confused with the higher-
level keys and/or metadata, and 3) that higher-level keys and/or metadata do not get confused
with lower-level keys and/or metadata. This typically involves a multi-level secure computer
operating system.

FR:4.21 The CKMS design shall specify whether or not it supports multi-level security
domains.

FR:4.22 The CKMS design shall specify each level of security domain that it supports.

FR:4.23 If multi-level security domains are supported, the CKMS design shall specify how
it maintains the separation of the keys and metadata belonging to each security level.
