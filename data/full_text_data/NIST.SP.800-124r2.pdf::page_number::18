WiFi is a wireless local area network (WLAN) technology and is generally available on most
mobile devices. WiFi devices often connect via a centralized wireless access point (AP) but can
also work in a device-to-device ad hoc mode. Bluetooth is a short-range wireless communication
technology primarily used to establish wireless personal area networks (WPANs). Bluetooth
technology is common in consumer mobile devices and can be used to communicate with
headsets, wearables, keyboards, mice, and other IoT devices. Another form of short-range
wireless communication is NFC, which is typically optimized for distances of less than 4 inches
but may be vulnerable at greater distances. NFC is based on the radio frequency identification
(RFID) set of standards. Mobile payment technology commonly relies on NFC, which has led to
a large increase of use in recent years.
A global navigational satellite system (GNSS) provides worldwide, geospatial positioning via
GPS. GPS uses line-of-sight communication with a satellite constellation in orbit to help a
handset determine its location. These systems run independently of cellular networks. The U.S.
Federal Government operates a GPS constellation, although mobile devices may use other
constellations (e.g., Global Navigation Satellite System [GLONASS], Galileo). The U.S. Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) mandates that cellular devices must have GPS built-in for
public safety and emergency medical reasons. It should be noted that the GPS system is not the
only way to identify a mobile deviceâ€™s location. Other techniques include cellular positioning,
WiFi-assisted positioning, and geolocation of IP addresses.
