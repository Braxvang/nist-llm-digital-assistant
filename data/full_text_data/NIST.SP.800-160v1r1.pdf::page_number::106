-   Variable or dynamic characteristics of the system (e.g., reconfiguration, relocation, refresh of system
    elements; random routing of data over different communication channels from source to destination;
    the ability to change aspects of the system behavior, structure, data, or configuration in a random but
    nonetheless verifiable manner)
A design approach that includes diversity in structure, configuration, communications, protocols, and
similar or dissimilar system elements (e.g., N-version, heterogeneity) increases uncertainty due to the
increased complexity of the design and the behaviors and outcomes that stem from emergent effects, side
effects, and feature interaction. This drives the need for confidence that the design approach will deliver
only the authorized and intended functional behavior, produce only the authorized and intended
outcomes, and do so in a manner that allows for control over side effects, emergence, and feature
interaction.
Diversity options include intentionally designed regular or irregular changes in the system (e.g.,
implementing the concept of dynamicity). A design incorporating dynamicity can (1) complicate the
attack planning of an adversary, (2) reduce the potential for non-adversarial adversity to have an effect on
the system, (3) provide the margin to deliver a required capability while reducing actual losses, and (4)
protect against the effects of an attack. Dynamic change may refer to either shifting the target or shifting
the behaviors of a target in performing its activities (e.g., frequency hopping complicates attempts to
intercept or jam signals within wireless communications).
The uncertainty and diminished predictability associated with the employment of diversity and
dynamicity in design can be problematic where it impedes or prevents having confidence that the system
will function and produce outcomes only as authorized and intended. It is important to differentiate where
the uncertainty lies: (1) uncertainty in how the system achieves an end objective (i.e., the means to an
end) or (2) uncertainty that an objective will be achieved (i.e., achieving the end). A design that employs
diversity and dynamicity must be based on acquiring confidence that the system will produce only the
desired results despite uncertainty in knowing exactly how the desired results are achieved. This
constitutes a design trade that is specific to diversity- and dynamicity-based designs. Diversity may have a
cost (e.g., hardware, software, maintenance, training, assurance) greater than the value or effectiveness
that it provides.

E.12. Domain Separation
Principle: Domains with distinctly different protection needs are physically or logically
separated.
Note: The separation of domains enables enhanced control and, therefore, protection of system function
and the flow of data. Control relative to separated domains limits the extent to which an entity or domain
is influenced by or is able to influence some other entity or domain, thereby enhancing the protection of a
domain. This is achieved through the control of information flow and data between domains as well as
control over the use of a system capability between domains.
The differing protection needs that are used to define domains may be thought of in terms of protecting
the domain from influence by external entities (i.e., susceptibility) and protecting external entities from
erroneous behavior that occurs within the domain (i.e., containment). This distinction may include
separating critical functions from less critical functions, such as separating the flight control functions of a
transport aircraft from the environmental control functions that maintain a safe environment for the cargo
and passengers being transported.
Historically, domain separation has been used to enforce the separation of roles or privileges. For
example, a system may separate an “administrative” or “supervisor” domain from “user” domains. The
