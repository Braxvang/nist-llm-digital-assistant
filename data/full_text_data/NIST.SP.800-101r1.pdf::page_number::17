      Garbage collection occurs because NAND flash memory cannot overwrite existing data, the
      data must first be erased before writing to the same cell [Bel10].

2.3   Identity Module Characteristics

      Identity modules (commonly known as SIM cards) are synonymous with mobile devices that
      interoperate with GSM cellular networks. Under the GSM framework, a mobile device is
      referred to as a Mobile Station and is partitioned into two distinct components: the Universal
      Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) and the Mobile Equipment (ME). A UICC, commonly
      referred to as an identity module (e.g., Subscriber Identity Module [SIM], Universal Subscriber
      Identity Module [USIM], CDMA Subscriber Identity Module [CSIM]), is a removable
      component that contains essential information about the subscriber. The ME and the radio
      handset portion cannot fully function without a UICC. The UICC’s main purpose entails
      authenticating the user of the mobile device to the network providing access to subscribed
      services. The UICC also offers storage for personal information, such as phonebook entries,
      text messages, last numbers dialed (LND) and service-related information.

      The UICC partitioning of a mobile device stipulated in the GSM standards has brought about a
      form of portability. Moving a UICC between compatible mobile devices automatically
      transfers the subscriber’s identity and some of the associated information (e.g., SMS messages
      and contacts) and capabilities. In contrast, 2G and 3G CDMA mobile devices generally do not
      contain a UICC card. Analogous UICC functionality is instead directly incorporated within the
      device. However, newer CDMA (i.e., 4G/LTE) devices may employ a CDMA Subscriber
      Identity Module (CSIM) application running on a UICC.

      A UICC can contain up to three applications: SIM, USIM and CSIM. UICCs used in GSM
      and UMTS mobile devices use the SIM and UMTS SIM (USIM) applications, while CDMA
      devices use the CSIM application. A UICC with all three applications provides users with
      additional portability through the removal of the UICC from one mobile device and insertion
      into another. Because the SIM application was originally synonymous with the physical card
      itself, the term SIM is often used to refer to the physical card in lieu of UICC. Similarly the
      terms USIM and CSIM can refer to both the physical card as well as the respective
      applications supported on the UICC.

      At its core, a UICC is a special type of smart card that typically contains a processor and
      between 16 to 128 KB of persistent electronically erasable, programmable read only memory
      (EEPROM). It also includes RAM for program execution and ROM for the operating system,
      user authentication and data encryption algorithms, and other applications. The UICC’s file
      system resides in persistent memory and stores data such as: as phonebook entries, text
      messages, last numbers dialed (LND) and service-related information. Depending on the
      mobile device used, some information managed by applications on the UICC may coexist in
      the memory of the mobile device. Information may also reside entirely in the memory of the
      mobile device instead of available memory reserved for it in the file system of the UICC.

      The UICC operating system controls access to elements of the file system [3GP07]. Actions
      such as reading or updating may be permitted or denied unconditionally, or allowed
      conditionally with certain access rights, depending on the application. Rights are assigned to a
      subscriber through 4-8 digit Personal Identification Number (PIN) codes. PINs protect core
      subscriber-related data and certain optional data.
