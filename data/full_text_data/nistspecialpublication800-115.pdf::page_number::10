                                             TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



1.    Introduction

1.1   Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b (3), “Securing Agency
Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority; nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.

1.2   Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this document is to provide guidelines for organizations on planning and conducting
technical information security testing and assessments, analyzing findings, and developing mitigation
strategies. It provides practical recommendations for designing, implementing, and maintaining technical
information relating to security testing and assessment processes and procedures, which can be used for
several purposes—such as finding vulnerabilities in a system or network and verifying compliance with a
policy or other requirements. This guide is not intended to present a comprehensive information security
testing or assessment program, but rather an overview of the key elements of technical security testing
and assessment with emphasis on specific techniques, their benefits and limitations, and recommendations
for their use.

This document replaces NIST Special Publication 800-42, Guideline on Network Security Testing.

1.3   Audience

This guide is intended for use by computer security staff and program managers, system and network
administrators, and other technical staff who are responsible for the technical aspects of preparing,
operating, and securing systems and network infrastructures. Managers can also use the information
presented to facilitate the technical decision-making processes associated with security testing and
assessments. Material in this document is technically oriented, and assumes that readers have at least a
basic understanding of system and network security.
