                       IMPERATIVE 3 – Strengthening Cryptographic Standards And Validation




AUTOMATING CRYPTOGRAPHIC TESTING
Several years ago, NIST launched a project to automate much of the testing
required under its cryptographic validation programs. Automated cryptographic
algorithm testing was completed in 2018, and NIST is now developing methods to
automate the testing of cryptographic modules. These efforts in automation are
intended to provide a higher trust in the assurance claims made by the product
developers in an efficient and cost-effective manner that allows the vendors’
conformance efforts to keep pace with the changing IT landscape. By investing
in a more robust testing infrastructure, NIST anticipates that product vendors
will take advantage of this service by validating their products more often, which
will produce more secure products. In FY19, NIST will put more responsibility
for generating evidence of conformance in the hands of industry by leveraging
automated test processes that will reduce time to market, slice costs to maintain
compliance, and ensure that the Federal Government has effective and up-to-
date technologies.
