    It should be noted that there are distinct differences among certifications that are
offered by a variety of organizations. Primarily, one will encounter certificates of
completion, certifications awarded by an industry and/or vendors, and graduate-level
certificates awarded by academic institutions:
      • Certificates of completion are provided to individuals solely as a testament
        to completion of a particular course—these certificates do not make any claims
        that the individual actually gained knowledge and/or skills.
      • Industry and/or vendor certification requires a combination of training,
        education, and experience. These certifications validate knowledge and skills
        through testing—they provide varying degrees of assurance that an individual
        has a baseline level of knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) with regard to a
        predefined body of knowledge. The preparatory work for knowledge-based or
        skill-based certifications normally includes training in a prescribed body of
        knowledge or technical curriculum and is supplemented frequently by on-the-
        job experience.
      • Graduate certificates in information security are awarded by an academic
        institution to individuals who successfully complete all graduation requirements
        for a particular program. These graduate certificates generally require 18 to 21
        credit hours of academic study, have at least four required courses, allow for
        one or two electives, and may require some form of research paper, project, or
        case study.

4.3    Designing, Developing, and Implementing an Awareness and Training
       Program
   The development of an information security awareness and training program
involves three major steps:
      1. Designing the program (including the development of the information security
         awareness and training program plan);



                                                                                       30
