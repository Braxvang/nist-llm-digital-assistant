GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



 Purpose of the compromise (e.g., email spoofing, illegal software repository, platform for other
  attacks)
 Method used for the system compromise
 Actions of the attacker during and after the compromise (e.g., log files, intrusion detection reports)
 Duration of the compromise
 Extent of the compromise on the network (e.g., the number of hosts compromised)
 Results of consultation with management and legal counsel.
The lower the level of access gained by the attacker and the more the mail server administrator
understands about the attacker’s actions, the less risk there is in restoring from a backup and patching the
vulnerability. For incidents in which there is less known about the attacker’s actions and/or in which the
attacker gains high-level access, it is recommended that the operating system and applications be
reinstalled from the manufacturer’s original distribution media and that the mail server data be restored
from a known good backup.

If legal action is pursued, system administrators need to be aware of the guidelines for handling a host
after a compromise. Consult legal counsel and relevant law enforcement authorities as appropriate.

9.4     Security Testing Mail Servers

Periodic security testing of public mail servers is critical. 64 Without periodic testing, there is no
assurance that current protective measures are working or that the security patch just applied by the mail
server administrator is functioning as advertised. Although a variety of security testing techniques exists,
vulnerability scanning is the most common. Vulnerability scanning assists a mail server administrator in
identifying vulnerabilities and verifying whether the existing security measures are effective. Penetration
testing is also used, but less frequently and usually only as part of an overall penetration test of the
organization’s network. 65

9.4.1     Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanners are automated tools that are used to identify vulnerabilities and misconfiguration
of hosts. Many vulnerability scanners also provide information about mitigating discovered
vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability scanners attempt to identify vulnerabilities in the hosts scanned. Vulnerability scanners can
help identify out-of-date software versions, missing patches or system upgrades, and validate compliance
with or deviations from the organization's security policy. To accomplish this effort, vulnerability
scanners identify operating systems and major software applications running on hosts and match them
with known vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scanners employ large databases of vulnerabilities to identify
vulnerabilities associated with commonly used operating systems and applications.

      If Web-based mail access is being provided, periodic security testing of the Web servers providing that access is also
      critical. See NIST SP 800-44, Guidelines on Securing Public Web Servers, for information on performing security testing
      for Web servers. It is available at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/.
