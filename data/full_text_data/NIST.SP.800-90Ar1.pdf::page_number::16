Random Number            For the purposes of this Recommendation, a value in a set that
                         has an equal probability of being selected from the total
                         population of possibilities and, hence, is unpredictable. A
                         random number is an instance of an unbiased random variable,
                         that is, the output produced by a uniformly distributed random
                         process.

Random Bit Generator     A device or algorithm that outputs a sequence of binary bits
(RBG)                    that appears to be statistically independent and unbiased. An
                         RBG is either a DRBG or an NRBG.
Randomness Source        A component of a DRBG (which consists of a DRBG
                         mechanism and a randomness source) that outputs bitstrings
                         that are used as entropy input by the DRBG mechanism. The
                         randomness source can be an entropy source or an RBG.
Reseed                   To acquire additional bits that will affect the internal state of
                         the DRBG mechanism.
Secure Channel           A path for transferring data between two entities or
                         components that ensures confidentiality, integrity and replay
                         protection, as well as mutual authentication between the
                         entities or components. The secure channel may be provided
                         using approved cryptographic, physical or procedural
                         methods, or a combination thereof. Sometimes called a trusted
                         channel.

Security Strength        A number associated with the amount of work (that is, the
                         number of operations of some sort) that is required to break a
                         cryptographic algorithm or system in some way. In this
                         Recommendation, the security strength is specified in bits and
                         is a specific value from the set {112, 128, 192, 256}. If the
                         security strength associated with an algorithm or system is S
                         bits, then it is expected that (roughly) 2S basic operations are
                         required to break it.
Seed                     Noun : A string of bits that is used as input to a DRBG
                         mechanism. The seed will determine a portion of the internal
                         state of the DRBG, and its entropy must be sufficient to
                         support the security strength of the DRBG.
                         Verb : To acquire bits with sufficient entropy for the desired
                         security strength. These bits will be used as input to a DRBG
                         mechanism to determine a portion of the initial internal state.
