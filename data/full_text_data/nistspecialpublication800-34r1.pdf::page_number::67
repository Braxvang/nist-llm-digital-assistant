        configured to carry voice or data signals. Fractional T-1 communications links also can be
        provided when multiples of 64-kbps lines are required.
       T-3. T-3 is a dedicated phone connection supporting data rates of about 45 Mbps. A T-3 line
        consists of 672 individual channels, each of which supports 64 kbps. T-3 is also referred to as a
        Digital Signal (DS) 3.
       Frame Relay. Frame relay is a packet-switching protocol for connecting devices on a WAN. In
        frame relay, data is routed over virtual circuits. Frame relay networks support data transfer rates
        at T-1 and T-3 speeds.
       Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). ATM is a network technology that transfers data at high
        speeds using packets of fixed size. Implementations of ATM support data transfer rates of from
        25 to 622 Mbps and provide guaranteed throughput.
       Synchronous Optical Network (SONET). SONET is the standard for synchronous data
        transmission on optical media. SONET supports gigabit transmission rates.

5.3.1   Telecommunications Contingency Considerations

When developing the telecommunications recovery strategy, the ISCP Coordinator should apply
considerations that were provided in Section 5.2.1 regarding client/server systems. In addition, the
following practices should be considered:

       Telecommunications documentation. Physical
        and logical telecommunications diagrams should          TELECOMMUNICATIONS CONTINGENCY
        be up to date. The physical diagram should                    STRATEGIES:

        network connective devices that facilitate
        telecommunication (e.g., circuits, switches, bridges, and hubs) to ease recovery. Vendors and
        their contact information should be documented in the contingency plan to provide for prompt
        hardware and software repair or replacement. The plan also should document the
        communications providers, including POC and contractual or SLA information.
       Coordinate with security policies and security controls. Telecommunications contingency
        solution(s) should be coordinated with network security policies to protect against threats that
        could disrupt the network. Therefore, in choosing the appropriate technical telecommunications
        contingency solution(s), similar security controls and security-related activities (e.g., risk
