       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                          Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                                 and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

                               Activity                         Completed                    Comments
       Prior to authorization, an independent third party has
       been consulted and has reviewed the assessment (if
       needed).
       The PIV system is operational, and actual PIV
       processes can be observed by the assessment team.
       PIV Cards or derived PIV Credential tokens are ready
       to be personalized and can be used for testing by the
       assessment team.
       Personalized PIV Cards and/or derived PIV
       credentials are submitted on an annual basis to the
       FIPS 201 Evaluation Program for testing and are
       issued from a production system.
