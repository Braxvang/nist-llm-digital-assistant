3.4       Periodic Assessment Recommendations

Organizations with WLANs should conduct regular periodic technical WLAN security assessments.
These assessments should be performed at least annually to evaluate the overall security of the WLAN. In
addition, organizations should perform periodic assessments at least quarterly unless continuous
monitoring of WLAN security is already collecting all of the information about WLAN attacks and
vulnerabilities needed for assessment purposes. For example, an organization that does not have
comprehensive WIDPS coverage of its facilities should use mobile WIDPS sensors, WLAN scanners, or
other tools with similar capabilities to search for rogue WLANs in areas outside the WIDPS’s range.

The following are additional factors that organizations should consider when planning the frequency and
breadth of periodic assessments:

          The location of the facility being scanned, because the physical proximity of a building to a
           public area (e.g., streets and public common areas) or its location in a busy metropolitan area may
           increase the risk of WLAN threats

          The security level of the data to be transmitted on the WLAN

          How often WLAN client devices connect to and disconnect from the environment, and the typical
           traffic levels for these devices (e.g., occasional activity or fairly constant activity)—this is
           because only active WLAN client devices are discoverable during a WLAN scan

          Physical changes to the facilities, such as construction projects that could affect the strength and
           propagation of WLAN signals
