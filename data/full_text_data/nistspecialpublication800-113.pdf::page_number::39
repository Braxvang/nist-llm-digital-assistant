the DNS traffic outside of the VPN. Because port forwarding technology is a subset of network
extension, this document discusses only network extension.

Most SSL VPN devices offer packet filtering for users that access resources via network extension.
Because network extension provides broad access to users, the most effective way to protect certain
subnets may be to configure packet filters that prevent access to them. SSL VPN devices may also
support multiple routing tables for users. One routing table can be used to provide access to all internal
subnets, while another routing table enables connectivity to subnets that only specific groups should
access.

The following is an example of an organization’s access control requirements. The organizational
requirements listed in the Identify Requirements phase are repeated here as a reminder:

 All employees should be able to access the main corporate applications and a set of Web-based
  applications such as email that are all hosted on the intranet servers.
 A small group of executives should be able to access the executive file share on the administrative
  server.
 The sales team should have access to the sales database and the sales file share on the sales server.
 Business partners should be able to access the extranet partner server.
 Network administrators should have full access to routers, switches, and other network infrastructure.
The resources that should be made accessible by the SSL VPN are then specified:

 Corporate applications on intranet servers (grouped together)
 Web applications—email and calendaring (grouped together)
 Executive file share on administrative server
 Sales database
 Sales file share on sales server
 Extranet partner server
 Network infrastructure devices (grouped together).
The groups that should be able to access resources are as follows:

 Employees
 Executives
 Sales
 Business partners
 Administrators.
These are the conditions by which resources can be accessed by groups:
