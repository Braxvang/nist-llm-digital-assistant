NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                Guidelines for Media Sanitization


 4.7 Verify Methods

Verifying the selected information sanitization and disposal process is an essential step in
maintaining confidentiality. Two types of verification should be considered. The first is
verification every time sanitization is applied (where applicable, as most Destroy techniques do
not support practical verification for each sanitized piece of media). The second is a
representative sampling verification, applied to a selected subset of the media. If possible, the
sampling should be executed by personnel who were not part of the original sanitization action.
If sampling is done after full verification in cases of low risk tolerance then a different
verification tool than the one used in the original verification should be used.

    4.7.1 Verification of Equipment

    Verification of the sanitization process is not the only assurance required by the
    organization. If the organization is using sanitization tools (e.g., a degausser or a dedicated
    workstation), then equipment calibration, as well as equipment testing, and scheduled
    maintenance, is also needed.

    4.7.2 Verification of Personnel Competencies

    Another key element is the potential training needs and current expertise of personnel
    conducting the sanitization. Organizations should ensure that equipment operators are
    competent to perform sanitization functions.

    4.7.3 Verification of Sanitization Results

    The goal of sanitization verification is to ensure that the target data was effectively sanitized.
    When supported by the device interface (such as an ATA or SCSI storage device or solid
    state drive), the highest level of assurance of effective sanitization (outside of a laboratory)
    is typically achieved by a full reading of all accessible areas to verify that the expected
    sanitized value is in all addressable locations. A full verification should be performed if time
    and external factors permit. This manner of verification typically only applies where the
    device is in an operational state following sanitization so that data can be read and written
    through the native interface.

    If an organization chooses representative sampling then there are three main goals applied to
    electronic media sanitization verification:

        1. Select pseudorandom locations on the media each time the analysis tool is applied.
           This reduces the likelihood that a sanitization tool that only sanitizes a subset of the
           media will result in verification success in a situation where sensitive data still
           remains.

        2. Select locations across the addressable space (user addressable and reserved areas).
           For instance, conceptually break the media up into equally sized subsections. Select
           a large enough number of subsections so that the media is well-covered. The number
           of practical subsections depends on the device and addressing scheme. The
           suggested minimum number of subsections for a storage device leveraging LBA
