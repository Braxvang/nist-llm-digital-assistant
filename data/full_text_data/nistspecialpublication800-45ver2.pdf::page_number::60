GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



containing inappropriate language. When implementing file-type restrictions and malware scanning, only
a certain level of security is provided. The contents of an email message or its attachments could prove
much more damaging to an organization than a virus or rogue executable. For this case, some sort of
content filtering mechanism should be employed.

6.2.2.1 Implementing Content Filters

For maximum effectiveness, content filtering should be performed on all incoming and outgoing
messages and conducted in the same locations as malware scanning—on the firewall/mail relay/mail
gateway, mail servers, and end users’ hosts. In fact, many products are available for popular messaging
systems that incorporate content filtering, malware scanning, and file-type restriction (see Appendix D for
a listing of common products). Incorporation of these features into one product can reduce the
administration of security controls.

In general, rules are defined to forward, quarantine, park, clean, block, or delete any data passing through
the server depending upon the results of the scan. Typical items that would be caught by the filter and
possible actions taken on them could be as follows:

 Email that contains suspicious active content (e.g., ActiveX, JavaScript) is stripped of the active code
  and forwarded to the recipient.
 Spam email and phishing attempts may be deleted or tagged as suspicious.
 Extra-large files might be held for delivery during off-peak hours.
Another key feature of content filtering packages is the scanning of outbound data. A lexical analysis can
be performed that scans email messages for words and phrases that might be viewed as inappropriate for
use in organizational email. The lexical analysis can also save possible litigation against an organization
by preventing inappropriate content, including hoaxes and spam (see Section 6.3), from leaving the
organization. In addition, a lexical analysis might include searches for key words and phrases indicating
that sensitive data is leaving the enterprise.

Organizations should also take steps to prevent email address spoofing, such as ensuring that external
users cannot send emails to internal users that have one of the organization’s email addresses as the
spoofed sender. For example, a hypothetical company WidgetsRUs should block any incoming email
with a “from” address in the domain widgetsrus.com at its mail gateway. Attackers often spoof email
addresses to make their malicious emails appear to be from internal users, because it can trick users into
trusting the emails. Checking digital signatures on emails is a way that users can detect some spoofing
attempts. 38

Before implementing any filtering solution, it is imperative to determine how the existing network and
applications actually work. This entails running network analyzers (sniffers); analyzing router, firewall,
and server log files; and interviewing all appropriate system and network administrators. It is also
imperative to analyze the existing organization information system security policy, or draft one if one
does not exist. Clearly defined security policies are critical to translating the organization’s security goals
into filter rules. Great care must be taken in crafting the rules because an incorrectly configured filter
may fail to filter inappropriate content or may accidentally filter appropriate content. These steps will

     There are some emerging experimental standards for email sender verification, including Sender ID (currently defined in
     RFC 4406) and Sender Policy Framework (currently defined in RFC 4408). More information on these approaches is
     available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4406.txt and http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4408.txt, respectively.
