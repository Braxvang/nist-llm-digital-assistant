               The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



Schematron rules to check well-formed SCAP content. The Schematron files for the SCAP specification
and its applicable component specifications are located at http://scap.nist.gov/revision/1.2/#schematron.
Source content SHOULD pass all Schematron assertions in the Schematron rule files. When creating
source content, failed assertions with a “warning” flag MAY be disregarded if the assertion discovers an
issue in the content that is justifiable and expected based on the needs of the content author. When
executing source content, all failed assertions with a “warning” flag MUST be disregarded.
The Schematron rule sets are interpretations of the specifications, and the implementations of their rules
are subject to change. Whenever a change is made to a Schematron file, the SCAP errata document will
be updated and the new Schematron file will be posted. The latest Schematron file SHOULD be used in
place of any earlier versions. If the latest file is unavailable, the version specified on the <ds:data-
stream-collection> element’s @schematron-version attribute SHALL be used instead.
Also, for the component specifications, the Schematron file on the SCAP website SHALL be used in
place of any corresponding Schematron file available elsewhere. For example, a particular specification
may have an official Schematron file available on a different website. In most cases, the copy on the
SCAP website will be the same, but if issues in a Schematron file are discovered, the SCAP website may
address these before the individual specification’s maintainers do.

3.1.3    Globally Unique Identifiers
The elements listed in Table 13 have special conventions around the format of their identifiers (@id
attribute). Authors MUST follow these conventions because they preserve the global uniqueness of the
resulting identifiers. In Table 13, namespace contains a valid reverse-DNS style string (limited to letters,
numbers, periods, and the hyphen character) that is associated with the content author. Examples include
"com.acme.finance" and "gov.tla". These namespace strings MAY have any number of parts, and SCAP
content consumers processing them SHALL treat them as case-insensitive (e.g., com.ABC is considered
identical to com.abc). The name in the format conventions MUST be an NCName-compliant string
[XMLS].

3.2     Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF)
This section lists requirements and recommendations for using the Extensible Configuration Checklist
Description Format (XCCDF) to express an XCCDF benchmark or tailoring component of an SCAP
source data stream (see Table 12). They are organized by the following categories: general,
<xccdf:Benchmark>, <xccdf:Profile>, <xccdf:Rule>, <xccdf:Value>, and
<xccdf:Group>.

3.2.1    General
The @xml:base attribute SHALL NOT be allowed in XCCDF content. This attribute is not compatible
with the SCAP data stream model.
Descriptive information within XCCDF MAY be used by SCAP products to assist in the selection of the
appropriate SCAP data stream, ensure that the most recent or correct version of an XCCDF document is
