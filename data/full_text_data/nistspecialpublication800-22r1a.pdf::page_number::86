3.15 Random Excursions Variant Test
An alternative to the random excursions test can be derived as follows. Using the notation of the previous
subsection, let ξJ(x) be the total number of visits to x during J excursions. (The test suite code assumes J
≥ 500.) Since Sk renews at every zero, ξJ(x) is a sum of independent identically distributed variables with
the same distribution as ξ(x) = ξ1(x). Therefore, the limiting distribution of ξJ(x),
