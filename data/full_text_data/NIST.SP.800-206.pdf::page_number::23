     IMPERATIVE 4 – Advancing Cybersecurity Research And Applications Development



          •    Roots of Trust. Modern computing devices consist of varied hardware, firmware,
               and software components at multiple layers of abstraction. Many security and
               protection mechanisms are rooted in software that, along with all underlying
               components, must be trusted and not tampered with. A vulnerability in any
               of those components could compromise the trustworthiness of the security
               mechanisms that rely upon them. Achieving stronger security assurances may
               be possible by grounding security mechanisms in highly reliable and secure
               hardware, firmware, and software components that perform specific, critical
               security functions. In FY18, NIST built on earlier work focused on protecting
               boot firmware to develop new technical guidelines and recommendations for
               supporting the resiliency of platform firmware and data against potentially
               destructive attacks. Platform Resiliency Guidelines (SP 800-193)28 promotes
               resiliency in platforms by describing security mechanisms for protecting against
               unauthorized changes, detecting unauthorized changes that occur, and securely
               recovering from attacks. In FY19, NIST plans to continue outreach to stakeholders
               to encourage the development of more secure and reliable systems and
               investigate how roots of trust can support other security needs, including supply
               chain assurance.
