QM-3 PERFORM QUALITY MANAGEMENT CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTIVE ACTIONS
         QM-3.1 Plan corrective actions when security quality management objectives are not
                achieved.
         QM-3.2 Plan preventive actions when there is a sufficient risk that security quality
                management objectives will not be achieved.
         QM-3.3 Monitor the security aspects of corrective and preventive actions to completion, and
                inform stakeholders.

J.6.1. Security Purpose
-   Enable the organization to exploit opportunities to reapply existing security knowledge.

J.6.2. Security Outcomes
-   A taxonomy for the application of security-relevant knowledge assets is identified.
-   Organizational security knowledge, skills, and knowledge assets are organized.
-   Organizational security knowledge, skills, and knowledge assets are available.
-   Organizational security knowledge, skills, and knowledge assets are communicated across
    the organization.
-   Security knowledge management usage data is analyzed.

J.6.3. Security Activities and Tasks
KM-1     PLAN KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
         KM-1.1 Define the security aspects of the knowledge management strategy.
         Note: The security aspects of the knowledge management strategy include:
         - The security knowledge domains and technologies and their potential for the reapplication
            of knowledge
         - The plans for obtaining and maintaining security knowledge, skills, and security knowledge
            assets for their useful life
         - The types of security knowledge, security skills, and security knowledge assets to be
            collected and maintained
         - The criteria for accepting, qualifying, and retiring security knowledge, security skills, and
            security knowledge assets
