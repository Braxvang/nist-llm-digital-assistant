NIST SP 800-38G                                            METHODS FOR FORMAT-PRESERVING ENCRYPTION



Algorithm 1: NUMradix (X)

Prerequisite:
Base, radix.

Input:
Numeral string, X.

Output:
Number, x.

Steps:
1.    Let x = 0.
2.    For i from 1 to LEN(X), let x = x ⋅ radix + X [i].
3.    Return x.


Algorithm 2: NUM(X)

Input:
Byte string, X, represented in bits.

Output:
Integer, x.

Steps:
1.    Let x = 0.
2.    For i from 1 to LEN(X), let x = 2 x + X [i].
3.    Return x.

                    m
Algorithm 3: STR radix (x)

Prerequisites:
Base, radix;
String length, m.

Input:
Integer, x, such that 0 ≤ x < radixm.

Output:
Numeral string, X.

Steps:
1.    For i from 1 to m:
        i. X [m + 1– i] = x mod radix;
        ii. x = ⎣x/radix⎦.
2.    Return X.
