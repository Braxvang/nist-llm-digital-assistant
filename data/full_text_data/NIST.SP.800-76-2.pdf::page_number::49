of users with the process. The use of two fingers or irises in all authentication transactions offers substantially
improved performance over single-instance authentication.
This document does not establish false rejection performance criteria – how often genuine users are unable to
successfully authenticate – because it does not represent a direct security objective. Agencies are cautioned that
false rejection performance is operationally vital in access control applications and is achieved by using high
performance cameras and algorithms, by ensuring good quality enrollment, by correct control of the environment, by
adherence to enrollment specifications, by subject and operator instruction, and by subject habituation. Agencies are
therefore strongly encouraged to consider:
―   Establishing a policy on how many times a subject can attempt to authenticate;
―   Establishing false rejection accuracy criteria against which tests and qualification procedures can be conducted;
―   Referring to false rejection performance measures reported for algorithms evaluated using the IREX test and
    calibration procedure;
―   Referring to false rejection performance measures reported for algorithms conforming to the MINEX test and
    calibration procedure;
―   Training staff to recognize poor quality images at time of enrollment;
―   Requiring the use of multiple samples (e.g., two fingers);
―   Conditions under which an alternative modality for authentication (e.g., iris instead of fingerprint) might be used;
―   Conditions under which an additional modality for authentication (e.g., iris and fingerprint) might be used;
―   Conducting their own supplementary tests. These might be performance tests of single products or
    interoperability tests, and might be used to estimate application-specific performance. The execution of tests
    conforming to one or more parts of the ISO/IEC 19795 standard is strongly recommended because biometric
    testing is a specialized discipline. Particularly a number of subtleties and difficulties exist that can potentially
    fatally undermine a test.
This specification does not:
―   Preclude agencies from establishing more stringent false match criteria. The false match criteria can always be
    met by setting a high (i.e., stringent) comparison threshold. However, more stringent thresholds imply elevated
    false rejection errors because of the error-rate tradeoff. One mitigation is to use two fingers or two eyes.
