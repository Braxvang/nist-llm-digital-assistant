SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


2 Profile Basics
This Profile provides a structured view of a Federal CKMS, discussing security provisions
that shall, should or could be used by a Federal organization or contractor to manage and
protect cryptographic keys and metadata.

2.1    Profile Topics and Requirements, Augmentations, and Features

This Profile consists of a set of topics that is similar to the topics found in the Framework.
Each topic heading is typically followed by an overview of the topic, a list of Framework
requirements from [SP 800-130], a list of Profile requirements, a list of recommended Profile
augmentations, and a list of possible Profile features. In some cases, there may be no
requirements, augmentations, or features that apply to the topic.

Framework requirements for CKMSs are indicated by “shall” or “shall not,” and are
numbered beginning with an “FR” designation. Profile requirements for all FCKMSs are
indicated by “shall” or “shall not,” and are numbered beginning with a “PR” designation.
Some Profile requirements are conditional (e.g., based on the applicable [FIPS 200] impact-
level). Only the Framework requirements and the non-conditional Profile requirements are
necessary to conform to and comply with this document. A CKMS design conforming to this
Profile, must support a configuration that is compatible with both sets of requirements.
Recommended augmentations are indicated by “should,” and are numbered beginning with a
“PA” designation. Recommended augmentations are strongly recommended by NIST for
implementation in most systems. Possible features are indicated by “could,” and are
numbered beginning with a “PF” designation. Profile features are optional features that are
often intended for complex or future systems. Their possible implementation, if desired, is
left to the stakeholders of the system. Federal CKMS service-using organizations could
selectively require that their FCKMSs support some of the recommended augmentations or
suggested features, but such requirements are beyond the scope of this document.

In order to easily recognize Profile requirements, augmentations and features from the
surrounding text, each type is presented in separate tables. For each table:
        Column one provides the PR, PA or PF number;
        Column two identifies any related security controls in [SP 800-53]; when column two
         is blank, no related security control has been identified; and
        Column three provides the text of the requirement, augmentation or feature.
The first Framework requirement and the first Profile requirement, recommended
augmentation and suggested feature are concerned with the overall conformance to the
Framework and Profile.

FR:1.1 A conformant CKMS design shall meet all “shall” requirements of the Framework
[SP 800-130].

                           A Federal CKMS shall satisfy all Framework requirements
PR:2.1
                           (FRs) and Profile requirements (PRs).
