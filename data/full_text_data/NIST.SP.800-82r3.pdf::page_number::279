F.7.11.        PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION – PE
Tailoring Considerations for the Physical and Environmental Protection Family
Physical and environmental protections are often used as a compensating control for many OT
systems, so physical and environmental protection controls are especially important. Any
selected compensating control mitigates risk to an acceptable level.

PE-1    POLICY AND PROCEDURES

                                                                       CONTROL BASELINES

   NO.                      Control Enhancement Name
                                                                     LOW         MOD         HIGH

OT Discussion: The policy specifically addresses the unique properties and requirements of OT
and the relationship to non-OT systems. The OT components can be distributed over a large
facility footprint or geographic area and can be an entry point into the entire organizational
network OT. Regulatory controls may also apply.
PE-2    PHYSICAL ACCESS AUTHORIZATIONS

                                                                       CONTROL BASELINES
  CNTL                         CONTROL NAME
   NO.                      Control Enhancement Name
                                                                     LOW         MOD         HIGH

 PE-2       Physical Access Authorizations                          Select     Select      Select

No OT Discussion for this control.
PE-3    PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL

 PE-3       Physical Access Control                                 Select     Select      Select

 PE-3 (1)   PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL | SYSTEM ACCESS                                        Select

OT Discussion: The organization considers OT safety and security interdependencies and access
requirements in emergency situations. During an emergency, the organization may restrict access
to OT facilities and assets to authorized individuals only. OT systems are often constructed of
devices that do not have or cannot use comprehensive access control capabilities due to time-
restrictive safety constraints. Physical access controls and defense-in-depth measures are used by
the organization when necessary and possible to supplement OT security when electronic
mechanisms are unable to fulfill the security requirements of the organization’s security plan.
Control Enhancement: (1) No OT Discussion for this control.
