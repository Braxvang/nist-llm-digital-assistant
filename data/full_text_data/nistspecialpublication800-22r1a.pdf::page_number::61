A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



        For the example in this section,
                 S1 = -1                 S6 = 2
                 S2 = 0                  S7 = 1
                 S3 = 1                  S8 = 2
                 S4 = 0                  S9 = 1
                 S5 = 1                  S10 = 2

        The set S = {-1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2}.

(3)     Form a new sequence S' by attaching zeros before and after the set S. That is, S' = 0, s1, s2, … , sn,
        0.

        For the example, S' = 0, -1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0. The resulting random walk is shown below.




                                             Example Random Walk (S')


(4)     For each of the eighteen non-zero states of x, compute ξ(x) = the total number of times that state x
        occurred across all J cycles.

        For the example in this section, ξ(-1) = 1, ξ(1) = 4, ξ(2) = 3, and all other ξ(x) = 0.

                                                     ξ (x) − J 
                                                                  
(5)     For each ξ(x), compute P-value = erfc                      . Eighteen P-values are computed. See
                                                     2J (4 x − 2) 
                                                                  
        Section 5.5.3 for the definition of erfc.

                                                                             4−3       
        For the example in this section, when x = 1, P-value = erfc                     = 0.683091.
                                                                         2 • 3(41 − 2 )
                                                                                       

2.15.5 Decision Rule (at the 1% Level)
If the computed P-value is < 0.01, then conclude that the sequence is non-random. Otherwise, conclude
that the sequence is random.

2.15.6 Conclusion and Interpretation of Results
Since the P-value obtained in step 7 of Section 2.15.4 is ≥ 0.01 for the state x = 1 (P-value = 0.683091),
the conclusion is that the sequence is random.
