SC-22     ARCHITECTURE AND PROVISIONING FOR NAME / ADDRESS RESOLUTION SERVICE

          Control: The information systems that collectively provide name/address resolution service for an
          organization are fault tolerant and implement role separation.
          Supplemental Guidance: A domain name system (DNS) server is an example of an information
          system that provides name/address resolution service. To eliminate single points of failure and to
          enhance redundancy, there are typically at least two authoritative domain name system (DNS)
          servers, one configured as primary and the other as secondary. Additionally, the two servers are
          commonly located in two different network subnets and geographically separated (i.e., not located
          in the same physical facility). If organizational information technology resources are divided into
          those resources belonging to internal networks and those resources belonging to external
          networks, authoritative DNS servers with two roles (internal and external) are established. The
          DNS server with the internal role provides name/address resolution information pertaining to both
          internal and external information technology resources while the DNS server with the external role
          only provides name/address resolution information pertaining to external information technology
          resources. The list of clients who can access the authoritative DNS server of a particular role is
          also specified. NIST Special Publication 800-81 provides guidance on secure DNS deployment.
          Control Enhancements: None.

SC-23     SESSION AUTHENTICITY

          Control: The information system provides mechanisms to protect the authenticity of
          communications sessions.
          Supplemental Guidance: This control focuses on communications protection at the session, versus
          packet, level. The intent of this control is to implement session-level protection where needed
          (e.g., in service-oriented architectures providing web-based services). NIST Special Publication
          800-52 provides guidance on the use of transport layer security (TLS) mechanisms. NIST Special
          Publication 800-77 provides guidance on the deployment of IPsec virtual private networks (VPNs)
          and other methods of protecting communications sessions. NIST Special Publication 800-95
          provides guidance on secure web services.
          Control Enhancements: None.
