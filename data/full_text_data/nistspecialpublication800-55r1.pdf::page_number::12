they are meeting applicable information security requirements, and to document the level of
performance based on results of annual program reviews.

1.4    Critical Success Factors

An information security measurement program within an organization should include four
interdependent components (see Figure 1-1).




             Figure 1-1. Information Security Measurement Program Structure

The foundation of strong upper-level management support is critical, not only for the success of
the information security program, but also for the program’s implementation. This support
establishes a focus on information security within the highest levels of the organization. Without
a solid foundation (i.e., proactive support of personnel in positions that control information
resources), the information security measurement program can fail when pressured by
organizational dynamics and budget limitations.

The second component of an effective information security measurement program is the
existence of information security policies and procedures backed by the authority necessary to
enforce compliance. Information security policies delineate the information security
management structure, clearly assign information security responsibilities, and lay the foundation
needed to reliably measure progress and compliance. Procedures document management’s
position on the implementation of an information security control and the rigor with which it is
applied. Measures are not easily obtainable if no procedures are in place that supply data to be
used for measurement.
