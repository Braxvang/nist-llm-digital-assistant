D.3.   Tools and Training

D.3.1. CISA Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET®)
CISA’s Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET®) provides a systematic, disciplined, and
repeatable approach for evaluating an organization’s security posture. CSET is a desktop
software tool that guides asset owners and operators through a step-by-step process to evaluate
ICS and IT network security practices. Users can evaluate their own cybersecurity stance using
many recognized government and industry standards and recommendations.

D.3.2. CISA Cybersecurity Framework Guidance
Sector-specific guidance has been completed by all six critical infrastructure sectors for which
the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Infrastructure Protection is the Sector-Specific
Agency (SSA): Chemical, Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, Dams, Emergency
Services, and Nuclear. Guidance is developed in close collaboration with the SSA alongside the
Sector Coordinating Councils (SCC) and Government Coordinating Councils (GCC) to provide a
holistic view of a sector’s cybersecurity risk environment.
