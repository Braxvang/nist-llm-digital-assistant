A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



A.2            Configuration Information

The following parameters are available in the file defs.h.

1.    #define ALPHA                                                0.01
2.    #define MAXNUMOFTEMPLATES                                    148
3.    #define NUMOFTESTS                                           15
4.    #define NUMOFGENERATORS                                      10
5.    #define MAXFILESPERMITTEDFORPARTITION                        148

Lines 1-5 correspond to test suite parameters that have been preset. Under various conditions, the user
may decide to modify them.

Line 1 refers to the significance level. It is recommended that the user select the level in the range
[0.001,0.01].

Line 2 refers to the maximum number of templates that may be used in the Nonoverlapping Template
Matching test. The value 148 corresponds to the number of templates of length 9.

Line 3 refers to the maximum number of tests that is supported in the test suite. If the user adds
additional tests, this parameter should be incremented.

Line 4 refers to the maximum number of generators that is supported in the package. If the user adds
additional generators, this parameter should be incremented.

Line 5 refers to the maximum number of files that may be decomposed by the partitionResultFile
routine. This routine is applied only for specific tests where more than one P-value is produced per
sequence. This routine decomposes the corresponding results file into separate files, data001, data002,
data003, â€¦
