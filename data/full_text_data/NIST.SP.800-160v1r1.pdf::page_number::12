 “Providing satisfactory security controls in a computer system is in itself a system design problem. A
 combination of hardware, software, communications, physical, personnel and administrative-
 procedural safeguards is required for comprehensive security. In particular, software safeguards alone
 are not sufficient.”
 “Security Controls for Computer Systems,” (The Ware Report), Rand Corporation
 Defense Science Board Task Force on Computer Security, February 1970


 “Mission assurance requires systems that behave with predictability and proportionality.”
 General Michael Hayden
 Former Director National Security Agency (NSA) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Syracuse University,
 October 2009


 “In the past, it has been assumed that to show that a system is safe, it is sufficient to provide assurance
 that the process for identifying the hazards has been as comprehensive as possible, and that each
 identified hazard has one or more associated controls. While historically this approach has been used
 reasonably effectively to ensure that known risks are controlled, it has become increasingly apparent
 that evolution to a more holistic approach is needed as systems become more complex and the cost
 of designing, building, and operating them become more of an issue.”

 “This whole economic boom in cybersecurity seems largely to be a consequence of poor engineering.”
 Carl Landwehr
 Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), February 2015


 “Cybersecurity requires more than government action. Protecting our Nation from malicious cyber
 actors requires the Federal Government to partner with the private sector. The private sector must
 adapt to the continuously changing threat environment, ensure its products are built and operate
 securely, and partner with the Federal Government to foster a more secure cyberspace…Incremental
 improvements will not give us the security we need; instead, the Federal Government needs to make
 bold changes and significant investments in order to defend the vital institutions that underpin the
 American way of life.”
 Executive Order (EO) on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, May 2021


 “[Systems] security engineering must be fundamental to systems engineering, not just a specialty
 discipline. Security concepts must be fundamental to [an] engineering education, and security
 proficiency must be fundamental in development teams. Security fundamentals must be clearly
 understood by stakeholders and effectively evaluated in a way that considers broad goals with security
 functions and outcomes.”

 International Symposium, July 2021
