                                                                                   GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



Some mail server administrators also install one or more forms of host-based intrusion detection software
on their servers. For example, file integrity checking software can identify changes to critical system
files.

When planning security controls, mail server administrators should consider the resources that the
security controls will consume. A server’s performance could degrade if it does not have enough memory
and processing capacity for the controls.

5.2     Security Testing the Operating System

Periodic security testing of the operating system is a vital way to identify vulnerabilities and to ensure that
the existing security precautions are effective. Methods for testing operating systems include
vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. Vulnerability scanning usually entails using an automated
vulnerability scanner to scan a host or groups of hosts on a network for application, network, and
operating system vulnerabilities. Penetration testing is a testing process designed to compromise a
network using the tools and methodologies of an attacker. It involves iteratively identifying and
exploiting the weakest areas of the network to gain access to the remainder of the network, eventually
compromising the overall security of the network. Vulnerability scanning should be conducted
periodically, such as weekly or monthly, and penetration testing should be conducted at least annually.
Because both of these testing techniques also are applicable to testing the mail server application, they are
discussed in detail in Section 9.4. 35
