    routability, which is described in Section 4.4.3.3, below:

    – Binding Update
    – Binding Acknowledgement
    – Binding Refresh Request
    – Binding Error
    – Home Test Init
    – Home Test
    – Care-of Test Init
    – Care-of Test
   Four new ICMPv6 message types:

    – Home Agent Address Discovery Request
    – Home Agent Address Discovery Reply
