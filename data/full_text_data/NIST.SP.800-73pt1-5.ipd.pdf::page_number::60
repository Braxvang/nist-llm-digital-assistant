       NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1

1232   B.1.5. Authentication Using PIV Visual Credentials (Deprecated)
1233   Figure 7 shows the deprecated authentication mechanism in which a human guard authenticates
1234   the cardholder using the visual credentials held by the PIV Card. The authentication mechanism
1235   has been deprecated in FIPS 201-3 and MAY be removed from a future edition of the standard.

1238   B.1.6. Authentication Using PIV CHUID (Removed)
1239   The content of this section has been removed since the CHUID as an authentication mechanism
1240   is no longer allowed under FIPS-201. However, the CHUID data element itself remains on-card
1241   to support other authentication mechanisms. For example, the BIO and BIO-A authentication
1242   mechanisms use the CHUID data element as a source for the cardâ€™s expiration date. The CHUID
1243   data element also provides the content signing certificate for these authentication mechanisms as
1244   well as unique identifiers for PACS ACLs.
