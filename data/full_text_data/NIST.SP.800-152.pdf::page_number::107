SP 800-152                                                 A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


cryptographic algorithm implementation may be required to pass both functional testing
and security testing.

Penetration testing is a specific type of security testing in which a team of testing experts
attacks one or more of a systemâ€™s computers or devices to defeat its security. Prior to
penetration testing, the FCKMS is analyzed for potential vulnerabilities that could be
exploited by the penetration team. Such vulnerabilities could result from an incomplete
CKMS design, an improper FCKMS configuration, hardware or software flaws, or
operational weaknesses in key-management services or technical countermeasures. The
scope of penetration testing should include FCKMS hardware, software, personnel
procedures, facilities, and environmental services. Any findings of, and conclusions
reached by, the penetration testing team should be addressed before initial deployment of
the FCKMS.

Note that individual FCKMS product/device penetration testing could be conducted as
part of an FCKMS security assessment (see Section 11).

FR:9.7 The CKMS design shall specify the functional and security testing that was
performed on the system and the results of the tests.

               SA-11        A Federal CKMS shall pass functional and security testing
PR:9.10
                            before its initial operation.
                            Functional testing shall include performing and passing the
PR:9.11
                            following types of tests or obtaining evidence that the tests
                            were performed and produced acceptable results:
                                a) Third-party testing, where available,
                                b) Interoperability testing,
                                c) Self testing, and
                                d) Scalability testing.

               CA-8         For High impact-level systems, a Federal FCKMS shall pass
PR:9.12
               SA-11        penetration testing before initial operation, and before
                            resuming operations after major changes.
                            A Federal CKMS shall conduct functional and security
PR:9.13
                            testing annually or in accordance with a Service Level
                            Agreement (SLA), and continue operation only if the tests are
                            passed or the system supports operation in a degraded mode.

                CA-8        For Low and Moderate impact-level systems, a Federal
PA:9.5
                SA-11       FCKMS should pass penetration testing before initial
                            operation, and before resuming operations after major
                            changes.
