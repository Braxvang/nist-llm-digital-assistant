    Other Sensitive Documents Related to Homeland Security

(c) MEMORANDUM FOR DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES of March 19, 2002
    Subject: Safeguarding Information Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction and Other
    Sensitive Records Related to Homeland Security
    [See http://csrc.nist.gov/policies/guidance-homelandsec.html.]

       III. Sensitive But Unclassified Information

       In addition to information that could reasonably be expected to assist in the development
       or use of weapons of mass destruction, which should be classified or reclassified as
       described in Parts I and II above, departments and agencies maintain and control sensitive
       information related to America's homeland security that might not meet one or more of
       the standards for classification set forth in Part 1 of Executive Order 12958. The need to
       protect such sensitive information from inappropriate disclosure should be carefully
       considered, on a case-by-case basis, together with the benefits that result from the open
       and efficient exchange of scientific, technical, and like information.

       All departments and agencies should ensure that in taking necessary and appropriate
       actions to safeguard sensitive but unclassified information related to America's homeland
       security, they process any Freedom of Information Act request for records containing
       such information in accordance with the Attorney General's FOIA Memorandum of
       October 12, 2001, by giving full and careful consideration to all applicable FOIA
       exemptions. See FOIA Post, "New Attorney General FOIA Memorandum Issued"
       (posted 10/15/01) (found at http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/foiapost/2001foiapost19.htm),
       which discusses and provides electronic links to further guidance on the authority
       available under Exemption 2 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(2), for the protection of
       sensitive critical infrastructure information. In the case of information that is voluntarily
       submitted to the Government from the private sector, such information may readily fall
       within the protection of Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(4).

E.3 OMB and Case Law Interpretations
The disclosure prohibitions, as stated in law are often imprecise. As a result, Office of
Management and Budget and case law interpretations are sometimes necessary to clarify the
prohibitions. In some cases, the analyst may need to identify such clarifications and
interpretations.

One law imposing disclosure prohibitions that has received particular attention across the Federal
government deserves special attention. The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. ยง 552a (2000), which
has been in effect since September 27, 1975, can generally be characterized as an omnibus "code
of fair information practices" that attempts to regulate the collection, maintenance, use, and
