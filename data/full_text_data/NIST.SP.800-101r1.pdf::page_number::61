and display of data [Aye11, Jan09]. Therefore, having a high degree of trust and understanding
of the tool’s ability to perform its function properly is essential. The Computer Forensics Tool
Testing (CFTT) project at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) produces
specification, test methods and test reports that provide a foundation for toolmakers to improve
tools, users to make informed choices, and provide interested parties with an overview of any
anomalies found. CFTT has spent several years researching and testing forensic tools capable
of acquiring data from the internal memory of mobile devices and Subscriber Identity Modules
(SIMs).

A knowledgeable individual may tamper with device information, such as purposefully
modifying a file extension to foil the workings of a tool, altering the date/time of the mobile
device to falsify timestamps associated with logged activities, creating false transactions in the
memory of the mobile device or its UICC or utilizing a wiping tool to remove or eliminate data
from memory. Seasoned experience with a tool provides an understanding of its limitations,
allowing an examiner to compensate for them and minimize errors to achieve the best possible
results.

To uncover evidence, specialists should gain a background of the suspect, offense and
determine a set of terms for the examination. Search expressions should be developed in a
systematic fashion, such as using contact names that may be relevant. By proceeding
systematically, the specialist creates a profile for potential leads that may unveil valuable
findings. Forensic Examination of Digital Evidence – A Guide for Law Enforcement,
produced by the U.S. Department of Justice [DOJ08], offers the following suggestions for the
analysis of extracted data:

       Ownership and possession – Identify the individuals who created, modified, or
        accessed a file, and the ownership and possession of questioned data by placing the
        subject with the device at a particular time and date, locating files of interest in non-
        default locations, recovering passwords that indicate possession or ownership, and
        identifying contents of files that are specific to a user.

       Application and file analysis – Identify information relevant to the investigation by
        examining file content, correlating files to installed applications, identifying
        relationships between files (e.g., e-mail files to e-mail attachments), determining the
        significance of unknown file types, examining system configuration settings, and
        examining file metadata (e.g., documents containing authorship identification).

       Timeframe analysis – Determine when events occurred on the system to associate
        usage with an individual by reviewing any logs present and the date/time stamps in
        the file system, such as the last modified time. Besides call logs, the date/time and
        content of messages and e-mail can prove useful. Such data can also be corroborated
        with billing and subscriber records kept by the service provider.

       Data hiding analysis – Detect and recover hidden data that may indicate knowledge,
        ownership, or intent by correlating file headers to file extensions to show intentional
        obfuscation; gaining access to password-protected, encrypted, and compressed files;
        gaining access to steganographic information detected in images; and gaining access
        to reserved areas of data storage outside the normal file system.

The capabilities of the tool and the richness of its features, versus the operating system and
type of device under examination, determines what information can be recovered, identified,
