                                                                                 INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

1.         Introduction

Federal Information Processing Standard 201, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of
Federal Employees and Contractors [FIPS 201], was developed to establish standards for
identity credentials. FIPS 201 sets the minimum requirements for a federal personal
identification system that meets the control and security objectives of Homeland Security
Presidential Directive (HSPD) 12 [HSPD 12]. FIPS 201 also gives the technical
specifications of components and processes required for the interoperability of PIV Cards 1
with the access control and PIV card management systems throughout the Federal
Government. FIPS 201 is accompanied by three documents:
       +    NIST Special Publication 800-73-4 (NIST SP 800-73-4) [SP 800-73] specifies
            interface requirements for retrieving and using the identity credentials from the PIV
            Card. It also defines a PIV data model, which details the structure and format of the
            information stored on the PIV Card.
       +    NIST SP 800-76-2 [SP 800-76] contains technical specifications for biometric data
            mandated in FIPS 201.
       +    NIST SP 800-78-4 [SP 800-78] specifies the cryptographic algorithms and key sizes
            for performing cryptographic operations on PIV data objects defined as part of the
            PIV data model.
This test guidance document specifies the test plan, processes, derived test requirements, and
the detailed test assertions/conformance tests for testing the following PIV software
components:
       +    PIV Middleware (implements PIV Client API).
       +    PIV Card Application.
The present document, SP 800-85A-4, supersedes SP 800-85A-2 in its entirety, effective
immediately upon publication.
1.1 Purpose

The objective of this document is to provide test requirements and test assertions that could
be used to validate the compliance/conformance of two PIV components – PIV Middleware
and PIV Card Applications – with the specifications in NIST SP 800-73-4. Because NIST SP
800-73-4 specifications were developed for meeting interoperability goals of FIPS 201, the
conformance tests in this document provide the assurance that the set of PIV Middleware and
PIV Card Applications that have passed these tests are interoperable. This in turn facilitates
procurement of FIPS 201-conformant products that meet the goals of HSPD-12.
1.2 Scope

This document provides guidelines for running conformance tests for the following three
classes of specifications in NIST SP 800-73-4:

    The term PIV Card in the context of this document refers to a smart card loaded with a PIV Card Application.
