5.2.1   Authenticated Encryption Function

5.2.1.1 Input Data

Given the selection of an approved block cipher and key, there are three input strings to the
authenticated encryption function:

   •    a plaintext, denoted P;
   •    additional authenticated data (AAD), denoted A; and
   •    an initialization vector (IV), denoted IV.

The plaintext and the AAD are the two categories of data that GCM protects. GCM protects the
authenticity of the plaintext and the AAD; GCM also protects the confidentiality of the plaintext,
while the AAD is left in the clear. For example, within a network protocol, the AAD might
include addresses, ports, sequence numbers, protocol version numbers, and other fields that
indicate how the plaintext should be treated.

The IV is essentially a nonce, i.e, a value that is unique within the specified context, which
determines an invocation of the authenticated encryption function on the input data to be
protected. The uniqueness requirement on the IVs (and keys) is stated precisely in Sec. 8, and
two frameworks for constructing IVs are given in Sec. 8.2. Practical considerations in assuring
the requirement are discussed in Secs. 9.1 and 9.2. The critical importance of the uniqueness of
the IVs is detailed in Ref. [5] and summarized in Appendix A.

The bit lengths of the input strings to the authenticated encryption function shall meet the
following requirements:

   •    len(P) ≤ 239-256;
   •    len(A) ≤ 264-1;
   •    1 ≤ len(IV) ≤ 264-1.

Although GCM is defined on bit strings, the bit lengths of the plaintext, the AAD, and the IV
shall all be multiples of 8, so that these values are byte strings.

An implementation may further restrict the bit lengths of these inputs, consistent with the above
requirements; for example, an implementation may establish smaller maximum values. The bit
lengths that an implementation allows are called the supported bit lengths. A single set of
supported bit lengths for each of the three inputs should be established for the entire
implementation, independent of the key.

For IVs, it is recommended that implementations restrict support to the length of 96 bits, to
promote interoperability, efficiency, and simplicity of design.

5.2.1.2 Output Data

The following two bit strings comprise the output data of the authenticated encryption function:
