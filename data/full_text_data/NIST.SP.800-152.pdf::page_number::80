SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


                           A Federal CKMS shall revoke the key associated with
PR:6.80
                           compromised sensitive metadata.
                           A Federal CKMS shall support reporting and investigating a
PR:6.81
                           compromise of sensitive metadata.


                           A Federal CKMS should destroy the keys whose sensitive
PA:6.25
                           metadata has been compromised, and also destroy all the
                           sensitive metadata associated with that key.

6.8.3 Key and Metadata Revocation
Keys could be revoked for a number of reasons, including key compromise, metadata
compromise, and the termination of an employee or the employeeâ€™s role within an
organization. Additional information is provided in Section 6.8.3 of the Framework.

FR:6.108 A CKMS design shall specify the key revocation mechanism(s) and associated
relying-entity notification mechanism(s) used or available for use.

6.8.4 Cryptographic Module Compromise
Since a cryptographic module contains plaintext keys at some point during its operation,
physical access to, and compromise of, a cryptographic module could compromise the
symmetric and private keys contained within the module, as well as any sensitive metadata
contained in the module. This could lead to the loss of confidentiality and/or integrity of the
keys and metadata.

Cryptographic modules could be compromised either physically (i.e., obtaining the keys by
physical penetration of the cryptographic module enclosure) or by non-invasive methods
(i.e., obtaining keys, or knowledge about the keys via some external action). Physical
protection could be provided to the modules by enclosing them in a facility or a protected
space where unauthorized access is prevented or where unauthorized access could be quickly
detected. Some modules provide this protection at their cryptographic boundary (see [FIPS
140]). If any access to the contents of a cryptographic module is possible, then an access
control system should restrict access to only authorized parties.

Following an actual or suspected cryptographic module compromise, a secure state of the
module must be re-established before the module is returned to normal operation, or the
module must be replaced. Following repair or replacement, the security and correct operation
of a module should be tested and approved before it becomes operational.

FR:6.109 The CKMS design shall specify how physical and logical access to the
cryptographic module contents is restricted to authorized entities.

FR:6.110 The CKMS design shall specify the approach to be used to recover from a
cryptographic module compromise.
