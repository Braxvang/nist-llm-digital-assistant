Chapter 3.          Information System Contingency Planning Process

This section describes the process to develop and maintain an effective information system contingency
plan. The process presented is common to all information systems. The seven steps in the process are:

     1. Develop the contingency planning policy;
     2. Conduct the business impact analysis (BIA);
     3. Identify preventive controls;
     4. Create contingency strategies;
     5. Develop an information system contingency plan;
     6. Ensure plan testing, training, and exercises; and
     7. Ensure plan maintenance.

These steps represent key elements in a comprehensive information system contingency planning
capability. Developing contingency planning policy and performing system BIA(s) are accomplished
early in the SDLC (see Appendix F) and before the systems are categorized in accordance with the RMF.
Six of the seven planning process steps are discussed in this section. Because plan development
represents the core of information system contingency planning, including the individual sections that
compose the plan, plan development is addressed in Chapter 4. Responsibility for the planning process
generally falls under the auspice of the Information System Contingency Plan Coordinator, or ISCP
Coordinator, who is typically a functional or resource manager within the organization. The ISCP
Coordinator develops the strategy in cooperation with other functional and resource managers associated
with the system or the mission/business processes supported by the system. The ISCP Coordinator also
typically manages development and execution of the contingency plan. All federal information systems
must have a contingency plan. Figure 3-1 illustrates the contingency planning process.
