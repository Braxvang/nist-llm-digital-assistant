          For the example, P-value = igamc        ,          = 0.180598.
                                                2      2    

2.4.5 Decision Rule (at the 1% Level)
If the computed P-value is < 0.01, then conclude that the sequence is non-random. Otherwise, conclude
that the sequence is random.

2.4.6 Conclusion and Interpretation of Results
For the example in Section 2.4.8, since the P-value ≥ 0.01 (P-value = 0.180609), the conclusion is that the
sequence is random. Note that large values of χ2(obs) indicate that the tested sequence has clusters of
ones.

2.4.7 Input Size Recommendation
It is recommended that each sequence to be tested consists of a minimum of bits as specified in the table
in Section 2.4.2.

2.4.8 Example
For the case where K = 3 and M = 8:
