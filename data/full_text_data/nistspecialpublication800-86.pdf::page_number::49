5.       Using Data from Operating Systems

An operating system (OS) is a program that runs on a computer and provides a software platform on
which other programs can run. In addition, an OS is responsible for processing input commands from a
user, sending output to a display, interacting with storage devices to store and retrieve data, and
controlling peripheral devices such as printers and modems. Some common OSs for workstations or
servers include various versions of Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Mac OS. Some network devices, such
as routers, have their own proprietary OSs (e.g., Cisco Internetwork Operating System [IOS]). PDAs
often run specialized OSs, including PalmOS and Windows CE.59 Many embedded systems, such as
cellular phones, digital cameras, and audio players, also use OSs.60 This section discusses the
components of an OS that might be relevant to forensics and provides guidance on collecting, examining,
and analyzing data from common workstation and server OSs.61

5.1      OS Basics

OS data exists in both non-volatile and volatile states. Non-volatile data refers to data that persists even
after a computer is powered down, such as a filesystem stored on a hard drive. Volatile data refers to data
on a live system that is lost after a computer is powered down, such as the current network connections to
and from the system. Many types of non-volatile and volatile data may be of interest from a forensics
perspective. This section discusses both of these types of OS data.

5.1.1      Non-Volatile Data

The primary source of non-volatile data within an OS is the filesystem.62 The filesystem is also usually
the largest and richest source of data within the OS, containing most of the information recovered during
a typical forensic event. The filesystem provides storage for the OS on one or more media.63 A
filesystem typically contains many types of files, each of which may be of value to analysts in different
situations. In addition, as noted in Section 4.1.2, important residual data can be recovered from unused
filesystem space. Several types of data that are commonly found within OS filesystems are as follows:

      ! Configuration Files. The OS may use configuration files to store OS and application settings.64
        For example, configuration files could list the services to be started automatically after system
        boot, and specify the location of log files and temporary files. Users might also have individual
        OS and application configuration files that contain user-specific information and preferences,
        such as hardware-related settings (e.g., screen resolution, printer settings) and file associations.
        Configuration files of particular interest are as follows:

      A discussion of the types of information that can be found on these types of devices and the methods for collecting,
      examining, and analyzing the information is beyond the scope of this document. Because of the wide variety of devices and
      the knowledge and equipment needed in many cases to forensically process the data they contain, most organizations will
      find it best to secure such a device and transfer it to an appropriate party that is experienced in collecting, examining, and
      analyzing data from such devices (e.g., a law enforcement agency).
61
      Guidance specific to data from proprietary and specialized operating systems is beyond the scope of this document;
      however, many of the concepts described in this section should also apply to them.
62
      This may not be true for some devices, such as consumer electronics that do not use standard filesystems.
63
      In some cases, the filesystem may be “stored” in dynamic memory. The term memory filesystems refers to filesystems that
      reside only in a system’s memory. Such filesystems are considered volatile data. Filesystems, including an entire bootable
      OS implementation, may also reside on removable media such as flash drives.
64
      On Windows systems, many configuration settings reside in a set of special files known as the registry. For more
      information on the registry, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 256986, Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry,
      available at http://support.microsoft.com/?id=256986.
