                                                       GUIDE TO SECURITY FOR FULL VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGIES



1.    Introduction

1.1   Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency
Information Systems,” as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2   Purpose and Scope

The purpose of the guide is to discuss the security concerns associated with full virtualization
technologies for server and desktop virtualization, and to provide recommendations for addressing these
concerns. All forms of virtualization other than server and desktop full virtualization are outside the scope
of this document.

Most existing recommended security practices remain applicable in virtual environments. The practices
described in this document build on and assume the implementation of practices described in other NIST
publications.

1.3   Audience

The intended audience for this document is system and security administrators, security program
managers, information system security officers, and others who have responsibilities for or are otherwise
interested in the security of server or desktop full virtualization technologies.

This document assumes that readers have some operating system, networking, and security expertise.
Because of the constantly changing nature of full virtualization technologies, readers are encouraged to
take advantage of other resources (including those listed in this document) for more current and detailed
information.

1.4   Document Structure

The remainder of this document is organized into the following major sections:

 Section 2 presents an introduction to full virtualization technologies and describes server and desktop
  full virtualization.
