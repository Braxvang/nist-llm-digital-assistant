NIST published a practice guide–SP 1800-21, Mobile Device Security: Corporate-owned
Personally-Enabled (COPE)–for public comment [24]. The goal of the COPE project was
to provide an example solution that demonstrates how organizations can use a standards-
based approach and commercially available technologies to meet their security needs
for using mobile devices to access enterprise resources. Usability, privacy, and regulatory
requirements influence which mobile security technologies and security controls are going
to be well-suited to meet the needs of an organization’s mobility program. The sample
solution provides the details of tools for an enterprise mobility management (EMM)
capability located on-premises, including mobile threat defense (MTD), mobile threat
intelligence (MTI), application vetting, secure boot/image authentication, and virtual
private network (VPN) services. (See https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-

Advancing 5G Security
As the next generation of mobile broadband technology—the 5th Generation, or 5G—is
deployed in our nation and across the world, there is great promise of positive change
in the way humans and machines communicate, operate, and interact in the physical
and virtual world. With cellular technology becoming the primary way that devices
are connected, it is imperative for organizations to understand and address the risks
associated with the use of these technologies. As industry embarks on ubiquitous 5G
deployments, there are opportunities to take advantage of the various cybersecurity
technologies and capabilities that are available today. 5G introduces the concept of
a service-based architecture for the first time in cellular networks. This design has
fundamental impacts on the way network services are created and how the individual
network functions communicate. Not only is the core network decomposed into smaller
functional elements, but the communication between these elements is also expected
to be more flexible—routed via a common service bus and deployed using virtualization
technologies. It is envisioned that 5G network components are deployed on a hyper-
scalable, containerized, and virtualized infrastructure. While this is not the only approach
for 5G deployments, this infrastructure is a fundamental building block of 5G that
operators and manufacturers can adopt to meet the customers’ demands of modern
use cases. Secure deployment of the core network and radio access network services
on cloud-like infrastructures constitutes a foundational element of both commercial and
private 5G networks.
In FY 2019, NIST hosted a public workshop on 5G cybersecurity at the NCCoE. The purpose
of the workshop was to explore the practical and implementable cybersecurity capabilities
delivered by 5G systems, identify existing industry recommended practices for securing
the supporting infrastructure and technologies, and understand the potential opportunities
and challenges that affect the 5G evolution. The findings from this workshop will inform
the development of potential NCCoE demonstration projects to leverage 5G cybersecurity
capabilities and supporting technologies to protect the cellular communications network
and secure the core 5G underlying infrastructure and services.
