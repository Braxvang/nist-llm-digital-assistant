Computer Forensic Tool Testing
Computer Forensic Tool Testing (CFTT) is supported by the NIST Special Programs Office
and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In FY 2020, several key advances were
made to help address a critical need in the law enforcement community to ensure the
reliability of computer forensic tools. CFTT tested the attributes of numerous digital forensic
tools, and federated testing was developed to provide third parties with the ability to use the
NIST testing methodology in their own labs and produce standardized test reports. In FY
2020, NIST upgraded the core infrastructure and added 14 published reports.
Computer Forensic Reference Data Sets
Computer Forensic Reference Data Sets (CFReDS) is a repository of documented sets of
digital evidence. In FY 2020, the development of an improved portal began. The goal is for the
CFReDS website to be a centralized portal for the forensic community to find and share
datasets of interest. The Forensics Tool Catalog is a web-based, community-sourced catalog
of tools aided by a taxonomy.
National Software Reference Library
The National Software Reference Library (NSRL) collects software from various sources and
incorporates file profiles into a Reference Data Set (RDS) of information. The RDS can be used
by members of law enforcement, government, and industry to review computer files by
matching file profiles in the RDS. This helps alleviate the effort involved in determining which
files are important as evidence on computers or file systems seized as part of criminal
investigations. NSRL provides a research environment to promote the development of new
forensic techniques and other applications in computer science. In FY 2020, the NSRL
published four releases of software metadata and enlarged the collection to a combined total
of 798 million files.
