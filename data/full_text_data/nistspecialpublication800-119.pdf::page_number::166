                                                              GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


security parity during the IPv6 deployment. The security plan should address the following areas:

        Equipment configuration
        Perimeter defense (firewall, ACL, IDPS)
        Content filtering
        Mail filtering
        Patch management
        Vulnerability management (scanning)
        Certification and accreditation of the new systems
        AAA (authentication, authorization, and accounting)
        Rogue detection
        Infrastructure protocol security.
The coexistence plan documents which mechanisms support IPv6/IPv4 internetworking. The coexistence
plan details how IPv6 clients will access legacy IPv4 services (i.e., deployment of which translation
mechanisms) and how existing IPv4 clients will access IPv6 services. By planning the coexistence
mechanism in advance, an organization is able to leverage economy of scale and select technology that
can be a repeatable solution. This reduces the amount of required training and increases operator
familiarity with the mechanisms.

  6.9.3   Implementation Phase

The implementation phase involves the secure installation and configuration of IPv6 equipment, tunnels,
and translation mechanisms. The deployment stage differs depending on which deployment scenario is
used (IPv6 pervasive deployment or IPv6 sparse deployment). In both scenarios, the actual IPv6 roll out
involves a phased deployment. The first three steps are the same regardless of deployment scenario.

The steps for the IPv6 pervasive deployment are as follows:

    1. Enabling perimeter firewall IPv6 policies and IPv6 access control lists and configuring devices in
       accordance with security plan, standards, and procedures.
    2. Deploying external IPv6 connectivity with exterior IPv6 routing.
    3. Deploying basic IPv6 services (DNS, DHCPv6, and NTPv6).
    4. Deploying IPv6 interior routing.
    5. Enabling management monitoring (SNMP, service monitoring, IDPS, authentication, statistical
       monitoring, and netflow).
    6. Enabling IPv6 hosts.
    7. Deploying IPv6 to IPv4 translation mechanisms.

The steps for the IPv6 sparse deployment are as follows:


                                                  6-44
