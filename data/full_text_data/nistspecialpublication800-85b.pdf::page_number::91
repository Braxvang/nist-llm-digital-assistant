Special Publication 800-85B                                   PIV Data Model Testing Specification


Test Steps            1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                      2. Set OID := <<Card Holder Fingerprints
                         (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.96.16)>>
                      3. Call pivGetData w/
                         • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                      4. Extract the version field contents from the
                         CBEFF_SIGNATURE_BLOCK
                      5. Extract the certificates field contents from the
                         CBEFF_SIGNATURE_BLOCK (if present)
Expected              The value of the version field of the SignedData is v1 if the certificates
Result(s)             field is omitted and v3 if present.


10.2.1.3 Verify digest Algorithm in SignedData

Purpose               Confirm that the digestAlgorithms field of the SignedData content type is
                      in accordance with Table 3-3 of SP80078.
Reference(s)          1.      SP80078 , Section 3.2.1
                      2.      AS06.02.04
Precondition          1.      A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                      2.      A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and the
                              contact reader.
                      3.      The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                      4.      A valid card holder fingerprint object is present on the PIV card.
                      5.      A valid CHUID object is present on the PIV card.
