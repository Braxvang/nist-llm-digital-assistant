                                                                                             Access restrictions for change represent the enforcement side of SecCM. Configuration change
                                                                                             control is a process for funneling changes for a system through a managed process; however,
                                                                                             without access restrictions, there is nothing preventing someone from implementing changes
                                                                                             outside of the process. Access restrictions are a mechanism to enforce configuration control
                                                                                             processes by controlling who has access to the system and/or its constituent CIs to make changes.

                                                                                                     ii. Determine which individuals have privileged access and which of those privileged
                                                                                                          individuals are authorized to make what types of changes; and
                                                                                                     iii. Implement technical mechanisms (e.g., role-based access, file/group permissions, etc.)
                                                                                                          to ensure that only authorized individuals are able to make the appropriate changes.
