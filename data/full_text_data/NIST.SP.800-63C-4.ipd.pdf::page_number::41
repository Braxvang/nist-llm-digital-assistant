       NIST SP 800-63C-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                                      Federation and Assertions


1055   once access is no longer required by the RP for its functioning purposes or when the
1056   trust agreement is terminated.
1057   Any provisioning API provided to the RP SHALL be under the control and jurisdiction
1058   of the IdP. External attribute providers MAY be used as information sources by the IdP to
1059   provide attributes through this provisioning API, but the IdP is responsible for the content
1060   and accuracy of the information provided by the referenced attribute providers.
1061   When a provisioning API is in use, the IdP SHALL signal to the RP when a subscriber
1062   account has been terminated. When receiving such a signal, the RP SHALL terminate the
1063   associated RP subscriber account.

1064   5.4.4. Attribute Collection
1065   The RP MAY collect and maintain additional attributes from the subscriber beyond
1066   those provided by the IdP. These attributes are governed separately from any federation
1067   agreement since they are collected directly by the RP. All attributes associated with an
1068   RP subscriber account, regardless of their source, SHALL be removed when the RP
1069   subscriber account is terminated.
1070   The RP SHALL disclose to the subscriber the purpose for collection of any additional
1071   attributes. These attributes SHALL be used solely for the stated purposes of the RPâ€™s
1072   functionality and SHALL NOT have any secondary use, including communication of said
1073   attributes to other parties.
1074   An RP SHALL disclose any additional attributes collected, and their use, as part of its
1075   System of Records Notice (SORN). The RP SHALL provide an effective means of
1076   redress for the subscriber to update and remove these additionally-collected attributes
1077   from the RP subscriber account. See Sec. 10 on usability considerations for redress.

1078   5.4.5. Time-based Removal of RP Subscriber Accounts
1079   Over time, an RP could accumulate RP subscriber accounts that are no longer accessible
1080   from the IdP. This poses a risk to the RP for holding personal information in the RP
1081   subscriber accounts, especially when a just-in-time provisioning model is in use and
1082   no shared signaling is available from the IdP to signal subscriber account termination
1083   as discussed in Sec. 5.7. In such circumstances, the RP SHOULD employ a time-based
1084   mechanism to identify RP subscriber accounts for termination that have not been accessed
1085   after a period of time, for example, 120 days since last access.
1086   When processing such an inactive account, the RP SHALL provide sufficient notice to
1087   the subscriber, if possible, about the pending termination of the account and provide the
1088   subscriber with an option to re-activate the account prior to its scheduled termination.
1089   Upon termination, the RP SHALL remove all personal information associated with the
1090   RP subscriber account, except what is required for audit and security purposes.
