6.8.7 Personnel Security Compromise Recovery
The humans who are responsible for the correct and secure operation of a CKMS often
have the capability to compromise its security. However, a CKMS can be designed with
its own capabilities to minimize the likelihood of human compromises, detect the
compromises, minimize the negative consequences of the compromises, and efficiently
recover from the compromises.

A CKMS should be designed to:
   a) Minimize the ability of humans to cause security failures,
   b) Minimize the ability of humans to hide their actions that caused security failures,
   c) Help determine who or what caused the security failure (for example by
      maintaining audit records), and
   d) Mitigate the negative consequences of the failure.

Any detected security failure should result in the initiation of recovery procedures based
upon the Information Security Policy and the CKMS capabilities.

Typical responses include:
   e) The complete shut-down of the system,
   f) The activation of a backup facility and system with new keys,
   g) The notification of current and potential users of the possible security failure, or
   h) The flagging of the keys that were compromised.

In addition to the above responses, failures involving personnel compromise could vary
from administrative reprimands, to removal from the role or position and legal action
involving civil or criminal courts.

FR:6.117 The CKMS design shall specify any personnel compromise detection features
that are provided for each supported role.

FR: 6.118 The CKMS design shall specify any personnel compromise minimization
features that are provided for each supported role.

FR:6.119 The CKMS design shall specify the CKMS compromise recovery capabilities
that are provided for each supported role.

6.8.8 Physical Security Compromise Recovery
The physical security of a cryptographic module is discussed in Section 6.8.4, and the
general compromise of keys and metadata is discussed in Section 6.8.1 and Section 6.8.2,
respectively. However a physical security breach of a CKMS could involve compromises
other than the compromise of keys or cryptographic modules. If security-related logic
resides outside of the CKMS cryptographic modules, then the integrity of that logic also
should be protected. Typically, techniques similar to those used by the cryptographic
module are employed. Physical protection can be provided that prevents the potential
attacker from gaining physical access to the components and devices. Alternatively,
