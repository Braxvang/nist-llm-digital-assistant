         Note: This includes security criteria for gates, checkpoints, and entry/exit criteria for milestones
         and decision points.
         LM-1.5 Establish security criteria for the standard life cycle models for the organization,
                including criteria for outcomes for each stage.
         Note: The life cycle model comprises one or more stages, as needed, with each stage having
         security aspects to its purpose and outcomes. The model is assembled as a sequence of stages
         that overlap or iterate as appropriate for the scope of the system of interest, magnitude,
         complexity, changing needs, and opportunities (including protection needs and opportunities).

LM-2     ASSESS THE LIFE CYCLE PROCESS
         LM-2.1 Monitor the security aspects of process execution across the organization.
         Note: This includes the analysis of process measures and the review of security-relevant trends
         with respect to strategic security criteria, feedback from projects regarding the effectiveness
         and efficiency of the processes, and monitoring execution according to regulations and
         organizational policies.
         LM-2.2 Conduct reviews of the security aspects of the life cycle models used by the projects.
         Note: This includes confirming the suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness of the life cycle
         models used by the project. The reviews should be conducted periodically and be event-driven
         (e.g., at completions of large project milestones).
         LM-2.3 Identify security-relevant improvement opportunities from assessment results.

LM-3     IMPROVE THE PROCESS
         LM-3.1 Prioritize and plan for security-relevant improvement opportunities.
         LM-3.2 Implement security improvement opportunities, and inform relevant stakeholders.
         Note: This includes regulatory, certification, accreditation, acceptance, and similar stakeholders.
