5.      SSL VPN Recommended Practices

This section summarizes the information presented in the previous sections as a manageable and
actionable set of recommendations that organizations can implement to provide reasonable assurance that
their SSL VPN solutions are providing adequate security and are themselves secured properly. To be
effective, an SSL VPN should have its security considerations incorporated throughout the entire IT life
cycle, involving everything from policy to operations. This section references a five-phase life cycle
model to help organizations determine at what point in their SSL VPN deployments a recommended
practice might be relevant. The model is based on one introduced in NIST SP 800-64, Security
Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle 20 . Organizations may follow a project
management methodology or life cycle model that does not directly map to the phases in the model that is
presented in this section, but the types of tasks in the methodology and their sequencing are probably
similar.

Table 5-1 presents the recommended practices corresponding to the life cycle phases. Each
recommendation is accompanied by a brief explanation of the rationale for its inclusion and section
reference for more information, and is rated as recommended practice or should consider. Organizations
are strongly encouraged to adopt the recommended practices. Failure to implement them significantly
increases the risk of an SSL VPN security failure or makes it more difficult to assess the overall security
of the SSL VPN system. Organizations should also examine each of the should consider
recommendations to determine their applicability to the target environment. In general, should consider
measures enhance security beyond what can be achieved through the recommended practices. A should
consider should be rejected only if it is infeasible or if the reduction in risk from its implementation does
not justify its cost.
