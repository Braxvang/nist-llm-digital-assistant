response process. The major phases of the incident response process—preparation,
detection and analysis, containment/eradication/recovery, and post-incident activity,
are described in detail throughout the rest of this chapter. Figure 13-1 illustrates the
incident response life cycle.

13.1 Preparation
    Incident preparation involves not only establishing an incident response capability
so that the organization is ready to respond to incidents but also preventing incidents
by ensuring that systems, networks, and applications are afforded sufficient security.
Incident prevention is now considered a fundamental component of incident response
programs, also known as incident management programs, although the incident
response team is not typically responsible for it. The incident response team’s
expertise should be used to establish recommendations for securing systems and
preventing incidents, as much as possible. This section provides an overview of
actions needed to prevent and handle incidents, including incident data collection
preparation.

13.1.1 Preparing for Incident Response
     Organizing an effective incident response capability involves the participation of
many people within the organization. Making the right planning and implementation
decisions is key to establishing a successful incident response program. One of the
first planning tasks should be to develop an organization-specific definition of the
term “incident” so that the scope of the term is clear. Additional tasks that should
be performed during the preparation phase include the following:
   • Create an Incident Response Policy. The policy should define what events
     are considered incidents, establish the organizational structure for incident
     response, define roles and responsibilities, and list the organization’s incident
     reporting requirements.
   • Develop Incident Response and Reporting Procedures. Based on the
     incident response policy, standard operating procedures (SOPs) are a
     delineation of the specific technical processes, techniques, checklists, and forms
     used by the incident response team. SOPs should be comprehensive and
     detailed to ensure that the organization’s priorities are properly reflected in
     response operations. In addition, following standardized response procedures
     is also an effective way to minimize errors, particularly those that might be
     caused by incident handling pace and stress. Prior to implementation, the
     organization should test incident response SOPs in order to validate their
     accuracy and usefulness. Once validated, the SOPs must be widely
     disseminated throughout the organization. Incidents can occur in countless and
     unpredictable ways; therefore, it is impractical to develop comprehensive
     procedures with step-by-step instructions for handling every incident. The best
     that the organization can do is prepare to handle any type of incident, and
     more specifically, to handle common types of incidents.
   • Establish Guidelines for Communicating with External Parties. During
     the incident response process, the organization may need to communicate with
     outside parties, including other incident response teams, law enforcement, the
     media, vendors, and external victims. Because such communications often
     need to occur quickly, organizations should have predetermined communication
     guidelines so that only the appropriate information is shared with the right
     parties. If sensitive information is inappropriately released, it can lead to



                                                                                    125
