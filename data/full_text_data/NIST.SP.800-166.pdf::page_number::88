NIST SP 800-166                                                    DERIVED PIV APPLICATION AND
                                                                   DATA MODEL TEST GUIDELINES

                             •   P2, key reference value, is set to '80'
                             •   Data field of the command contains the correct
                                 PUK value concatenated without delimitation with
                                 a new correctly-formatted password value padded
                                 to 8 bytes with 'FF' (if necessary)
 Expected Result(s)   1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property template
                         with the status word '90 00'.
                      2. From Step 2, the command returns status word '63 CX' (X ==
                         number of retries left for the Derived PIV Application Password)
                      3. From Step 3, the command returns status word '63 CX' (where 'X'
                         indicates the number of further allowed retries for the PUK)
                      4. From Step 4, the command returns status word '63 CX' (where 'X' is
                         the number of retries remaining for the Derived PIV Application
                         Password. Verify that 'X' from this step is the same as 'X' from Step
                         2.
                      5. From Step 5, the command returns status word '63 CX' (where 'X'
                         indicates the number of further allowed retries for the PUK) and the
                         PUK’s retry counter is decremented each time. The command
                         returns status word '69 83' (reset operation blocked) when the
                         command is invoked after the value of 'X' becomes 0.
                      6. From Step 6, the command returns status word '69 83' (reset
                         operation blocked).
 Postcondition(s)     The Reset Retry Counter command is blocked.
