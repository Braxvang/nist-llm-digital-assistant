       collection must be a priority with stakeholders and users if the collected data
       is to be meaningful to management and faciliate improvement of the overall
       security program.

Q. What do information security metrics measure?
A. Metrics measure efficiency and effectiveness, implementation, and impact of
   security activities.

Q. What is the difference between developing and implementing a metrics
   program?
A. The metrics development process establishes the initial set of metrics and selects
   the metrics subset appropriate for an organization at a given time. The metrics
   program implementation process operates a metrics program that is iterative by
   nature and ensures that appropriate aspects of information security are
   measured for a specific time period.

Q. What are the activities that comprise the information security metrics
   process?
A. The information security metrics development process consists of two major
   activities:
       1. Identification and definition of the current information security program;
          and
       2. Development and selection of specific metrics to measure implementation,
          efficiency, effectiveness, and the impact of the security controls.

Q. What are the activities that comprise the information security
   implementation process?
A. The information security implementation process consists of six phases:
       1.   Prepare for data collection;
       2.   Collect data and analyze results;
       3.   Identify corrective actions;
       4.   Develop business case;
       5.   Obtain resources; and
       6.   Apply corrective actions.

Q. Can the use of a metrics program assist an organization with federal
   requirements or FISMA?
A. Yes. Information security metrics will assist in satisfying the annual FISMA
   reporting requirement by providing an infrastructure for organized data
   collection, analysis and reporting. Also, information security metrics can be used
   as input into Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Inspectors General
   (IG) audits. Implementation of an information security metrics program will
   demonstrate agency commitment to proactive security.

Q. Metrics help answer three basic questions, what are they?
A. Metrics are one element of a managerâ€™s toolkit for making and substantiating
   decisions. Metrics are used to answer three basic questions:
       1. Am I implementing the tasks for which I am responsible?
       2. How efficiently or effectively am I accomplishing those tasks?
