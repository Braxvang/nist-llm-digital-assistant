GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



 The EPC Manager ID, which uniquely identifies the organization that is responsible for assigning the
  object class and serial number bits (often the manufacturer of the item),
 The Object Class, which identifies a class of objects, such as a certain model of television set, and
 The Serial Number, which uniquely describes the instance of that class of objects (e.g., a particular
  television set).
Using a standard identifier format makes it easier for organizations to decode identifiers. When a
machine reads a standard identifier, it can parse the identifier and decode its fields. The machine may
need to request information from a remote computer to look up an identifier. When the database is
distributed across several organizations and many servers, a standard identifier format with specified
fields greatly facilitates the look up process. Therefore, standard identifier formats should be used
whenever an RFID system will be used across multiple organizations.

If an organization does not expect its tag identifiers to be read by external parties or is concerned that the
association of a tag with the organization or specific classes of objects is a business or privacy risk, then it
may choose to develop and implement its own identifier format that does not reveal this information.
Options include random or serialized identifiers that do not reveal information about the tagged item (e.g.,
its object class). Such identifiers can be encoded on many standards-based tags. These tags reserve
memory for standard identifier formats but the memory does not have to be used for that purpose.

The data format chosen for an RFID system should be adequate for the entire life cycle of the system.
Certain data formats may not have enough bits to uniquely encode all the tags that will be used in a
particular application. For example, a supply chain RFID system may need longer identifiers to identify
the large number of items that it will manage. The identifier data format also has security implications.
For example, standard formats such as EPC allow an adversary to quickly obtain intelligence about a
business activity by decoding the manager and object class fields. 4

2.3.1.2 Power Source

Tags need power to perform functions such as sending radio signals to a reader, storing and retrieving
data, and performing other computations (e.g., those needed for security mechanisms). Tags can obtain
this power from a battery or from electromagnetic waves emitted by readers that induce an electric current
in the tags. The power requirements of a tag depend on several factors, including the operating distance
between the tag and the reader, the radio frequency being used, and the functionality of the tag. In
general, the more complex the functions the tag supports, the greater its power requirements. For
example, tags that support cryptography or authentication require more energy than tags that are limited
to transmitting an identifier.

Tags are categorized into four types based on the power source for communication and other
functionality:

 Passive,
 Active,
 Semi-active, and
 Semi-passive.

    The US Department of Defense (DoD) has mitigated this risk by using a serialized single-field tag identifier. This serialized
    identifier does not reveal any information about the object with which it is associated.
