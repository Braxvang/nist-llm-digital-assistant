understanding/memorandum of agreement (MOU/MOA) between the organizations.
Specifically, the ISA documents the requirements for connecting the information
systems, describes the security controls that will be used to protect the systems and
data, contains a topological drawing of the interconnection, and provides a signature
line.
    The joint planning team should document an agreement governing the
interconnection and the terms under which the organizations will abide. The
agreement should be based on the team’s review of all relevant technical, security,
and administrative requirements identified and examined in Step 4.
    The MOU/MOA documents the terms and conditions for sharing data and
information resources. It defines the purpose of the interconnection, identifies
relevant authorities, specifies the responsibilities of each organization, defines the
apportionment of costs, and identifies the timeline for terminating or reauthorizing
the interconnection. In order to operate as an instrument that can be enforced by
any agency that is a party to the interconnection, the MOU/MOA must be signed by
an organization official, typically the authorizing official (AO). Lastly, because the ISA
and the MOU/MOA may contain sensitive information, the original document and any
copies should be protected appropriately against unauthorized disclosure or
modification, damage, or destruction.

Step 6: Approve or Reject System Interconnection
    The joint planning team should submit the ISA and the MOU/MOA to the AO of
each organization, requesting approval for the interconnection. Upon receipt, the
AOs should review the ISA, the MOU/MOA, and any other relevant documentation or
activities. Organizations may combine ISAs and MOU/MOAs to simplify their
management processes and reduce paperwork if these two documents fall within the
purview of the same AO. When combining ISAs and MOU/MOAs, organizations must
ensure that the contents and the intent of these two documents remain unaltered.
   Based on this review, the AOs should decide on one of the following:
   • Approve the interconnection;
   • Grant interim approval; or
   • Reject the interconnection.

6.2.2 Phase 2: Establishing the Interconnection
    After the system interconnection is planned and approved, it can be
implemented. The recommended steps for establishing the system interconnection
are provided in Figure 6-3.

Step 1: Develop an Implementation Plan
    To ensure that the information systems are connected properly and securely, the
joint planning team should develop a system interconnection implementation plan. At
a minimum, the implementation plan should:


                                                                                       50
