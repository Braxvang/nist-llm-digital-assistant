A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS




           where Φ is the Standard Normal Cumulative Probability Distribution Function as defined in
           Section 5.5.3.

           For the example in this section, P-value = 0.4116588.

2.13.5 Decision Rule (at the 1% Level)
If the computed P-value is < 0.01, then conclude that the sequence is non-random. Otherwise, conclude
that the sequence is random.


2.13.6 Conclusion and Interpretation of Results
Since the P-value obtained in step 4 of Section 2.13.4 is ≥ 0.01 (P-value = 0.411658), the conclusion is
that the sequence is random.

Note that when mode = 0, large values of this statistic indicate that there are either “too many ones” or
“too many zeros” at the early stages of the sequence; when mode = 1, large values of this statistic indicate
that there are either “too many ones” or “too many zeros” at the late stages. Small values of the statistic
would indicate that ones and zeros are intermixed too evenly.

2.13.7 Input Size Recommendation
It is recommended that each sequence to be tested consist of a minimum of 100 bits (i.e., n ≥ 100).

2.13.8 Example
(input)     ε = 11001001000011111101101010100010001000010110100011
                00001000110100110001001100011001100010100010111000

(input)            n = 100

(input)            mode = 0 (forward) || mode = 1 (reverse)

(processing)       z = 1.6 (forward) || z = 1.9 (reverse)

(output)           P-value = 0.219194 (forward) || P-value = 0.114866 (reverse)

(conclusion)       Since P-value > 0.01, accept the sequence as random.


2.14 Random Excursions Test

2.14.1 Test Purpose
The focus of this test is the number of cycles having exactly K visits in a cumulative sum random walk.
The cumulative sum random walk is derived from partial sums after the (0,1) sequence is transferred to
the appropriate (-1, +1) sequence. A cycle of a random walk consists of a sequence of steps of unit length
taken at random that begin at and return to the origin. The purpose of this test is to determine if the
number of visits to a particular state within a cycle deviates from what one would expect for a random
sequence. This test is actually a series of eight tests (and conclusions), one test and conclusion for each of
the states: -4, -3, -2, -1 and +1, +2, +3, +4.
