                                                              GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


6.       IPv6 Deployment

 This section suggests approaches to a successful and secure IPv6 deployment. Although this document
 uses the term deployment, rather than transition, many of the methods and mechanisms described in this
 section are referred to as transition mechanisms; to avoid confusion, this document also uses the word
 transition in that context. The overarching goal during the process of IPv6 deployment should be to
 maintain functional parity with existing networks and services. This section addresses that goal. IPv6
 deployment focuses on integrating IPv6 with an existing IPv4 environment while maintaining, if not
 enhancing, the existing level of security. It includes the following subjects:

          Security risks

          Addressing security

          Transition mechanisms

          Transition planning

6.1      Security Risks

This section provides an overview of risks organizations may face when moving from an IPv4 to
IPv4/IPv6 and eventually IPv6 environment.

The deployment of IPv6 is inevitable. The IPv4 address space is almost exhausted and the only long-term
solution is to deploy IPv6. IPv6 is not backwards compatible with IPv4, which means organizations will
have to change their network infrastructure and systems to deploy IPv6. Organizations should begin now
to understand the risks and the risk mitigation strategies. Planning will enable an organization to make a
smooth, secure and successful transition.
Some general risks an organization may face include:

 The attacker community’s use of IPv6
 Unauthorized deployment of IPv6 on existing IPv4 production networks
 Vulnerabilities present in IPv6, including ―day zero‖ vulnerabilities that are inherent in any new or
  revised system
 Complexity added by dual IPv4/IPv6 operations
 Immaturity of IPv6 security products and processes
 Possible lack of vendor support.
     6.1.1   Attacker Community

The attacker community is adapting to the IPv6 environment, posing a serious risk to all organizations
connected to the Internet. The attacker community leverages IPv6 to infiltrate and attack both IPv4 and
IPv6 networks. The publication of a United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT)
whitepaper48 and the public release of IPv6-enabled attack tools49 in May 2005 demonstrate how the

      One such tool is THC-IPv6.
