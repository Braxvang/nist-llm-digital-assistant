Recommendation for Applications Using Approved Hash
                    Algorithms


1 Introduction
A hash algorithm is used to map a message of arbitrary length to a fixed-length message
digest. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 180-4, the Secure Hash Standard
(SHS) [FIPS 180-4], specifies seven approved hash algorithms: SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-
256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256.
This Recommendation provides security guidelines for supporting the required or desired
security strengths of several cryptographic applications that employ the approved hash
functions specified in FIPS 180-4, such as digital signature applications specified in FIPS
186-3 [FIPS 186-3], Keyed-hash Message Authentication Codes (HMACs) specified in
FIPS 198-1 [FIPS 198-1] and Hash-based Key Derivation Functions specified in SP 800-
56A [SP 800-56A] and SP 800-56B [SP 800-56B]. While the use of hash functions in
HMAC-based key derivation functions is specified in SP 800-56C [SP 800-56C] and SP
800-108 [SP 800-108], these documents sufficiently address the security aspects of their
use, so discussions of SP 800-56C and SP 800-108 are not included herein.

2 Authority
This Recommendation has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal
Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347.
NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum
requirements, for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and
assets, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems.
This recommendation is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency Information
Systems, as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.
This Recommendation has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by
non-governmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright
(attribution would be appreciated by NIST).
Nothing in this Recommendation should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines
made mandatory and binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under
statutory authority. Nor should this Recommendation be interpreted as altering or
superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB,
or any other federal official.
