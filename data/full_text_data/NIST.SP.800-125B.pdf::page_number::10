2.      Network Segmentation Configurations for VM Protection

Network segmentation is an often-misunderstood technique. Some security practitioners view network
segmentation as being purely for network management purposes. However, other security practitioners
consider network segmentation as an integral part or at least a preliminary step of a defense-in-depth
network security strategy. Security standards such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
(PCI DSS) specifically cite network segmentation as a requirement for data protection. Similarly, network
segmentation is sometimes viewed as being synonymous with use of a virtual local area network
(VLAN), but this is inaccurate. This section identifies five distinct approaches to network segmentation,
with VLAN deployment being one of them.

The main motivation for network segmentation is to achieve logical separation for applications with
different sensitivity levels or belonging to different departments. The network segmentation approaches
discussed in this section are organized by their increasing order of scalability. The initial approach is to
host all applications of a given sensitivity level in one VM and host all VMs of the same sensitivity level
(based on hosted applications) in a given virtualized host (Section 2.1). This is not strictly a network
segmentation approach, since it does not involve configuring a network parameter, but it is still included
here because it meets the objective of providing VM protection. Sections 2.2 and 2.3 discuss approaches
for creating virtual network segments inside a virtualized host using virtual switches and virtual firewalls,
respectively. Truly scalable (data center-wide) approaches for creating virtual network segments that span
multiple virtualized hosts are discussed in Sections 2.4 and 2.5. These approaches are based on VLAN
and overlay-based virtual networking technologies, respectively.

2.1     Separating Virtualized Hosts

When enterprise applications of different sensitivity levels were first being hosted in VMs, the initial
network-based protection measure was to locate applications with different sensitivity levels in different
virtualized hosts. This isolation between applications was extended into the physical network of the data
center by connecting these virtualized hosts to different physical switches and regulating the traffic
between these physical switches using firewall rules. Alternatively, virtualized hosts carrying application
workloads of different sensitivity levels were mounted in different racks so that they were connected to
different top-of-rack (ToR) switches.

2.1.1    Advantages

The most obvious advantage of this approach to segmentation is the simplicity of network configuration
and the ease of network monitoring since traffic flowing into and out of VMs hosting workloads of
different sensitivity levels are physically isolated.

2.1.2    Disadvantages

The basic economic goal of full hardware utilization is unlikely to be realized when this approach is used
because only VMs with the appropriate sensitivity level may be placed onto a particular virtualized host.
This tends to negatively impact workload balancing for the data center as a whole. This approach will also
hamper flexibility in VM migration because the target host must be of the same sensitivity level as the
source host.
