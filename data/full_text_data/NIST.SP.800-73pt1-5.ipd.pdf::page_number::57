1206   B.1.3. Authentication Using Card Authentication Key
1207   Authentication mechanisms using the Card Authentication key are illustrated in Fig. 4 and Fig.
1208   5. Figure 4 illustrates the use of the mandatory asymmetric Card Authentication key, while Fig.
1209   5 uses the deprecated, optional symmetric Card Authentication key for the authentication
1210   mechanism. Note that the symmetric card authentication key has been deprecated in FIPS 201-3
1211   and MAY be removed in a future version of the standard.
