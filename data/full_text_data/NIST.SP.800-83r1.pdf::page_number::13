                                  GUIDE TO MALWARE INCIDENT PREVENTION AND HANDLING FOR DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS


2.      Understanding Malware Threats

Malware, also known as malicious code, refers to a program that is covertly inserted into another program
with the intent to destroy data, run destructive or intrusive programs, or otherwise compromise the
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim’s data, applications, or operating system. Malware is
the most common external threat to most hosts, causing widespread damage and disruption and
necessitating extensive recovery efforts within most organizations.

This section provides basic information on various forms of malware. It defines common terminology that
is used throughout the rest of the document, and it presents fundamental concepts of malware. It does not
attempt to explain how these different types of malware work in detail, but rather it highlights the basic
characteristics of each type of malware. This section first discusses attacker tools, which are often
delivered to targeted hosts via malware, and malware toolkits, which are used by attackers to construct
malware. The rest of the section examines forms of malware: traditional, phishing, web-based malware,
and advanced persistent threats.

2.1     Forms of Malware

Malware has become the greatest external threat to most hosts, causing damage and requiring extensive
recovery efforts within most organizations. The following are the classic categories of malware:

       Viruses. A virus self-replicates by inserting copies of itself into host programs or data files.
        Viruses are often triggered through user interaction, such as opening a file or running a program.
        Viruses can be divided into the following two subcategories:

          –   Compiled Viruses. A compiled virus is executed by an operating system. Types of compiled
              viruses include file infector viruses, which attach themselves to executable programs; boot
              sector viruses, which infect the master boot records of hard drives or the boot sectors of
              removable media; and multipartite viruses, which combine the characteristics of file infector
              and boot sector viruses.

          –   Interpreted Viruses. Interpreted viruses are executed by an application. Within this
              subcategory, macro viruses take advantage of the capabilities of applications’ macro
              programming language to infect application documents and document templates, while
              scripting viruses infect scripts that are understood by scripting languages processed by
              services on the OS.
       Worms. A worm is a self-replicating, self-contained program that usually executes itself without
        user intervention. Worms are divided into two categories:

          –   Network Service Worms. A network service worm takes advantage of a vulnerability in a
              network service to propagate itself and infect other hosts.

          –   Mass Mailing Worms. A mass mailing worm is similar to an email-borne virus but is self-
              contained, rather than infecting an existing file.
       Trojan Horses. A Trojan horse is a self-contained, nonreplicating program that, while appearing
        to be benign, actually has a hidden malicious purpose. Trojan horses either replace existing files
        with malicious versions or add new malicious files to hosts. They often deliver other attacker
        tools to hosts.
