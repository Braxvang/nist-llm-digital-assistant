Artificial Intelligence
NIST contributes to the research, standards, evaluation, and data required to advance the
development, use, and governance of trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI). NIST aims to
cultivate trust in the design, development, and use of AI technologies and systems by improving
measurement science, technology, standards, and related tools in ways that enhance economic
security and improve the quality of life.
AI and machine learning (ML) are already changing the ways in which society addresses
economic and national security challenges and opportunities, and these technologies must
be developed and used in a trustworthy and responsible manner. Characteristics that support
trustworthiness include accuracy, explainability, interpretability, reliability, privacy, robustness,
safety, security (resilience), and the mitigation of harmful bias. Principles such as transparency,
fairness, and accountability should be considered, especially during deployment and use.
Trustworthy data, standards, evaluation, validation, and verification are critical for the successful
deployment of new technologies for genomics, image and video processing, materials, natural
language processing, robotics, wireless spectrum monitoring, and more.
Delivering the needed measurements, standards, and other tools is a primary focus of NIST’s
portfolio of AI efforts. It is an area in which the agency has special responsibilities and expertise
and for which others often turn to NIST for guidance. The agency’s AI goals and activities are
prioritized and informed by its statutory mandates, White House directives, and the needs
expressed by U.S. industry, other federal agencies, and the global AI research community.
NIST's continued AI work is aligned with five broad goals:
    1. Conduct fundamental research to advance trustworthy AI technologies.
    2. Apply AI research and innovation across the NIST Laboratory Programs.
    3. Establish benchmarks and develop data and metrics to evaluate AI technologies.
    4. Lead and participate in the development of technical AI standards.
    5. Contribute to discussions and development of AI policies.
NIST will continue to collaborate with commercial, academic, and public-sector partners to
pursue these goals and collectively advance the security and trustworthiness of this important
and emerging technology.
