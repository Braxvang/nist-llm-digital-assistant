stronger implementations than WEP and TKIP. Accordingly, NIST requires the use of CCMP for Federal
agencies. For legacy IEEE 802.11 equipment that does not provide CCMP, auxiliary security protection
is required; one possibility is the use of an IPsec VPN, using FIPS-approved cryptographic algorithms.
NIST SP 800-48 contains specific recommendations for securing legacy IEEE 802.11 implementations. 46
