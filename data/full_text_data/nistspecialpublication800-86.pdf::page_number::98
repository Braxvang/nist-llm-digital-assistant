GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



          efforts should be familiar with and understand the forensic policy. Additional policy
          considerations are as follows:

          –    Forensic policy should clearly define the roles and responsibilities of all people performing or
               assisting with the organization’s forensic activities. The policy should include all internal
               and external parties that may be involved and should clearly indicate who should contact
               which parties under different circumstances.

          –    The organization’s policies, guidelines, and procedures should clearly explain what forensic
               actions should and should not be performed under normal and special circumstances and
               should address the use of anti-forensic tools and techniques. Policies, guidelines, and
               procedures should also address the handling of inadvertent exposures of sensitive
               information.

          –    Incorporating forensic considerations into the information system life cycle can lead to more
               efficient and effective handling of many incidents.

          –    The organization’s policies should address inadvertent disclosures and long-term storage of
               sensitive information captured by forensic tools, and should ensure that this does not violate
               the organization’s privacy or data retention policies.

          –    The organization’s policies should also address the monitoring of networks, as well as
               requiring warning banners on systems that indicate that activity might be monitored. The
               policies should take into account reasonable expectations of user privacy.
      ! Organizations should create and maintain guidelines and procedures for performing
        forensic tasks. The guidelines should include general methodologies for investigating an
        incident using forensic techniques, and step-by-step procedures should explain how to perform
        routine tasks. The guidelines and procedures should support the admissibility of evidence into
        legal proceedings. Because electronic logs and other records can be altered or otherwise
        manipulated, organizations should be prepared, through their policies, guidelines, and procedures,
        to demonstrate the reliability and integrity of such records. The guidelines and procedures should
        also be reviewed regularly and maintained so that they are accurate.
A.1.3         Technical Preparation

      ! Analysts should have a forensic toolkit for data collection, examination, and analysis. It
        should contain various tools that provide the ability to collect and examine volatile and non-
        volatile data and to perform quick reviews of data as well as in-depth analysis. The toolkit should
        allow its applications to be run quickly and efficiently from removable media (e.g., floppy disk,
        CD) or a forensic workstation.

      ! Organizations should provide adequate storage for network activity–related logs.
        Organizations should estimate typical and peak log usage, determine how many hours or days’
        worth of data should be retained based on the organization’s policies, and ensure that systems and
        applications have sufficient storage available. Logs related to computer security incidents might
        need to be kept for a substantially longer period of time than other logs.
A.2       Performing the Forensics Process

      ! Organizations should perform forensics using a consistent process. This guide presents a
        four-phase forensics process, with collection, examination, analysis, and reporting phases. The
        exact details of the phases may vary based on the need for forensics.
