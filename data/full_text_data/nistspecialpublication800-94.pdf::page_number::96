GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



 The staff needed to monitor and maintain an IDPS. Some IDPSs are designed under the
  assumption that personnel will be available to monitor and maintain them around the clock. If
  evaluators do not anticipate having such personnel available, they may wish to explore those systems
  that accommodate less than full-time attendance or are designed for unattended use, or they could
  consider the possibility of outsourcing the monitoring and possibly also the maintenance of the
  IDPS. 53
9.2     Security Capability Requirements

In addition to defining general requirements, as described in Section 9.1, evaluators also need to define
more specialized sets of requirements. This section specifically addresses security capability
requirements. Sections 9.3 through 9.5 discuss performance, management, and life cycle cost
requirements, respectively. The criteria in these sections are presented as possible evaluation criteria and
are not intended to be used as-is for performing product evaluations. Instead, organizations could use
them as a basis for creating an organization-specific set of criteria that takes into account an
organization’s environment, policies, and existing security and network infrastructure. Section 9.6
provides additional information on performing IDPS evaluations.

Evaluating the security capabilities of each IDPS product is obviously very important. If the product
cannot provide the necessary capabilities, then it ultimately is insufficient as a security control alone, and
either a different product should be selected or the product should be used in conjunction with other
security controls, such as a different IDPS product. This section presents IDPS security capability
considerations in four categories: information gathering, logging, detection, and prevention. Section 9.6
provides guidance on collecting data on IDPS security capabilities as part of an evaluation.

9.2.1     Information Gathering Capabilities

Organizations should identify the information gathering capabilities needed for their IDPS’s detection
methodologies and analysis functions, and evaluate each IDPS product under consideration for its ability
to offer those capabilities. Information on information gathering capabilities for each type of IDPS
technology are presented in Sections 4 through 7.

9.2.2     Logging Capabilities

Organizations should carefully examine the event and alert logging capabilities of each IDPS solution
being evaluated. The quality of logging, both completeness and precision, affects an organization’s
ability to perform analysis, confirm the accuracy of alerts, and correlate logged events with events
recorded by other sources (e.g., other security controls, OS logs). IDPS products should log basic
information at a minimum, such as a timestamp, the event type, the source of the event, and the sensor or
agent that detected the event. Each IDPS product should also log supporting data involving the details of
the event; these data fields are specific to particular IDPS product types, and common data fields are
listed in Sections 4 through 7. IDPS products should also provide a mechanism that allows users to
associate each log entry with corresponding external references, including Common Vulnerabilities and




53
      If portions of the IDPS will be or might be outsourced, organizations should ensure that their product requirements reflect
      outsourcing-specific requirements, such as limiting the actions that the outsourcers can perform and performing auditing of
      their actions.
