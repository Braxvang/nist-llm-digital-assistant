time lapses from the last full backup, requiring more processing time and storage than would an
incremental backup. Generally, full backups are performed less frequently (weekly to monthly or when a
significant change occurs), and incremental or differential backups are performed more frequently (daily
to weekly). The frequency of backups will be determined by several factors:

 Volatility of information on the Web site

     Static Web content (less frequent backups)

     Dynamic Web content (more frequent backups)

     E-commerce/e-government (very frequent backups)

 Volatility of configuring the Web server

 Amount of data to be backed up

 Backup device and media available

 Time available for dumping backup data

 Criticality of data

 Threat level faced by the Web server

 Effort required for data reconstruction without data backup

 Other data backup or redundancy features of the Web server (e.g., Redundant Array of Inexpensive
  Disks [RAID]).

9.2.2   Maintain a Test Web Server

Most organizations will probably wish to maintain a test or development Web server. Ideally, this server
should have hardware and software identical to the production or live Web server and be located on an
internal network segment (intranet) where it can be fully protected by the organization’s perimeter
network defenses. Although the cost of maintaining an additional Web server is not inconsequential,
having a test Web server offers numerous advantages:

 It provides a platform to test new patches and service packs prior to application on the production
  Web server.

 It provides a development platform for the Webmaster and Web server administrator to develop and
  test new content and applications.

 It provides a platform to test configuration settings before applying them to production Web servers.

 Software critical for development and testing but that might represent an unacceptable security risk
  on the production server can be installed on the development server (e.g., software compliers,
  administrative tool kits, remote access software).

The test Web server should be separate from the server that maintains an authoritative copy of the content
on the production Web server (see Section 9.2.3).
