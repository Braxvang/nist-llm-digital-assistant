NIST researchers performed software benchmarking using available implementations of the
candidates, evaluated their performance on various microcontrollers, and compared them against
the NIST AES-GCM and SHA-256 standards. (AES-GCM is the Advanced Encryption Standard
algorithm with Galois Counter Mode. SHA-256 is the 256-bit Secure Hash Algorithm.) NIST
researchers also published research results on the security of the candidates and design trends
in lightweight cryptography.
NIST announced 10 finalists for the last round of evaluation in March 2021. Details of the selection
process were published in the Status Report on the Second Round of the NIST Lightweight
Cryptography Standardization Process (NISTIR 8369). This report included a summary of
each second-round candidate and their main features, third-party security analysis, software
benchmarking on microcontrollers, and hardware benchmarking results on various architectures.
NIST plans to host the Fifth Lightweight Cryptography Workshop in May 2022. After further security
analysis and performance benchmarking of the finalists, NIST intends to select the winner and add
a new cryptographic standard to NIST’s portfolio.
Cryptographic Programs and Laboratory Accreditation
Cryptographic Security Testing laboratories are vital to ensuring that government systems protected
by cryptography meet the validation requirements. There are currently 22 laboratories around
the world certified through the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP). To
better assess tester proficiency knowledge across all laboratories, the Cryptographic Validation
Program (CVP) Certification Exam was revamped to update the older Federal Information
Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 exam and incorporate the 2019 FIPS 140-3 standard’s unique
requirements.
Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP)
When the use of cryptography is needed for the protection of sensitive unclassified information,
federal agencies must use validated cryptographic modules. The Cryptographic Module
Validation Program (CMVP) was created to support the federal user community’s need for strong,
independently tested, and commercially available cryptographic modules. Working with U.S.
and Canadian agencies, NIST has incorporated standards from international organizations that
represent both public and private sectors within the cryptographic community.
To assist the community, the CMVP put a process in place by which labs/vendors could
request an extension until March 31, 2022 for submission of FIPS 140-2 reports that could
not meet the previously specified September 2021 deadline. Until that deadline, the CMVP is
managing a dual validation process for both FIPS 140-2 and FIPS 140-3 validations. Over 300
FIPS 140-2 certificates have been awarded in FY 2021. The first FIPS 140-3 submissions are
being reviewed, and only FIPS 140-3 submissions for new validations will be accepted after
March 31, 2022.
A number of elements of the current validation processes are manual in nature, and the period
required for third-party testing and government validation of cryptographic modules is often
incompatible with industry requirements. Federal users and others who depend on validated
cryptography face a dilemma when frequent updates and patches are essential for staying ahead
of attackers, but the existing CMVP validation process does not permit rapid implementation of
these updates while maintaining a validated status. NIST has started a broad effort through the
National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) to modernize and automate its cryptographic
validation programs. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the value and practicality of
