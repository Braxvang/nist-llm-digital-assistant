                                                                                                 Attributes are characteristics of the subject, object, or environment conditions. Attributes contain

                                                                                                 A subject is a human user or NPE, such as a device that issues access requests to perform operations
                                                                                                 on objects. Subjects are assigned one or more attributes. For the purpose of this document, assume
                                                                                                 that subject and user are synonymous.
