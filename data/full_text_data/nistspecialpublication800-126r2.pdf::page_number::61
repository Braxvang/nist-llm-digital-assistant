E2. The schema for the namespace “http://scap.nist.gov/schema/asset-reporting-
    format/1.1” has been updated to align with the ARF specification.

Date: November 29, 2011                              Type: Technical                                 Location: P. 5, Table 1

Description:
In the ARF schema the line

to make it consistent with the specification.
