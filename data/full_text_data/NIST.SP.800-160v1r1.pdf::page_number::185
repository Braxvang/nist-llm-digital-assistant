PM-2     EVALUATE THE PORTFOLIO OF PROJECTS
         PM-2.1 Evaluate the security aspects of projects to confirm ongoing viability.
         Note: This includes the following:
         - The project is progressing toward achieving established security goals and objectives.
         - The project is complying with project security directives.
         - The project is being conducted according to the security aspects of project life cycle policies,
            processes, and procedures.
         - The project remains viable, as indicated by the continuing need for security services,
            practical secure product implementation, and acceptable security-driven investment
            benefits.
         PM-2.2 Act to continue projects that are satisfactorily progressing in consideration of project
                security aspects.
         PM-2.3 Act to redirect projects that can be expected to progress satisfactorily with
                appropriate security-informed redirection.

PM-3     TERMINATE PROJECTS
         PM-3.1 Where agreements permit, act to cancel or suspend projects whose security-driven
                disadvantages or security-driven risks to the organization outweigh the benefits of
                continued investments.
         PM-3.2 After completion of the agreement for the security aspects of products or services, act
                to close the projects.
         Note: Closure is accomplished in accordance with organizational security policies, procedures,
         and the agreement.
