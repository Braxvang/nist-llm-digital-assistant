1832   3.13.12. Collaborative Computing Devices and Applications
1833              REQUIREMENT: 03.13.12
1834              a. Prohibit remote activation of collaborative computing devices and applications.
1835              b. Provide an explicit indication of use to users physically present at the devices.

1836              DISCUSSION
1837              Collaborative computing devices include white boards, microphones, and cameras. Indication
1838              of use includes notifying users (e.g., a pop-up menu stating that recording is in progress, or
1839              that the microphone has been turned on) when collaborative computing devices are activated.
1840              Dedicated video conferencing systems, which typically rely on one of the participants calling
1841              or connecting to the other party to activate the video conference, are excluded. Solutions to
1842              prevent device usage include webcam covers and buttons to disable microphones.

1846   3.13.13. Mobile Code
1847              REQUIREMENT: 03.13.13
1848              a. Define acceptable mobile code and mobile code technologies.
1849              b. Authorize, monitor, and control the use of mobile code.

1850              DISCUSSION
1851              Mobile code includes software programs or parts of programs obtained from remote systems,
1852              transmitted across a network, and executed on a local system without explicit installation or
1853              execution by the recipient. Decisions regarding the use of mobile code within the system are
1854              based on the potential for the code to cause damage to the system if used maliciously. Mobile
1855              code technologies include Java applets, JavaScript, HTML5, VBScript, and WebGL. Usage
1856              restrictions and implementation guidelines apply to the selection and use of mobile code
1857              installed on servers and mobile code downloaded and executed on individual workstations and
1858              devices, including notebook computers, smart phones, and smart devices. Mobile code policy
1859              and procedures address the actions taken to prevent the development, acquisition, and use of
1860              unacceptable mobile code within the system, including requiring mobile code to be digitally
1861              signed by a trusted source.
