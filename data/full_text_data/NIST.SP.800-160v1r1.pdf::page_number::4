NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                             Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022



Abstract
This publication describes a basis for establishing principles, concepts, activities, and tasks for
engineering trustworthy secure systems. Such principles, concepts, activities, and tasks can be
effectively applied within systems engineering efforts to foster a common mindset to deliver
security for any system, regardless of the system’s purpose, type, scope, size, complexity, or the
stage of its system life cycle. The intent of this publication is to advance systems engineering in
developing trustworthy systems for contested operational environments (generally referred to as
systems security engineering) and to serve as a basis for developing educational and training
programs, professional certifications, and other assessment criteria.

Reports on Computer Systems Technology
The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
with industry, government, and academic organizations.
