Enterprise architecture also promotes the concepts of segmentation, redundancy, and elimination
of single points of failure—all concepts that can help organizations more effectively manage risk.
Segmentation is important because it allows organizations to separate missions/business functions
and operations and the information systems, system components, or subsystems supporting those
missions, functions, and operations from other functions and operations and supporting systems.
Segmentation helps to define more manageable components and to potentially reduce the degree
of harm from a successful threat exploitation of a vulnerability. Segment architecture supports the
concept of segmentation at the highest levels of organizations and the concept is carried forward
through solution architecture (including decomposition of information systems and networks into
subsystems and subnetworks, as appropriate).

The concept of redundancy is also very important in enterprise architecture. With the high
probability of breaches or compromises when threats exploit vulnerabilities in organizational
information systems, the failure or degradation of one or more information system components is
inevitable. To enhance information system resilience as part of risk response, organizational
information systems provide a failover mode that helps to ensure that failed components trigger
appropriate backup components with similar capability. This type of capability is essential to
address the advanced persistent threat in situations where organizations might be required to
operate while under cyber attack in a degraded mode but still providing a sufficient level of
capability to achieve mission/business success. Segment and solution architectures support the
concept of redundancy by establishing a disciplined and structured approach to developing and
implementing key architectural considerations that facilitate replication of critical information
system components, where appropriate.

Finally, the concept of single point of failure and the elimination of such failure points is easily
supported by enterprise architecture. Having the essential visibility and transparency provided in
the architectural design at the organization level exposes potential single points of failure early in
the development process. Thus, single points of failure are effectively addressed by segment and
solution architectures. Failure to address potential single points of failure early in the architectural
design can result in severe or catastrophic effects when those failure points are propagated to
information systems and the actual failure causes a loss of mission/business capability.

2.4.3 Information Security Architecture
The information security architecture is an integral part of the organization’s enterprise
architecture. It represents that portion of the enterprise architecture specifically addressing
information system resilience and providing architectural information for the implementation of
security capabilities.37 The primary purpose of the information security architecture is to ensure
that mission/business process-driven information security requirements are consistently and cost-
effectively achieved in organizational information systems and the environments in which those
systems operate consistent with the organizational risk management strategy.38 The information
security architecture also incorporates security requirements from legislation, directives, policies,
regulations, standards, and guidance into the segment architecture. Ultimately, the information
security architecture provides a detailed roadmap that allows traceability from the highest-level
strategic goals and objectives of organizations, through specific mission/business protection
needs, to specific information security solutions provided by people, processes, and technologies.

37
   In general, a version of an information security architecture exists for each of the enterprise architecture reference
models; including Performance, Business, Service Component, Data, and Technical.
38
  Organizations employ sound system and security engineering principles and techniques to ensure that information
security requirements are effectively implemented in organizational information systems.
