13. Incident Response
    Attacks on information systems and networks have become more numerous,
sophisticated, and severe in recent years. While preventing such attacks would be
the ideal course of action for organizations, not all information system security
incidents can be prevented. Every organization that depends on information systems
and networks to carry out its mission should identify and assess the risks to its
systems and its information and reduce those risks to an acceptable level. 78 An
important component of this risk management process is the trending analysis of
past computer security incidents and identifying effective ways to deal with them. A
well-defined incident response capability helps the organization detect incidents
rapidly, minimize loss and destruction, identify weaknesses, and restore information
technology (IT) operations rapidly.
    The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) specifically directs
federal agencies to develop and implement procedures for detecting, reporting, and
responding to security incidents. In addition, OMB 79 directs federal agencies to
identify in their FISMA report any incidents (physical or electronic) involving the loss
of or unauthorized access to personally identifiable information (PII) and report them
according to the policies outlined in OMB Memorandum. 80 Federal civilian agencies
are responsible for reporting all computer security incidents to the United States
Computer Emergency Response Team (US-CERT) in the Department of Homeland
Security and for documenting the corrective actions taken and their impact.
Specifically, agencies are responsible for reporting all incidents involving PII to the
(US-CERT) within one hour of discovering the incident. Further, policy guidance
issued by the OMB in Circular No. A-130, Appendix III, requires that agencies have a
capability to provide help to users after a system security incident occurs, and to
share information concerning common vulnerabilities and threats.
