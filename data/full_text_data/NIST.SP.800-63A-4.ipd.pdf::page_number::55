       NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines

1410   for applicants to find and access.
1411   The Privacy Act requires federal CSPs that maintain a system of records to follow
1412   procedures to enable applicants to access and, if incorrect, amend their records. Any
1413   Privacy Act Statement should include a reference to the applicable SORN(s) (see
1414   Sec. 5.1.2), which provide the applicant with instructions on how to make a request for
1415   access or correction. Non-federal CSPs should have comparable procedures, including
1416   contact information for any third parties if they are the source of the information.
1417   CSPs should make the availability of alternative methods for completing the process clear
1418   to applicants (e.g., in person at a customer service center) in the event an applicant is
1419   unable to establish their identity and complete the registration process online.
1420         Note: If the identity proofing process is not successful, CSPs should inform
1421         the applicant of the procedures to address the issue but should not inform the
1422         applicant of the specifics of why the registration failed (e.g., do not inform
1423         the applicant, “Your SSN did not match the one that we have on record for
1424         you”), as doing so could allow fraudulent applicants to gain more knowledge
1425         about the accuracy of the PII.

1426   8.5. Privacy Risk Assessment
1427   The guidelines require the CSP to conduct a privacy risk assessment. In conducting a
1428   privacy risk assessment, CSPs should consider:
1429      1. The likelihood that the action it takes (e.g., additional verification steps or records
1430         retention) could create a problem for the applicant, such as invasiveness or
1431         unauthorized access to the information; and
1432      2. The impact if a problem did occur. CSPs should be able to justify any response it
1433         takes to identified privacy risks, including accepting the risk, mitigating the risk,
1434         and sharing the risk. The use of applicant consent should be considered a form
1435         of sharing the risk, and therefore should only be used when an applicant could
1436         reasonably be expected to have the capacity to assess and accept the shared risk.

1437   8.6. Agency-Speciﬁc Privacy Compliance
1438   The guidelines cover specific compliance obligations for federal CSPs. It is critical
1439   to involve your agency’s SAOP in the earliest stages of digital authentication system
1440   development to assess and mitigate privacy risks and advise the agency on compliance
1441   requirements, such as whether or not the PII collection to conduct identity proofing
1442   triggers the Privacy Act of 1974 [PrivacyAct] or the E-Government Act of 2002 [E-Gov]
1443   requirement to conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment. For example, with respect to
1444   identity proofing, it is likely that the Privacy Act requirements will be triggered and
1445   require coverage by either a new or existing Privacy Act system of records due to the
