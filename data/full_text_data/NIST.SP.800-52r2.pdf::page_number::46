NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                            GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


To mitigate attacks against CBC mode, TLS implementations that support versions prior to TLS
1.3 shall use the bad_record_mac error to indicate a padding error. Implementations shall
compute the MAC regardless of whether padding errors exist. TLS implementations should
support constant-time decryption or near constant-time decryption. This does not apply to TLS
1.3 implementations as they do not support cipher suites that use CBC mode.

4.3.2       Validated Cryptography

The client shall use validated cryptography as described for the server in Section 3.3.3.

The validated random number generator shall be used to generate the random bytes (32 bytes in
TLS 1.3; 28 bytes in prior TLS versions) of the client random value. The validated random
number generator should be used to generate the 4-byte timestamp of the client random value for
TLS versions prior to TLS 1.3.

4.4        TLS Extension Support

In general, it is advised that clients only be configured to support extensions that are required for
interoperability or enhance security. Extensions that are not needed should not be enabled.

4.4.1       Mandatory TLS Extensions

The client shall be configured to use the following extensions:

      1.    Renegotiation Indication
      2.    Server Name Indication
      3.    Extended Master Secret
      4.    Signature Algorithms
      5.    Certificate Status Request

4.4.1.1 Renegotiation Indication

Applies to TLS versions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2

The Renegotiation Indication extension is required by these guidelines as described in Section
3.4.1.1. Clients shall perform the initial and subsequent renegotiations in accordance with RFC
5746 [59].

4.4.1.2 Server Name Indication

Applies to TLS versions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3

The server name indication extension is described in Section 3.4.1.2. The client shall be capable
of including this extension in a ClientHello message as described in RFC 6066 [29].
