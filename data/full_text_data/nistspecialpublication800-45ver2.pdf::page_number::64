GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



ORB spam control is not foolproof. Open relays are connected and disconnected regularly. Mail server
administrators who wish to participate in the policing effort may submit UCE complaints to Web sites
provided in Appendix E.

6.4   Authenticated Mail Relay

As mentioned previously, configuring mail relay authentication decreases the likelihood of someone
using a particular mail server to send spam. An added benefit of implementing authenticated relay is
increased security and usability.

Two methods are available for controlling mail relay. The first is to control the subnet or domain from
which messages are being sent. This method is effective if the perimeter of the messaging system resides
within known address ranges. However, if remote users have hosts with different address ranges, this
method is not useful. To accommodate remote users, a more robust configuration is needed.

The second method is to require users to authenticate themselves before sending any messages. This is
commonly referred to as authenticated relay, or SMTP AUTH, which is the SMTP extension that supports
user authentication. Unfortunately, the default configuration of most mail servers does not implement
authenticated relay; therefore, mail server administrators must configure the server appropriately.
Requiring authenticated relay is one of the least used but most powerful security features of mail servers.
(Refer to manufacturer documentation for configuring SMTP AUTH.)

Mail server administrators must use caution if choosing to have an authenticated relay. An improperly
configured mail server could be exploited and used to send or relay spam. If the mail server is found to
be an open relay, it might be put on a blacklist (as described in Section 6.3). Any organizations
subscribing to and using these blacklists will not be able to receive any email from a blacklisted server,
whether the messages are spam or valid emails.

If a mail server administrator learns that one of his or her mail servers is on a blacklist, the administrator
will have to fix the open relay problem and perform testing to ensure the server is no longer relaying. The
administrator then needs to determine which blacklists the server is on and check with each blacklist
maintainer to get instructions on how to remove the server from the lists. Until the server has been
removed from all blacklists and the updated blacklists have been propagated to their subscribers,
outbound email from the organization may not reach all of its recipients. See Appendix D for a listing of
Web sites that provide open relay testing tools as well as the maintainers of commonly used blacklists.

6.5   Secure Access

In Section 2, different mail transport and mailbox access protocols were discussed. Like many Internet
protocols, most of these protocols did not initially incorporate any form of encryption or cryptographic
authentication. These deficits posed three problems for email users. First, for users sending messages,
the contents could be intercepted and read at any host on the path between the sender and recipient or
even forged or modified. An apt paradigm from “regular” mail would be a postcard. Any person who
handles the postcard could read the message on the back. Second, the recipients could not verify that
messages were not modified by others during transit or actually originated by the sender. Third, rather
than supplying non-reusable authentication information, a user accessing a mailbox would send a
password over the network in the clear, which could be easily observed and reused by an attacker.
Unfortunately, in most default configurations, mail clients are set up to send the user’s password in the
clear, allowing it to be intercepted by other computers on the local network segment of the client or any
host responsible for forwarding the password to the mail server.
