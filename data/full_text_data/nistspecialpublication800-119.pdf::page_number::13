                                                               GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


1.    Introduction

1.1   Authority

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002,
Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; but such standards and
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems. This guideline is consistent with the requirements
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), ―Securing Agency
Information Systems,‖ as analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental
information is provided in A-130, Appendix III.

This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by nongovernmental
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired.

Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory and
binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these
guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce,
Director of the OMB, or any other Federal official.

1.2   Purpose and Scope

The purpose of Guidelines for the Secure Deployment of IPv6 is to provide information security guidance
to organizations that are planning to deploy IPv6 technologies or are simply seeking a better
understanding of IPv6. The scope of this document encompasses the IPv6 protocol and related protocol
specifications. IPv6-related security considerations are discussed with emphasis on deployment-related
security concerns. The document also includes general guidance on secure IPv6 deployment and
integration planning.

1.3   Audience

This document is intended primarily for network engineers and administrators who are responsible for
planning, building, and operating IP networks, as well as security engineers and administrators who are
responsible for providing Information Assurance support. Anyone interested in deploying IPv6
technologies and related security implications may also find the document useful. It includes a discussion
of the major features and protocols that constitute IPv6. For each of these, the description is comprised of
an introductory section, a more in-depth description, and three analytical sections: differences between
the IPv4 and the IPv6 versions, security ramifications and unknown aspects. Managers or users who are
trying to understand IPv6 might want to skip the in-depth descriptions but read the other sections
(Introduction, Differences, Security Ramifications and Unknown Aspects). They should also read Section
1 (Introduction) and Sections 6.8-6.9 (IPv6 Deployment). It is assumed that readers are already familiar
with basic IPv4, data networking, and network security concepts.
