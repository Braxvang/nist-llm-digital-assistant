                                                           CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



                      Compliance with NIST Standards and Guidelines

NIST develops and issues standards, guidelines, and other publications to assist federal agencies in
implementing the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 and in managing cost-
effective programs to protect their information and information systems.

      •    Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are developed by NIST in accordance with
           FISMA. FIPS are approved by the Secretary of Commerce and are compulsory and binding for
           federal agencies. Since FISMA requires that federal agencies comply with these standards,
           agencies may not waive their use.

      •    Guidance documents and recommendations are issued in the NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-
           series. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policies (including OMB FISMA Reporting
           Instructions for the Federal Information Security Management Act and Agency Privacy
           Management) state that, for other than national security programs and systems, agencies must
           follow NIST guidance. 1

      •    Other security-related publications, including NIST interagency and internal reports (NISTIRs)
           and ITL Bulletins, provide technical and other information about NIST’s activities. These
           publications are mandatory only when so specified by OMB.

    While agencies are required to follow NIST guidance in accordance with OMB policy, there is flexibility within NIST’s
    guidance in how agencies apply the guidance. Unless otherwise specified by OMB, the 800-series guidance documents
    published by NIST generally allow agencies some latitude in the application. Consequently, the application of NIST guidance
    by agencies can result in different security solutions that are equally acceptable, compliant with the guidance, and meet the
    OMB definition of adequate security for federal information systems. When assessing federal agency compliance with NIST
    guidance, auditors, evaluators, and assessors should consider the intent of the security concepts and principles articulated
    within the particular guidance document and how the agency applied the guidance in the context of its specific mission
    responsibilities, operational environments, and unique organizational conditions.
