3.1.1   Attack Monitoring

Organizations should continuously monitor their WLANs for both WLAN-specific and general (wired
network) attacks. The latter involves the same security controls as would be used for any network-
connected system in an organization; see [SP800-53] for additional information on general system
security and [SP800-94] for general information on attack detection technologies. Further discussion of
general (non-wireless) attack monitoring is out of the scope of this publication.

WLAN-specific attacks can typically be divided into two types: passive and active. These attack classes,
which are significant for monitoring purposes, are described below.

       Passive attack: an attack in which an unauthorized party only monitors WLAN communications;
        the attacker does not generate, alter, or disrupt WLAN communications. There are two types of
        passive attacks:

        o   Eavesdropping. The attacker monitors WLAN data transmissions for message content.

        o   Traffic analysis (also known as traffic flow analysis). The attacker gains intelligence by
            monitoring the transmissions for patterns of communication. A considerable amount of
            information is contained in the flow of messages between communicating parties.

       Active attack: an attack in which an unauthorized party generates, alters, or disrupts WLAN
        communications. Active attacks may take the form of one of the following types:

        o   Masquerading. The attacker impersonates an authorized user to gain access to certain
            unauthorized privileges.

        o   Replay. The attacker monitors transmissions (passive attack) and retransmits messages
            posing as the legitimate user.

        o   Message modification. The attacker alters a legitimate message by deleting, adding to,
            changing, or reordering the message.

        o   Denial of service (DoS). A DoS can occur inadvertently, such as other electronic devices
            causing interference, or it can occur intentionally, such as an attacker sending large numbers
            of messages at a high rate to flood the WLAN.

        o   Misappropriation. The attacker steals or makes other unauthorized use of WLAN services.

A form of active attack that is particularly noteworthy is the deployment of rogue WLAN devices. For
example, an attacker deploys an AP that has been configured to appear as part of an organization’s
WLAN infrastructure. This can provide a backdoor into the wired network, bypassing perimeter security
mechanisms, such as firewalls. In addition, if client devices inadvertently connect to the rogue AP, the
attacker can view and manipulate the client devices’ communications (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks), as
well as potentially gaining access to the client devices themselves.

Monitoring WLAN-specific attacks is focused on active attacks. Because passive attacks strictly involve
intercepting radio transmissions and do not generate their own transmissions, there is nothing for an
organization to monitor electronically. However, all forms of active attack mentioned above can be
detected through monitoring. Section 3.2 discusses tools that can monitor for active attacks.
