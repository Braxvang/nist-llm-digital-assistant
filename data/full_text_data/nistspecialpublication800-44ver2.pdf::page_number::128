       Completed                                                 Action
                      Plan the configuration and deployment of the Web server
                      Identify functions of the Web server
                      Identify categories of information that will be stored, processed, and transmitted
                      through the Web server
                      Identify security requirements of information
                      Identify how information is published to the Web server
                      Identify the security requirements of other hosts involved (e.g., backend database or
                      Web service)
                      Identify a dedicated host to run the Web server
                      Identify network services that will be provided or supported by the Web server
                      Identify the security requirements of any additional services provided or supported by
                      the Web server
                      Identify how the Web server will be managed
                      Identify users and categories of users of the Web server and determine privilege for
                      each category of user
                      Identify user authentication methods for the Web server and how authentication data
                      will be protected
                      Identify how access to information resources will be enforced
                      Identify appropriate physical security mechanisms
                      Identify appropriate availability mechanisms
                      Choose appropriate OS for Web server
                      Minimal exposure to vulnerabilities
                      Ability to restrict administrative or root level activities to authorized users only
                      Ability to control access to data on the server
                      Ability to disable unnecessary network services that may be built into the OS or server
                      software
                      Ability to control access to various forms of executable programs, such as CGI scripts
                      and server plug-ins
                      Ability to log appropriate server activities to detect intrusions and attempted intrusions
                      Provision of a host-based firewall capability
                      Availability of experienced staff to install, configure, secure, and maintain OS
                      Choose appropriate platform for Web server
                      General purpose OS
                      Trusted OS
                      Web server appliance
                      Pre-hardened OS and Web server
                      Virtualized platform
