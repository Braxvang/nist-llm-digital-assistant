6.2.3 Variable-Value Configuration coverage
      So far we have only considered measures of the proportion of combinations for
which all configurations of t variables are fully covered. But when t variables with v
values each are considered, each t-tuple has vt configurations. For example, in pairwise (2Â­
way) coverage of binary variables, every 2-way combination has four configurations: 00,
01, 10, 11. We can define two measures with respect to configurations:

Definition. For a given combination of t variables, variable-value configuration coverage
is the proportion of variable-value configurations that are covered.

Definition. For a given set of n variables, (p, t)-completeness is the proportion of the C(n,
t) combinations that have configuration coverage of at least p [50].

Example. For Figure 16 above, there are C(4, 2) = 6 possible variable combinations and
C(4,2)22 = 24 possible variable-value configurations. Of these, 19 variable-value
configurations are covered and the only ones missing are ab=11, ac=11, ad=10, bc=01,
bc=10. But only two, bd and cd, are covered with all 4 value pairs. So for the basic
definition of simple t-way coverage, we have only 33% (2/6) coverage, but 79% (19/24) for
the configuration coverage metric. For a better understanding of this test set, we can
compute the configuration coverage for each of the six variable combinations, as shown in
Figure 17. So for this test set, one of the combinations (bc) is covered at the 50% level,
three (ab, ac, ad) are covered at the 75% level, and two (bd, cd) are covered at the 100%
level.    And, as noted above, for the whole set of tests, 79% of variable-value
configurations are covered. All 2-way combinations have at least 50% configuration
coverage, so (.50, 2)-completeness for this set of tests is 100%.

        Although the example in Figure 17 uses variables with the same number of values,
this is not essential for the measurement. Coverage measurement tools that we have
developed compute coverage for test sets in which parameters have differing numbers of
values, as shown in Figure 18 and Figure 19.
