      NIST SP 800-157r1 ipd                            Derived PIV Credentials (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


721   Appendix A.      Digital Signature and Key Management Keys
722   This appendix is informative.
723   In addition to the PIV authentication keys, [FIPS201] also requires each PIV Card to
724   have a digital signature key and a key management key unless the cardholder does not
725   have a government-issued email account at the time of credential issuance. A subscriber
726   who has been issued a derived PIV credential may also need a digital signature and key
727   management key.
728   For most subscribers, it will be necessary to store a copy of the PIV Card’s key
729   management private key and certificate in the keystore that hosts the derived PIV
730   credential. Similarly, copies of some or all of the PIV Card’s retired key management
731   private keys and certificates should be stored in the derived PIV credential keystore.
732   Neither [FIPS201] nor [COMMON] precludes a key management private key from being
733   used on more than one device (e.g., the PIV Card and a derived PIV credential keystore)
734   as long as all of the requirements of the policy under which the key management
735   certificate was issued are satisfied. This means that in order to use a copy of a key
736   management private key in a [FIPS140] Level 1 software cryptographic module, the
737   corresponding certificate would have to be issued under a certificate policy, such
738   as id-fpki-common-policy, that does not require the use of a [FIPS140] Level 2
739   hardware cryptographic module. This should be taken into account at the time that the
740   key management certificate that will be placed on the PIV Card is issued. Key recovery
741   mechanisms are encouraged for key management keys that will be used on derived PIV
742   credential keystores.
743   As the digital signature key on a PIV Card cannot be copied, a new digital signature
744   private key will need to be generated and a corresponding certificate will need to be
745   issued for the derived PIV credential keystore. The issuance of this private key and
746   certificate is independent of the issuance of the PIV Card. As the certificate policies
747   associated with digital signature certificates in [COMMON] (id-fpki-common-policy,
748   id-fpki-common-hardware, and id-fpki-common-High) are not limited to use with
749   PIV Cards, a digital signature certificate for a derived PIV credential keystore may be
750   issued under one of these policies as long as all of the policy requirements are satisfied.
