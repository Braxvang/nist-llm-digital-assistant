     Routers. Routers may be configured to permit or block certain types of network traffic based on
      a policy. Routers that block traffic are usually configured to log only the most basic
      characteristics of blocked activity.
     Firewalls. Like routers, firewalls permit or block activity based on a policy; however, firewalls
      use much more sophisticated methods to examine network traffic.6 Firewalls can also track the
      state of network traffic and perform content inspection. Firewalls tend to have more complex
      policies and generate more detailed logs of activity than routers.
     Network Quarantine Servers. Some organizations check each remote host’s security posture
      before allowing it to join the network. This is often done through a network quarantine server
      and agents placed on each host. Hosts that do not respond to the server’s checks or that fail the
      checks are quarantined on a separate virtual local area network (VLAN) segment. Network
      quarantine servers log information about the status of checks, including which hosts were
      quarantined and for what reasons.
Figure 2-1 contains several examples of security software log entries.7
