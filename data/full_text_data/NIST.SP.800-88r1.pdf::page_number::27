NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                Guidelines for Media Sanitization


 4.4 Control of Media

A factor influencing an organizational sanitization decision is who has control and access to the
media. This aspect must be considered when media leaves organizational control. Media control may
be transferred when media are returned from a leasing agreement or are being donated or resold to be
reused outside the organization. The following are examples of media control:
Under Organization Control:

      Media being turned over for maintenance are still considered under organization control
       if contractual agreements are in place with the organization and the maintenance provider
       specifically provides for the confidentiality of the information.

      Maintenance being performed on an organization’s site, under the organization’s
       supervision, by a maintenance provider is also considered under the control of the
       organization.

Not Under Organization Control (External Control):

      Media that are being exchanged for warranty, cost rebate, or other purposes and where
       the specific media will not be returned to the organization are considered to be out of
       organizational control.

 4.5 Data Protection Level

Even within an organization, varying data protection policies may be established. For instance, a
company may have an engineering department and a sales department. The sales personnel may
not have a need for access to the detailed proprietary technical data such as source code and
schematics, and the engineers may not have a need to access the PII of the company’s customers.
Both might be within the same confidentiality categorization, but contextually different and with
different internal and external rules regarding necessary controls. As such, data protection level
is a complementary consideration to organizational control. When identifying whether
sanitization is necessary, both the organizational control and data protection level should be
considered.

 4.6 Sanitization and Disposal Decision

Once an organization completes an assessment of its system confidentiality, determines the need
for information sanitization, determines appropriate time frames for sanitization, and determines
the types of media used and the media disposition, an effective, risk-based decision can be made
on the appropriate and needed level of sanitization. Again, environmental factors and media type
might cause the level of sanitization to change. For example, purging paper copies generally does
not make sense, so destroying them would be an acceptable alternative.

Upon completion of sanitization decision making, the organization should record the decision
and ensure that a process and proper resources are in place to support these decisions. This
process is often the most difficult piece of the media sanitization process because it includes not
only the act of sanitization but also the verification: capturing decisions and actions, identifying
resources, and having critical interfaces with key officials.
