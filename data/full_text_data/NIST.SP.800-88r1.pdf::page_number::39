NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                                 Guidelines for Media Sanitization



   Clear:           Perform a full manufacturerâ€™s reset to reset the office equipment to its factory default settings.

   Purge:           See Destroy. Most office equipment only offers capabilities to Clear (and not Purge) the
                    data contents. Office equipment may offer Purge capabilities, but these capabilities are
                    specific to the hardware and firmware of the device and should be applied with caution.
                    Refer to the device manufacturer to identify whether the device has a Purge capability that
                    applies media-dependent techniques (such as rewriting or block erasing) or Cryptographic
                    Erase to ensure that data recovery is infeasible, and that the device does not simply
                    remove the file pointers. Office equipment may have removable storage media, and if so,
                    media-dependent sanitization techniques may be applied to the associated storage device.


   Destroy:         Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:           For both Clear and (if applicable) Purge, manually navigate to multiple areas of the device (such
                    as stored fax numbers, network configuration information, etc.) to verify that no personal
                    information has been retained on the device.
                    For both Clearing and (if applicable) Purge, the ink, toner, and associated supplies (drum, fuser,
                    etc.) should be removed and destroyed or disposed of in accordance with applicable law,
                    environmental, and health considerations. Some of these supplies may retain impressions of
                    data printed by the machine and therefore could pose a risk of data exposure, and should be
                    handled accordingly. If the device is functional, one way to reduce the associated risk is to print a
                    blank page, then an all-black page, then another blank page. For devices with dedicated color
                    components (such as cyan, magenta, and yellow toners and related supplies), one page of each
                    color should also be printed between blank pages. The resulting sheets should be handled at
                    the confidentiality of the Office Equipment (prior to sanitization). Note that these procedures do
                    not apply to supplies such as ink/toner on a one-time use roll, as they are typically not used again
                    and therefore will not be addressed by sending additional pages through the equipment. They
                    will, however, still need to be removed and destroyed. Office Equipment supplies may also pose
                    health risks, and should be handled using appropriate procedures to minimize exposure to the
                    print components and toner.
                    For both Clear and (if applicable) Purge, refer to the manufacturer for additional information on
                    the proper sanitization procedure.



                                        Table A-5: Magnetic Media Sanitization


   Magnetic Media

   Floppies

   Clear:           Overwrite media by using organizationally approved software and perform verification on the
                    overwritten data. The Clear pattern should be at least a single write pass with a fixed data value,
                    such as all zeros. Multiple write passes or more complex values may optionally be used.

   Purge:           Degauss in an organizationally approved degausser rated at a minimum for the media.


   Destroy:         Incinerate floppy disks and diskettes by burning in a licensed incinerator or Shred.


   Magnetic Disks (flexible or fixed)

   Clear:           Overwrite media by using organizationally approved software and perform verification on the
                    overwritten data. The Clear pattern should be at least a single write pass with a fixed data value,
                    such as all zeros. Multiple write passes or more complex values may optionally be used.
