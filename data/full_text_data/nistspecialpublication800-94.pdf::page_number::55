    malicious activity. If the IDPS only needs to monitor a single band and channel, a bundled solution
    might provide reasonable security and network availability. If the IDPS has to monitor multiple
    bands or channels, then the sensor needs to perform channel scanning, which will disrupt the AP
    functions of the sensor by making it temporarily unavailable on its primary band and channel.
 Bundled with a Wireless Switch. Wireless switches are intended to assist administrators with
  managing and monitoring wireless devices; some of these switches also offer some wireless IDPS
  capabilities as a secondary function. Wireless switches typically do not offer detection capabilities as
  strong as bundled APs or dedicated sensors.
Because dedicated sensors can focus on detection and do not need to carry wireless traffic, they typically
offer stronger detection capabilities than wireless sensors bundled with APs or wireless switches.
However, dedicated sensors are often more expensive to acquire, install, and maintain than bundled
sensors because bundled sensors can be installed on existing hardware, whereas dedicated sensors involve
additional hardware and software. Organizations should consider both security and cost when selecting
wireless IDPS sensors.

Some vendors also have host-based wireless IDPS sensor software that can be installed on STAs, such as
laptops. The sensor software detects attacks within range of the STAs, as well as misconfigurations of the
STAs, and reports this information to management servers. The sensor software may also be able to
enforce security policies on the STAs, such as limiting access to wireless interfaces. More information on
host-based IDPS products is presented in Section 7.

5.2.2   Network Architectures

Wireless IDPS components are typically connected to each other through a wired network, as shown in
Figure 5-2. As with a network-based IDPS, a separate management network or the organizationâ€™s
standard networks can be used for wireless IDPS component communications. Because there should
already be a strictly controlled separation between the wireless and wired networks, using either a
management network or a standard network should be acceptable for wireless IDPS components. Also,
some wireless IDPS sensors (particularly mobile ones) are used standalone and do not need wired
network connectivity.
