                    Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems


3. Plan Development
The remainder of this document guides the reader in writing a system security plan,
including logical steps which should be followed in approaching plan development,
recommended structure and content, and how to maximize the use of current NIST
publications to effectively support system security planning activity. There should be
established agency policy on how the information system security plans are to be
controlled and accessed prior to initiation of the activity.


3.1 System Name and Identifier
The first item listed in the system security plan is the system name and identifier. As
required in OMB Circular A-11, each system should be assigned a name and unique
identifier. Assignment of a unique identifier supports the agency's ability to easily collect
agency information and security metrics specific to the system as well as facilitate
complete traceability to all requirements related to system implementation and
performance. This identifier should remain the same throughout the life of the system
and be retained in audit logs related to system use.


3.2 System Categorization
Each system identified in the agency's system inventory must be categorized using FIPS
199. NIST Special Publication 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and
Information Systems to Security Categories, provides implementation guidance in
completing this activity. See Table 1 for a summary of FIPS 199 categories.


3.3 System Owner
A designated system owner must be identified in the system security plan for each
system. This person is the key point of contact (POC) for the system and is responsible
for coordinating system development life cycle (SDLC) activities specific to the system.
It is important that this person have expert knowledge of the system capabilities and
functionality. The assignment of a system owner should be documented in writing and
the plan should include the following contact information:

   •   Name
   •   Title
   •   Agency
   •   Address
   •   Phone Number
   •   Email Address
