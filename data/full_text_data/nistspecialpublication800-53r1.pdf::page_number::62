FAMILY: ACCESS CONTROL                                                                     CLASS: TECHNICAL


AC-1      ACCESS CONTROL POLICY AND PROCEDURES

          Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a formal,
          documented, access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
          management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and (ii)
          formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and
          associated access controls.
          Supplemental Guidance: The access control policy and procedures are consistent with applicable
          laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The access
          control policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for the
          organization. Access control procedures can be developed for the security program in general, and
          for a particular information system, when required. NIST Special Publication 800-12 provides
          guidance on security policies and procedures.
          Control Enhancements: None.

AC-2      ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

          Control: The organization manages information system accounts, including establishing, activating,
          modifying, reviewing, disabling, and removing accounts. The organization reviews information
          system accounts [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least annually].
          Supplemental Guidance: Account management includes the identification of account types (i.e.,
          individual, group, and system), establishment of conditions for group membership, and assignment
          of associated authorizations. The organization identifies authorized users of the information
          system and specifies access rights/privileges. The organization grants access to the information
          system based on: (i) a valid need-to-know/need-to-share that is determined by assigned official
          duties and satisfying all personnel security criteria; and (ii) intended system usage. The
          organization requires proper identification for requests to establish information system accounts
          and approves all such requests. The organization specifically authorizes and monitors the use of
          guest/anonymous accounts and removes, disables, or otherwise secures unnecessary accounts.
          Account managers are notified when information system users are terminated or transferred and
          associated accounts are removed, disabled, or otherwise secured. Account managers are also
          notified when usersâ€™ information system usage or need-to-know/need-to-share changes.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to support the management of information
                system accounts.
          (2)   The information system automatically terminates temporary and emergency accounts after
                [Assignment: organization-defined time period for each type of account].
          (3)   The information system automatically disables inactive accounts after [Assignment: organization-
                defined time period].
          (4)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to audit account creation, modification,
                disabling, and termination actions and to notify, as required, appropriate individuals.
