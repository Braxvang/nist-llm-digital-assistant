                                                                  COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE



 Budget enough funding to maintain, enhance, and expand proficiency in technical areas and security
  disciplines, as well as less technical topics such as the legal aspects of incident response. This should
  include sending staff to conferences and encouraging or otherwise incentivizing participation in
  conferences, ensuring the availability of technical references that promote deeper technical
  understanding, and occasionally bringing in outside experts (e.g., contractors) with deep technical
  knowledge in needed areas as funding permits.
 Give team members opportunities to perform other tasks, such as creating educational materials,
  conducting security awareness workshops, and performing research.
 Consider rotating staff members in and out of the incident response team, and participate in
  exchanges in which team members temporarily trade places with others (e.g., network administrators)
  to gain new technical skills.
 Maintain sufficient staffing so that team members can have uninterrupted time off work (e.g.,
  vacations).
 Create a mentoring program to enable senior technical staff to help less experienced staff learn
  incident handling.
 Develop incident handling scenarios and have the team members discuss how they would handle
  them. Appendix A contains a set of scenarios and a list of questions to be used during scenario
  discussions.
Incident response team members should have other skills in addition to technical expertise. Teamwork
skills are of fundamental importance because cooperation and coordination are necessary for successful
incident response. Every team member should also have good communication skills. Speaking skills are
important because the team will interact with a wide variety of people, and writing skills are important
when team members are preparing advisories and procedures. Although not everyone within a team needs
to have strong writing and speaking skills, at least a few people within every team should possess them so
the team can represent itself well in front of others.

2.4.4   Dependencies within Organizations

It is important to identify other groups within the organization that may need to participate in incident
handling so that their cooperation can be solicited before it is needed. Every incident response team relies
on the expertise, judgment, and abilities of others, including:

 Management. Management establishes incident response policy, budget, and staffing. Ultimately,
  management is held responsible for coordinating incident response among various stakeholders,
  minimizing damage, and reporting to Congress, OMB, the General Accounting Office (GAO), and
  other parties.
 Information Assurance. Information security staff members may be needed during certain stages of
  incident handling (prevention, containment, eradication, and recovery)—for example, to alter network
  security controls (e.g., firewall rulesets).
 IT Support. IT technical experts (e.g., system and network administrators) not only have the needed
  skills to assist but also usually have the best understanding of the technology they manage on a daily
  basis. This understanding can ensure that the appropriate actions are taken for the affected system,
  such as whether to disconnect an attacked system.
