SP 800-152                                                             A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


                               A Federal CKMS shall support all the key types and lengths
PR:6.1
                               required by its FCKMS Security Policy.

6.1.2 Key Protections
All keys managed by an FCKMS require integrity protection. Secret and private keys also
require confidentiality protection. FIPS-validated cryptographic modules have been designed
to provide this protection when used in accordance with the associated security policy.
However, when outside a FIPS-validated cryptographic module, either physical or logical
protection is required for these keys. Cryptographic protection is one form of logical
protection.

                 SC-8          A Federal CKMS shall physically or logically protect all
PR:6.2
                 SC-11         cryptographic keys from unauthorized disclosure, use, and
                 SC-12         modification.
                 SC-28
                               A Federal CKMS shall support the protection of keys at the
PR:6.3
                               same or a higher impact-level than the data to be protected by
                               the keys.
                 SC-8          A Federal CKMS used to protect Moderate or High impact-
PR:6.4
                 SC-11         level information shall cryptographically protect all keys
                 SC-12         against unauthorized disclosure and modification when outside
                 SC-28         a cryptographic module.

                 SC-8          A Federal CKMS used to protect Low impact-level
PA:6.1
                 SC-11         information should cryptographically protect all keys against
                 SC-12         unauthorized disclosure and modification when outside a
                 SC-28         cryptographic module.

6.1.3 Key Assurance
When cryptographic keys and domain parameters4 are stored or distributed, they may pass
through unprotected environments. In this case, specific assurances are required before the
key and/or domain parameters may be used to perform cryptographic operations. Assurance
of integrity is needed for all keys and metadata. Assurance of possession is needed for both
secret and private keys. Assurance of domain parameter validity is needed for certain public-
key algorithms. Assurance of validity is needed for symmetric keys and the key pairs of
public-key algorithms (which includes pairwise consistence). See [SP 800-89], [SP 800-56A]
and [SP 800-56B] for further discussion. Other assurances that may be needed include source
authenticity.

 Note that domain parameters used in conjunction with some public-key algorithms to generate key pairs, to
create digital signatures, or to establish keying material, should not be confused with security domains.
