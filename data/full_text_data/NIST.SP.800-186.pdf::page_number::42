each pair of points. In particular, for each point P = (x1, y1) on the twisted Edwards curve Ea,d,
point doubling yields the point Q = 2P, where Q = (x, y) and

Note that (0, 1) is the identity element since for each point P = (x, y) on the twisted Edwards
curve Ea,d, one has P + (0, 1) = (x, y) + (0, 1) = (x, y) = P.
For each point P = (x, y) on the twisted Edwards curve EA,B, the inverse point −P is the point (-x,
y), and one has P + (−P) = (0, 1). The point (0, −1) has order 2.

A.2.1. Group Law for Weierstrass Curves
For each point P on the Weierstrass curve Ba,b, the point at infinity ∅ serves as the identity
element (i.e., P + ∅ = ∅ + P = P).
For each point P = (x, y) on the Weierstrass curve Ba,b, the point −P is the point (x, x + y), and
one has P + (−P) = ∅.
Let P1 = (x1, y1) and P2 = (x2, y2) be points on the Weierstrass curve Ba,b, where P1 ≠ ± P2, and let
Q = P1 + P2. Then, Q = (x, y), where
  𝑥𝑥 = λ2 + λ + 𝑎𝑎 − 𝑥𝑥1 − 𝑥𝑥2 and 𝑦𝑦 = λ(𝑥𝑥1 + 𝑥𝑥) − 𝑥𝑥 − 𝑦𝑦1 , where λ = (𝑦𝑦2 + 𝑦𝑦1 )/(𝑥𝑥2 + 𝑥𝑥1 ).
Let P = (x1, y1) be a point on the Weierstrass curve Ba,b, where P ≠ − P, and let Q = 2P. Then, Q =
(x, y), where
                                     𝑏𝑏
        𝑥𝑥 = λ2 + λ + 𝑎𝑎 = 𝑥𝑥12 +        and 𝑦𝑦 = λ(𝑥𝑥1 + 𝑥𝑥) − 𝑥𝑥 − 𝑦𝑦1 , where λ = 𝑥𝑥1 + 𝑦𝑦1 /𝑥𝑥1 .
