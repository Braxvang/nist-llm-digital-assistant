3.     Signing and Encrypting Email Messages

Organizations often want to protect the confidentiality and integrity of some of their email messages, such
as preventing the exposure of personally identifiable information in an email attachment. Email messages
can be protected by using cryptography in various ways, such as the following:

 Sign an email message to ensure its integrity and confirm the identity of its sender.
 Encrypt the body of an email message to ensure its confidentiality.
 Encrypt the communications between mail servers to protect the confidentiality of both the message
  body and message header.
The first two methods, message signing and message body encryption, are often used together. For
example, if a message needs to be encrypted to protect its confidentiality, it is usually digitally signed as
well, so that the recipient can ensure the integrity of the message and verify the identity of the signer.
Messages that are digitally signed are usually not encrypted if the confidentiality of the contents does not
need to be protected.

The third cryptography method listed above, encrypting the transmissions between mail servers, is
typically applicable only when two organizations want to protect emails regularly sent between them. For
example, the organizations could establish a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt the
communications between their mail servers over the Internet. Unlike methods that can only encrypt a
message body, a VPN can encrypt entire messages, including email header information such as senders,
recipients, and subjects. In some cases, organizations may need to protect header information. However,
a VPN solution alone cannot provide a message signing mechanism, nor can it provide protection for
email messages along the entire route from sender to recipient. 7

Because most email messages are protected individually by digitally signing and optionally encrypting
them, this section focuses on the use of these methods. The most widely used standards for signing
messages and encrypting message bodies are Open Pretty Good Privacy (OpenPGP) and
Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME). 8 Both are based in part on the concept of
public key cryptography, which involves a user having a pair of related keys: a public key that anyone can
hold, and a private key that is held exclusively by its owner. Because public key cryptography is so
computationally intense, it is used sparingly in email security; symmetric key cryptography, which is
much more efficient, is much more heavily used.

Symmetric key cryptography requires a single key to be shared between communicating parties, the
sender and recipient of an email message. The process involves the sender generating a random key and
encrypting the message with it using a symmetric key encryption algorithm. The sender then encrypts the
symmetric key with a corresponding public key encryption algorithm using the recipientâ€™s public key, and
sends both the encrypted message and encrypted symmetric key together to the recipient. This hybrid
process uses public key encryption only to encrypt the symmetric key. Because only the intended
message recipient holds the private key that is needed to recover the symmetric key, no other party can
decrypt the message and read it. Digital signature techniques rely on the creation of a digest or

     Many other methods for protecting emails have been proposed since the invention of email. Two of these mechanisms were
     Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM), first developed in 1987, and MIME Object Security Services (MOSS). Since neither
     method is broadly used today, they are not discussed in this document.
