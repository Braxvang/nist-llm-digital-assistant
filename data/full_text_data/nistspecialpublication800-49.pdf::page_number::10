                               Federal S/MIME V3 Client Profile


ESS section discusses requirements for ESS conformance. The optional features and notes on
testing section specifies desirable, but optional features for S/MIME client implementations as
well as useful notes for testing. These features will be useful to “power” users, but fall outside
the core services required to support mainstream S/MIME users. The references section provides
current URL as well as document titles when documents are on-line. The non-normative
appendix on cryptographic algorithms provides guidance on cryptographic algorithms.


2 S/MIME Profile Requirements

Important S/MIME interoperability and security features are identified in this section. First,
underlying technologies are examined, including cryptography, public key infrastructure (PKI),
and formatting of cryptographically protected data. The following subsection describes
requirements in these areas. Using these technologies, S/MIME clients perform two fundamental
operations: they generate electronic mail messages and process electronic mail messages. The
second and third sections describe the minimum functionality for S/MIME message generation
and reception, respectively.

Conformant implementations MUST be able to generate and process signed, encrypted, and
signed and encrypted messages as detailed in the paragraphs that follow. Conformant
implementations MUST be able to support all of the mandatory clauses of the IETF RFCs 2630,
2632, and 2633 with the exception that implementation of RFC 2631 Ephemeral-Static Diffie-
Hellman Key Agreement [RFC2631] algorithm mandated in [RFC2630] is NOT required by this
Profile. However, implementation of the Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement
algorithm in RFC 2631 is recommended. The terms “MUST,” “SHOULD,” and “MAY” are
used as defined in RFC 2119 [MUSTSHOULD].

Conformance to this profile also assumes implementations of Federal Information Processing
Standards (FIPS) approved cryptographic algorithms as specified in Clause 2.1.1.


2.1   Fundamental Technologies

S/MIME relies on four fundamental technologies to format and protect electronic mail messages.
These fundamental technologies are cryptographic algorithms, public key infrastructure (PKI),
the cryptographic message syntax (CMS) data format, and MIME. Correct implementation of
these mechanisms is essential to the security and interoperability of every S/MIME client. While
these technologies will not be tested in isolation, they will be tested indirectly.

However, not all features available through these technologies are required for S/MIME. To that
end, we describe the features that are required by this profile.
