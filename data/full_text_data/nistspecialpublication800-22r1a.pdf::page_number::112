A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



                        if ( counter == testid ) {
                             printf("    Enter MyNewTest Parameter Value:                               ");
                             scanf("%d", &tp.myNewTestParameter);
                             printf(“\n”);
                             continue;
                        }
                }

        (d) Embed the test function call into the nist_test_suite function. For example:

                if ((testVector[0] == 1) || (testVector[TEST_MYNEWTEST] == 1))
                      myNewTest(tp.myNewTestInputParameters,tp.n);

C.2           Incorporating Additional PRNGs

In order to add a PRNG to the test suite, the user should make the following modifications:

1.     [In the file include/defs.h]

        Increment the variable NUMOFGENERATORS by one.

2.     [In the file include/decls.h]

        Insert the new PRNG name into the generatorDir array, For example,

        char generatorDir[20][20] = {"AlgorithmTesting",

                                                         …,"G-SHA1", "MYNEWPRNG"};

3.      [In the file include/generators.h]

        Insert the generator function prototype declaration. For example,
                 void myNewPRNG();

4.      [In the file generators/generators.c]

        Define the generator function. The general scheme for each PRNG defined in the test
        suite is as follows:

             Allocate space for epsilon, the n-bit BitField array.
             for i = 1 to numOfBitStreams {
               Construct an n-bit sequence using myNewGenerator and store
               in epsilon.
               Invoke the nist_test_suite.
            }
            Deallocate the space given to epsilon.

        Note: A sub-directory called myNewPRNG/ must be created in the experiments/ directory.
        Under this new directory, a set of sub-directories must be created for each of the test suite
        statistical tests. The script createScript has been included to facilitate this operation.
