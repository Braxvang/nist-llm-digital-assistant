                                                            CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



6.      Platform-as-a-Service Cloud Environments

A Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) cloud provides a toolkit for conveniently developing, deploying, and
administering application software that is structured to support large numbers of consumers, process very
large quantities of data, and potentially be accessed from any point in the Internet. PaaS clouds will
typically provide a set of software building blocks and a set of development tools such as programming
languages and supporting run-time environments that facilitate the construction of high-quality, scalable
applications. Additionally, PaaS clouds will typically provide tools that assist with the deployment of
new applications. In some cases, deploying a new software application in a PaaS cloud is not much more
difficult than uploading a file to a Web server. PaaS clouds will also generally provide and maintain the
computing resources (e.g., processing, storage, and networking) that consumer applications need to
operate. In short, PaaS clouds are similar to any traditional computing system (i.e., platform) in that
software applications can be developed for them and run on them.

                                                    PaaS

      Who are the consumers?
        1. Application developers, who design and implement an application's software.
        2. Application testers, who run applications in various (possibly cloud-based) testing
            environments.
        3. Application deployers, who publish completed (or updated) applications into the cloud, and
            manage possible conflicts arising from multiple versions of an application.
        4. Application administrators, who configure, tune, and monitor application performance on a
            platform.
        5. Application end users, who subscribe to the applications deployed on a PaaS cloud: to end
            users, access to applications is the same as using a SaaS cloud.

      What does the consumer get? The use of the PaaS cloud provider's tools and execution resources
            to develop, test, deploy and administer applications.

      How are usage fees calculated? Typically, based on the number of consumers, the kind of
            consumers (e.g., developers vs. application end users), storage, processing, or network
            resources consumed by the platform, requests serviced, and the time the platform is in use.

Unlike the case of a traditional system, however, PaaS provides a basis for developers to create scalable
applications. Applications for a public PaaS cloud can: (1) employ large quantities of computing
resources as needed, (2) process large volumes of data as needed, (3) be deployed nearly instantly, (4)
relieve consumers of numerous IT chores, and (5) be purchased incrementally, by paying ongoing usage
fees instead of traditional up-front costs for equipment and IT staff training. Outsourced private or
community PaaS clouds can provide similar abilities though the scale may be restricted depending on the
outsourcing terms. For private or community non-outsourced PaaS clouds (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4), the
scale is restricted by the data center resources.

The following six subsections describe several important characteristics of PaaS offerings: Abstract
Interaction Dynamics; Software Stack and Provider/Consumer Scopes of Control; Benefits; Issues and
Concerns; Candidate Application Classes; and Recommendations.

6.1     Abstract Interaction Dynamics

Figure 13 provides a simplified (four-step) view of the interaction dynamics of a PaaS cloud. Figure 13 A
shows a PaaS cloud running two applications on behalf of a client, C1. In Figure 13.A, the PaaS provider
