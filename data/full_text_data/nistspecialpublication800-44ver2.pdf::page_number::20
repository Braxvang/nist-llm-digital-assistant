                                                                 GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



 Least Common Mechanism—When providing a feature for the system, it is best to have a single
  process or service gain some function without granting that same function to other parts of the
  system. The ability for the Web server process to access a back-end database, for instance, should not
  also enable other applications on the system to access the back-end database.

 Defense-in-Depth—Organizations should understand that a single security mechanism is generally
  insufficient. Security mechanisms (defenses) need to be layered so that compromise of a single
  security mechanism is insufficient to compromise a host or network. No “silver bullet” exists for
  information system security.

 Work Factor—Organizations should understand what it would take to break the system or network’s
  security features. The amount of work necessary for an attacker to break the system or network
  should exceed the value that the attacker would gain from a successful compromise.

 Compromise Recording—Records and logs should be maintained so that if a compromise does
  occur, evidence of the attack is available to the organization. This information can assist in securing
  the network and host after the compromise and aid in identifying the methods and exploits used by
  the attacker. This information can be used to better secure the host or network in the future. In
  addition, these records and logs can assist organizations in identifying and prosecuting attackers.
