SP 800-130                                                            August 2013



       a) Confidentiality protection protects data from unauthorized disclosure.
          Encryption algorithms are used to transform plaintext data into unintelligible
          ciphertext, while decryption algorithms are used to transform the ciphertext
          back to the original plaintext. The transformations are controlled by one or
          more cryptographic keys so that only the authorized parties who have the keys
          can successfully perform the transformations.
       b) Integrity protection provides mechanisms to detect unauthorized data
          modifications. Cryptographic authentication algorithms typically calculate an
          authentication code or digital signature, which is a function of the data being
          protected and a cryptographic key used by the algorithm. It is highly unlikely
          that without possession of the correct key, an entity could modify the data and
          compute the correct authentication code or digital signature. Therefore,
          unauthorized modifications of data can be detected before the modified data is
          used.
       c) Source authentication provides assurance that the protected data came from an
          authorized entity. For example, suppose that a digital signature is calculated
          on data and is transmitted with the data. The receiver can verify the digital
          signature and therefore know that the data came from a particular entity. In
          this Framework, source authentication involves authenticating the identity of
          the source and then verifying that the authenticated entity is authorized to
          participate in the function being performed.

These protections can be provided to any data protected by the CKMS, including keys
and the associated metadata (See Section 6.2.1, items s) and t)).

Cryptographic algorithms should reside within a cryptographic module (consisting of
hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof) which physically and logically
protects its contents (e.g., the algorithms, cryptographic keys, and metadata) from
unauthorized modification and disclosure. A cryptographic module is part of a CKMS
and can provide cryptographic protections to keys, metadata, and user data.

FR:2.1 The CKMS design shall specify all cryptographic algorithms and supported key
sizes for each algorithm used by the system.

FR:2.2 The CKMS design shall specify the estimated security strength of each
cryptographic technique that is employed to protect keys and their bound metadata.

2.2 Keys, Metadata, Trusted Associations, and Bindings
A key must be associated with metadata that specifies characteristics, constraints,
acceptable uses, and parameters applicable to the key. For example, a key may be
associated with metadata that specifies the key type, how it was generated, when it was
generated, its ownerâ€™s identifier, the algorithm for which it is intended, and its
cryptoperiod. Each unit of metadata is called a metadata element. Like keys, metadata
needs to be protected from unauthorized modification and may need to be protected from
disclosure; the metadata also needs to have its source adequately authenticated.
