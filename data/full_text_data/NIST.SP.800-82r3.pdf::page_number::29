   •   Hierarchy. Supervisory control is used to provide a central location that can aggregate
       data from multiple locations to support control decisions based on the current state of the
       system. A hierarchical or centralized control is often used to provide human operators
       with a comprehensive view of the entire system.
   •   Control complexity. Simple controllers and preset algorithms can often perform control
       functions. However, more complex systems (e.g., air traffic control) require human
       operators to ensure that all control actions are appropriate for meeting the larger
       objectives of the system.
   •   Availability. Systems with strong availability and up-time requirements may require
       more redundancy or alternate implementations across all communications and controls.
   •   Impact of failures. The failure of a control function could cause substantially different
       impacts across domains. Systems with greater impacts often require the ability to
       continue operations through redundant controls or to operate in a degraded state.

2.3.2. SCADA Systems
Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are used to control dispersed assets
for which centralized data acquisition is as important as control [Bailey][Boyer]. These systems
are used in distribution systems, such as water distribution and wastewater collection systems, oil
and natural gas pipelines, electrical utility transmission and distribution systems, and rail and
other public transportation systems. SCADA systems integrate data acquisition systems with data
transmission systems and HMI software to provide a centralized monitoring and control system
for numerous process inputs and outputs. SCADA systems are designed to collect field
information, transfer it to a control center, and display the information to the operator graphically
or textually, thereby allowing the operator to monitor or control an entire system from a central
location in near real-time. Based on the sophistication and setup of the individual system, control
of any individual system, operation, or task can be automatic, or it can be performed by operator
commands.
Typical hardware includes a control server placed at a control center, communications equipment
(e.g., radio, telephone line, cable, or satellite), and one or more geographically distributed field
sites that consist of remote terminal units (RTUs) and/or PLCs that control actuators and/or
monitor sensors. The control server stores and processes the information from RTU inputs and
outputs, while the RTU or PLC controls the local process. The communications hardware allows
for the transfer of information and data between the control server and the RTUs or PLCs. The
software is programmed to tell the system what and when to monitor, what parameter ranges are
acceptable, and what response to initiate when a process variable changes outside of acceptable
values. An intelligent electronic device (IED), such as a protective relay, may communicate
directly to the control server, or a local RTU may poll the IEDs to collect the data and pass it to
the control server. IEDs provide a direct interface to control and monitor equipment and sensors.
IEDs may be directly polled and controlled by the control server and, in most cases, have local
programming that allows for the IED to act without direct instructions from the control center.
SCADA systems are usually designed to be fault-tolerant systems with significant redundancy
built in, although redundancy may not be a sufficient countermeasure in the face of a malicious
attack.
