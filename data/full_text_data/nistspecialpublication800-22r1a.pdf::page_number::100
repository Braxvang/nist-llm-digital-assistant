Once the user has prescribed a particular data set or PRNG, the statistical tests to be applied must be
selected. The following screen is displayed:


                                           STATISTICAL TESTS

                                              INSTRUCTIONS
                 Enter 0 if you DO NOT want to apply all of the
                 statistical tests to each sequence and 1 if you DO.
                  Enter Choice: 0



In this case, 0 has been selected to indicate interest in applying a subset of the available statistical tests.
The following screen is then displayed.




                                                INSTRUCTIONS
                            Enter a 0 or 1 to indicate whether or not the numbered
                            statistical test should be applied to each sequence. For
                            example, 111111111111111 applies every test to each
                            sequence.
