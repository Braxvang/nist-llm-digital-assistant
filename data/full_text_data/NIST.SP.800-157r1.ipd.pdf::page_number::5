85    Reports on Computer Systems Technology

86    The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
87    Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
88    leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops
89    tests, test methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical
90    analyses to advance the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s
91    responsibilities include the development of management, administrative, technical, and
92    physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of other
93    than national security-related information in federal information systems. The Special
94    Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in
95    information system security, and its collaborative activities with industry, government,
96    and academic organizations.

97    Abstract

98    This recommendation provides technical guidelines for the implementation of standards-
99    based, secure, reliable credentials that are issued by federal departments and agencies
100   to individuals who possess and prove control of their valid PIV Card. These credentials
101   can be either public key infrastructure (PKI)-based like the PIV Card or non PKI-based
102   but verified by the individual’s home agency. The scope of this document includes
103   requirements for the initial issuance and maintenance of these credentials, certificate
104   policies as applicable, cryptographic specifications, technical specifications for permitted
105   authenticator types, and the command interfaces for removable implementations of such
106   PKI-based credentials.

110   Note to Reviewers

111   Public draft SP 800-157r1 Guidelines for Derived Personal Identity Verification (PIV)
112   Credentials expands the use of derived PIV credentials beyond mobile devices to include
113   non-PKI-based phishing resistant multi-factor credentials. The draft details the expanded
114   set of derived PIV credentials in a variety of form factors and authenticator types as
115   envisioned in OMB Memoranda M-19-22, M-22-09, and subsequently outlined in
116   FIPS 201-3. The cross-domain and interagency use of these credentials is provided by
117   federation protocols outlined in public draft SP 800-217 Guidelines for PIV Federation.
118   Both documents are closely aligned with draft release SP 800-63-4 Digital Identity
119   Guidelines. NIST hopes that the draft document enables a close alignment with new
