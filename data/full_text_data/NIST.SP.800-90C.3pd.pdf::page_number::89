2533   The CTR_DRBG specified in [SP800-90A] will be used as the DRBG with AES-256 used as the
2534   underlying block cipher for the DRBG. The CTR_DRBG will be implemented using a derivation
2535   function (located inside the CTR_DRBG implementation). In this case, full-entropy output will
2536   not be required for the entropy source (see [SP800-90A]). However, an alternative example could
2537   use the CTR_DRBG without a derivation function. In that case, either the entropy source would
2538   need to provide full-entropy output, or a vetted conditioning function would be required to
2539   condition the entropy to provide full-entropy bits before providing it to the DRBG.
2540   As specified in Section 6.2, a DRBG used as part of the RBG must be instantiated (and reseeded)
2541   at a security strength of 256 bits (which AES-256 can support).
2542   For this example, the DRBG has a fixed security strength (256 bits), which is hard-coded into the
2543   implementation so will not be used as an input parameter.
2544   Calls are made to the RBG as specified in Section 6.3.1. Calls made to the directly accessible
2545   DRBG (part of a RBG2(P) construction) use the RBG calls specified in Section 5.2. Since an
2546   entropy source is always available, the directly accessed DRBG can be reseeded and support
2547   prediction resistance.
2548   If the entropy source produces output at a slow rate, a consuming application might call the
2549   RBG3(RS) construction only when full-entropy bits are required, obtaining all other output from
2550   the directly accessible DRBG.
2551   This example provides the following capabilities:
