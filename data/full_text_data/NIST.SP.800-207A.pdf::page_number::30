       Summary and Conclusions
This document provides guidance for realizing a ZTA for cloud-native application platforms
(microservices with a service mesh infrastructure) in the context of an enterprise environment in
which applications are hosted in multi-cluster and multi-cloud deployments. A ZTA consists of
deployment artifacts that enforce zero trust principles, which is only possible with robust,
flexible, scalable, and granular policies that cover all enterprise resources. A policy framework
that consists of network-tier and identity-tier policies to meet these goals has been proposed in
this document.
The artifacts needed for the definition, deployment, and enforcement of these policies have been
discussed along with examples of network-tier policies and identity-tier policies. The
applicability of these policies in modern enterprise application infrastructures is also illustrated.
Finally, the policies that belong to the two tiers are compared in terms of their advantages and
limitations, and the critical role of identity-tier policies for realizing a ZTA in the context of
modern cloud-native application infrastructures is emphasized.
