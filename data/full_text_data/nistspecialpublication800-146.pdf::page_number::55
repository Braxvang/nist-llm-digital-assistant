                                                             CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



7.5.1   Compatibility with Legacy Security Vulnerabilities

By allowing consumers to run legacy software systems in the providers' infrastructures, IaaS clouds
expose consumers to all of the security vulnerabilities of those legacy software systems.

7.5.2   Virtual Machine Sprawl

IaaS systems allow consumers to create and potentially retain many VMs in various states, e.g., running,
suspended, and off. An inactive VM can easily become out of date with respect to important security
updates; if an out-of-date VM is activated, such a VM may become compromised. Although, in principle,
a provider could update inactive VMs on behalf of consumers, the mechanics of such updating are
complex, and the maintenance of security updates typically is a consumer responsibility.

7.5.3   Verifying Authenticity of an IaaS Cloud Provider Web Site

Although the features outlined in Section 7.2 enable establishment of a secure session with IaaS cloud
provider resources, the onus for verifying the identity of the provider's Web site still rests with the
consumer through some means, e.g., checking with a third party credential service. The consumer’s
browser will typically use public key cryptography [Mar08, Die08] to establish a private link to the cloud
provider, but it is a consumer’s responsibility to check the identity of the cloud Web site to ensure that the
private link is not with an imposter.

7.5.4   Robustness of VM-level Isolation

As Figure 15 illustrates, virtual machines are allocated for different consumers from a common pool.
Consumers must be protected from potential eavesdropping or tampering on the part of other, possibly
malicious, consumers. That is, consumers must be isolated from one another except to the extent that
they choose to interact. An IaaS cloud typically uses a hypervisor (which is a software layer), in
combination with hardware support for virtualization (e.g., AMD-V and Intel VT-x), to split each
physical computer into multiple virtual machines. Isolation of the virtual machines depends on the
correct implementation and configuration of the hypervisor. Hardware virtualization [Per08] provided by
hypervisors has become a widely used technique for providing isolated, or sandboxed, computing
environments, but the strength of the isolation in the presence of sophisticated attackers is an open
research question.

7.5.5   Features for Dynamic Network Configuration for Providing Isolation

It is not evident from Figure 15, but the network infrastructure (e.g., routers, cables, network bandwidth,
etc.) that supports each running VM is also allocated from a common pool of networking resources.
When a VM is allocated by a cloud for a consumer, a network path through the cloud provider’s
infrastructure must be configured to allow that VM to communicate with the originating consumer and
possibly also with arbitrary external entities on the Internet. To prevent undesirable interactions between
consumers, the cloud network must prevent a consumer from observing any packets sent in the cloud by
other consumers, and must also reserve sufficient bandwidth to ensure that each consumer has the
expected level of service. VMs typically are dynamically allocated in only a few minutes, and the
corresponding network configuration must be performed just as quickly. A number of techniques, such as
Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) and overlay networks, provide a logical view of a network’s
topology that can be quickly reconfigured. Careful configuration of these features (and perhaps support
in hypervisors as well) is required to prevent interference between networks belonging to different
consumers.
