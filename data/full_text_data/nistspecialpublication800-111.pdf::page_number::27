                                                     GUIDE TO STORAGE ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES FOR END USER DEVICES



 Solution architecture. The architecture of the storage encryption implementation refers to the
  selection of devices and software to provide storage encryption services and the placement of
  centralized elements within the existing network infrastructure, such as authentication credential
  servers, Web servers for self-service recovery, and management servers. Each end user device must
  have hardware and/or software that provides protection for the stored information. Designing the
  architecture includes component placement, redundancy, reliability, and interoperability.

 Other security controls. These support and complement the storage encryption implementation.
  For example, organizations should have policies regarding acceptable usage of storage encryption
  technologies. Organizations may also set minimum security standards for end user devices, such as
  mandatory host hardening measures and patch levels, and specify security controls that must be
  employed, such as host-based personal firewalls, antivirus software, and antispyware software.

 Minimum requirements for end user devices. The minimum requirements for the hardware, OS,
  and supporting software should be defined. They should be based on the requirements supplied by
  the product vendor and the organization’s performance requirements.

Another aspect of solution design is planning the logistics of the solution’s deployment. For example, the
organization may need to replace devices that do not meet minimum requirements or run on a platform
that the organization will not support for storage encryption. This could cause out-of-cycle upgrades or
replacements of hardware, OSs, and supporting software. Another logistical consideration is how the
solution will be deployed to end user devices. If devices need to be updated locally, such as upgrading
the OS, replacing the hard drive, backing up user files, or installing storage encryption software, then
organizations need to plan who will perform these actions and when and where the work will be done.
Some organizations may need to set up staging areas and get additional personnel to perform this work.

4.2.1    Cryptography

Storage encryption technologies use one or more cryptographic keys to encrypt and decrypt the data that
they protect. The number of keys and the types of keys used are product and implementation-dependent.
For example, public key cryptography uses a pair of keys, and symmetric cryptography uses a single key.
Some products support the use of a recovery key that can be used to recover the encrypted data if the
regular key is lost. Also, some technologies permit encrypted storage to be shared by multiple users,
which could be enabled by having a different key for each user. Often, users’ keys are not directly used
to decrypt their stored data; instead, those keys are used to decrypt another key, which in turn is used to
decrypt the stored data.

If a key is lost or damaged, it may not be possible to recover the encrypted data. Therefore, organizations
need to ensure that all keys used in a storage encryption solution are secured and managed properly to
support the security of the solution. Organizations should perform extensive planning of key
management processes, procedures, and technologies before implementing storage encryption
technologies. This planning should include all aspects of key management, including key generation, use,
storage, recovery, and destruction. 29 Organizations should carefully consider how key management
practices can support the recovery of encrypted data if a key is inadvertently destroyed or otherwise
becomes unavailable (such as a user unexpectedly leaving an organization or losing a cryptographic token
containing a key). An example of recovery preparation is storing duplicates of keys in a centralized,
secured key repository or on physically secured removable media. Organizations planning on encrypting

     NIST SP 800-57, Recommendation for Key Management, provides detailed information on key management planning,
     algorithm selection and appropriate key sizes, cryptographic policy, and cryptographic module selection. Organizations
     may be able to use the same or similar key management processes for end user devices’ storage encryption, virtual private
     network (VPN) clients, and wireless client configuration.
