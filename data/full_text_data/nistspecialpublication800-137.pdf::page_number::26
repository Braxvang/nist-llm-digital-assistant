•    Templates for assessing risks; and

•    Templates for security status reporting (on control effectiveness and status monitoring).
Policy, procedures, and templates necessarily address manual and automated monitoring
methodologies. Additionally at these tiers, organizations establish policy and procedures for
training of personnel with ISCM roles. This may include training on management and use of
automated tools (e.g., establishing baselines and tuning of measurements to provide accurate
monitoring of operational environments). It may also include training for recognition of and
appropriate response to triggers and alerts from metrics indicating risks beyond acceptable limits,
as well as training on internal or external reporting requirements. This training may be included in
existing role-based training requirements for those with significant security roles, or it may
consist of training specifically focused on implementation of the organization’s ISCM policy and
procedures.

When implementing policies, procedures, and templates developed at higher tiers, lower tiers fill
in any gaps related to their tier-specific processes. Decisions and activities by Tier 1 and 2
officials may be constrained by things such as mission/business needs, limitations of the
infrastructure (including the human components), immutable governance policies, and external
drivers.

Primary Roles: Risk Executive (Function), Chief Information Officer, Senior Information
Security Officer, Authorizing Officials

Expected Input: Organizational risk assessment and current risk tolerance, current threat
information, organizational expectations and priorities, available tools from OMB lines of
business and/or third-party vendors

Expected Output: Updated information on organizational risk tolerance, organization-wide
ISCM strategy and associated policy, procedures, templates, tools

3.1.2 INFORMATION SYSTEM (TIER 3) ISCM STRATEGY
The system-level ISCM strategy is developed and implemented to support risk management, not
only at the information systems tier, but at all three tiers in accordance with system and
organizational risk tolerance. Although the strategy may be defined at Tiers 1 or 2, system-
specific policy and procedures for implementation may also be developed at Tier 3. System-level
security-related information includes assessment data pertaining to system-level security controls
and metrics data obtained from system-level security controls. System owners establish a system-
level strategy for ISCM by considering factors such as the system’s architecture and operational
environment, as well as organizational and mission-level requirements, 26 policy, procedures, and
templates.

System-level ISCM addresses monitoring security controls for effectiveness (assessments),
monitoring for security status, and reporting findings. At a minimum, all security controls,
including common and hybrid controls implemented at the system level, are assessed for
26
     The ISCM strategy is designed, in part, to help ensure that compromises to the security architecture are managed
     in a way to prevent or minimize impact on business and mission functions.
