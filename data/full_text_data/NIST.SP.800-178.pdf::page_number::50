                                                                                               resource objects, but not administrative capabilities that may influence those capabilities. MAC
                                                                                               policies unavoidably impose rules on users in performing operations on resource objects.

                                                                                               Expression of MAC policies is perhaps XACML’s strongest suit. XACML can specify rules in
                                                                                               terms of attribute values that can be of varying types, such as strings and integers. There are
                                                                                               undoubtedly certain policies that are expressible in terms of these rules that cannot be easily
                                                                                               accommodated by NGAC. For example, a financial transaction may pertain to adding a person’s
                                                                                               credit limit to their account balance. XACML also takes into consideration environmental
                                                                                               attributes in expressing policies, and NGAC does not directly support such policies. These
                                                                                               environmental-driven policies are dynamic in nature in that the authorization state can change
                                                                                               without the involvement of any administrative action. For instance, the threat level can change
                                                                                               from “Low” to “High”. XACML also includes the notion of an obligation that directs a PEP to
                                                                                               take an action prior to or after an access request is approved or denied. XACML obligation can
                                                                                               complement and refine MAC policies in a number of ways. While NGAC also uses the term
                                                                                               obligation, an NGAC obligation refers to a different policy construct.

                                                                                               MAC policies are often dependent on and include administrative policies. This is especially true
                                                                                               in a federated or collaborative environment, where governance policies require different
                                                                                               organizational entities to have different responsibilities for administering different aspects of
                                                                                               policies and their dependent attributes. It is also often desirable to be able to express policies that
                                                                                               prevent combinations of resource capabilities and administrative capabilities—for example, a
                                                                                               policy that would prevent an administrator from granting him/herself access to sensitive
                                                                                               resources. XACML is ill suited to naturally express such policies. Consider the MAC policy
                                                                                               depicted by Figure 6a. Although XACML can certainly express and enforce this policy, it cannot
                                                                                               easily express policies as to who can assign users to the various groups (attributes), while NGAC
                                                                                               can. NGAC can create administrative attributes and provide users with administrative
                                                                                               capabilities down to the granularity of a single configuration element. Furthermore, NGAC can
                                                                                               deny administrative capabilities down to the same granularity.
