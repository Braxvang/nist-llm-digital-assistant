                                                                      Guidelines on PDA Forensics



Executive Summary

    Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are a relatively recent phenomenon, not usually covered in
    classical computer forensics. This guide attempts to bridge that gap by providing an in-depth
    look into PDAs and explaining the technologies involved and their relationship to forensic
    procedures. It covers three families of devices – Pocket PC, Palm OS, and Linux-based PDAs
    – and the characteristics of their associated operating system. This guide also discusses
    procedures for the preservation, acquisition, examination, analysis, and reporting of digital
    information present on PDAs, as well as available forensic software tools that support those
    activities.

    The objective of the guide is twofold: to help organizations evolve appropriate policies and
    procedures for dealing with PDAs, and to prepare forensic specialists to deal with new
    situations involving PDAs, when they are encountered. The guide is not all-inclusive nor is it
    a mandate for the law enforcement and incident response communities. However, from the
    principles outlined and other information provided, organizations should nevertheless find the
    guide helpful in setting policies and procedures.

    The information in this guide is best applied in the context of current technology and practices.
    Every situation is unique, as are the experiences of the forensic specialists and the tools and
    facilities at their disposal. The judgment of the forensic specialists should be given deference
    in the implementation of the procedures suggested in this guide. Circumstances of individual
    cases and International, Federal, State, local laws/rules and organization-specific policies may
    also require actions other than those described in this guide. As always, close and continuing
    consultation with legal council is advised.
