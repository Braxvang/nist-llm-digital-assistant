The following symbols are used in this Recommendation:
        Symbol                                         Meaning
+                    Addition.
X⊕Y                  Bitwise exclusive-or (also bitwise addition modulo 2) of two bitstrings
                     X and Y of the same length.
X || Y               Concatenation of two strings X and Y. X and Y are either both bitstrings
                     or both byte strings.
⎡x⎤                The ceiling of x; the smallest integer ≥ x. For example, ⎡5⎤ = 5, and
                     ⎡5.3⎤ = 6.
leftmost (V, a)      The leftmost a bits of V.
len (a)              The length in bits of string a.
min (a, b)           The minimum of a and b.
x mod n              The unique remainder r (where 0 ≤ r ≤ n-1) when integer x is divided
                     by n. For example, 23 mod 7 = 2.
rightmost (V, a)     The rightmost a bits of V.
select (V, a, b)     A substring of string V consisting of bit a through bit b.
                     Used in a figure to illustrate a "switch" between input sources.


{a1, ...ai}          The internal state of the DRBG at a point in time. The types and
                     number of the ai values depends on the specific DRBG mechanism.
