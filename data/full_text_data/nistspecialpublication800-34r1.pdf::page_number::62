                                                CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS




The ISCP Coordinator should look at information provided in the BIA to determine what critical
mission/business processes a system supports, the MTD, and the impact loss of the system would have on
the business to establish what type of recovery site is needed. An information system recovery strategy
may incorporate one or more of these types of alternate processing facilities. For example, some
functionality of a system may be highly critical and require a hot site to minimize the downtime and
impact on mission/business processes. However, other functionality of the same system, such as a
reporting or batch printing process, may be able to be down for several days with little impact and would
just need extra space in the alternate facility to place additional equipment after it is purchased.

5.1.6   Use of High Availability (HA) Processes

HA is a process where redundancy and failover processes are built into a system to maximize its uptime
and availability. The concept of HA is to achieve an uptime of 99.999 percent or higher, which equates to
just a few minutes per year of downtime. Several vendors offer HA products and services designed to
minimize downtime by building redundancy and resiliency into the architecture.

HA can be an expensive option for systems, with duplicate hardware and special failover software to
eliminate any single point of failure. Normally, there are higher cost maintenance and support
requirements associated with HA systems. Therefore, HA is not a viable option for many systems and
should be considered only for those systems that cannot tolerate downtime. Examples of this may be air
traffic systems and financial systems. Also, HA systems cannot be a replacement for a solid backup
strategy, as a corruption of data on a system may propagate through an HA system, making the system
unusable. Without a backup of the system separate from the system itself, recovery may not be possible.

HA can be implemented at a single site, with all system redundancy resident at that site. This will keep
the system running at an HA level as long as there is no interruption of the facility housing the system.
However, when implementing HA products or services in a system, the ISCP Coordinator should have
HA processes extended to an alternate location. Mechanisms such as block mirroring to an alternate site
should be considered to provide redundancy and backup of system data outside of the system facility.
Whenever a write is made to a block on a primary storage device, the same write is made to an alternate
storage device, either within the same storage system, or between separate storage systems, at different
locations.

5.2     Client/Server Systems

Client/server systems can have processing and data at both the server and client workstation levels.
Client workstations are normally desktop computers, although portable devices may be connected to
servers as clients. Portable devices include laptops, notebook computers, and handheld devices (e.g.,
smart phones and specialized equipment such as inventory collection bar code readers).

Wireless and smart phone technology advances have allowed users access to key server functionality and
services such as email from their mobile phones. This is normally done by using proprietary third-party
software that establishes the communications and data transfer to and from the phone via the network
provided by mobile cell carriers.

Servers support file sharing and storage, data processing, central application hosting (such as email or a
central database), printing, access control, user authentication, remote access connectivity, and other
