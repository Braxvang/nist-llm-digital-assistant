FAMILY: AWARENESS AND TRAINING                                                        CLASS: OPERATIONAL


AT-1      SECURITY AWARENESS AND TRAINING POLICY AND PROCEDURES

          Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a formal,
          documented, security awareness and training policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
          responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and
          compliance; and (ii) formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the
          security awareness and training policy and associated security awareness and training controls.
          Supplemental Guidance: The security awareness and training policy and procedures are consistent
          with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.
          The security awareness and training policy can be included as part of the general information
          security policy for the organization. Security awareness and training procedures can be developed
          for the security program in general, and for a particular information system, when required. NIST
          Special Publications 800-16 and 800-50 provide guidance on security awareness and training.
          NIST Special Publication 800-12 provides guidance on security policies and procedures.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW AT-1                      MOD AT-1                  HIGH AT-1



AT-2      SECURITY AWARENESS

          Control: The organization provides basic security awareness training to all information system
          users (including managers and senior executives) before authorizing access to the system, when
          required by system changes, and [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least annually]
          thereafter.
          Supplemental Guidance: The organization determines the appropriate content of security awareness
          training based on the specific requirements of the organization and the information systems to
          which personnel have authorized access. The organizationâ€™s security awareness program is
          consistent with the requirements contained in C.F.R. Part 5 Subpart C (5 C.F.R 930.301) and with
          the guidance in NIST Special Publication 800-50.
          Control Enhancements: None.
