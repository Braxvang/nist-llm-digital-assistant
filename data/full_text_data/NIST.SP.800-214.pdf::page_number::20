• NISTIR 8267, Security Review of Consumer Home Internet of Things (IoT) Devices, reviewed
  a number of typical home consumer IoT devices to better understand common security
  architectures and the typical range of core baseline capabilities in consumer IoT devices.
The IoT program is committed to international engagement. The harmonization of market
requirements is critical to improving IoT device security. Cyberthreats do not stop at borders,
and market fragmentation does not help improve security. Through ongoing participation in
ISO/IEC working groups, NIST has supported the development of international standards that
promote security and privacy in IoT devices including:
• Provision of NISTIR 8259 as input to the first draft of ISO/IEC 27402 – Cybersecurity –
  IoT security and privacy – Device baseline requirements; NIST provided comments and
  participated in working meetings for subsequent drafts.
• Provision of comments and participation in working meetings for ISO/IEC 27400 –
  Cybersecurity – IoT security and privacy – Guidelines.
• Promotion of U.S. interests and strategies on IoT security through participation in the ad hoc
  working group on IoT Security Standardization.
The IoT program participated in bilateral and multilateral discussions with international
governments and industries to increase awareness and utilization of NIST IoT cybersecurity
resources. The IoT program engaged with a number of countries and partners across several
regions, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Taiwan,
Japan, the European Commission, and others.
In addition to the publications listed above, the Cybersecurity for IoT program engaged the
global community in many ways, including blog posts, webinars, an RSA Conference event, a
virtual workshop around the development of a federal profile of the online catalog of capabilities,
and a virtual workshop on the risks associated with consumer home IoT devices.
Blockchain Security
Blockchains are tamper-evident and tamper-resistant digital ledgers that are implemented in
a distributed fashion (i.e., without a central repository) and usually without a central authority
(i.e., a bank, company, or government). At their basic level, they enable a community of users to
record transactions in a shared ledger within that community such that under normal operation
of the blockchain network, no transaction can be changed once published.
NIST continued its research and development in the use, application, standardization, and
interoperability of blockchains and the potential they bring to cultivating trust. In FY 2020, NIST
expanded publications and research in some of the following areas:
• NISTIR 8301, Blockchain Networks: Token Design and Management Overview
• The use of aggregating atomic clocks for time stamping
• NIST White Paper, On the Profitability of Selfish Mining Against Multiple Difficulty
  Adjustment Algorithms
• NIST White Paper, A Taxonomic Approach to Understanding Emerging Blockchain Identity
  Management Systems
• Conference Paper, Implementing a Protocol Native Managed Cryptocurrency
