2.3 Information Security Governance Challenges and Keys to Success
    There are many diverse, and sometimes conflicting, priorities an organization
must account for in meeting information security governance requirements. These
criteria present challenges an organization is likely to face in its efforts to establish
information security governance.
       Some of the most common challenges include:
       • Balancing extensive requirements originating from multiple governing
         bodies. Several different governing and oversight bodies establish governance
         and information security requirements for the federal government. While these
         requirements are seldom contradictory, they are not always complementary,
         and organizations may be faced with the challenge of implementing different
         compliance measures and monitoring these measures for reporting purposes.
       • Balancing legislation and agency-specific policy. Agencies may have more
         stringent requirements that go beyond those required by information security
         legislation, regulation, and directives.
       • Maintaining currency. Governance standards and guidance evolve to support
         different requirements, and new legislation is frequently introduced.
       • Prioritizing available funding according to requirements. Increased
         competition for limited federal budgets and resources requires that agencies
         allocate available funding toward their highest-priority information security
         investments.
   Information security governance provides a framework for establishing and
maintaining an information security program that will evolve with the organization it
