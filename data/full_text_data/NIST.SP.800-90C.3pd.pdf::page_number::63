       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                           Recommendation for RBG Constructions

1738           2. Return (status, RBG3(RS)_state_handle).
1739   In step 1, the DRBG is instantiated at a security strength of 256 bits. The
1740   prediction_resistance_flag is set to TRUE, and personalization_string (when provided as input to
1741   the RBG3(RS)_DRBG_Instantiate function) shall be used in step 1.
1742   In step 2, the status and the RBG3(RS)_state_handle are returned. Note that if the status does not
1743   indicate a successful instantiate process (i.e., a failure is indicated), the returned state handle shall
1744   be invalid (e.g., a Null value). The handling of status codes is discussed in Section 2.8.3.

1745   6.3.1.2.        Random and Pseudorandom Bit Generation
1746   6.3.1.2.1   Generation Using the RBG3(RS) Construction
1747   When an RBG3(RS) construction receives a request for n random bits, the DRBG instantiation
1748   used by the construction needs to be reseeded with sufficient entropy so that bits with full entropy
1749   can be extracted from the DRBG’s output block.
1750   Table 3 provides information for generating full-entropy output from the DRBGs in SP 800-90A
1751   that use the cryptographic primitives listed in the table. Each primitive in the table can support a
1752   security strength of 256 bits − the highest security strength recognized by this Recommendation.
1753   To use the table, select the row that identifies the cryptographic primitive used by the implemented
1754   DRBG.
1755       •   Column 1 lists the DRBGs.
1756       •   Column 2 identifies the cryptographic primitives that can be used by the DRBG(s) in
1757           column 1 to support a security strength of 256 bits.
1758       •   Column 3 indicates the length of the output block (output_len) for the cryptographic
1759           primitives in column 2.
1760       •   Column 4 indicates the amount of fresh entropy that is obtained by a Reseed_function
1761           when the Generate_function is invoked with prediction resistance requested.
