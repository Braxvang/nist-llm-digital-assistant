     Awareness about the importance of strong cybersecurity for maintaining trust in the economy and protecting the
nation is at an all-time high. So, too, are the challenges. When it comes to cybersecurity, the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) has a long history of conducting path-breaking research and development, cultivating standards
and best practices, and facilitating technology transitions. We rely on open, transparent, and collaborative processes that
engage private and public sector participation and attract expertise from around the world. This 2016 report captures our
most noteworthy accomplishments.

    In 2016, NIST continued to advance fundamental research to support security and interoperability standards and
guidelines. This work was led by the Computer Security Division (CSD) in the NIST Information Technology Laboratory
(ITL). Among other things, CSD is responsible for developing cybersecurity standards, guidelines, tests, and metrics for
the protection of non-national security federal information systems. Recognizing the agency’s need to respond to and
anticipate increasing demands for its cybersecurity expertise, NIST established the Applied Cybersecurity Division (ACD)
within ITL to support additional applied research and to transition effective cybersecurity technology approaches to
government and business sectors nationwide. ACD helps to drive the adoption of appropriate cybersecurity solutions by
government and commercial organizations – enabling solutions-oriented collaborative interactions and offering guidance
on the use of research results, standards, and best practices. Other parts of NIST also are key contributors to NIST’s
cybersecurity portfolio.

    Strong partnerships with industry, academia and government are critical to NIST’s cybersecurity program. In 2016,
NIST continued to collaborate with stakeholders from across the country and around the world to raise awareness and
encourage use of the voluntary Cybersecurity Framework. In this spirit, NIST began to develop an update to the version first
published in 2014. NIST also prepared a draft Cybersecurity Framework profile aligned with manufacturing sector goals and
industry best practices. In addition, NIST developed the draft Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder self-assessment tool
that complements the Cybersecurity Framework and helps organizations to better understand the effectiveness of their
cybersecurity risk management efforts.

    Looking ahead is vital in the realm of cybersecurity. Knowing that if large-scale quantum computers are ever built,
they will be able to break many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use and compromise the confidentiality and
integrity of digital communication on the Internet and elsewhere, NIST is working closely with the academic community and
industry to develop protective cryptographic standards that we all rely upon. Building on its successful tradition of working
openly with the worldwide cryptographic community, in 2016 NIST called for submissions for quantum-resistant public-key
cryptographic algorithms for standards. These algorithms must be secure against both quantum and classical computers,
and should interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks. After submissions are received late in
2017, NIST plans to spend 3-5 years working with the research community and industry to analyze the candidates before
selecting algorithms for standardization.

     Identity management is fundamental to security management. In 2016, NIST continued to advance solutions in identity
management through projects with partners who manage innovative but practical real-world solutions. Also in the past
year, NIST produced an introduction to the concepts of privacy engineering and risk management for federal information
systems. The goal is to help decrease privacy risks and enable organizations to make purposeful decisions about resource
allocation and effective implementation of controls in information systems. NIST also initiated an update to our Digital
