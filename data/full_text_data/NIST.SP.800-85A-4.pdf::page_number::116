                              PIN ('00') for PIV data access and command execution
                              as indicated by the Discovery Object’s PIN Usage
                              Policy.
                               1. Send VERIFY card command with
                                  • P2, key reference value is set to '00'
                                  • Data field of the command will contain the
                                     correct Global PIN value, and padded with 'FF'
                                     to complete the total length of the value to 8
                                     bytes
                         2c. Test case for implementations that support OCC ('96'
                              and '97') for PIV data access and command execution
                              as indicated by the Discovery Object’s PIN Usage
                              Policy
                               1. Send VERIFY card command with
                                  • P2, key reference value is set to '96'
                                  • Data field of the command will contain a value
                                     that matches the Primary Finger OCC value
                               2. Send VERIFY card command with
                                  • P2, key reference value is set to '97'
                                  • Data field of the command will contain a value
                                     that matches the Secondary Finger OCC value
                         2d. Test case for implementations that support pairing
                             code ('98')
                               1. Send VERIFY card command with
                                  • P2, key reference value is set to '98'
                                  • Data field of the command will contain the
                                     correct pairing code value
 Expected Result(s)   1. The command returns the application property template with the
                         status word '90 00' at the end.
                      2. The command returns either 1) the Discovery Object with the
                          status word '90 00' at the end or 2) '6A 82' (data object not found)
                          (verify that the return PIN Usage Policy matches that described
                          in vendor documentation.
                         2a:
                              1. The command returns an error status word.
                         2b:
                              1. The command returns an error status word.
                         2c:
                              1. In the steps 1-2: The command returns an error status word.
                         2d:
                              1. The command returns an error status word.
