are captured primarily so that intrusion detection analysts can review them when validating IDS alerts and
investigating suspicious activity. Some IDSs also have intrusion prevention capabilities, which means
that they actively attempt to stop attacks in progress. Any use of intrusion prevention features should be
indicated in the IDS logs.

6.2.4     Remote Access

Remote access servers are devices such as VPN gateways and modem servers that facilitate connections
between networks. This often involves external systems connecting to internal systems through the
remote access server but could also include internal systems connecting to external or internal systems.
Remote access servers typically record the origin of each connection and might also indicate which user
account was authenticated for each session. If the remote access server assigns an IP address to the
remote user, this is also likely to be logged. Some remote access servers also provide packet filtering
functions, which typically perform logging similar to that provided by firewalls and routers, as described
in Section 6.2.1. Remote access servers typically work at a network level, supporting the use of many
different applications. Because the servers have no understanding of the applications’ functions, they
usually do not record any application-specific data.

In addition to remote access servers, organizations typically use multiple applications that are specifically
designed to provide remote access to a particular host’s OS. Examples include secure shell (SSH), telnet,
terminal servers,99 and remote control software. Such applications can typically be configured to log
basic information for each connection, including source IP address and user account. Organizations also
typically use many applications that are accessed remotely, such as client/server applications. Some of
these applications also log basic information for connections.

Although most remote access–related logging occurs on the remote access server or the application
server, in some cases the client also logs information related to the connection.

6.2.5     Security Event Management Software

Security event management (SEM)100 software is capable of importing security event information from
various network traffic–related security event data sources (e.g., IDS logs, firewall logs) and correlating
events among the sources.101 It generally works by receiving copies of logs from various data sources
over secure channels, normalizing the logs into a standard format, then identifying related events by
matching IP addresses, timestamps, and other characteristics. SEM products usually do not generate
original event data; instead, they generate meta-events based on imported event data. Many SEM
products not only can identify malicious activity, such as attacks and virus infections, but also can detect
misuse and inappropriate usage of systems and networks. SEM software can be helpful in making many
sources of network traffic information accessible through a single interface.

Because SEM products can handle nearly any security event data source, such as OS logs, antivirus
software alerts, and physical security device logs, SEM products may contain a wide variety of
information regarding events. However, it is typical for only some data fields to be brought over. For
example, if an IDS records packets, the packets may not be transferred to the SEM because of bandwidth
and storage limitations. In addition, because most data sources record information in different formats,
SEM products typically normalize the data—converting each data field to a standard format and labeling

      provide graphical remote access to operating systems and applications.
