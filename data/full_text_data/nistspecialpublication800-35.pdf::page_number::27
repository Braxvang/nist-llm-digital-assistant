4.    IT Security Services Life Cycle

The IT security services life cycle provides IT security decision makers and managers with a six-phase
process by which they can select, implement, and manage IT security services. This chapter details the
various life-cycle phases and the issues and decisions within each phase. As Figure 4-1 illustrates, the
security services life cycle has both a linear and iterative component. It proceeds linearly from initiation
to implementation to closeout, but the assessment, solution, and operations phases must continually occur
for an IT security service to succeed.




                                 Figure 4-1. IT Security Services Life Cycle

The six phases are described as follows:

 Phase 1: Initiation—the need to initiate the services life cycle is recognized. Section 4.1 discusses
  potential triggers for this phase.
 Phase 2: Assessment—before decision makers can implement a service and select a service
  provider, an accurate portrait of the current environment must be developed. Section 4.2 discusses
  Phase 2 and the importance of creating and gathering appropriate metrics.
 Phase 3: Solution—decision makers choose the appropriate solution from the viable options
  identified during the assessment phase. Section 4.3 discusses the business cases and implementation
  plans.
 Phase 4: Implementation—the service and service provider are implemented during the
  implementation phase. Section 4.4 guides decision makers through service agreement development
  and service implementation.
