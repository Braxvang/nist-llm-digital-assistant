                                                                                                data that is stored in a VM image. VM images can be encrypted on the telework computer when they are
                                                                                                not in use and only decrypted after the user provides proper authentication just before booting an image.
                                                                                                If VM images are encrypted, an unauthorized person that gets access to the telework device will not be

                                                                                                Organizations should consider encrypting all VM images used for telework to reduce the risk of
