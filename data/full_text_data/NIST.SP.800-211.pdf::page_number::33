Guidelines; SP 800-63A, Enrollment and Identity Proofing; SP 800-63B, Authentication
and Lifecycle Management; and, SP 800-63C, Federation and Assertions [22]. SP 800-
63-3 represented a major update to the previous SP 800-63-2 standard and advanced
new approaches for componentization, assurance levels, authenticators, federation, and
privacy considerations. There has been widespread interest, analysis, and adoption by
industry and international standards organizations of SP 800-63-3 for its concepts and
guidance, control requirements, and application of the Risk Management Framework
to identity management systems. During FY 2019, NIST has been working closely with
federal agencies and industry for the implementation of the standard. Questions and
issues are publicly posted on NIST Pages (see https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-FAQ/) and
as open issues on GitHub (see https://github.com/usnistgov/800-63-3/issues).
OMB Policy Memorandum M-19-17 updated federal identity, credentials, and access
management policy and provided direction for federal agencies to enhance associated
capabilities [23]. In response, NIST established the Identity and Access Management
(IAM) Resource Center, which provides information and resources for NIST IAM9
activities. The IAM Resource Center includes a roadmap of major NIST projects and
activities. The roadmap presents NIST plans to update SP 800-63-3 in order to build on
the feedback already received, starting with a formal request for comments in the third
quarter of FY 2020.
M-19-17 assigned to NIST the responsibility for developing conformance criteria for the
accreditation of products and services to meet designated levels of assurance in SP 800-
63-3. In response, NIST explored various conformance regimes that might be leveraged
so that the conformance criteria could be developed in the most appropriate fashion. The
conformance criteria present all normative requirements and controls of SP 800-63-3 by
designated assurance level. These include conformance assessment objectives for each
criterion, recommended methods for determining conformity with the requirements, and
supplemental guidance to assist implementers and assessors to achieve and determine
conformity. The conformance criteria are intended for federal agencies and industry
service providers for their specific implementations and risk and security assessments
under FISMA.

Personal Identity Verification (PIV)
As required by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12, NIST developed and
maintains the FIPS for personal identity verification (PIV) of federal employees and
contractors (FIPS 201). In FY 2019, NIST initiated the revision of FIPS 201 with the goals
of incorporating the new or changing business requirements of federal departments and
agencies, adapting to changes in the environment and technology, and aligning with
M-19-17. The revision activities began with a business requirement meeting to engage
with federal stakeholders about the revision goals. Based on the engagement, NIST
aims to expand the set of PIV authenticators beyond the current practices (including

                                                                                                            25
