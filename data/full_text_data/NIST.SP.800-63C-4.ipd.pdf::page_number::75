1931   10.2. Speciﬁc Usability Considerations
1932   This section addresses the specific usability considerations that have been identified with
1933   federated identity systems. This section does not attempt to present exhaustive coverage
1934   of all usability factors related to federated identity systems. Rather it is focused on the
1935   larger, more pervasive themes in the usability literature, primarily users’ perspectives on
1936   identity, user adoption, trust, and perceptions of federated identity space. In some cases,
1937   implementation examples are provided. However, specific solutions are not prescribed.
1938   The implementations mentioned are examples to encourage innovative technological
1939   approaches to address specific usability needs. See standards for system design and
1940   coding, specifications, APIs, and current best practices (such as OpenID and OAuth)
1941   for additional examples. Implementations are sensitive to many factors that prevent a
1942   one-size-fits-all solution.

1943   10.2.1. User Perspectives on Online Identity
1944   Even when users are familiar with federated identity systems, there are different
1945   approaches to federated identity (especially in terms of privacy and the sharing of
1946   information) that make it necessary to establish reliable expectations for how users’ data
1947   are treated. Users and implementers have different concepts of identity. Users think of
1948   identity as logging in and gaining access to their own private space. Implementers think
1949   of identity in terms of authenticators and assertions, assurance levels, and the necessary
1950   set of identity attributes to provide a service. Given this disconnect between users’ and
1951   implementers’ concepts of identity, it is essential to help users form an accurate concept
1952   of identity as it applies to federated identity systems. A good model of identity provides
1953   users a foundation for understanding the benefits and risks of federated systems and
1954   encourage user adoption and trust of these systems.
1955   Many properties of identity have implications for how users manage identities, both
1956   within and among federations. Just as users manage multiple identities based on
1957   context outside of cyberspace, users must learn to manage their identity in a federated
1958   environment. Therefore, it must be clear to users how identity and context are used. The
1959   following factors should be considered:
1960       • Provide users the requisite context and scope in order to distinguish among
1961         different user roles. For example, whether the user is acting on their own behalf
1962         or on behalf of another, such as their employer.
1963       • Provide users unique, meaningful, and descriptive identifiers to distinguish among
1964         entities such as IdPs, RPs, and accounts. Any such user-facing identifiers are likely
1965         to be in addition to identifiers used by the underlying protocols, which are not
1966         normally exposed to the user.
1967       • Provide users with information on data ownership and those authorized to make
1968         changes. Identities, and the data associated with them, can sometimes be updated
1969         and changed by multiple actors. For example, some healthcare data is updated and
