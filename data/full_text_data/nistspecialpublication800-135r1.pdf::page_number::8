3.3     Symbols & Mathematical Operations


AES(k, input)   A single AES encryption operation as specified in FIPS 197 [FIPS
                197] with k and input being the AES encryption key and one 128-
                bit block of plaintext/data, respectively.
gxy             Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange value, also called a DH shared
                secret (in IKE version 1).
gir             DH key exchange value, also called a DH shared secret (in IKE
                version 2).
||              Concatenation operation; for example, a || b means that string b is
                appended after string a.
0x0X            8-bit binary representation of the hexadecimal number X, for
                example, 0x02 = 00000010.
