Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Recreational resource management and
tourism include enforcement functions (e.g., protective and enforcement functions of the
National Park Service). Integrity impacts associated with criminal apprehension, criminal
investigation and surveillance, citizen protection, and property protection may cause the integrity
impact of enforcement-related information to be moderate or high. These types of enforcement-
related information are time-critical. Where terrorists or other criminals pose a threat to key
national assets, or pose a threat to human life, the integrity impact level recommended for
recreational resource management and tourism enforcement information is high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most recreational resource management and tourism information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to recreational resource management
and tourism information. Generally, missions supported by recreational resource
management and tourism information are tolerant of delays.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Recreational resource management
and tourism include enforcement functions (e.g., protective and enforcement functions of the
National Park Service). Availability impacts associated with criminal apprehension, criminal
investigation and surveillance, citizen protection, and property protection may cause the
confidentiality impact of enforcement-related information to be moderate or high.

There may also be time-critical cases associated with protection of people and key national
assets from natural disasters (such as fires, unexpected blizzards, or volcanic eruptions). In
such cased, the availability impact may be high. Except for time-critical information, the
availability impact level recommended for protection-related information is typically
moderate.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: Most recreational resource management and tourism
information is routine in nature (not time-critical). Consequently, the provisional availability
impact level recommended for most recreational resource management and tourism information
is low.

D.6.4 Agricultural Innovation and Services Information Type

Agricultural Innovation and Services involves the creation and dissemination of better methods
for farming and the development of better and healthier crops. The recommended security
categorization for the agricultural innovation and service information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}
