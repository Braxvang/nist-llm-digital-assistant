NIST SP 800-82r3                                         Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

When token-based access control employs cryptographic verification, the access control system
should conform to the requirements of NIST SP 800-78-4 [SP800-78-4].

6.2.1.4.2.     Biometric Authentication
Biometric authentication enhances software-only solutions, such as password authentication, by
offering an additional authentication factor and removing the need for people to memorize
complex secrets. In addition, because biometric characteristics are unique to a given individual,
biometric authentication addresses the issues of lost or stolen physical tokens and smart cards.
Biometric devices make a useful secondary check versus other forms of authentication that can
become lost or borrowed. Using biometric authentication in combination with token-based
access control or badge-operated employee time clocks increases security.
Noted issues with biometric authentication include:
   •   Distinguishing a real object from a fake one (e.g., distinguishing a real human finger
       from a silicon rubber cast of one or a real human voice from a recorded one)
   •   Generating type-I and type-II errors, which is the probability of rejecting a valid
       biometric image and accepting an invalid biometric image, respectively. Biometric
       authentication devices should be configured to the lowest crossover between these two
       probabilities, also known as the crossover error rate.
   •   Handling environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity, to which some
       biometric devices are sensitive
   •   Addressing industrial applications where employees may have to wear safety glasses
       and/or gloves and industrial chemicals are present
   •   Retraining biometric scanners that occasionally “drift” over time. Human biometric traits
       may also shift over time, necessitating periodic scanner retraining.
   •   Requiring face-to-face technical support and verification for device training, unlike a
       password that can be given over a phone or an access card that can be handed out by a
       receptionist
   •   Denying needed access to the OT system because of a temporary inability of the sensing
       device to acknowledge a legitimate user
   •   Being socially acceptable. Users consider some biometric authentication devices more
       acceptable than others. For example, retinal scans may be considered very low on the
       scale of acceptability, while thumbprint scanners may be considered high on the scale of
       acceptability. Users of biometric authentication devices will need to take social
       acceptability for their target group into consideration when selecting among biometric
       authentication technologies.
When token-based access control employs biometric verification, the access control system
should conform to the requirements of NIST SP 800-76-2 [SP800-76-2].
             OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
             While biometrics can provide a valuable authentication mechanism,
             organizations may need to carefully assess the technology for use with
