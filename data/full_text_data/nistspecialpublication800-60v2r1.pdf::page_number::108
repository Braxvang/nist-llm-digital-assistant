significant subset of the workforce can result in work stoppages that adversely affect the
agency’s mission. Where interruptions to agency missions can have serious or life-threatening
consequences for individuals, the impacts of integrity compromises can be moderate or even
high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
labor relations information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to labor relations information. Labor
relations processes are generally tolerant of delay. Typically, disruption labor relations
information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: In some cases (e.g., where an agency’s
mission is strongly dependent on organized labor), loss of availability of information that
adversely affects a significant subset of the workforce can result in work stoppages that
adversely affect the agency’s mission. Where interruptions to agency missions can have serious
or life-threatening consequences for individuals, the impacts of availability compromises can be
moderate or even high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended
labor relations information is low.
C.3.3.9 Separation Management Information Type

Separation Management conducts efficient and effective employee separation programs that
assist employees in transitioning to non-Federal employment; facilitates the removal of
unproductive, non-performing employees; and assists employees in transitioning to retirement.
The recommended provisional security categorization for separation management information is
as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of separation
management information on the ability of responsible agencies conducts efficient and effective
employee separation programs that assist employees in transitioning to non-Federal employment;
facilitates the removal of unproductive, non-performing employees; and assists employees in
transitioning to retirement. In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of separation management
information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where more sensitive information is
involved, it will probably be personal information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974. The
Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and
Authentication information type. This can result in assignment of a moderate impact level to
such information.
