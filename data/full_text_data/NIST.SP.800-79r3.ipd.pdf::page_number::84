                   (ii) The fingerprint templates are prepared from images of the primary
                        and secondary fingers (test).
                  (iii) The fingerprint templates are formatted according to Table 6 in

      CI-7      The identity management system (IDMS) or Central Verification System            [FIPS201], Sec. 2.8 – PIV Card
                (CVS) reflects the adjudication status of each PIV cardholder as part of the    Issuance Requirements
                PIV identity account.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                  (i) The issuer’s IDMS or CVS is capable of recording the adjudication
                      status of each PIV Cardholder as part of the PIV identity account
                      (review, observe).
      CI-8      Iris images collected during identity proofing and registration are formatted   [SP800-76], Sec. 6.3 – Iris image
                such that they conform to [SP800-76], if applicable.                            specification for PIV Cards

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                    (i) Iris images are formatted according to Table 9 in [SP800-76] and
                         ISO/IEC 19794-6:2011 (review, test).
      CI-9      Fingerprint templates for on-card comparison (OCC) that are collected           [SP800-76], Sec. 5.5.1 – Biometric
                during identity proofing and registration are formatted such that they          Information Template
                conform to [SP800-76], if applicable.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                  (i) Fingerprint templates for on-card comparison are formatted
                      according to Table 7 in [SP800-76] and ISO/IEC 19794-2:2011
                      (review, test).

     CI-15      As part of the PIV identity account, the issuer maintains an enrollment         [FIPS201], Sec. 2.6 – PIV
    (NEW)       record for each issued PIV Card.                                                Enrollment Records

                Assessment                                                                      [SP800-156], Sec. 2 – Chain-of-

                   (i) The enrollment data record maintains an auditable sequence of
                       enrollment events to bind an applicant to multiple transactions that
                       might take place at different times and locations. These include
                       activities that document (i) who took the action, (ii) what action was
                       taken, (iii) when and where the action took place, and (iv) and what
                       data was collected (review).
                  (ii) The enrollment data record includes details of biometric acquisition,
                       including the name and role of the acquiring agent, the office and
                       organization, time, place, and acquisition method (review).
                 (iii) The enrollment data record includes (i) unique identifiers issued to
                       the individual (e.g., FASC-N, UUID, etc.); (ii) information about the
                       authorizing entity that has approved the issuance of a credential; (iii)
                       the current status of the background investigation, including the
                       results of the investigation once completed; (iv) the evidence of
                       authorization if the credential is issued under a pseudonym; and (v)
                       any other relevant data about the cardholder, including subsequent
                       changes in the data (e.g., cardholder name changes) (review).
                 (iv) The records are stored as part of the cardholder’s PIV identity
                       account, either as part of the issuer’s IDMS or through links to
