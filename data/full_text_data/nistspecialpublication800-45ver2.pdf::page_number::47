                                                                                   GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



     –   Length – a minimum length for passwords. Specify a minimum length of at least eight
         characters.

     –   Complexity – the mix of characters required. Require passwords to contain both uppercase and
         lowercase letters and at least one non-alphanumeric character, and to not be a “dictionary”
         word. 32

     –   Aging – how long a password may remain unchanged. Require users to change their passwords
         periodically. Administrator or root level passwords should be changed every 30 to 120 days.
         User level passwords should also be changed periodically, with the period determined by the
         enforced length and complexity of the password combined with the sensitivity of the information
         protected. When considering the appropriate aging duration, the exposure level of user
         passwords should also be taken into account.

     –   Reuse – whether a password may be reused. Some users try to defeat a password aging
         requirement by changing the password to one they have used previously. If possible, ensure that
         users cannot change their password by merely appending characters to the beginning or end of
         their original password (e.g., original password was “mysecret” and is changed to “1mysecret” or
         “mysecret1”).

     –   Authority – who is allowed to change or reset passwords and what sort of proof is required
         before initiating any changes.

     –   Password Security – how passwords should be secured, such as not storing passwords
         unencrypted on the mail server, and requiring administrators to use different passwords for their
         mail administration accounts than their other administration accounts.
 Configure computers to prevent password guessing. It is relatively easy for an unauthorized user
  to try to gain access to a computer by using automated software tools that attempt all passwords. If
  the operating system provides the capability, configure it to increase the period between login
  attempts with each unsuccessful attempt. If that is not possible, the second alternative is to deny login
  after a limited number of failed attempts (e.g., three). Typically, the account is “locked out” for a
  period of time (such as 30 minutes) or until a user with appropriate authority reactivates it.
     The choice to deny login is another situation that requires the mail server administrator to make a
     decision that balances security and convenience. Implementing this recommendation can help
     prevent some kinds of attacks, but it can also allow an attacker to make failed login attempts to
     prevent user access, a denial of service (DoS) condition.

     Failed network login attempts should not prevent an authorized user or administrator from logging in
     at the console. Note that all failed login attempts whether via the network or console should be
     logged. If remote administration is not to be implemented (see Section 9.5), disable the ability for the
     administrator or root level accounts to log in from the network.

 Install and configure other security mechanisms to strengthen authentication. If the information
  on the mail server requires it, consider using other authentication mechanisms such as biometrics,
  smart cards, client/server certificates, or one-time password systems. They can be more expensive
  and difficult to implement, but they may be justified in some circumstances. When such
