      NIST SP 800-78-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                    Cryptographic Algorithms
      September 2023                                                                    and Key Sizes for PIV



 81   Abstract
 82   Federal Information Processing Standard 201-3 (FIPS 201-3) defines the requirements for
 83   Personal Identity Verification (PIV) life cycle activities, including identity proofing, registration,
 84   PIV Card issuance, and PIV Card usage. FIPS 201-3 also defines the structure of an identity
 85   credential that includes cryptographic keys. This document contains the technical specifications
 86   needed for the mandatory and optional cryptographic keys specified in FIPS 201-3, as well as the
 87   supporting infrastructure specified in FIPS 201-3 and the related NIST Special Publication (SP)
 88   800-73, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification, and NIST SP 800-76, Biometric
 89   Specifications for Personal Identity Verification, which rely on cryptographic functions.

 93   Reports on Computer Systems Technology
 94   The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
 95   Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
 96   leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
 97   methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
 98   the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
 99   development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
100   the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
101   federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
102   guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
103   with industry, government, and academic organizations.
