5.5 Recommendations for System Administrators
The System Administrator is the individual who runs the S/MIME application on a day-
to-day basis and, on client implementations, interacts with the end user.

     1. The system administrator shall ensure that end users are properly trained and that
        the organization’s security policy is enforced.

     2. Systems shall be maintained so that they only permit the use of approved
        cryptographic algorithms and approved key sizes to encrypt or sign new
        messages.

     3. Administrators should maintain S/MIME clients so that they default to the use of
        an approved cipher algorithm suite. Furthermore, administrators should maintain
        a straightforward means for end users to change default settings and select
        algorithms as needed for interoperability and in accordance with organizational
        needs and policies.

     4. System administrators should provide training for users on the relative security
        provided by various cryptographic algorithms and on organizational policies for
        their use.

     5. System administrators should provide end users with guidance on how
        certificates and keys are stored and managed, and identify the end user’s related
        responsibilities.


5.6 Recommendations for End Users
An end user is the individual using a client to access the system. Even within a centrally
managed environment, end users may find that they have a significant amount of control
over some of the security features within an SMIME implementation.

     1. Users shall operate their system as instructed by their organization and system
        administrators.

     2. Users should use unique certificates for each security function at their disposal.23

     3. Users shall protect their private keys from unauthorized disclosure.

     4. Users should not send the same message in both encrypted and plain text.




23
  If they have not been supplied with certificates by their home organizations, users can obtain certificates
from a number of organizations via the web.
