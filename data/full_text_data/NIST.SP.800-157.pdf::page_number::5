Special Publication 800-157                                                             Guidelines for Derived PIV Credentials


Executive Summary

The deployment of PIV Cards and their supporting infrastructure was initiated in 2004 by Homeland
Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) with a directive to eliminate the wide variations in the
quality and security of authentication mechanisms used across Federal agencies. The mandate called for a
common identification standard to promote interoperable authentication mechanisms at graduated levels
of security based on the environment and the sensitivity of data. In response, the 2005 Federal
Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201 specified a common set of credentials in a smart card form
factor, known as the Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Card, which is currently used government-wide,
as intended, for both physical access to government facilities and logical access to Federal information
systems.

At the time that FIPS 201 was first published, logical access was geared towards traditional computing
devices (i.e., desktop and laptop computers) where the PIV Card provides common authentication
mechanisms through integrated readers across the federal government. With the emergence of a newer
generation of computing devices and in particular with mobile devices,1 the use of PIV Cards has proved
challenging. Mobile devices lack the integrated smart card readers found in laptop and desktop computers
and require separate card readers attached to devices to provide authentication services from the device.
For some departments and agencies, the use of PIV Cards and separate card readers is a practical solution
for authentication from mobile devices. Other departments and agencies may plan to take advantage of
Near Field Communication (NFC) to communicate with the PIV Card from NFC-enabled mobile devices.
These solutions are summarized in Section 1.1, Background, and provide the complete picture of mobile
device PIV-enablement.

NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-157 does not address use of the PIV Card with mobile devices, but
instead provides an alternative to the PIV Card in cases in which it would be impractical to use the PIV
Card. Instead of the PIV Card, SP 800-157 provides an alternative token, which can be implemented and
deployed directly with mobile devices (such as smart phones and tablets). The PIV credential associated
with this alternative token is called a Derived PIV Credential. The use of a different type of token greatly
improves the usability of electronic authentication from mobile devices to remote IT resources.

Derived PIV Credentials are based on the general concept of derived credentials in SP 800-63-2, which
leverages identity proofing and vetting results of current and valid credentials. When applied to PIV,
identity proofing and vetting processes do not have to be repeated to issue a Derived PIV Credential.
Instead, the user proves possession of a valid PIV Card to receive a Derived PIV Credential. To achieve
interoperability with the PIV infrastructure and its applications, a Derived PIV Credential is a PKI
credential.2




1 A mobile device, for the purpose of this document is a portable computing device that: (i) has a small form factor such that it

  can easily be carried by a single individual; (ii) is designed to operate without a physical connection (e.g., wirelessly transmit or
  receive information); (iii) possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and (iv) includes a self-contained power
  source. Mobile devices may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the devices to capture
  information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones, tablets,
  and e-readers.

   While the PIV Card may be used as the basis for issuing other types of derived credentials, the issuance of these other
  credentials is outside the scope of this document. Only derived credentials issued in accordance with this document are
  considered to be PIV credentials.
