2094   3.16.2. Unsupported System Components
2095             REQUIREMENT: 03.16.02
2096             a. Replace system components when support for the components is no longer available from
2097                the developer, vendor, or manufacturer.
2098             b. Provide options for risk mitigation or alternative sources for continued support for
2099                unsupported components if components cannot be replaced.

2100             DISCUSSION
2101             Support for system components includes software patches, firmware updates, replacement parts,
2102             and maintenance contracts. An example of unsupported components includes when vendors no
2103             longer provide critical software patches or product updates, which can result in opportunities for
2104             adversaries to exploit weaknesses or deficiencies in the installed components. Exceptions to
2105             replacing unsupported system components include systems that provide critical mission or
2106             business capabilities when newer technologies are unavailable or when the systems are so
2107             isolated that installing replacement components is not an option.
2108             Alternative sources for support address the need to provide continued support for system
2109             components that are no longer supported by the original manufacturers, developers, or vendors
2110             when such components remain essential to organizational mission and business functions. If
2111             necessary, organizations can establish in-house support by developing customized patches for
2112             critical software components or obtain the services of external providers who provide ongoing
2113             support for the designated unsupported components through contractual relationships. Such
2114             contractual relationships can include open-source software value-added vendors. The increased
2115             risk of using unsupported system components can be mitigated, for example, by prohibiting the
2116             connection of such components to public or uncontrolled networks or implementing other forms
2117             of isolation.

2121   3.16.3. External System Services
2122             REQUIREMENT: 03.16.03
2123             a. Require the providers of external system services used for the processing, storage, or
2124                transmission of CUI, to comply with the following security requirements: [Assignment:
2125                organization-defined security requirements].
2126             b. Define and document user roles and responsibilities with regard to external system services
2127                including shared responsibilities with external providers.
2128             c.   Implement processes, methods, and techniques to monitor security requirement compliance
2129                  by external service providers on an ongoing basis.

2130             DISCUSSION
2131             External system services are provided by external service providers. Organizations establish
2132             relationships with external service providers in a variety of ways, including through business
2133             partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing
2134             agreements, joint ventures, and supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks
2135             from the use of external system services remains with the organization charged with protecting


                                                            58
