Chapter 4
4. Awareness and Training
    The security awareness and training program is a critical component of the
information security program. It is the vehicle for disseminating security information
that the workforce, including managers, need to do their jobs. In terms of the total
security solution, the importance of the workforce in achieving information security
goals and the importance of training as a countermeasure cannot be overstated.
Establishing and maintaining a robust and relevant information security awareness
and training program as part of the overall information security program is the
primary conduit for providing the workforce with the information and tools needed to
protect an agency’s vital information resources. These programs will ensure that
personnel at all levels of the organization understand their information security
responsibilities to properly use and protect the information and resources entrusted
to them. Agencies that continually train their workforce in organizational security
policy and role-based security responsibilities will have a higher rate of success in
protecting information.
    As cited in audit reports, periodicals, and conference presentations, people are
arguably the weakest element in the security formula that is used to secure systems
and networks. The people factor, not technology, is a critical factor that is often
overlooked in the security equation. It is for this reason that the Federal Information
Security Management Act (FISMA) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
have mandated that more and better attention must be devoted to awareness
activities and role-based training, as they are the only security controls that can
minimize the inherent risk that results from the people who use, manage, operate,
and maintain information systems and networks. 31 Robust and enterprise-wide
awareness and training programs are needed to address this growing concern.
    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP)
800-50, Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training
Program, provides guidelines that can help federal departments and agencies meet
their information security awareness and training responsibilities defined in FISMA
and in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policy. The publication identifies
models for building and maintaining a comprehensive awareness and training
program as part of an organization’s information security program.
   NIST SP 800-50 is a companion publication to NIST SP 800-16, Information
Technology Security Training Requirements: A Role- and Performance-Based Model.
NIST SP 800-50 works at a higher strategic level and discusses how to build and
maintain an information security awareness and training program; NIST SP 800-16
addresses a more tactical level and discusses the awareness-training-education
continuum, role-based training, and course content considerations. The learning
continuum is shown in Figure 4-1.
