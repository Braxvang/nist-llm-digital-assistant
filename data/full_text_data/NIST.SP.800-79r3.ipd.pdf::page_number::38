       NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                             Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
       December 2023                                                                                    and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

1157   “contingency/disaster recovery plan for information systems.” Though the development of the
1158   contingency/disaster recovery plan is an organizational-level control, it must be reviewed when
1159   new information systems in the existing facilities or new facilities are added to ensure that the
1160   new systems are brought within the scope of the plan.
1161   Unlike organizational-level issuer controls, facility-level issuer controls need to be assessed
1162   individually at each facility. A facility is often designated based on the type of PIV process it
1163   performs (exceptions are the sponsorship process and adjudication process). For example, if
1164   there are multiple facilities for identity proofing/registration (e.g., multiple registration centers),
1165   assessment of the issuer controls under the identity proofing/registration focus area should take
1166   place in each of the registration centers. However, if all facilities are operating using uniform
1167   operational procedures and underlying information systems, assessments may be performed at
1168   facilities that are selected randomly or through some other established criteria (e.g., geographical
1169   region or service provider).
1170   Prior assessments MAY be used as a starting point for the assessment of an issuer. While past
1171   assessments provide insight into the implementation and operation of an issuer, a number of
1172   factors affect the validity of past assessments. These include updates in policies and procedures,
1173   changes in systems and technology, and turnover among employees and contractors. Any
1174   significant changes in one or more of these factors SHOULD trigger a new assessment. The
1175   assessor SHALL validate whether the issuer is currently operating as expected using the given
1176   assessment procedures, including specially tailored or augmented procedures. It is only through a
1177   current valid assessment of issuer controls that the assessor and the EIMO will have confidence
1178   in the reliability of the issuer and its issuing facilities.
1179   The use of automated security controls, if reliably implemented and maintained in information
1180   systems, results in a high assurance of the protection of information and other organizational
1181   assets. Human involvement results in more variability in how issuer controls are implemented
1182   and operated since security and reliability depend on many factors, including an individual’s
1183   training, knowledge, motivation, experience, and management. Relying on humans rather than
1184   automated security mechanisms for data protection makes it critical that trust and reliability
1185   assessments of management, operators, and maintenance personnel are current and up to date.
1186   Many assessment procedures rely on interactions among the assessor, issuer management, and
1187   facilities staff. Interviews with all involved personnel and observations of all PIV processes are
1188   required. On-site visits, real-time observations, and reviews of processes are essential. The
1189   assessor SHOULD NOT rely solely on documentation to determine whether a given issuer
1190   control has been implemented.

1191                Assessment Methods
1192   In order to assess the capability and reliability of an issuer, one or more assessment procedures
1193   associated with each issuer control have to be completed. An assessment procedure is carried out
1194   using one or more of the following assessment methods: 10
1195           •    Review — An evaluation of documentation that describes plans, policies, and procedures
1196                in order to verify that they are adequate, understood by management and operations


       10
            The assessment methods associated with an assessment procedure are given in parenthesis in Appendices G.1 and G.2.
