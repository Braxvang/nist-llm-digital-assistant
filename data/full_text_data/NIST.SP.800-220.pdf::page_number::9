Every organization wants to gain maximum effect and value for its finite cybersecurity-related
investments. This includes managing risk to the enterprise and optimizing the potential reward
of cybersecurity policies, programs, and actions. Organizations frequently make decisions by
comparing various projected costs with potential associated benefits and risk-reduction scenarios.
Senior executives need accurate and quantitative methods to portray and assess these factors, their
effectiveness and efficiency, and their effect on risk exposure. Providing reliable answers to these
questions requires organizations to employ a systematic approach to cybersecurity measurement
that considers current knowledge limits.

NIST’s cybersecurity measurements program enables organizations to manage cybersecurity risks
by supporting the development and alignment of technical measures to determine the effect of
cybersecurity risks and responses on an organization’s objectives. A mature metrics program is
content-rich, supports a broad range of stakeholders, and provides greater value to the organization.
More precise measurement data helps organizations focus on an actionable approach to improving
cybersecurity. NIST’s various initiatives to support this effort include research in new technology
areas and the development of risk management tools, test resources, guidance, and ways for
organizations to continue to mature their use of cybersecurity metrics. These initiatives involve
collaboration with the research, business, and government sectors.

Cyber Risk Analytics (CRA)
The CRA project promotes technical solutions and guidance to improve the understanding of
cybersecurity risks, inform management practices, and facilitate information sharing among risk
owners. NIST is leveraging past and present efforts, such as using a data repository for cyber
incident analysis, predictive analytics and strategic analysis on threat coverage, prioritization and
gap identification. In FY 2021, the research explored natural language processing to provide added
enrichment and enhanced graph visualization to cyber incident data in a collaborative repository. The
