Special Publication 800-157                                                          Guidelines for Derived PIV Credentials


A] defines a mechanism for an application provider to manage (i.e., load, install and personalize) its
application in a confidential manner while using a third party communication network. The Derived PIV
Application shall be installed in a security domain that is separate from other security domains, dedicated
to the Derived PIV Credential, and under the explicit control of the issuing agency. The APDUs as
specified in Appendix B shall be used with this secure element containing the PIV Derived Application.11

A UICC is a secure element, which may be capable of hosting a Derived PIV Application. A UICC used
to host a Derived PIV Credential shall implement the GlobalPlatform Card Secure Element Configuration
v1.0 [GP-SE].

3.3.1.3 USB Token with Cryptographic Module

A Universal Serial Bus (USB) token is a device that plugs into the USB port on various IT computing
platforms, including mobile devices. USB tokens typically include onboard storage and may also include
cryptographic processing capabilities (e.g., cryptographic mechanisms to verify the identity of users).

USB token implementations that contain an integrated secure element (an Integrated Circuit Card or ICC)
are suitable for issuance of Derived PIV Credentials. Such implementations are called USB Integrated
Circuit(s) Card Devices (ICCD) and shall comply with the Universal Serial Bus Device Class: Smart Card
ICCD Specification for USB Integrated Circuit(s) Card Devices [ICCDSPEC].

The APDUs for the Derived PIV Application (as specified in Appendix B) shall be transported to the
secure element using the Bulk-Out command pipe and the responses shall be received from the secure
element using the Bulk-In command pipe.

USB tokens with cryptographic modules that support a Derived PIV Application shall also be compliant
with the specifications in [SP800-96] for APDU support for contact card readers. The requirements for
the Application Programming Interface (API) for Derived PIV Application implementations are beyond
the scope of this document.

3.3.2     Embedded Cryptographic Tokens

A Derived PIV Credential and its associated private key may be used in cryptographic modules that are
embedded within mobile devices (see Draft NIST Interagency Report 7981, Mobile, PIV, and
Authentication [NISTIR7981]). These modules may either be in the form of a hardware cryptographic
module that is a component of the mobile device or in the form of a software cryptographic module that
runs on the device.

Protecting and using the Derived PIV Credentialâ€™s corresponding private key in software may potentially
increase the risk that the key could be stolen or compromised. For this reason, software-based Derived
PIV Credentials cannot be issued at LOA-4.

Note: Many mobile devices on the market provide a hybrid approach where the key is stored in hardware,
but a software cryptographic module uses the key during an authentication operation. While the hybrid
approach is a LOA-3 solution, it does provide many security benefits over software-only approaches.


   wants its own security domain, e.g., for having its own secure application environment or managing its own applications, such
   a domain can be created with the help of the card issuer. Institutions managing their own applications are also referred to as
   application providers. A controlling authority security domain, that is optionally present, offers a confidential personalization
   service to authenticated application providers.
11 The requirements in this section only apply to removable UICCs. An embedded UICC may be used to host a Derived PIV

   Credential in accordance with the requirements in Section 3.3.2
