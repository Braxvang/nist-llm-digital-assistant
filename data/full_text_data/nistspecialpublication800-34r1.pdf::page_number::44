and approaches for conducting TT&E activities is provided in NIST SP 800-84. The depth and rigor of
ISCP TT&E activities increases with the FIPS 199 availability security objective. All tests and exercises
should include some kind of determination of the effects on the organization’s operations and provide for
a mechanism to update and improve the plan as a result.

Each of the three ISCP Templates (FIPS 199 low, moderate, and high) included as appendices to this
guide contain details for conducting TT&E activities appropriate to their respective impact level.

   For low-impact systems, a tabletop exercise at an organization-defined frequency is sufficient.
    The tabletop should simulate a disruption, include all main ISCP points of contact, and be conducted
    by the system owner or responsible authority.
   For moderate-impact systems, a functional exercise at an organization-defined frequency
    should be conducted. The functional exercise should include all ISCP points of contact and be
    facilitated by the system owner or responsible authority. Exercise procedures should be developed to
    include an element of system recovery from backup media.
   For high-impact systems, a full-scale functional exercise at an organization-defined frequency
    should be conducted. The full-scale functional exercise should include a system failover to the
    alternate location. This could include additional activities such as full notification and response of
    key personnel to the recovery location, recovery of a server or database from backup media or setup,
    and processing from a server at an alternate location. The test should also include a full recovery and
    reconstitution of the information system to a known state.

Table presents a sample TT&E activity using NIST SP 800-53 guidance and as required by the FIPS 199
impact level.
