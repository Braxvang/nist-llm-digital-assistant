GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



For example, in an EAS application, someone might remove or disable a tag to steal an item from a store
without triggering an alarm. Alternatively, someone could replace a tag with one from a lower-priced
item before purchasing the tagged item. In an access control application, someone might replace a tag
with one that has greater access. If the replaced tag were attached to a picture identification badge, an
adversary might be able to effectively gain the privileges of another person while appearing legitimate to
personnel who visually check the badge. 31

Environmental threats to tags include extreme heat, cold, moisture, vibration, shock, and radiation
(including sunlight). Any risk assessment of environmental threats should also consider the impact of
these conditions to the material to which the tag is attached and the glue or other mechanism that attaches
the tag to the item. Impacts of harsh environmental conditions include degradation of tag performance,
destruction of the tag, and separation of the tag from its associated item.

Organizations need to assess the likelihood of these threats in their environment and set requirements for
their RFID technology accordingly. In general, human threats are more likely to be realized if outsiders
(e.g., customers or members of the general public) have physical access to the tags and therefore the
means to engage in malicious behavior. Human threats are also more likely if people have an incentive to
perform the attack, such as some form of financial gain or access to a restricted resource.

3.5       RFID Economics

Cost-benefit tests can be applied to any technology project, but the RF subsystem of an RFID system has
differentiating characteristics, especially regarding security. Table 3-2 examines the key factors to
consider.

       Smartcard standards (as distinguished from RFID standards) include specifications for tamper proofing, including
       lamination of the cards. Lamination is the application of a transparent material that, among other things, prevents the easy
       removal of a tag attached to the surface of the card.
