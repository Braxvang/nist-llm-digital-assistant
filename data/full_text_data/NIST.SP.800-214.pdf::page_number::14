services are sufficiently trustworthy and have the necessary resilience to support organizational
missions. To this end, NIST has supported public and private-sector outreach for
interested stakeholders, including hosting a virtual event with over 8,500 participants.
The most significant changes to SP 800-53, Revision 5, include:
• Making controls outcome-based
• Consolidating the control catalog to address information security, privacy, and supply chain
  risk management
• Adding state-of-the-practice controls to support cyber resiliency, secure systems design,
  security and privacy governance, and accountability
• Transferring control baselines, including the first federal privacy control baseline, and tailoring
  guidance to a separate publication, NIST SP 800-53B, Control Baselines for Information
  Systems and Organizations
Supporting the Implementation of the RMF and SP 800-53
NIST continues to develop publications that support the implementation of the RMF steps,
including Volume 4 in the NISTIR 8011 series, Automation Support for Security
Control Assessments: Software Vulnerability Management. NISTIR 8011, Volume 4,
addresses the automation of security control assessment, helping with the software
vulnerability management of security capabilities and facilitating the risk management of
defects that are present in software on the network.
NIST also published SP 800-137A, Assessing Information Security Continuous
Monitoring (ISCM) Programs: Developing an ISCM Program Assessment. NIST SP
800-137A details an approach for the development and evaluation of Information Security
Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) programs. An ISCM program assessment provides
organizational leadership with information about the effectiveness and completeness
of the organization’s continuous monitoring program, including the review of ISCM
strategies, policies, procedures, operations, and the analysis of continuous monitoring data.
Integration of Cybersecurity Risk Management into Enterprise Risk Management
The increasing frequency, creativity, and severity of cybersecurity attacks mean that
all enterprises should ensure that cybersecurity risk is receiving appropriate attention
within their enterprise risk management (ERM) programs. In FY 2020, NIST developed
NISTIR 8286, Integrating Cybersecurity and Enterprise Risk Management, to help
enterprise stakeholders improve and apply the use of cybersecurity risk management (CSRM)
information as an input to ERM processes. By doing so, enterprises and their component
organizations can better identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks in the context of
their broader mission and business objectives. The publication describes the use of risk
registers to document, aggregate, and communicate risk elements. Doing so ensures that
CSRM is an integral part of ERM, both taking its direction from ERM and informing it.
