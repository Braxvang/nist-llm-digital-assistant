4.9.5 Multi-level Security Domains
A security domain could contain entities, each of which supports the same multi-level
Domain Security Policy. For example, the Domain Security Policy could provide either a
high level or a low level of protection to the keys and/or metadata that it processes. In this
case, the security domain acts much like two separate security domains because it must
distinguish between the two levels of protection. Each entity must ensure that keys and/or
metadata protected by the higher-level policy are always provided the higher level of
protection, that keys and/or metadata protected by the lower-level policy cannot be
confused with the higher-level keys and/or metadata, and that higher-level keys and/or
metadata do not get confused with lower-level keys and/or metadata. This typically
involves a multi-level operating system. See Figure 9. Physical entity B is divided into
two logical entities: entity BHL for high-level protection, and entity BLL for low-level
protection. The separation of the BHL keys from the BLL keys is maintained logically (as
indicated by the dashed line in the figure) by the operating system. The advantage of a
multi-level security domain is that it can process keys and/or metadata from entities
operating at different security levels.
