                                                             CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



8.3.3    Portability of Workloads

An initial barrier to cloud adoption is the need to move local workloads into a provider's infrastructure.
For a consumer, this decision is less risky if a provider offers a practical method to move workloads (e.g.,
data workload or a fully encapsulated compute/storage/network workload) back to a consumerâ€™s premises
on demand. Another issue is that a consumer should be able to move a workload from one provider to
another on demand. These two needs would support a competitive cloud marketplace.

Portability relies on standardized interfaces and data formats. Cloud computing relies on both consensus
and de facto standards such as TCP/IP, XML, WSDL, IA-64, x509, PEM, DNS, SSL/TLS, SOAP, REST,
etc. Cloud service offerings that rent traditional computing resources (such as virtual machines or disk
storage, i.e., IaaS) are closely related to existing standards, and hence some usage scenarios illustrating
portability can be expressed using existing standards terminology.

Achieving portability is (and will remain) a challenge, because IaaS systems expose low-level details
such as device interfaces, and any mismatch between such interfaces is an obstacle. In contrast, cloud
service offerings that rent synthetic entities, such as access to a middleware stack (PaaS) or rights to use a
given application (SaaS), are less well described by current standards, and hence even common
terminology is lacking for describing how such entities might be transferred from one provider to another.
While some low level details such as device interfaces are hidden by providers and thus helpful for
mobility, the resource definitions are frequently vendor-specific.

8.3.4    Interoperability between Cloud Providers

For operations such as transferring a virtual machine image and data between providers, standardized
formats for the data being transferred, billing, and identity management are needed. Some standards,
such the Open Virtualization Format [DMT09] and the Cloud Data Management Interface [SNI10], have
already been developed, but further development and experience is needed to reduce the costs of
interoperation among providers. As a security example, a provider must be able to offer proper
credentials to another provider before a transfer of consumer assets can be accomplished after a consumer
requests the transfer. Further, once legitimacy is determined, the formats for the transferred objects must
be compatible.

8.3.5    Disaster Recovery

Disaster recovery involves both physical and electronic mishaps with consumer assets. For natural
disasters, replication of data at geographically distributed sites is advisable. For other physical disasters
such as hardware theft, law enforcement involvement may offer the only remedy. For electronic mishaps,
fault tolerance approaches such as redundancy, replication, and diversity are all applicable, depending on
what type of electronic mishap is being protected against. Disaster recovery plans are applicable to all
hosted IT services and should be documented and quickly executable. All of these traditional issues are
complicated as consumers may not know where their workloads are hosted.

8.4     Compliance

When data or processing is moved to a cloud, the consumer retains the ultimate responsibility for
compliance but the provider (having direct access to the data) may be in the best position to enforce
compliance rules. A number of issues complicate compliance and should be addressed contractually.
NIST and other US government agencies are evolving paths to help consumers with compliance issues,
e.g., FEDRAMP [Fed10]. Also, see Section 3 and Appendix A.
