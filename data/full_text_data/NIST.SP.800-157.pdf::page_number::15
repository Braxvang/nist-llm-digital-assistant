record are stored in the same system and termination of the PIV Card automatically triggers termination
of the Derived PIV Credential.

The issuer of the Derived PIV Credential shall not solely rely on tracking the revocation status of the PIV
Authentication certificate as a means of tracking the termination status of the PIV Card. This is because
there are scenarios where the card’s PIV Authentication certificate is not revoked even though the PIV
Card has been terminated. This may happen, for example, when a terminated PIV Card is collected and
either zeroized or destroyed by an agency – in this case, in accordance with [FIPS201], the corresponding
PIV Authentication certificate does not need to be revoked.

Additional methods must be employed for obtaining information about the PIV Card from the PIV Card
issuer. Some example mechanisms are listed below – however, any other mechanism that meets the above
requirements is also acceptable.

       If the Derived PIV Credential is issued by the same agency or issuer that issued the Subscriber’s
        PIV Card, then the Derived PIV Credential issuer may have direct access to the Identity
        Management System (IDMS) database implemented by the issuing agency that contains the
        relevant information about the Subscriber.

       When the issuer of the Derived PIV Credential is different from the PIV Card Issuer, the
        following mechanisms may be applied:

            o    The Backend Attribute Exchange [BAE] can be queried for the termination status of the
                 PIV Card, if an attribute providing this information is defined and the issuer of the PIV
                 Card maintains this attribute for the Subscriber. The BAE can also be queried for other
                 attributes about the Subscriber (e.g., name) that may appear in the Derived PIV
                 Authentication certificate.

            o    The issuer of the Derived PIV Credential notifies the original PIV issuer when a Derived
                 PIV Credential is created. The issuer of the PIV Card maintains a list of corresponding
                 Derived PIV Credential issuers and sends notification to the latter set when the PIV Card
                 is terminated or when attributes about the cardholder change. Such notification should
                 provide evidence of receipt and the integrity of the message.

            o    If a Uniform Reliability and Revocation Service (URRS) is implemented in accordance
                 with Section 3.7 of [NISTIR7817], the issuer of a Derived PIV Credential may obtain
                 termination status of the Subscriber’s PIV Card through the URRS.
