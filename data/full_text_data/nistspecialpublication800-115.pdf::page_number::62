                                               TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



8.      Post-Testing Activities

Following the execution phase—whose findings are expressed in terms of vulnerabilities—the
organization should take steps to address the vulnerabilities that have been identified. This section
presents ways that organizations can translate their findings into actions that will improve security. First,
final analysis of the findings should be performed, and mitigation actions developed. Second, a report
should be developed to present the recommendations. Lastly, the mitigation activities should be carried
out. Many of the actions presented in this section may occur outside of the testing process itself—for
example, as part of a risk assessment that utilizes testing results.

8.1     Mitigation Recommendations

As described in Section 7.3, most analysis occurs during the testing process. Final analysis, such as the
development of overall conclusions, usually takes place after all testing activities have been completed
and involves the development of mitigation recommendations. While identifying and categorizing
vulnerabilities is important, a security test is much more valuable if it also results in a mitigation strategy
being developed and implemented. Mitigation recommendations, including the outcome of the root cause
analysis, should be developed for each finding. There may be both technical recommendations (e.g.,
applying a particular patch) and nontechnical recommendations that address the organization’s processes
(e.g., updating the patch management process). Examples of mitigation actions include policy, process,
and procedure modifications; security architecture changes; deployment of new security technologies; and
deployment of OS and application patches.

NIST SP 800-53 suggests mitigation recommendations for each security control. Organizations should
compare potential mitigation actions against operational requirements to determine the actions that best
balance functionality and security. Section 8.3 discusses the implementation of mitigation
recommendations.

8.2     Reporting

Upon completion of analysis, a report should be generated that identifies system, network, and
organizational vulnerabilities and their recommended mitigation actions. Security testing results can be
used in the following ways:

       As a reference point for corrective action
       In defining mitigation activities to address identified vulnerabilities
       As a benchmark for tracking an organization’s progress in meeting security requirements
       To assess the implementation status of system security requirements
       To conduct cost/benefit analysis for improvements to system security
       To enhance other life cycle activities, such as risk assessments, C&A, and process improvement
        efforts
       To meet reporting requirements, such as those of FISMA.
Security testing results should be documented and made available to the appropriate staff, which may
include the CIO, CISO, and ISSO as well as appropriate program managers or system owners. Because a
report may have multiple audiences, multiple report formats may be required to ensure that all are
appropriately addressed. For example, organizations developing reports for FISMA compliance need to
