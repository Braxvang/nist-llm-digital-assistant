SC-8      TRANSMISSION INTEGRITY

          Control:   The information system protects the integrity of transmitted information.
          Supplemental Guidance: If the organization is relying on a commercial service provider for
          transmission services as a commodity item rather than a fully dedicated service, it may be more
          difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the implementation of needed security
          controls for transmission integrity. When it is infeasible or impractical to obtain the necessary
          security controls and assurances of control effectiveness through appropriate contracting vehicles,
          the organization either implements appropriate compensating security controls or explicitly
          accepts the additional risk. NIST Special Publication 800-52 provides guidance on protecting
          transmission integrity using Transport Layer Security (TLS). NIST Special Publication 800-77
          provides guidance on protecting transmission integrity using IPsec. NIST Special Publication
          800-81 provides guidance on Domain Name System (DNS) message authentication and integrity
          verification. NSTISSI No. 7003 contains guidance on the use of Protective Distribution Systems.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs cryptographic mechanisms to recognize changes to information during
                transmission unless otherwise protected by alternative physical measures.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Alternative physical protection measures include, for
                example, protected distribution systems.

SC-9      TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY

          Control:   The information system protects the confidentiality of transmitted information.
          Supplemental Guidance:   If the organization is relying on a commercial service provider for
          transmission services as a commodity item rather than a fully dedicated service, it may be more
          difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the implementation of needed security
          controls for transmission confidentiality. When it is infeasible or impractical to obtain the
          necessary security controls and assurances of control effectiveness through appropriate contracting
          vehicles, the organization either implements appropriate compensating security controls or
          explicitly accepts the additional risk. NIST Special Publication 800-52 provides guidance on
          protecting transmission confidentiality using Transport Layer Security (TLS). NIST Special
          Publication 800-77 provides guidance on protecting transmission confidentiality using IPsec.
          NSTISSI No. 7003 contains guidance on the use of Protective Distribution Systems. Related
          security control: AC-17.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization employs cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of
                information during transmission unless otherwise protected by alternative physical measures.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Alternative physical protection measures include, for
                example, protected distribution systems.

           LOW Not Selected              MOD SC-9                   HIGH SC-9 (1)
