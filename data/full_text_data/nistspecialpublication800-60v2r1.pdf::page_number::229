recommended provisional categorization of the research and development information type
follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level depends on the effect of unauthorized disclosure of research and
development information on the ability of responsible agencies to gather and analyze data,
disseminate results, and develop new products, methodologies, and ideas, and on the degree to
which unauthorized disclosure of the information can assist hostile institutions to do harm to the
interests of the government of the United States. Many research and development activities are
conducted in association with public institutions of higher learning, and the findings resulting
from those activities are intended for publication. Unauthorized disclosure of most research and
development information can be expected to have only limited adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Most research and development
information is proprietary. Unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information violates several
statures and Federal regulations (see Appendix E). Pre-publication disclosure or other
unauthorized disclosure of research findings can have a serious adverse effect on agency
operations, agency assets, or individuals. In such cases, the confidentiality impact level
associated with research and development is moderate.

Premature and/or partial release of preliminary research and development information can lead to
misleading conclusions by policy makers, funding entities, news organizations, and/or the
general public. Where the research and development activities are associated with security
measures or law enforcement tools, potential adversaries may derive insights on countermeasures
development. In extreme cases, the resulting confidentiality impact can be high.

In some cases, the research and development information is classified or otherwise qualifies as
national security information). Such information is outside the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most government research and development information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of most research and development
information can be seriously disruptive to the progress of research activities. The effects on
future funding can be serious and can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting
external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations
and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be more
limited.
