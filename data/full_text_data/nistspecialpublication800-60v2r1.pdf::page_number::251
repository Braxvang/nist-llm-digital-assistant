Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
general insurance information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to general insurance information. The
nature of general insurance processes is usually tolerant of reasonable delays.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Extensive delays in insurance servicing
activities can result in financial harm for individuals and businesses and in public alarm and
repercussions in the financial markets. In more serious cases, delays may have serious political
and operational consequences for affected agencies. In such cases, the confidentiality impact
may be at least moderate.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
general insurance information is low.

D.25 Transfers to State/Local Governments
Transfers to States and Local Governments involve the transfer of funds or financial assistance
from the Federal government to State and Local governments and Indian tribes.

D.25.1 Formula Grants Information Type

Formula Grants involves the allocation of money to States or their subdivisions in accordance
with distribution formulas prescribed by law or administrative regulation, for activities of a
continuing nature. The recommended provisional security categorization for the formula grants
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of formula grants
information on the ability of responsible agencies to allocate money to States or their
subdivisions in accordance with distribution formulas prescribed by law or administrative
regulation, for activities of a continuing nature. Typically, unauthorized disclosure of most
formula grants information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets,
or individuals. In most cases, information associated with formula grants is public knowledge.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In a few cases, details of programs
for which formula grants are awarded may be sensitive (e.g., some Federal/State cooperative
programs intended to support Homeland Security operations). This can result in assignment of a
moderate or high impact level to such information.        Some formula grants information might
be classified (hence outside the scope of this guideline).
