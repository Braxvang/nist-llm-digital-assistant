GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



 Rebooting Hosts. For many host-based IDPS products, agent software upgrades and some agent
  configuration changes can necessitate rebooting the monitored hosts. As with other problems
  mentioned earlier, implementers should perform extensive testing of this before selecting products
  and consider the impact that reboots could have on the effectiveness of the agents (e.g., agents being
  unable to detect the latest threats because important hosts could not be rebooted).
7.2.3   Prevention Capabilities

Host-based IDPS agents offer various intrusion prevention capabilities. Because the capabilities vary
based on the detection techniques used by each product, the following items describe the capabilities by
detection technique.

 Code Analysis. The code analysis techniques can prevent code from being executed, including
  malware and unauthorized applications. Some host-based IDPSs can also stop network applications
  from invoking shells, which could be used to attempt to perform certain types of attacks. If
  configured and tuned well, code analysis can be very effective, particularly at stopping previously
  unknown attacks.
 Network Traffic Analysis. This can stop incoming network traffic from being processed by the host
  and outgoing network traffic from exiting it. This might be done to stop network, transport, and
  application layer attacks (and in some cases, wireless networking protocol attacks), as well as to stop
  the use of unauthorized applications and protocols. Analysis can also identify malicious files being
  downloaded or transferred and prevent those files from being placed on the host. The network traffic
  might be dropped or rejected, and the hostâ€™s personal firewall (which might be built into the agent)
  could be reconfigured to shun additional traffic related to the suspicious traffic. Network traffic
  analysis is effective at stopping many known and previously unknown attacks.
 Network Traffic Filtering. Working as a host-based firewall, this can stop unauthorized access and
  acceptable use policy violations (e.g., use of inappropriate external services). It is effective only
  against stopping activity that is identifiable by IP address and TCP port, UDP port, or ICMP type and
  code.
 Filesystem Monitoring. This can prevent files from being accessed, modified, replaced, or deleted,
  which could stop malware installation, including Trojan horses and rootkits, as well as other attacks
  involving inappropriate file access. This technique can provide an additional layer of access control
  to supplement the existing access control technologies on a host.
Other host-based IDPS detection techniques, such as log analysis, network configuration monitoring, and
file integrity and attribute checking, generally do not support prevention actions because they identify
events well after they have occurred.

7.2.4   Other Capabilities

Some host-based IDPSs offer non-IDPS capabilities such as antivirus software, spam filtering, and Web
or e-mail content filtering. It is outside the scope of this guide to discuss these capabilities, which are
often provided by bundling separate products with the IDPS software. This section focuses on those
additional product capabilities that are more closely tied to host-based IDPS functionality. Examples of
these capabilities are as follows:

 Removable Media Restriction. Some products can enforce restrictions on the use of removable
  media, both USB-based (e.g., flash drive) and traditional (e.g., CD, floppy disk). This can prevent
