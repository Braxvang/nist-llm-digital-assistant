potential applications for biometric conformance testing.
To progress the work beyond the original goal of research,
the development of a solution was performed, resulting
in a working implementation of an existing CSD BioCTS
CTS (developed in Microsoft C#) being incorporated into
a Linux and Java-based Apache Hadoop MapReduce
job. This work successfully overcame several initial
implementation problems, and resulted in a release package
and methodology for using BioCTS software in Apache
Hadoop (for more information on Apache Hadoop see:
https://hadoop.apache.org/). The process, problems,
and methods used to overcome them were presented
at Global Identity Summit 2014. BioCTS Web, an
ASP.NET Web application that runs existing BioCTS
CTSs, was updated to support more testing suites.
