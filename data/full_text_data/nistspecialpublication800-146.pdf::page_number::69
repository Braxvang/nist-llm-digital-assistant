                                                           CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



    response times that such systems may experience from unexpected and unavoidable round trip delays.
    Consumers should avoid using clouds for time-critical applications.
 Safety-critical Software. Because of the lack of ability to fully assess the “pedigree” for all
  subsystems composing a cloud, and because of network variability, employing cloud technologies for
  safety-critical applications at this time is not recommended.
 Application Development Tools. When available, consumers should choose clouds that provide
  application development frameworks that include an architecture and tools for mitigating security
  vulnerabilities. Tools that support the intuitive authoring and maintenance of security policies, and
  provide an integrated application development environment covering the full system lifecycle, with
  an orientation towards facilitating security accreditation, are preferable. Consumers should also assure
  that such tools satisfy as appropriate FIPS 140-2.
 Application Runtime Support. Before a decision is made to deploy a new application in a cloud, or
  in the case of composing an application from the building blocks offered by a provider, a consumer
  should ensure that libraries included in the compilation phase or libraries called during the execution
  phase behave as intended, both in terms of functionality and performance.
 Application Configuration. Consumers should ensure that an application can be configured to run in
  a secure manner (e.g., a dedicated VLAN segment) and can be integrated with existing
  enterprise/agency security frameworks (such as identification and authorization) such that
  enterprise/agency security policies are enforced.
 Standard Programming Languages. Consumers should choose clouds that work with standardized
  languages and tools wherever feasible.
