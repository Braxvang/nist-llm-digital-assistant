 Media Access Control                A hardware address that uniquely identifies each component of an
 Address                             IEEE 802-based network. On networks that do not conform to
                                     the IEEE 802 standards but do conform to the OSI Reference
                                     Model, the node address is called the Data Link Control (DLC)
                                     address.
 Media Sanitization                  A general term referring to the actions taken to render data
 [NIST SP 800-88]                    written on media unrecoverable by both ordinary and
                                     extraordinary means.
 Mobile Code                         Software programs or parts of programs obtained from remote
                                     information systems, transmitted across a network, and executed
                                     on a local information system without explicit installation or
                                     execution by the recipient.
 Mobile Code Technologies            Software technologies that provide the mechanisms for the
                                     production and use of mobile code (e.g., Java, JavaScript,
                                     ActiveX, VBScript).
 Moderate-Impact System              An information system in which at least one security objective
 [FIPS 200]                          (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, or availability) is assigned a FIPS
                                     199 potential impact value of moderate and no security objective
                                     is assigned a FIPS 199 potential impact value of high.
 National Security                   Telecommunications services that are used to maintain a state of
 Emergency Preparedness              readiness or to respond to and manage any event or crisis (local,
 Telecommunications                  national, or international) that causes or could cause injury or
 Services                            harm to the population, damage to or loss of property, or degrade
 [47 C.F.R., Part 64, App A]         or threaten the national security or emergency preparedness
                                     posture of the United States.
 National Security                   Information that has been determined pursuant to Executive
 Information                         Order 12958 as amended by Executive Order 13292, or any
                                     predecessor order, or by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as
                                     amended, to require protection against unauthorized disclosure
                                     and is marked to indicate its classified status.
 National Security System            Any information system (including any telecommunications
 [44 U.S.C., Sec. 3542]              system) used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an
                                     agency, or other organization on behalf of an agencyâ€” (i) the
                                     function, operation, or use of which involves intelligence
                                     activities; involves cryptologic activities related to national
                                     security; involves command and control of military forces;
                                     involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or
                                     weapons system; or is critical to the direct fulfillment of military
                                     or intelligence missions (excluding a system that is to be used for
                                     routine administrative and business applications, for example,
                                     payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management
                                     applications); or (ii) is protected at all times by procedures
                                     established for information that have been specifically authorized
                                     under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of
                                     Congress to be kept classified in the interest of national defense
                                     or foreign policy.
