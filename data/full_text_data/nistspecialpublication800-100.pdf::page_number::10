CHAPTER 1                                                               Introduction



Chapter 1
1. Introduction
    This Information Security Handbook provides a broad overview of information
security program elements to assist managers in understanding how to establish and
implement an information security program. Typically, the organization looks to the
program for overall responsibility to ensure the selection and implementation of
appropriate security controls and to demonstrate the effectiveness of satisfying their
stated security requirements. The topics within this document were selected based
on the laws and regulations relevant to information security, including the Clinger-
Cohen Act of 1996, the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of
2002, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130. The material in
this handbook can be referenced for general information on a particular topic or can
be used in the decision-making process for developing an information security
program. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NISTIR) Interagency
Report 7298 provides a summary glossary for the basic security terms used
throughout this document. While reading this handbook, please consider that the
guidance is not specific to a particular agency. Agencies should tailor this guidance
according to their security posture and business requirements.

1.1    Purpose and Applicability
    The purpose of this publication is to inform members of the information security
management team (agency heads; chief information officers [CIOs]; senior agency
information security officers [SAISOs], also commonly referred to as Chief
Information Security Officers [CISOs]; and security managers) about various aspects
of information security that they will be expected to implement and oversee in their
respective organizations. In addition, the handbook provides guidance for facilitating
a more consistent approach to information security programs across the federal
government. Even though the terminology in this document is geared toward the
federal sector, the handbook can also be used to provide guidance on a variety of
other governmental, organizational, or institutional security requirements.

1.2    Relationship to Existing Guidance
   This handbook summarizes and augments a number of existing NIST standards
and guidance documents and provides additional information on related topics. Such
documents are referenced within appropriate subchapters.

1.3    Audience
    The intended audience includes agency heads, CIOs, SAISOs (also commonly
referred to as CISOs), and security managers. The handbook provides information
that the audience can use in building their information security program strategy.
While there are differences between federal and private sector environments,
especially in terms of priorities and legal requirements, the underlying principles of
information security are the same. The handbook is therefore useful to any manager
who requires a broad overview of information security practices.
