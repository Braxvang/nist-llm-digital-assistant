NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                                         Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

The applicability statement is not meant to limit the technical and management application of
these considerations. That is, the security design principles, concepts, and techniques described
in this publication are part of a trustworthy secure design approach as described in Appendix D
and can be applied in any of the following cases:
•    Development of a new capability or system
     The engineering effort includes such activities as concept exploration, preliminary or applied
     research to refine the concepts and/or feasibility of technologies employed in a new system,
     and an assessment of alternative solutions. This effort is initiated during the concept and
     development stages of the system life cycle.
•    Modification of an existing capability or system
     -     Reactive modifications to fielded systems: The engineering effort occurs in response to
           adversity that diminishes or prevents the system from achieving the design intent. This
           effort can occur during the production, utilization, or support stages of the system life
           cycle and may be performed concurrently with or independent of day-to-day system
           operations.
     -     Planned upgrades to fielded systems while continuing to sustain day-to-day operations:
           Planned system upgrades may enhance an existing system capability, provide a new
           capability, or constitute a technology refresh of an existing capability. This effort occurs
           during the production, utilization, or support stages of the system life cycle.
     -     Planned upgrades to fielded systems that result in new systems: The engineering effort is
           conducted as if developing a new system with a system life cycle that is distinct from the
           life cycle of a fielded system. The upgrades are performed in a development environment
           that is independent of the fielded system.
•    Evolution of an existing capability or system
     The engineering effort involves migrating or adapting a system or system implementation
     from one operational environment or set of operating conditions to another operational
     environment or set of operating conditions. 7
•    Retirement of an existing capability or system
     The engineering effort removes system functions, services, elements, or the entire system
     from operation and may include the transition of system functions and services to another
     system. The effort occurs during the retirement stage of the system life cycle and may be
     conducted while sustaining day-to-day operations.
•    Development of a dedicated, domain-specific, or special-purpose capability or system
     -     Security-dedicated or security-purposed system: The engineering effort delivers a system
           that satisfies a security-dedicated need or provides a security-oriented purpose and does
           so as a stand-alone system that may monitor or interact with other systems. Such systems

  There is a growing need to reuse or leverage system implementation successes within operational environments that are different from how they
were originally designed and developed. This type of reuse or reimplementation of systems within other operational environments is more
efficient and represents potential advantages in maximizing interoperability between various system implementations. It should be noted that
reuse may violate the assumptions used to determine that a system or system component was trustworthy.
