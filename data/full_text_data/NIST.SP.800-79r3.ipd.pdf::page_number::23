      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                    Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                           and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

663   2.7.2. Designated Authorizing Official (DAO)
664   The designated authorizing official (DAO) has the authority within an organization to review the
665   assessment results of the organization’s established issuers and related issuing facilities and to
666   provide an authorization decision as required by [HSPD-12]. Through authorization, the DAO
667   accepts responsibility for the operation of the issuers at an acceptable level of risk and attests that
668   the organization is issuing PIV Cards and, optionally, derived PIV credentials in accordance with
669   the requirements of [FIPS201] such that issued PIV credentials have the commensurate level of
670   identity assurance. The SAO may also fulfill the role of the DAO. The DAO SHALL NOT
671   assume the role of the EIMO.

672   2.7.3. Enterprise Identity Management Official (EIMO)
673   The organization’s enterprise identity management official (EIMO) is responsible for
674   implementing the policies of the organization and ensuring that all identity-proofing, card/token
675   production, issuance, and maintenance processes are being performed reliably, consistently,
676   securely, and in compliance with [FIPS201] and, optionally, [SP800-157] (in the case of derived
677   PIV credentials) by the issuer. The EIMO is responsible for the organization’s identity
678   management system and the enrolled PIV identity accounts. The EIMO ensures that the PIV
679   identity account remains current at all times and that all issued PIV credentials are represented
680   within this PIV identity account for the cardholder.
681   Furthermore, the organization’s EIMO implements and manages the operations plan; ensures that
682   all issuing facility roles are filled with capable, trustworthy, knowledgeable, and trained staff;
683   ensures that all services, equipment, and processes meet [FIPS201] requirements; monitors and
684   coordinates activities with issuing facility managers; provides guidance to the issuing facilities
685   and SRIP operators as needed; and supports the authorization process.

686   2.7.4. Issuing Facility Manager
687   An issuing facility manager manages the day-to-day operations of an issuing facility, remote
688   SIRP center, or SIRP station. The issuing facility manager is responsible for implementing all
689   operating procedures for those functions that have been designated for that facility by the issuer.
690   The manager ensures that all PIV processes adhere to the requirements of [FIPS201] and that all
691   PIV and derived PIV services performed at the issuing facility are carried out in a consistent and
692   reliable manner in accordance with the organization’s policies and procedures and the direction
693   of the organization’s EIMO. In some cases (e.g., small organizations), the EIMO MAY fulfill the
694   role of the issuing facility manager.

695   2.7.5. Operator
696   An operator is responsible for executing all operating procedures for all functions, whether in-
697   person or remotely observed (e.g., identity proofing, registration, issuance of the PIV Card or
698   post-enrollment binding of a derived PIV credential, etc.) All operators SHALL receive
699   comprehensive training to perform their assigned responsibilities, detect fraudulent identity
700   source documents, and properly capture biometrics when needed. Multiple operators CAN be
701   assigned to an issuing facility, depending on the size of that facility. The issuer is responsible for
