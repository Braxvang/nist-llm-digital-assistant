3.      IT Security Services

This chapter provides an overview of IT security services, service arrangements, service issues, and
service management tools. These overviews serve as an introduction to the IT security services life cycle
discussed in Chapter 4. This life cycle is independent of an organization’s decision to use internal
resources or an external service provider to perform the service. Ultimately, the organization remains
responsible for and affected by any security breach regardless of who performs the security service.

3.1     Overview of IT Security Services

Security services fall into one of three categories (Table 3-1).


                                      Table 3-1. IT Security Categories

     Management Services     Techniques and concerns normally addressed by management in the
                             organization’s computer security program. They focus on managing the computer
                             security program and the risk within the organization.
     Operational Services    Services focused on controls implemented and executed by people (as opposed to
                             systems). They often require technical or specialized expertise and rely on
                             management activities and technical controls.
     Technical Services      Technical services focused on security controls a computer system executes.
                             These services are dependent on the proper function of the system for
                             effectiveness.


The security services life cycle applies to any security service regardless of the category into which it falls
and could even apply to an entire IT security category. As managers determine which IT security services
need to be implemented, assessed, or discontinued, they should consider the impact on other IT security
services.
