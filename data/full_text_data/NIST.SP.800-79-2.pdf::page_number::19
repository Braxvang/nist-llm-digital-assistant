Special Publication 800-79-2                                           Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                                        and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



define the authorization boundary of their issuer such that it strikes a balance between the costs
and benefits of assessment and authorization.

While the above considerations should be useful to an organization in determining the boundary
for purposes of authorization, they should not limit the organization’s flexibility in establishing a
practical boundary that promotes an effective [HSPD-12] compliant implementation. The scope
of an authorization is an issuer - that is a PCI or DPCI (whose boundaries are formed by included
issuing facilities) and not individual issuing facilities.

2.6 Issuer Roles and Responsibilities

PIV Card and Derived PIV Credential issuance roles and their processes are to be selected based
on the organization’s structure, its mission, and operating environment. The organization must
make sure that a separation of roles has been established and the processes are in compliance
with FIPS 201-2.

This document identifies roles and responsibilities of key personnel involved in the assessment
and authorization of an issuer.10 Recognizing that organizations have widely varying missions
and structures, there may be some differences in naming conventions for authorization-related
roles and in how the associated responsibilities are allocated among personnel (e.g. one
individual may perform multiple roles in certain circumstances).

2.6.1 Senior Authorizing Official (SAO)
The Senior Authorizing Official (see Figure 2) of an organization is responsible for all
operations. The SAO has budgetary control, provides oversight, develops policy, and has
authority over all functions and services provided by the issuer.

2.6.2 Designated Authorizing Official (DAO)
The Designated Authorizing Official has the authority within an organization to review all
assessments of an issuer and its facilities, and to provide an authorization decision as required by
[HSPD-12]. Through authorization, the DAO accepts responsibility for the operation of the
issuer at an acceptable level of risk to the organization. The SAO may also fulfill the role of the
DAO. The DAO shall not assume the role of the OIMO.

2.6.3 Organization Identity Management Official (OIMO)
The Organization Identity Management Official is responsible for implementing policies of the
organization, assuring that all PIV processes of the issuer are being performed reliably, and
providing guidance and assistance to the issuing facilities. The OIMO implements and manages
the operations plan; ensures that all roles are filled with capable, trustworthy, knowledgeable,
and trained staff; makes certain that all services, equipment, and processes meet FIPS 201-2
requirements; monitors and coordinates activities with Issuing Facility Manager(s); and supports
the authorization process.

  Organizations may define other significant roles (e.g., PIV System liaisons, operations managers) to support the authorization
 process.
