                                                                                         SECTION 5: RFID SECURITY CONTROLS



5.     RFID Security Controls

This section discusses security controls that can potentially mitigate the business risks associated with
RFID systems. As previously discussed, RFID implementations are highly customized. As a result, the
security controls listed are not all applicable or effective for all RFID applications. Organizations need to
assess the risks they face and choose an appropriate mix of controls for their environments, taking into
account factors such as regulatory requirements, the magnitude of the threat, cost and performance.

Federal agencies should refer to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 200,
Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems and NIST Special
Publication 800-53 (as amended), Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems,
when developing or revising policies related to an RFID system. NIST Special Publication 800-100,
Information Security Handbook: A Guide for Managers may also be helpful as it provides a broad
overview of information security program elements to assist managers in understanding how to establish
and implement an information security program.

This section covers security controls applicable to most RFID implementations. It does not address the
security of RFID-enabled smart cards and payment systems. This section also does not discuss security
controls related to general IT systems, such as network infrastructure, databases, and Web servers because
these are already covered by other security requirements and guidelines. For example, EPCIS servers,
which can be accessed by trading partners through the Internet, should be protected by the same types of
controls that would be used for any other Internet-facing system (e.g., encryption of sensitive
communications, access control to prevent unauthorized access to data and systems) to ensure the security
of the data collected by the RFID system. Guidelines on topics such as IT server, application, database,
and network security are available from many sources, including NIST’s Computer Security Resource
Center (CSRC). 39

RFID security is a rapidly evolving discipline. Although promising research is noted when applicable,
this section focuses on controls that are presently commercially available.

The RFID security controls discussed in this section are divided into three groups: 40

 Management. A management control involves oversight of the security of the RFID system. For
  example, the management of an organization might need to update existing policies to address RFID
  implementations, such as security controls needed for an RF subsystem.
 Operational. An operational control involves the actions performed on a daily basis by the system’s
  administrators and users. For example, RFID systems need operational controls that ensure the
  physical security of the systems and their correct use.
 Technical. A technical control uses technology to monitor or restrict the actions that can be
  performed within the system. RFID systems need technical controls for several reasons such as
  protecting data on tags, causing tags to self-destruct, and protecting wireless communications.
The information provided for each control includes:

     publications that address general security issues and provide guidelines for the configuration of specific technologies that
     might be of use when securing an RFID system, including the computing devices in the enterprise subsystem.
