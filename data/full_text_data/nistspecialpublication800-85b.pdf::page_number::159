                    encapContentInfo                encapContentInfo asserts the id-icao-
                                                    ldsSecurityObject OID.
TE06.04.07.01       10.4.2.4: Verify contents of    The tester shall validate that eContent of the
                    encapContentInfo                encapContentInfo contains the contents of the
                                                    ldsSecurity object.
TE06.04.08.01       10.4.2.5: Verify certificates   The tester shall validate that the certificates field has
                    field omission                  been omitted from the SignedData.
TE06.04.09.01       10.4.2.6: Verify Digest         The tester shall validate that the digest algorithm in
                    Algorithm in SignerInfo         the SignerInfo is based on the expiration date of the
                                                    PIV card and is in accordance with Table 3-7 of SP

TE06.04.11.01       10.4.2.8: Verify digital        The tester shall validate that the SignedData content
                    signature                       type includes the digital signature corresponding to
                                                    the signed security object.
