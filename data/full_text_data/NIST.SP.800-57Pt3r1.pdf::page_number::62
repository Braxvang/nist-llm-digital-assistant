   string for dynamic update-message authentication (via TSIG). The security strength
   of the random bit generator process shall support the security strength required by the
   servers.

8.4.2 Recommendations for System Installers (Caching Recursive Servers)
1. Recursive caching server installers shall configure DNS servers to be DNSSEC-
   aware.

2. Recursive caching server installers shall install at least one public key used for
   DNSSEC validation. The key(s) shall be kept up-to-date to insure successful
   validations.

8.4.3 Recommendations for System Installers (Client Systems)
1. Client systems shall be configured to send DNS queries to a DNSSEC-enabled
   caching recursive server.
2. Client systems should be configured to use DNSSEC-enabled applications, if they are
   available.

8.5 Recommendations for System Administrators
The System Administrator is the individual who runs the DNS application on a day-to-
day basis and interacts with the end user.

8.5.1 Recommendations for System Administrators (Authoritative Server)
1. The organization security policy regarding the Authoritative servers shall be
   enforced.
2. Cryptographic keys shall be protected as specified in Part 1.
3. System administrators shall replace zone data-signature Resource Records before the
   end of their validity period.
4. Zone data-signature Resource Records shall be replaced if the private key associated
   with the public key is compromised, when the administrator of the DNS zone leaves
   the organization, and for other reasons listed in the organizationâ€™s security policy.
5. Administrators shall utilize methods for handling and protecting the private key (e.g.,
   using a smart card that requires appropriate user authentication).
6. Administrators shall follow the key lifecycle procedures found in NIST Special
   Publication 800-81, Secure Domain Name System (DNS) Deployment Guide [SP 800-
   81].

8.5.2 Recommendations for System Administrators (Caching Recursive Servers)
1. Server administrators shall ensure that there is an organization security policy for
   using the Caching Recursive Server.
2. Cryptographic keys shall be adequately protected (see Part 1).
3. The trust anchors for DNS validating caches should be kept up to date.
