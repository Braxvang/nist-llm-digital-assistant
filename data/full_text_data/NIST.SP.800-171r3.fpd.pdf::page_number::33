627   3.3.2. Audit Record Content
628           REQUIREMENT: 03.03.02
629           a. Include the following content in audit records:
630               1. What type of event occurred;
631               2. When the event occurred;
632               3. Where the event occurred;
633               4. Source of the event;
634               5. Outcome of the event; and
635               6. Identity of individuals, subjects, objects, or entities associated with the event.
636           b. Provide additional information for audit records, as needed.

637           DISCUSSION
638           Audit record content that may be necessary to support the auditing function includes time stamps,
639           source and destination addresses, user or process identifiers, event descriptions, file names, and
640           the access control or flow control rules that are invoked. Event outcomes can include indicators of
641           event success or failure and event-specific results (e.g., the security state of the system after the
642           event occurred). Detailed information that organizations may consider in audit records includes a
643           full text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities of group account users.

647   3.3.3. Audit Record Generation
648           REQUIREMENT: 03.03.03
649           a. Generate audit records for the selected event types and audit record content specified in
650              03.03.01 and 03.03.02.
651           b. Retain audit records for a time period consistent with records retention policy.

652           DISCUSSION
653           Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as
654           information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical
655           aspect of an audit logging capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to
656           problems. The ability to add information generated in audit records is dependent on system
657           functionality to configure the audit record content. Organizations may consider additional
658           information in audit records, including the access control or flow control rules invoked and the
659           individual identities of group account users. Organizations may also consider limiting additional
660           audit record information to only information that is explicitly needed for audit requirements.
