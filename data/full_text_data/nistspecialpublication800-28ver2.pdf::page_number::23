figure, not only can the server impact the browser by supplying it code to execute, but the reverse is also
true: input from the browser can influence the execution at the server. As discussed in Section 2, the
process of rendering the active content is more involved than what is illustrated in Figure 3-2.
Nevertheless, conceptually the depiction is accurate; the supplier of the code and the operator of the
execution environment can be from different domains, posing a security risk for each side.

                                  Figure 3-2. Simplified HTTP Transaction

Although Web transactions can be visualized as simple HTTP interchanges between a browser and a Web
server, they often are more complex, involving other computer platforms. For example, the Web server
may rely on a database server or other online repository or computational engine to fulfill requests it
receives. HTTP also accommodates redirection by allowing a Web server to provide referrals to other
servers that host requested resources. The redirected Web server could in turn provide further redirection
to other servers, if needed. Figure 3-3 gives a more complete picture of some of the other entities that
could be involved in Web transactions.




                       Figure 3-3. Entities Involved in HTTP Transaction Processing

Soon after early forms of active content began to appear on Web sites, some of the fundamental security
concerns associated with the design of the Web were recognized [Coh95]:
