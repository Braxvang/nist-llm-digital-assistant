                                                                  GUIDELINES ON FIREWALLS AND FIREWALL POLICY


 Secondary system status changes, if applicable.
5.3   Test

New firewalls should be tested and evaluated before deployment to ensure that they are working properly.
Testing should be completed on a test network without connectivity to the production network. This test
network should attempt to replicate the production network as faithfully as possible, including the
network topology and network traffic that would travel through the firewall. Aspects of the solution to
evaluate include the following:

 Connectivity. Users can establish and maintain connections through the firewall.
 Ruleset, Traffic that is specifically allowed by the security policy is permitted. All traffic that is not
  allowed by the security policy is blocked. Verification of the ruleset should include both reviewing it
  manually and testing whether the rules work as expected.
 Application Compatibility. Host-based or personal firewall solutions do not break or interfere with
  the use of existing software applications. This includes network communications between application
  components. Network firewall solutions do not interfere with applications that have components that
  interact through the firewall (e.g., client and server software).
 Management. Administrators can configure and manage the solution effectively and securely.
 Logging. Logging and data management function in accordance with the organization’s policies and
  strategies.
 Performance. Solutions provide adequate performance during normal and peak usage. In many
  cases, the best way to test performance under the load of a prototype implementation is to use
  simulated traffic generators on a live test network to mimic the actual characteristics of expected
  traffic as closely as possible. Simulating the loads caused by DoS attacks can also be helpful in
  assessing firewall performance. Testing should incorporate a variety of applications that will traverse
  the firewall, especially those that are most likely to be affected by network throughput or latency
  issues.
 Security of the Implementation. The firewall implementation itself may contain vulnerabilities and
  weaknesses that attackers could exploit. Organizations with high security needs may want to perform
  vulnerability assessments against firewall components.
 Component Interoperability. Components of the firewall solution must function together properly.
  This is of greatest concern when a variety of components from different vendors are used.
 Policy Synchronization. If there are multiple firewalls running synchronized policies or groups of
  rules, test that the synchronization works in various scenarios (such as if one or more nodes are
  offline).
 Additional Features. Additional features that will be used by the firewall—such as VPN and
  antimalware capabilities—should be tested to ensure they are working properly.
5.4   Deploy

Once testing is complete and all issues have been resolved, the next phase of the firewall planning and
implementation model is deployment, which should be done in accordance with organization policies.
Before deploying the firewall, administrators should notify users or owners of potentially affected
systems of the planned deployment, and instruct them who to notify if they encounter any problems. Any
