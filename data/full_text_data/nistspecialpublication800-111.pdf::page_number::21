information
* These storage encryption technologies can only protect the files against some OS and application layer threats if
the user has not been authenticated in this session to access the files. If a single sign-on solution is used, then
generally the user is authenticated to the storage encryption technology during OS login, so the files are not protected
against these threats once OS login occurs. If a separate authentication solution is used, the files are protected until
that separate authentication is performed.

When selecting storage encryption technologies, an organization should take into consideration the extent
to which each technology will require the infrastructure and end user devices to be changed. For
example, using some technologies requires deploying additional servers and installing software on the
devices to be protected, while other technologies can use existing servers, as well as software built into
the devices to be protected, such as FIPS approved encryption features built into the devices’ operating
systems. Generally, the more extensive the changes are to the infrastructure and devices, the more likely
it is that the storage encryption technology will cause a loss of functionality or other problems with the
devices. When evaluating solutions, organizations should compare the loss of functionality with the gain
in security capabilities and decide if the tradeoff is acceptable. Technologies that require extensive
changes to the infrastructure and end user devices should generally be used only when other technologies
cannot meet the organization’s needs.

The following are use cases that highlight the types of storage encryption technologies that may be
suitable for certain situations. Each use case presents a brief scenario, including the threats that need to
be mitigated, and then proposes possible solutions, both storage encryption technologies and alternate
solutions (if applicable). Each use case only lists high-level solutions that may be feasible, and is not
