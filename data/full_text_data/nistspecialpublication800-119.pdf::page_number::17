                                                               GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


  2.3.1   Extended Address Space

Each IPv4 address is typically 32 bits long and is written as four decimal numbers representing 8-bit
octets and separated by decimal points or periods. An example address is 172.30.128.97. Each IPv6
address is 128 bits long (as defined in RFC 4291) and is written as eight 16-bit fields in colon-delimited
hexadecimal notation (an example is fe80:43e3:9095:02e5:0216:cbff:feb2:7474). This new 128-bit
address space provides an enormous number of unique addresses, 2128 (or 3.4 x 1038) addresses, compared
with IPv4’s 232 (or 4.3 x 109) addresses. That is enough for many trillions of addresses to be assigned to
every human being on the planet. Moreover, these address bits are divided between the network prefix
and the host identifier portions of the address. The network prefix designates the network upon which the
host bearing the address resides. The host identifier identifies the node or interface within the network
upon which it resides. The network prefix may change while the host identifier can remain static. The
static host identifier allows a device to maintain a consistent identity despite its location in a network.
This enormous number of addresses allows for end-to-end communication between devices with globally
unique IP addresses and can better support the delivery of peer-to-peer services with data-rich content
such as voice and video. Chapter 3 describes IPv6 addressing in detail.

  2.3.2   Autoconfiguration

Essentially plug-and-play networking, autoconfiguration, defined in RFC 4862, IPv6 Stateless Address
Autoconfiguration, is one of the most interesting and potentially valuable addressing features in IPv6.
This feature allows devices on an IPv6 network to configure themselves independently using a stateless
protocol. In IPv4, hosts are configured manually or with host configuration protocols like Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP); with IPv6, autoconfiguration takes this a step further by defining a
method for some devices to configure their IP addresses and other parameters without the need for a
server. Moreover, it also defines a method, renumbering, whereby the time and effort required to
renumber a network by replacing an old prefix with a new prefix are vastly reduced. Section 3.5.4
describes autoconfiguration in detail.

  2.3.3   Header Structure

The IPv6 header is much simpler than the IPv4 header and has a fixed length of 40 bytes (as defined in
RFC 2460).

Even though this header is almost twice as long as the minimum IPv4 header, much of the header is taken
up by two 16-byte IPv6 addresses, leaving only 8 bytes for other header information. This allows for
improved fast processing of packets and protocol flexibility. IPv6 datagrams use a structure that always
includes a 40-byte base header and, optionally, one or more extension headers. This base header is like
the header of IPv4 datagrams, though it has a different format. Five IPv4 header fields have been
removed: IP header length, identification, flags, fragment offset, and header checksum. The IPv6 header
fields are as follows: version (IP version 6), traffic class (replacing IPv4’s type of service field), flow
label (a new field for Quality of Service (QoS) management), payload length (length of data following the
fixed part of the IPv6 header), next header (replacing IPv4’s protocol field), hop limit (number of hops,
replacing IPv4’s time to live field), and source and destination addresses. The IPv6 header format is
illustrated in Figure 2-1. The payload can be up to 64KB in size in standard mode, or larger with a jumbo
payload option. Section 3.3 describes these headers in detail.
