                                                                          BIOS PROTECTION GUIDELINES FOR SERVERS
environments. This publication identifies three general types of authenticated BIOS update mechanisms.
A server will typically implement one or more of these update mechanisms. Each mechanism is briefly
described below:

          Update Mechanism 1 – Authenticated BIOS update that can occur anytime. This update
           mechanism allows the BIOS flash memory to be securely updated irrespective of the operating
           state of the server. This includes being able to update the BIOS flash while the server operates,
           without requiring a reboot. This mechanism must protect the BIOS flash memory from
           unauthorized modifications.
          Update Mechanism 2 – Authenticated BIOS update on reboot. This BIOS update mechanism
           allows the flash process to be initiated during server runtime, but the actual update of the BIOS
           flash memory does not occur until the system reboots. Like the previous mechanism, this
           mechanism must protect the BIOS flash memory from unauthorized modifications.
          Update Mechanism 3 – BIOS update at runtime and verification of BIOS on reboot. With
           this BIOS update mechanism, the BIOS is verified to be authentic before it is executed on every
           boot. This mechanism is necessary if the BIOS flash locking mechanism is inadequate to protect
           the integrity of a running system’s BIOS flash memory. If the BIOS flash memory is determined
           to be inauthentic during boot, a recovery process is initiated and the inauthentic BIOS is not
           executed.

In addition, some servers may include a secure local update mechanism that updates the system BIOS
without using any of the three authenticated update mechanisms discussed above. A secure local update
mechanism ensures the authenticity and integrity of the BIOS update image by requiring that an
administrator be physically present at the server to conduct the update. The requirement for physical
presence mitigates the risk of remote attacks against the system BIOS.

2.4       Threats to the System BIOS
A server is susceptible to the same forms of attack that threaten a client system. Execution of operating
system-level malware on servers could precede a BIOS attack. Server BIOS updates that are executed
without being authenticated as coming from a trusted source are vulnerable to attacks. Since servers may
have multiple BIOS update mechanisms, each mechanism has a risk of vulnerability. The interaction
between update mechanisms potentially can also introduce vulnerabilities.

The Service Processor in servers has elevated privileges to perform system management, which may
include modifying BIOS. While the Service Processor might be controlled through an isolated
communication channel, unauthorized access to this channel exposes great risk to the server. While many
security practices focus on the data network, the management network might be less vetted and less
protected without special efforts.

If insufficiently protected, BIOS image backups on servers (often maintained for recovery features) are
vulnerable to rewrite attacks even while the primary BIOS is protected from modification. Subsequent to
successful subversion of a BIOS backup, an adversary could employ other means to cause the server to
reboot with the infected backup image.

2.5       Root of Trust for Update

A Root of Trust for Update (RTU) is an inherently trusted combination of hardware and firmware that
performs a secure update of the BIOS and maintains the integrity of the BIOS. The RTU may comprise
functionality for verifying digitally signed BIOS images, engaging and disengaging write-protection
mechanisms, writing BIOS updates to flash, performing BIOS recovery, and updating the RTU itself.
