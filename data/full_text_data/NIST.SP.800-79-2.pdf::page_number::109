Implementation of    CI(DC)-2    Derived PIV Authentication certificates are issued under DPCI          [SP 800-157], Section 3.1 –
Credentialing                    either: (i) the id-fpki-common-derived-pivAuth-hardware                Certificate Policies
Infrastructures                  (LOA-4) or the id-fpki-common-derived-pivAuth (LOA-3)
                                 policy of the X.509 Certificate Policy for the U.S.
                                 Federal PKI Common Policy Framework.

                                 Assessment
                                 Determine that:
                                   (i) the PKI is listed on the Federal PKI Policy
                                       Authority’s website as being a provider of
                                       Derived PIV Credential certificates (review).


                     CI(DC)-11   For Derived PIV Authentication certificates issued       DPCI - LOA    [SP 800-157], Section 3.2 –
                     (NEW)       under id-fpki-common-derived-pivAuth-hardware, the       4 Only        Cryptographic
                                 Derived PIV Authentication key pair is generated within                Specifications
                                 a hardware cryptographic module that has been
                                 validated to [FIPS140-2] Level 2 or higher that provides
                                 Level 3 physical security to protect the Derived PIV
                                 Authentication private key while in storage and that
                                 does not permit exportation of the private key.

                                 Assessment
                                 Determine that:
                                   (i) the organization ensures that Derived PIV
                                       Authentication certificates issued under id-fpki-

                                       policy are generated on cryptographic modules
                                       validated against [FIPS140-2] at Level 2 or
                                       higher with Level 3 physical security (review).

                     (NEW)       under id-fpki-common-derived-pivAuth, the Derived PIV 3 Only           Cryptographic
                                 Authentication key pair is generated within a                          Specifications
                                 cryptographic module that has been validated to
                                 [FIPS140-2] Level 1 or higher.

                                 Assessment
                                 Determine that:
                                   (i) the organization ensures that Derived PIV
