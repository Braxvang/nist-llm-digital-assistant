SP 800-152                                                  A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


                PL-1       A Federal CKMS shall make its FCKMS Security Policy
PR:4.5
                           available to all its FCKMS service-using organizations and
                           their authorized users.
                AT-2       Federal CKMS users and managers shall receive training
PR:4.6
                           about the security policies relevant to the FCKMS and the use
                           of the FCKMS in accordance with those policies.

                           The FCKMS Security Policy should specify the following:
PA:4.1
                            a) The names of the organization(s) adopting the policy;
                            b) Who (person, title or role) is authorized to
                               approve/modify the policy,
                            c) The impact-levels of the information that is specified in
                               and controlled by the policy,
                            d) The primary data and key/metadata protection services
                               (i.e., data confidentiality, data integrity, source
                               authentication) that are to be provided by the FCKMS,
                            e) The security services (e.g., personal accountability,
                               personal privacy, availability, anonymity, unlinkability,
                               unobservability) that can be supported by the FCKMS,
                            f) Sensitivity and handling restrictions for keys and
                               associated metadata,
                            g) The algorithms and all associated parameters to be used
                               for each impact-level and with each protection service,
                            h) The expected maximum lifetime of keys and metadata
                               for each cryptographic algorithm used,
                            i) The acceptable methods of user/role and source
                               authentication for each information impact-level to be
                               protected by a key and its associated metadata,
                            j) The backup, archiving and recovery requirements for
                               keys and metadata at each information impact-level,
                            k) The roles to be supported by the FCKMS,
                            l) The access control and physical security requirements
                               for the FCKMSâ€™s keys and metadata for each impact-
                               level,
                            m) The means and rules for recovering keys and metadata,
                               and
                            n) The communication protocols to be used when
                               protecting sensitive data, keys, and metadata.

A security policy should be written so that the people responsible for managing and using the
policy can understand the goals of the policy and can follow its implementation rules. A
security policy could be encoded in an electronic form (e.g., a policy specification formal
language, table of security rules, or computer program) such that an FCKMS could
                                             22
