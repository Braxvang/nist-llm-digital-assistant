IMPERATIVE 2
Enhancing Risk Management

Increasingly, NIST’s work is driven by a recognition that risk management should
be a fundamental driver for every organization’s decisions about investments in
cybersecurity—whether those investments take shape as people, processes, or
technology. NIST considers managing risk to be an essential principle and process
for organizations of any size or type to employ in planning and carrying out their
cybersecurity programs and in making decisions about priorities.
During FY18, NIST made significant strides in producing cybersecurity risk management
approaches and tools and assisting organizations in their use. Most notably, these
achievements included:
  •   Release of the first update of the Framework for Improving Critical
      Infrastructure Cybersecurity, popularly known as simply the “Cybersecurity
      Framework.” First produced in February 2014 with the active involvement of
      hundreds of organizations in the private and public sectors, Version 1.1 was
      released in April 2018. Based on the experience of Framework users and changes
      in the cybersecurity environment and technological advances, the revision
      added more content related to supply chain risk management and coordinated
      vulnerability disclosure. NIST added and clarified language regarding cybersecurity
      measurement with an emphasis on self-assessment. The number of downloads of
      Version 1.1 has far surpassed that of the initial version.
      Recognizing and seeking to further stimulate international usage of the
      Cybersecurity Framework, NIST worked on a Spanish language translation, which
      is now available along with translations or adaptations provided by government
      agencies and industry leaders in Italian, Japanese, Hebrew, Arabic, and
      Portuguese. NIST also engaged more purposefully to promote the alignment and
      use of the Framework, especially in Latin America and Europe. In the international
      standards arena, NIST vigorously assisted in efforts to include the Framework into
      a key International Organization for Standardization (ISO) cybersecurity standard,
      a process that is still under way.
      In addition, NIST included many more resources to aid in using the Cybersecurity
      Framework, many of which were generated by private sector, non-profit, and
      government organizations. NIST also launched a series of “Success Stories”
      highlighting the variety of ways in which organizations of all types and in all
      sectors are finding value in the Framework. Also in FY18, NIST recognized that
      new information products and tools are regularly being produced well beyond
      the initial Informative References included in Version 1.0 and pushed forward with
      an initiative that establishes a transparent, equitable process for organizations to
      propose new references, which are intended to be included as online Informative
      References associated with the Framework.
