2.3.8. Industrial Internet of Things
The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) consists of sensors, instruments, machines, and other
devices that are networked together and use internet connectivity to enhance industrial and
manufacturing business processes and applications [Berge]. As IT and OT systems continue to
converge and become even more interconnected, the control of physical processes remains a
relatively unique and critical concept of OT.
The Industry IoT Consortium proposes a three-tier system architecture model for representing
IIoT systems [IIRA19]: the edge tier, platform tier, and enterprise tier. Each tier plays a specific
role in processing the data flows and control flows involved in usage activities. The tiers are
connected by three networks: the proximity network, access network, and service network. An
example architecture is shown in Fig. 12.
The enterprise tier implements domain-specific applications and decision support systems,
provides interfaces to end users, receives data flows from the other tiers, and issues control
commands to the other tiers.
The platform tier receives, processes, and forwards control commands from the enterprise tier to
the edge tier. It consolidates processes and analyzes data flows from the other tiers, provides
management functions for devices and assets, and offers non-domain-specific services, such as
data query and analytics. Based on the specific implementation, these functions can be
implemented on the IIoT platform that is deployed in an on-site data center, an off-site data
center, or in the cloud.
The service network enables connectivity between the services in the platform tier, the enterprise
tier, and the services within each tier. This connectivity may be an overlay private network over
