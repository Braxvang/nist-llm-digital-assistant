         the tool would handle. Since the federal government has numerous IT-related
         efforts under way, including critical infrastructure protection (CIP) and COOP
         processes that seek to preserve national resources as well as the ability of
         departments and agencies to operate in adverse or emergency conditions, a
         security-enabled FEA will provide support to those other efforts while
         simultaneously ensuring that information is appropriately protected within
         these efforts.

2.2.5 Information Security Policy and Guidance
       Information security policy is an aggregate of directives, rules, and practices that
       prescribes how an organization manages, protects, and distributes information. 12
    Information security policy is an essential component of information security
governance—without the policy, governance has no substance and rules to enforce.
Information security policy should be based on a combination of appropriate
legislation, such as FISMA; applicable standards, such as NIST Federal Information
Processing Standards (FIPS) and guidance; and internal agency requirements.
    Agency information security policy should address the fundamentals of agency
information security governance structure, including:
       • Information security roles and responsibilities;
       • Statement of security controls baseline and rules for exceeding the baseline;
         and
       • Rules of behavior that agency users are expected to follow and minimum
         repercussions for noncompliance.
    Supporting guidance and procedures on how to effectively implement specific
controls across the enterprise should be developed to augment an agency’s security
policy. This subsequent guidance on information security, created by the agency, in
consideration of external guidance (e.g. NIST Special Publications and OMB
memoranda), should be consistent with the information security policy and may not
supersede it, unless the policy itself is being modified. Agencies should ensure that
their information security policy is sufficiently current to accommodate the
information security environment and agency mission and operational requirements.
To ensure that information security does not become obsolete, agencies should
implement a policy review and revision cycle. As a part of the periodic review and
the initial development of the information security policies, agencies should work to
ensure that all internal security policies (i.e., physical and personnel) are sufficiently
coordinated to ensure effective implementation of crosscutting and convergent
security objectives, such as access control initiatives.

2.2.6 Ongoing Monitoring
   An effective information security governance program requires constant review.
Agencies should monitor the status of their programs to ensure that:
       • Ongoing information security activities are providing appropriate support to the
         agency mission;
       • Policies and procedures are current and aligned with evolving technologies, if
         appropriate; and
       • Controls are accomplishing their intended purpose.
