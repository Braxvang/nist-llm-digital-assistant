yield minutiae outside the maximum possible spatial extent that can be encoded here (8 bit integers at 100 pixels cm-1
on card). The pruning mechanism of Sections 5.6.2.1 and 5.6.2.2 shall be used to remove such minutiae.

5.6.2.3       Sort order of minutiae
The BIT associated with the on-card comparison algorithm shall indicate how minutiae must be sorted according to
the options extended in [CARD-MIN, Clause 9.4]. However, because single finger PIV images have widths of fewer
than 500 pixels when scanned at 19.7 pixels mm-1, all possible minutiae coordinates shall be encoded in 8 bits, and the
modulo sorting technique defined in [CARD-MIN] shall not be used.

5.7       Performance specifications for PIV compliance
5.7.1         Scope
Minutia template generators and minutia matching algorithms used for on-card comparison shall perform according
to the interoperability specifications of Section 5.7.3, and the accuracy specifications of Section 5.7.4. The accuracy
specifications are intended to afford low operational error rates by assuring highly accurate matching in typical
authentication scenarios.

5.7.2         Background
NIST conducted tests of on-card comparison performance [MINEX-II]. Over four phases conducted between 2007 and
2010, the tests showed that four implementations would have attained the cross-provider interoperability
specifications of Section 4.5.2.
In parallel, NIST's Secure Biometrics Match-on-Card program demonstrated cryptographic protection of the template
data, and transactional durations below two seconds [SBMOC].

5.7.3         Minimum interoperability specification
The core cross-vendor interoperability specification is met by establishing requirements on paired template
generators and on-card matchers as described in the following two Sub-sections.

5.7.3.1       Conformance of template generators used to prepare on-card comparison templates
Template generators shall conform to the specification of Section 4.5.2.1 for off-card authentication (because on-card
comparison templates are generated off-card). No additional conformance specifications are defined here.

5.7.3.2       Conformance of on-card template matchers
A template matcher shall be certified if
1.      it conforms to the off-card template matcher interoperability specifications of Section 4.5.2.2 but operating with
        Section 5.5.2 [CARD-MIN] format templates, and
2.      it executes 90% of on-card genuine template pair comparisons (using the VERIFY command [CARD-CMD], for
        example) in fewer than 0.50 seconds, and
3.      when implemented on a functional but modified PIV Card, and in a software library, it produces identical output
                         14
        similarity scores , and
4.      it produces at least 512 unique integer scores when comparing many templates of different persons.

5.7.3.3       Test method
The performance specifications shall be tested according to the test defined by Annex A modified to use [CARD-MIN]
templates. This test shall conform to the requirements of the ISO/IEC 19795-7 testing standard.

14
  This requirement implies non-operational requirements, namely that a prototype card shall be submitted for testing and this
 must allow multiple template comparisons without locking and must report similarity scores to a dedicated test laboratory
 application.
