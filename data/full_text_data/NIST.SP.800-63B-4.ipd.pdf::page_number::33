      NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                             Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                      Authentication and Lifecycle Management


843         an authenticator that receives a push notification from the verifier and
844         simply asks the claimant to approve the transaction (even if providing
845         some additional information about the authentication) does not meet the
846         requirements of this section.

847   5.1.3.1. Out-of-Band Authenticators
848   The out-of-band authenticator SHALL establish a separate channel with the verifier
849   in order to retrieve the out-of-band secret or authentication request. This channel is
850   considered to be out-of-band with respect to the primary communication channel (even if
851   it terminates on the same device) provided the device does not leak information from one
852   channel to the other without the authorization of the claimant.
853   The out-of-band device SHOULD be uniquely addressable by the verifier.
854   Communication over the secondary channel SHALL be encrypted unless sent via the
855   public switched telephone network (PSTN). For additional authenticator requirements
856   specific to use of the PSTN for out-of-band authentication, see Sec. 5.1.3.3. Channels or
857   addresses that do not prove possession of a specific device, such as voice-over-IP (VOIP)
858   telephone numbers, SHALL NOT be used for out-of-band authentication.
859   Email SHALL NOT be used for out-of-band authentication because it also does not prove
860   possession of a specific device and is typically accessed using only a memorized secret.
861   The out-of-band authenticator SHALL uniquely authenticate itself in one of the following
862   ways when communicating with the verifier:
863       • Establish an authenticated protected channel to the verifier using approved
864         cryptography. The key used SHALL be stored in suitably secure storage available
865         to the authenticator application (e.g., keychain storage, TPM, TEE, secure element).
866       • Authenticate to a public mobile telephone network using a SIM card or equivalent
867         that uniquely identifies the device. This method SHALL only be used if a secret is
868         being sent from the verifier to the out-of-band device via the PSTN (SMS or voice).
869   If a secret is sent by the verifier to the out-of-band device, the device SHOULD NOT
870   display the authentication secret while it is locked by the owner (i.e., SHOULD require
871   the presentation and verification of a PIN, passcode, or biometric characteristic to view).
872   However, authenticators SHOULD indicate the receipt of an authentication secret on a
873   locked device.
874   If the out-of-band authenticator requests approval over the secondary communication
875   channel — rather than by the presenting a secret that the claimant transfers to the primary
876   communication channel — it SHALL accept transfer of the secret from the primary
877   channel and send it to the verifier over the secondary channel to associate the approval
878   with the authentication transaction. The claimant MAY perform the transfer manually or
879   use a technology such as a barcode or QR code to effect the transfer.
