Appendix D. Elliptic Curve Routines

D.1.   Public Key Validation

D.1.1. Non-binary Curves in Short-Weierstrass Form

D.1.1.1.          Partial Public Key Validation
Inputs:
   1. Weierstrass curve Wa,b defined over the prime field GF(p)
   2. Point Q

Output: ACCEPT or REJECT Q as an affine point on Wa,b.
Process:
   1. If Q is the point at infinity ∅, output REJECT.
   2. Let Q = (x, y). Verify that x and y are integers in the interval [0, p−1]. Output REJECT if
      verification fails.
   3. Verify that (x, y) is a point on Wa,b by checking that (x, y) satisfies the defining equation
      y2 = x3 + a x + b, where computations are carried out in GF(p). Output REJECT if
      verification fails.
   4. Otherwise, output ACCEPT.

D.1.1.2.          Full Public Key Validation
Inputs:
   1. Weierstrass curve Wa,b defined over the prime field GF(p)
   2. Point Q

Output: ACCEPT or REJECT Q as a point on Wa,b of order n.

Process:

   1. Perform partial public key validation on Q using the procedure of Appendix D.1.1.1.
      Output REJECT if this procedure outputs REJECT.
   2. Verify that n Q = ∅. Output REJECT if verification fails.
   3. Otherwise, output ACCEPT.

D.1.2. Montgomery Curves

D.1.2.1.          Partial Public Key Validation
Inputs:
   1. Montgomery curve MA,B defined over the prime field GF(p)
