Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1                Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems

implementers of security controls supplementing the minimum assurance requirements for the
moderate and high baselines in order to protect against threats from highly skilled, highly
motivated, and well-financed threat agents. This level of protection is necessary for those
information systems where the organization is not willing to accept the risks associated with the
type of threat agents cited above.

2.6 REVISIONS AND EXTENSIONS
The set of security controls listed in the control catalog represents the current state-of-the-practice
safeguards and countermeasures for information systems. The security controls will be reviewed
and revised periodically to reflect: (i) the experience gained from using the controls; (ii) the
changing security requirements within organizations; (iii) emerging threats and attack methods;
and (iv) the availability of new security technologies. 30 The controls in the control catalog are
expected to change over time, as controls are eliminated or revised and new controls are added.
The minimum security controls defined in the low, moderate, and high baselines are also
expected to change over time as the level of security and due diligence for mitigating risks within
organizations increases. In addition to the need for change, the need for stability will be
addressed by requiring that proposed additions, deletions, or modifications to the catalog of
security controls go through a rigorous public review process to obtain government and private
sector feedback and to build consensus for the changes. A stable, yet flexible and technically
rigorous set of security controls will be maintained in the control catalog.

   Currently, NIST plans to review and revise the security control catalog and security control baselines in Special
Publication 800-53 on a biennial basis. The proposed modifications to security controls and security control baselines
will be carefully weighed with each revision cycle, considering the desire for stability on one hand, and the need to
respond to changing threats and vulnerabilities, new attack methods, new technologies, and the important objective of
raising the foundational level of security over time.
