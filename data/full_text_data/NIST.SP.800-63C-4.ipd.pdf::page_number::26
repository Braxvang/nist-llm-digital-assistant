638   Trust agreements are able to be established either statically or dynamically. In a static
639   establishment, there is often a legal or contractual agreement binding the parties to a set
640   of expected behaviors, rights, and requirements. The parameters of static trust agreements
641    SHALL be available to all parties in the agreement, including the operator of the IdP, the
642   operator of the RP, and affected subscribers.
643   In dynamic trust establishment, in contrast, the trust agreement is implicitly defined when
644   the RP and IdP first contact each other for the purposes of a subscriber’s login. The
645   expression of the parameters of a dynamic trust agreement is driven by the federation
646   protocol in place, and are not usually tied to a contractual agreement between the
647   federating parties. The parameters of a dynamic trust agreement SHALL be disclosed
648   to the subscriber by the RP and the IdP during the federation transaction.
649   The authorized party in a trust agreement is the organization, person, or entity that is
650   responsible for the specific release decisions covered by the trust agreement, including
651   the release of subscriber attributes. For a static trust agreement, the authorized party
652    MAY be the organization responsible for the IdP. In this case, consent to release
653   attributes is decided for all subscribers and established by an allowlist as described in
654   Sec. 5.3.1, allowing for the disclosure of attribute information without direct decisions
655   and involvement by the subscriber. A static trust agreement MAY stipulate that an
656   individual, such as the subscriber, is to be prompted at runtime for consent to disclose
657   attributes as discussed in Sec. 5.3.3. Since dynamic trust agreements are established
658   by subscriber actions, the authorized party in a dynamic trust agreement is always the
659   subscriber. Disclosure of attributes in dynamic trust agreements SHALL be subject to a
660   runtime decision from the subscriber and SHALL NOT be subject to an allowlist at the
661   IdP.
662   For example, a static trust agreement is established for an organization (the IdP)
663   connecting to an enterprise service (the RP) to be made available to all subscribers
664   at the organization on an allowlist. The authorized party for this trust agreement is
665   the organization. When a subscriber logs in to the enterprise service, they are not
666   prompted with any runtime decisions regarding the service since the static trust agreement
667   establishes this a priori. In a different scenario, another service is made available to all
668   subscribers at the same organization, but the static trust agreement stipulates that the
669   subscriber is the authorized party. When logging in to the service for the first time, each
670   subscriber is prompted for their consent to release their attributes to the RP. In another
671   scenario, a dynamic trust agreement is established implicitly when a subscriber goes to
