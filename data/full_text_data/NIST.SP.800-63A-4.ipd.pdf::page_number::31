      NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                                 Enrollment and Identity Proofing


753           b) Any additional steps the CSP takes to verify the identity of an applicant
754              beyond the mandatory requirements specified herein;
755           c) Any processing of PII for purposes outside the scope of identity proofing and
756              enrollment except to comply with law or legal process;
757           d) The retention schedule for identity records and PII; and,
758           e) Any PII that is processed by a third party service on behalf of the CSP.
759      2. Based on the results of its privacy risk assessment, the CSP SHALL document the
760         measures it takes to maintain the disassociability, predictability, manageability,
761         confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the PII it processes. In determining
762         such measures, the CSP SHALL consult the NIST Privacy Framework
763         [NIST-Privacy] and NIST Special Publication [SP800-53].
764      3. The CSP SHALL re-assess privacy risks and update its privacy risk assessment any
765         time it makes changes to its identity service that affect the processing of PII.
766      4. The CSP SHALL review its privacy risk assessment periodically, as documented
767         in its practice statement, to ensure it accurately reflects the current risks associated
768         with the processing of PII.
769      5. The CSP SHALL make a summary of its privacy risk assessment available to any
770         organizations that use its services. The summary SHALL be in sufficient detail to
771         enable such organizations to do due dilligence.

772   5.1.2.2. Additional Privacy Protective Measures
773      1. Processing of PII SHALL be limited to the minimum necessary to validate the
774         existence of the claimed identity, associate the claimed identity with the applicant,
775         and provide RPs with attributes they may use to make authorization decisions.
776      2. The CSP MAY collect the Social Security Number (SSN) as an attribute when
777         necessary for identity resolution, in accordance with the privacy requirements in
778         Sec. 5.1.2. Additionally, CSPs SHALL implement privacy protective techniques
779         (e.g., transmitting and accepting derived attribute values rather than full attribute
780         values themselves) to limit the proliferation and retention of SSN data. Knowledge
781         of the SSN SHALL NOT be considered identity evidence.
782      3. At the time of collection, the CSP SHALL provide explicit notice to the applicant
783         regarding the purpose for collecting attributes necessary for identity proofing,
784         including whether such attributes are voluntary or mandatory to complete the
785         identity proofing process, the specific attributes and other sensitive data that
786         the CSP intends to store in the applicantâ€™s subsequent subscriber account, the
787         consequences for not providing the attributes, and the details of any records
788         retention requirement if one is in place.
