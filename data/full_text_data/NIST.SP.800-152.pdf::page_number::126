SP 800-152                                               A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


                           A penetration-testing team should include individuals with
PA:11.6
                           experience in computer and communication systems design
                           and testing, software testing, vulnerability analysis, and
                           security threat analysis.
              SA-11 (5)    When penetration testing has been performed on a Federal
PA:11.7
                           CKMS, the system should undergo penetration testing at least
                           every two years or in accordance with a Service Level
                           Agreement.

11.2 Periodic Security Review

FCKMS system controls, physical controls, procedural controls and personnel controls
should be reviewed periodically to ensure that these controls are in place and operational.
Issues identified from the review should be addressed. In addition, periodic functional
and security testing should be performed (see Section 9.6).

FR:11.10 The CKMS design shall specify the periodicity of security reviews.

FR:11.11 The CKMS design shall specify the scope of the security review in terms of
the CKMS devices.

FR:11.12 The CKMS design shall specify the scope of the periodic security review in
terms of the activities undertaken for each CKMS device under review.

FR:11.13 The CKMS design shall specify the functional and security testing to be
performed as part of the periodic security review.

             CA-2          The security of a Federal CKMS shall be reviewed annually
PR:11.9
                           or in accordance with a Service Level Agreement to assure
                           that it is operating with the latest security updates,
                           incorporating all current CKMS implementer-supported
                           software.

             CA-7          A Federal CKMS could perform continuous monitoring of its
PF:11.2
                           security-critical key-management processing and data storage
                           capabilities, modules, and devices.

11.3 Incremental Security Assessment

An incremental security assessment is limited in scope and should be conducted after any
change is made to the FCKMS that is not a major change to the system or the result of a
security compromise (both of which require a full security assessment, as specified in
Section 11.1). The scope of the assessment is limited to the specific change involved and
any effects that the change could have on the FCKMS performance or security.
