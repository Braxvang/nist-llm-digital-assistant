GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



 Block known “blacklisted” networks or subnets as identified by a trusted external security response
  center
 Notify the network or mail server administrator of suspicious activity through an appropriate means
  (e.g., page, email, network trap)
 Provide content filtering
 Provide malware scanning
 Protect against DoS attacks
 Log critical events, including the following details:

     –   Time/date

     –   Interface IP address

     –   Manufacturer-specific event name

     –   Standard attack event identifier (if one exists)

     –   Source and destination IP addresses

     –   Source and destination port numbers

     –   Network protocol.
Most firewall devices available in hardware and software perform some type of logging of the traffic they
receive. For most firewalls, the default logging configuration is suitable, provided logging is enabled.
Administrators should consult their manufacturer documentation if they believe they require additional
information to be logged. Certain brands of hardware-based firewalls include an ability to track and log
information for each rule. This ability enables accountability to a very specific extent.

Many firewalls support the ability to selectively decide what information to log. If a firewall receives a
series of similar packets from the same location, it may decide not to log any additional packets after the
first one. Although this is a valuable feature, consider the consequences: each packet that is dropped and
not logged is potential evidence of malicious intent. The principle of logging, a fundamental aspect of
accountability, is discussed in detail in Section 9.1.

As with operating systems and other security-enforcing elements, a firewall requires updates. Although
more prevalent in software implementations of firewall technology, hardware and router firewalls are
capable of updating their firmware. Specific instructions on how to update a firewall are found within the
manufacturer documentation. Administrators should check for firewall updates frequently.

7.2.2    Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is an application that monitors the events occurring in a system or
network and analyzes them for signs of potential incidents, which are violations or imminent threats of
violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices. 43 An
intrusion prevention system (IPS) has all the capabilities of an IDS and can also attempt to stop potential
