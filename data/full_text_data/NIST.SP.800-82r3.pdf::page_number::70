NIST SP 800-82r3                                                                       Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

Additionally, organizations may need to consider privacy with their risk assessment, which
sometimes require a different approach. The NIST Privacy Risk Assessment Methodology
(PRAM) is a tool that applies the risk model from NIST IR 8062 [IR8062] and helps
organizations analyze, assess, and prioritize privacy risks to determine how to respond and select
appropriate solutions.

4.1.3. Responding to Risk in an OT Environment
The risk response component provides an organization-wide response to risk in accordance with
the risk framing component by identifying possible courses of actions to address risk, evaluating
those possibilities while considering the organization’s risk tolerance and other issues identified
during framing, and choosing the best alternative for the organization. The response component
includes the implementation of the chosen course of action to address the identified risk:
acceptance, avoidance, mitigation, sharing, transfer, or any combination of these options. 8
                    OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
                    For an OT system, available risk responses may be constrained by
                    system requirements, potential adverse impacts on operations, or even
                    regulatory compliance regimes. An example of risk sharing is when
                    utilities enter into agreements to “loan” line workers in an emergency,
                    which reduces the duration of an incident’s effect to acceptable levels.

4.1.4. Monitoring Risk in an OT Environment
Monitoring risk is the fourth component of risk management activities. Organizations monitor
risk on an ongoing basis, including the implementation of chosen risk management strategies,
changes in the environment that may affect the risk calculation, and the effectiveness and
efficiency of risk reduction activities. The activities in the monitoring component impact all of
the other components.
                    OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
                    Many OT system monitoring capabilities leverage passive monitoring
                    techniques to detect system changes. However, this may not always
                    capture all modifications to the system. Modern monitoring platforms
                    that leverage native protocol communications to access more system
                    information may improve awareness, but the limitations of these OT
                    systems must be understood. Often OT systems are implemented with an
                    undefined frequency for monitoring cyber activities. Users should set a
                    frequency in accordance with the respective risk profile.
                    Threat information as it relates to the OT environment is evolving, and
                    the availability and accuracy of this threat information is early in its
                    development. By their nature, threats may be difficult to accurately
                    predict, even with historical data. Organizations should categorize threats
                    based on the likelihood of occurrence and their potential consequences.
