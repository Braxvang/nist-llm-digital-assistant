Special Publication 800-73-4        Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification – Part 1: PIV
                                 Card Application Namespace, Data Model and Representation

The Key History object is only available over the contact interface and VCI. The read access control
rule for the Key History object is “Always,” meaning that it can be read without access control
restrictions.

The Security Object enforces integrity of the Key History object according to the issuer.

3.3.4    Retired X.509 Certificates for Key Management

These objects hold the X.509 Certificates for Key Management corresponding to retired key
management private keys, as described in Section 3.3.3. Retired key management private keys and
their corresponding certificates are only available over the contact interface or VCI. The read access
control rule for these certificates is “Always,” meaning the certificates can be read without access
control restrictions. The PKI cryptographic function (see Table 4b) for all of the retired key
management private keys is protected with a “PIN” or “OCC” access rule. In other words, once the
PIN or OCC data is submitted and verified, subsequent key management key operations can be
performed with any of the retired key management private keys without requiring the PIN or OCC
data again. This enables multiple private key operations without additional cardholder consent.

3.3.5    Cardholder Iris Images

The iris images data object specifies compact images of the cardholder’s irises. The images are
suitable for use in iris recognition systems for automated identity verification. The iris images data
object shall be encoded as specified in [SP800-76].

3.3.6    Biometric Information Templates Group Template

The Biometric Information Templates (BIT) Group Template data object encodes the configuration
information of the OCC data. The encoding of the BIT Group Template shall be as specified in Table
7 of [SP800-76]. When OCC satisfies the PIV ACRs for PIV data objects access and command
execution both the Discovery Object and the BIT Group Template data object shall be present, and bit
5 of the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy shall be set. The BIT Group Template may be present
when OCC does not satisfy the PIV ACRs for PIV data objects access, but, if present, shall contain
no BITs. 9 The Security Object enforces integrity of the BIT Group Template data object according to
the issuer.

3.3.7    Secure Messaging Certificate Signer

The Secure Messaging Certificate Signer data object, which shall be present if the PIV Card supports
secure messaging for non-card-management operations, contains the certificate(s) needed to verify
the signature on the secure messaging card verifiable certificate (CVC), as specified in Part 2, Section
4.1.5.

The public key required to verify the digital signature of the secure messaging CVC is an ECC key. It
shall be provided in either an X.509 Certificate for Content Signing or an Intermediate CVC. If the
public key required to verify the digital signature of the secure messaging CVC is provided in an
Intermediate CVC, then the format of the Intermediate CVC shall be as specified in Part 2, Section
4.1.5, and the public key required to verify the digital signature of the Intermediate CVC shall be
provided in an X.509 Certificate for Content Signing.


9 A BIT Group Template with no BITs is encoded as '7F 61 03 02 01 00'.
