3.     it matches templates from all certified template generators, and the template generator accompanying the
       matcher, with FNMR less than or equal to 0.01 at an FMR of 0.01 (where this is calculated from scores from the
       sum of scores from two finger comparisons e.g., left and right index fingers).

4.5.3         Minimum accuracy specification
                                                       9
The interoperability criterion of Section 4.5.2.2 is designed to support low false rejection when templates can come
from many sources (i.e., conformant [MINUSTD] template generators). This FMR value, however, is too high for
operational application i.e., it is higher than the minimum accuracy requirements of Section 10. To support actual
authentication of PIV Card templates, a template generator and matcher-pair shall be certified if
1.     it meets all the interoperability criteria of sections 4.5.2.1 and 4.5.2.2, and
2.     it matches single-finger native templates with FNMR less than or equal to 0.02 when the FMR is at or below
       0.0001. The word native here means that all templates originate from one template generator and the provider
       of the template generation algorithm is the same as that of the comparison algorithm. Native mode operation
       will occur within an Agency that procures its template generation and matching equipment from the same
       provider.

4.5.4         Test method
The performance specifications of sections 4.5.2.1, 4.5.2.2 and referred to as Level 1 accuracy specifications. The
specifications of Section 4.5.3 are referred to as Level 2 accuracy specifications. Both Level 1 and Level 2 criteria shall
be tested as defined in Annex A.
                                                           10
INFORMATIVE NOTE             NIST's MINEX III program implements these tests [MINEX-III] â€“ see Section A.6.

4.6       Performance specifications for PIV operations
Off-card fingerprint authentication implementations shall be configured according to the specifications of Section 10.

4.7       Fingerprint capture
4.7.1         Scope
This Section gives specifications for fingerprint sensors used for capture of single finger images. These sensors shall
not be used for collection of images for use in the background check i.e., the specifications are unrelated to those of
Section 2.3 which govern ten-print enrollment. This document does not establish specifications on performance of
four-finger segmentation algorithms.

4.7.2         Fingerprint acquisition specifications for flat capture sensors
Fingerprint sensors used for PIV authentication shall conform to the FBI's Image Quality Specifications For Single
Finger Capture Devices [SINGFING]. The [SINGFING] specification establishes minimum sizes for the imaging platen
and for the scanning resolution.

    The accuracy for interoperability criterion is that a matching algorithm recognizes all templates at a false match rate (FMR) less
    than or equal to 0.01, the false non-match rate (FNMR) is at or below 0.01.

     The MINEX III program replaces the original Ongoing MINEX procedure which ran 2007-2013. Implementations that were
    deemed compliant in the older program are automatically compliant to Sections 4.5.2.1 and 4.5.2.2 as tested in MINEX III.
