6.4                                   Iris image specification for iris images retained outside the PIV Card
This document neither requires nor precludes agencies from retaining iris images. [FIPS] recommends use of iris
imagery (and face in limited cases) in cases where fingerprints cannot be captured satisfactorily. In addition, [FIPS]
allows iris whenever fingerprints are used, and indicates that iris image data may be available outside the PIV Card for
authentication during PIV Card issuance, re-issuance, and verification data reset transactions. If agencies elect to
retain images, they shall be stored in the format specified in this clause. This clause establishes a profile of ISO/IEC
19794-6:2011 suited for retention of iris images outside the PIV Card. The format specification includes the [CBEFF]
header of Section 9, and this requires integrity protection and allows for encryption of the image records.
Retention of data supports, for example, detection of duplicate identities.
