The basic DNS does not have many security features [SP 800-81]. A suite of RFCs has
been developed to provide security enhancements contained in three IETF documents,
collectively called the DNS security extensions (DNSSEC) ([RFC 4033], [RFC 4034],
[RFC 4035]). DNSSEC provides a layer of authentication and integrity protection for any
kind of data stored in the DNS, including data used by other protocols. For example,
there are RR types allocated for storing Secure Shell (SSH) keys in the DNS, which then
rely on DNSSEC to protect the integrity of that information.

8.1.1 DNS Data Authentication
Cryptographically generated public key-based digital signatures provide authentication
for DNS data. Commonly, there will be two or more digital signature public-key pairs
(which make up the key set) used to implement DNSSEC in a zone. One key pair is used
to sign the zone data (referred to as the Zone Signing Key or ZSK), and a separate key
pair is used to sign the zone key set (known as the Key Signing Key or KSK). While
some zones may only use one key pair for both ZSK and KSK, it is not recommended for
federal agency zones. This KSK is also known as the Secure Entry Point (SEP) key for
the zone – using it, a client can authenticate the ZSK (by validating the signature over the
ZSK using the KSK public key), and then use the ZSK to authenticate the zone data. The
KSK is also used to link the security chain37 from the zone to its delegating parent. Since
the KSK is used to link security from the zone (e.g. “example.gov”) to the delegating
parent zone (e.g. “.gov”) [RFC 4035], it is often longer lived, and used infrequently (used
only to sign the zone key set). Multiple digital signature algorithms can be supported, so
there may be multiple keys (one for each algorithm), as there is no algorithm negotiation
in DNSSEC, and clients may only understand certain digital signature algorithms. There
is one mandatory-to-implement algorithm as defined by the IETF, so there is at least one
agreed-upon digital-signature algorithm that all servers and clients will understand.

Currently, both RSA using SHA-1 and SHA-256 have been specified and can be used
with DNSSEC zones. Most modern implementations either support both or will do so
after an upgrade. Zones deploying DNSSEC for the first time can start with RSA using
SHA-256. Zones that initially deployed with RSA using SHA-1 should migrate to RSA
(2048-bit RSA key) using SHA-256: see [SP 800-131A] for information about guidelines
for using RSA with different key sizes and hash algorithms. However, both hash
algorithms (i.e., SHA-1 and SHA-256) should be used to generate digital signatures for
DNS data for a period of time to ensure that client systems that cannot validate RSA with
SHA-256 can still authenticate DNS data. The length of this transition period depends on
the widespread availability and deployment of client-system software that understands
RSA with SHA-256.

8.1.2 DNS Transaction Authentication
Additional authentication mechanisms are used for server-server communication and
administrative control. Transaction authentication is performed by computing an HMAC

  The security chain (also referred to as “chain of authentication”) is the collection of digital signatures and
public keys that can be used to trace a logical path from the data to be validated back to a trusted, installed
public key on the client [SP 800-81]. This chain of public keys and signatures is similar to a PKI certificate
chain (see Section 2.1), but entirely contained within the DNS.
