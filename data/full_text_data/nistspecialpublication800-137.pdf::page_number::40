Special Publication 800-137                                Information Security Continuous Monitoring for
                                                           Federal Information Systems and Organizations




by organization-wide tools (often implemented as common controls). The organization-wide tools
may be part of a specific system or systems, but the security-related information generated may
not be system-specific.

Primary Roles: System Owner, Common Control Provider, System Security Officer, Security
Control Assessor

Supporting Roles: Risk Executive (Function), Chief Information Officer, Chief Information
Security Officer, Authorizing Official

Expected Input: Security-related information (security status data); organizational ISCM
policies and procedures; reporting requirements from the Authorizing Official, Chief Information
Officer, Chief Information Security Officer, and/or Risk Executive (Function)

Expected Output: Reports on security status as required by organizational ISCM policies and
procedures and by the Authorizing Official in support of ongoing authorization (or re-
authorization)

3.5     RES POND TO FINDINGS
Security-related information obtained from monitoring is analyzed and met with appropriate
responses. Response to findings at all tiers may include risk mitigation, risk acceptance, risk
avoidance/rejection, or risk sharing/transfer, in accordance with organizational risk tolerance.41

Responses are coordinated with appropriate security management activities such as the security-
focused configuration management program. At Tier 1, response to findings may result in
changes to security policies around organizational governance. Tier 1’s response may be
constrained by the mission/business needs and the limitations of the enterprise architecture
(including the human components), immutable governance policies, or other external drivers. At
Tier 2, response to findings may include requests for additional security-related information, new
or modified metrics, changes in mission/business processes, or Tier 3 reporting requirements,
and/or additions or modifications to common control implementations. The Tier 2 response may
be constrained by organizational governance policies and strategies as well as mission/business
goals and objectives and limitations of organizational resources and infrastructure. At Tier 3,
mitigation strategies have a direct and immediate impact on system-level risk and responses to
findings may include implementation of additional controls, modifications to previously
implemented controls, removal of systems’ authorization to operate, changes to the frequency of
monitoring, and/or additional or more detailed analysis of security-related information. System-
level mitigations are made within constraints set by Tier 1 and 2 policies, requirements, and
strategies, to ensure that organizational processes are not negatively affected.

Response strategies may be implemented over a period of time, documenting implementation
plans in the system’s Plan of Action and Milestones. As weaknesses are found, response actions
are evaluated and any mitigation actions are conducted immediately or are added to the POA&M.
Other key system documents are updated accordingly. Security controls that are modified,
enhanced, or added as part of the response step of the continuous monitoring process are assessed
