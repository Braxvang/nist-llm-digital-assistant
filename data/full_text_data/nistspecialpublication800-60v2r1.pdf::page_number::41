C.2.3 Planning and Budgeting

Planning and Budgeting involves the activities of determining strategic direction, identifying
and establishing programs and processes to enable change, and allocating resources (capital
and labor) among those programs and processes.
C.2.3.1 Budget Formulation Information Type

Budget Formulation involves all activities undertaken to determine priorities for future spending
and to develop an itemized forecast of future funding and expenditures during a targeted period
of time. This includes the collection and use of performance information to assess the
effectiveness of programs and develop budget priorities. Subject to exception conditions
described below, the recommended security categorization for the budget formulation
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of budget formulation
information on the ability of responsible agencies to determine priorities for future spending and
to develop an itemized forecast of future funding and expenditures during a targeted period of
time. Most budget information is supposed to be available to the public.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Some budget information of is
classified national security information and is outside the scope of this guideline. The effects of
loss of confidentiality of budget information or of early drafts of budgets can result in attempts
by competing interests to influence and/or impede the regulation development process. The
consequences to agency programs and even of the ability of an agency to perform its mission can
be very serious. Premature public release of draft budgets before internal coordination and
review has been conducted can result in unnecessary criticism of the proposed regulation and
even damage public confidence in the agency. These consequences are particularly likely where
the release includes unedited internal commentary and discussion. Delays that result from
confidentiality compromise can imperil specific agency programs, but loss of public confidence
can do persistent harm to an agencyâ€™s ability to effectively perform its mission. In such cases,
the confidentiality impact level for budget formulation information is moderate. If the budget
formulation information is moved to the public domain, the confidentiality impact level becomes
Not Applicable (NA).

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: In spite of the serious harm that can be suffered by an
agency due to unauthorized and premature disclosure of draft budget information (and associated
commentary), the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for budget formulation
information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Some budget formulation information is
time-critical. Also, unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external
