SP 800-130                                                             August 2013



           v.    The renewal date: The date-time that a public key was renewed and
                 allowed to be used for a longer period of time, e.g., by generating a new
                 certificate for the same public key as was provided in an old certificate
                 (see Section 6.4.7),
           vi. The future renewal data: The date-time that a public key is to be renewed
                 and allowed to be used for a longer period of time (e.g., by generating a
                 new certificate for the same public key as was provided in an old
                 certificate),
           vii. The date of the last rekey: The date-time that a key was replaced with a
                 new key that was generated so that it is completely independent of the
                 key that was replaced,
           viii. The future rekey date: The date-time that the key is to be replaced with a
                 new key that will be generated so that it is completely independent of
                 the key being replaced,
           ix. The date of the last usage of the key: The date-time that the key was last
                 used.
           x. The deactivation date: The date-time that a key was deactivated,
           xi. The future deactivation date: The date-time that a key is to be
                 deactivated,
           xii. The expiration date: The date-time that a keyâ€™s useful lifetime was
                 terminated permanently,
           xiii. The revocation date: The date-time after which a key was no longer
                 considered valid,
           xiv. The compromise date: The date-time that a key was known or suspected
                 to have been compromised and was marked for replacement and not
                 renewal,
           xv. The destruction date: The date-time that a key was destroyed, and
           xvi. The future destruction date: The date-time that a key is to be destroyed.

   w) Revocation Reason: If a key is revoked, this element specifies the reason for the
      revocation. Examples include a compromise due to an adversary having the key, a
      compromise due to an adversary having the cryptographic module containing the
      key, a loss of the key, a loss of the cryptographic module containing the key, a
      suspected key compromise, the key owner left the sponsoring organization, and a
      key misuse by the owner.

The dates and times used in the above listed metadata elements, as well as various CKMS
transaction dates and times, may be required to be both accurate and from an
authoritative source, such as a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server. In addition, some of
the transactions may require time stamps from a trusted third-party. Trusted third-party
time stamping is described in [RFC 3161] and [SP 800-102].

FR:6.2 For each key type used in the system, the CKMS design shall specify all
metadata elements selected for a trusted association, the circumstances under which the
