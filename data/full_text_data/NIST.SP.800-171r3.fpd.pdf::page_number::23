      NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                       Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
      November 2023

243           with different individuals or roles (e.g., quality assurance, configuration management, system
244           management, assessments, programming, and network security), and ensuring that personnel who
245           administer access control functions do not also administer audit functions. Because separation of
246           duty violations can span systems and application domains, organizations consider the entirety of
247           their systems and system components when developing policies on separation of duties. This
248           requirement is enforced by 03.01.02.

252   3.1.5. Least Privilege
253           REQUIREMENT: 03.01.05
254           a. Allow only authorized system access for users (or processes acting on behalf of users) that is
255              necessary to accomplish assigned organizational tasks.
256           b. Authorize access to [Assignment: organization-defined security functions and security-
257              relevant information].
258           c.   Review the privileges assigned to roles or classes of users periodically to validate the need
259                for such privileges.
260           d. Reassign or remove privileges, as necessary.

261           DISCUSSION
262           Organizations employ the principle of least privilege for specific duties and authorized access for
263           users and system processes. Least privilege is applied to the development, implementation, and
264           operation of the system. Organizations consider creating additional processes, roles, and system
265           accounts to achieve least privilege. Security functions include establishing system accounts and
266           assigning privileges, installing software, configuring access authorizations, configuring settings
267           for events to be audited, establishing vulnerability scanning parameters, and establishing intrusion
268           detection parameters. Security-relevant information includes threat and vulnerability information,
269           filtering rules for routers or firewalls, configuration parameters for security services, security
270           architecture, cryptographic key management information, and access control lists.

274   3.1.6. Least Privilege â€“ Privileged Accounts
275           REQUIREMENT: 03.01.06
276           a. Restrict privileged accounts on the system to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
277              roles].
278           b. Require that users (or roles) with privileged accounts use non-privileged accounts when
279              accessing nonsecurity functions or nonsecurity information.
