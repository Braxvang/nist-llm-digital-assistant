   2. an analysis of the authenticity of newly published vulnerabilities, and
   3. a unique name to be used for each vulnerability.
General CVE information is available at http://cve.mitre.org. The vulnerabilities listed in CVE
can be viewed using the NIST ICAT vulnerability index at http://icat.nist.gov.

Guidelines

1. Federal departments and agencies should give substantial consideration to the
acquisition and use of security-related IT products and services that are compatible with
the CVE vulnerability naming scheme.

Most federal departments and agencies use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) security products
and services to track, detect, or counter known vulnerabilities. A problem with many of these
products is that different products use different names for the same vulnerabilities. Without a
consistent vulnerability terminology, it is difficult to compare the vulnerability coverage of such
security products. Also, it may be complex to correlate alerts among different vendors’ or
services’ databases and tools.

CVE-compatible products and services, however, use the same name for each vulnerability, thus
addressing many of these coverage and correlation concerns. Therefore, it is important to
consider acquiring CVE-compatible security products and services. Agencies should be careful,
however, to consider CVE compatibility only for products and services that inherently make use
of vulnerability names. Such products and services include vulnerability scanners, vulnerability
databases, vulnerability advisory services, vulnerability patch services, most intrusion detection
systems, and some firewalls.

Your organization’s use of CVE-compatible products can assist you by

1) determining which product covers the vulnerabilities most applicable to an agency’s network
   infrastructure; and

2) increasing the assurance that the alerts produced by the product(s) you choose will be able to
   be correlated with alerts from your other products and from your incident response center.

The requirements for CVE compatibility are described at
http://cve.mitre.org/compatible/requirements.html. Currently identified compatible products and
services are listed on the Compatible Products pages, http://cve.mitre.org/compatible. While
CVE compatibility should be an important consideration in IT security product and service
acquisition, federal departments and agencies should foremost consider their overall
requirements (functionality, cost, performance, architecture, etc.) when acquiring products and
services.

2. Federal departments and agencies should periodically monitor their systems for
applicable vulnerabilities listed in the CVE vulnerability naming scheme.
