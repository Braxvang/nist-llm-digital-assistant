devices. By not transmitting data, a passive scanning tool remains undetected by malicious users and
other devices. This reduces the likelihood of individuals avoiding detection by disconnecting or disabling
unauthorized WLAN devices.

There are also active WLAN scanning tools. Building on the information collected during passive scans,
active scanning attempts to attach to discovered WLAN devices and conduct penetration or vulnerability-
related testing. Organizations should be cautious in conducting active scans to make sure they do not
inadvertently scan devices owned or operated by other organizations or individuals within range. It is
important to evaluate the physical location of devices before actively scanning them. Generally,
organizations should focus on identifying and locating potential rogue devices rather than performing
active scans of such devices.

The types of tools mentioned in this section are examples of tools that are often effective at WLAN
security monitoring. This is not intended to imply that no other types of tools may also be useful at
WLAN security monitoring. What is important is having the necessary monitoring capabilities, not the
labels applied to the tool or tools providing those capabilities.

3.3       Continuous Monitoring Recommendations

Organizations with WLANs should implement continuous monitoring solutions for their WLANs that
provide all of the following detection capabilities:

          Unauthorized WLAN devices, including rogue APs and unauthorized client devices

          WLAN devices that are misconfigured or using weak WLAN protocols and protocol
           implementations

          Unusual WLAN usage patterns, such as extremely high numbers of client devices using a
           particular AP, abnormally high volumes of WLAN traffic involving a particular client device, or
           many failed attempts to join the WLAN in a short period of time

          The use of active WLAN scanners (e.g., war driving tools) that generate WLAN traffic. The use
           of passive sensors cannot be detected through monitoring controls.

          DoS attacks and conditions (e.g., network interference). Many denial of service attacks are
           detected by counting events during periods of time and alerting when threshold values are
           exceeded. For example, a large number of events involving the termination of WLAN sessions
           can indicate a DoS attack.

          Impersonation and man-in-the-middle attacks. For example, some WIDPS sensors can detect
           when a device is attempting to spoof the identity of another device.

Organizations with WLANs should also have the capability to identify the physical location of a detected
WLAN threat by using triangulation—estimating the threat’s approximate distance from multiple sensors
by the strength of the threat’s signal received by each sensor, then calculating the physical location at
which the threat would be the estimated distance from each sensor. This allows an organization to send
appropriate personnel, such as physical security staff, to the location to address the threat.
