Requirements analysis across stakeholder and system requirements determines the threshold
degree of rigor that is required. When a system cannot practicably meet the needed degrees of
rigor, stakeholders should have a means to determine if they will accept the associated risk.

The highest levels of rigor across systems can require formal methods – techniques that model
systems as mathematical entities to enable rigorous verification of the system’s properties
through mathematical proofs. Formal methods depend on formal specifications (i.e., statements
in a language whose vocabulary, syntax, and semantics are formally defined) and a variety of
models, including a formal security policy model (i.e., a mathematically rigorous specification of
a system’s security policy [Appendix C]).
Due to associated costs and complexity, formal methods are typically limited to engineering
efforts where only the highest levels of assurance are needed, such as the formal modeling,
specification, and verification of security policy and the implementation that enforces the policy
(Section D.4.2). In this case, the security policy model is verified as complete for its scope of
control and as self-consistent. The verified security policy model then serves as a foundation to
verify the models of the design and implementation of the mechanisms that provide for decision-
making and the enforcement of those decisions.
