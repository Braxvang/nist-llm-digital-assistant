ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



       Section 3 gives an overview of IEEE 802.11 security, including a review of the security features
        and weaknesses of IEEE 802.11 before the introduction of the IEEE 802.11i amendment. It also
        introduces the major security-related components that are defined in IEEE 802.11i.
       Section 4 introduces the concepts of Robust Security Networks (RSN) and Robust Security
        Network Associations (RSNA). It also discusses the RSN data confidentiality and integrity
        protocols, and the cryptographic keys created and used by these protocols.
       Section 5 describes the five phases that occur during RSN communication, starting with the
        discovery of a WLAN and ending in connection termination. It also discusses the types of frames
        used to carry information between RSN components, and depicts the flows of frames between
        components during each phase of RSN operation.
       Section 6 provides guidance on planning an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
        implementation, which is necessary for most enterprise RSN deployments. It discusses the most
        common EAP methods, explains how organizations can select EAP methods appropriate to their
        environments, examines additional EAP security considerations, and introduces the EAP
        architectural model and related support requirements.
       Section 7 describes FIPS 140-2 certification as it applies to 802.11 wireless networks. It also
        provides an overview of the security specifications developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance, which
        conducts a certification program for the interoperability of WLAN products. The certifications
        are intended to help organizations select WLAN products that can support RSNs.
       Section 8 presents best practice recommendations related to WLAN security.
       Section 9 presents three case studies that illustrate how organizations might plan, design, and
        implement RSNs in different scenarios, such as migrating a WLAN from pre-RSN to RSN
        technology, and designing a new WLAN that meets RSN requirements.
       Section 10 summarizes the major concepts and recommendations presented in Sections 2 through
        8 of the document.
       Section 11 provides a brief overview of possible extensions to IEEE 802.11i that are currently
        being developed.
The document also contains appendices with supporting material. Appendix A contains an acronym list.
Appendix B lists the document’s references and other sources of information that may be of interest to
readers. Appendix C identifies online resources that may be helpful for better understanding IEEE
802.11i and IEEE 802.11i security.

1.5     How to Navigate This Document

This document is intended to be used by readers with various levels of experience and technical
knowledge, as well as different interests in IEEE 802.11i. For example, computer security program
managers might want to learn the basic IEEE 802.11i concepts and terminology, while network and
security engineers might want to know as many details about the technical configuration of IEEE 802.11i
technologies as possible. The lists below provide general recommendations as to which sections and sub-
sections of the guide should be read, based on the reader’s objectives. Readers who are unsure about the
relevance or appropriateness of a particular section should read its introduction and summary to gain a
better understanding of what the section contains.
