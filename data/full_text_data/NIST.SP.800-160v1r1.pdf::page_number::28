     System Security Concepts
This chapter describes the aspects necessary for a systems engineering perspective on security. A
systems engineering perspective on security requires an understanding of the concept of security
(Section 3.1), the concept of an adequately secure system (Section 3.2), and the characteristics of
systems (Section 3.3). It also requires an understanding of the concept of assets (Section 3.4), the
concepts of loss and loss control (Section 3.5), how to reason about asset loss (Section 3.6), and
how to determine protection needs (Section 3.7). In satisfying such needs, specific viewpoints
(Section 3.8) and how security is demonstrated are considered, including what is adequate
(Section 3.9). The systems engineering subdiscipline that encompasses these considerations is
referred to as systems security engineering (Section 3.10).

           The Concept of Security
A system with freedom from those conditions that can cause a loss of assets with unacceptable
consequences must provide the intended behaviors and outcomes and also avoid any unintended
behaviors and outcomes that constitute a loss. The term intended is reflected in two cases, both
of which must be satisfied:
•    User intent: The system behaviors and outcomes expected by the user
•    Design intent: The system behaviors and outcomes to be achieved by the design

A system that delivers a capability per the design intent but inconsistent with the user intent
constitutes a loss. For example, vehicle control loss might result from a failure in the vehicle’s
steering control function (i.e., failure to meet the design intent) or through an attack that takes
control away from the driver (i.e., failure to meet the user intent).

The primary security objective is to ensure that only the intended behaviors and outcomes occur,
both with the system and within the system. 17 Every security need and concern derive from this
objective, which is based on the concept of authorization for what is and is not allowed. 18 As
such, the primary security control objective is enforcing constraints in the form of rules for
allowed and disallowed behaviors and outcomes. This control objective – and a foundational
principle of trustworthy secure design – is Mediated Access. If access is not mediated (i.e.,
controlled though enforcing constraints) following a set of non-conflicting rules, then no basis
exists upon which to claim that security is achieved.

The rules for mediated access are stated in a set of security policies 19 that reflect or are derived
from laws, directives, regulations, life cycle concepts, 20 requirements, or other specifically stated
stakeholder objectives. A security policy includes a scope of control that establishes bounds
within which the policy applies. Security policy rules are stated in terms of subjects (active
entities), objects (passive entities), and the operations that the subject can perform or invoke on

   Intended behaviors include interactions. Relevant interactions include human-to-machine and machine-to-machine interactions. Human-to-
machine interactions are transformed into machine-to-machine interactions, whereby a machine element operates on behalf of the human.
18
   An attacker seeks to produce unauthorized behaviors or outcomes. Attackers attempt to accomplish something that they are not authorized to
accomplish, even if that behavior or outcome is authorized for some other entity.
19
   A security policy is a set of rules that govern security-relevant system and system element behavior (Appendix C).

   Life cycle concepts include operation, sustainment, evolution, maintenance, training, startup, and shutdown.
