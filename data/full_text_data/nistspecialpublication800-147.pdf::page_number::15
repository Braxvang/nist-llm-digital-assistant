                                                                                  BIOS PROTECTION GUIDELINES



    •   One of the most difficult threats to prevent is a user-initiated installation of a malicious system
        BIOS. User-initiated BIOS update utilities are often the primary method for updating the system
        BIOS. The guidelines included in this document will not prevent users from installing
        unapproved BIOS images if they have physical access to the computer system. As with supply
        chain threats, security processes may be able to detect and remediate the unapproved system
        BIOS, such as initiating a recovery process to restore to an approved BIOS.

    •   Malware could leverage weak BIOS security controls or exploit vulnerabilities in the system
        BIOS itself to reflash or modify the system BIOS. General-purpose malicious software is
        unlikely to include this functionality, but a targeted attack on an organization could be directed
        towards an organization’s standard system BIOS. The malicious BIOS can be delivered to the
        system either over a network, or using media. The guidelines presented in this document are
        designed to prevent these kinds of attack.

    •   Network-based system management tools could also be used to launch an organization-wide
        attack on system BIOSs. For example, consider an organization-maintained update server for the
        organization’s deployed system BIOS; a compromised server could push a malicious system
        BIOS to computer systems across the organization. This is a high-impact attack, but requires
        either an insider or compromise of an organization’s update process. The guidelines presented in
        this document are designed to prevent this kind of attack.

    •   Any of the preceding mechanisms could be used to rollback to an authentic but vulnerable system
        BIOS. This is a particularly insidious attack, since the “bad” BIOS is authentic (i.e., shipped by
        the manufacturer). The security controls specified in the following section are primarily focused
        on verifying the source and integrity of the system BIOS. This document includes recommended
        controls for rollback protection.

The controls described in the following section are primarily focused on preventing unauthorized
modification of the system BIOS by potentially malicious software running on computer systems.
Installation of an unapproved system BIOS in the supply chain, by individuals with physical access, or
through rollback to an authenticated but vulnerable system BIOS, are not addressed by the controls in
Section 3.1, but can be addressed using processes specified in Section 3.2.
