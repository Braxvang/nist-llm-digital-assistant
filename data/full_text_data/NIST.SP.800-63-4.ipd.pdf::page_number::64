       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


1889   Federation Transaction
1890   A specific instance of processing an authentication using a federation process for a
1891   specific subscriber by conveying an assertion from an IdP to an RP.

1892   Front-Channel Communication
1893   Communication between two systems that relies on redirects through an intermediary
1894   such as a browser. This is normally accomplished by appending HTTP query parameters
1895   to URLs hosted by the receiver of the message.

1896   Hash Function
1897   A function that maps a bit string of arbitrary length to a fixed-length bit string. Approved
1898   hash functions satisfy the following properties:
1899     1. One-way - It is computationally infeasible to find any input that maps to any pre-
1900        specified output; and
1901     2. Collision resistant - It is computationally infeasible to find any two distinct inputs
1902        that map to the same output.

1903   Identity
1904   An attribute or set of attributes that uniquely describe a subject within a given context.

1905   Identity API
1906   An attribute API accessed by an RP for accessing attributes of a specific subscriber.
1907   Access to the identity API is generally granted as part of a federation authentication
1908   process and limited to the information for a single, specific subscriber.

1909   Identity Assurance Level (IAL)
1910   A category that conveys the degree of confidence that the applicant’s claimed identity is
1911   their real identity.

1912   Identity Evidence
1913   Information or documentation provided by the applicant to support the claimed identity.
1914   Identity evidence may be physical (e.g. a driver license) or digital (e.g. an assertion
1915   generated and issued by a CSP based on the applicant successfully authenticating to the
1916   CSP).

1917   Identity Proofing
1918   The process by which a CSP collects, validates, and verifies information about a person.

1919   Identity Provider (IdP)
1920   When using federation, this is the party that manages the subscriber’s primary
1921   authenticators and issues assertions derived from the subscriber account.
