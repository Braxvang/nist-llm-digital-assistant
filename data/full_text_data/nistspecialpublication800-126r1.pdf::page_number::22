              The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.1



An <xccdf:ident> element referencing a CVE, CCE, or CPE identifier SHALL be ordered before
other <xccdf:ident> elements referencing non-SCAP identifiers. Identifiers from previous revisions
of CCE or CPE MAY also be specified following the SCAP identifiers.

3.2.6.2 OVAL Definition References

If an <xccdf:Rule> element references a specific OVAL Definition, then:

   1. The referenced OVAL Definition MUST have its @class attribute defined as ―compliance‖ if it
      represents a check for the value of a specific configuration setting.

   2. The referenced OVAL Definition MUST have its @class attribute defined as ―vulnerability‖ if
      it represents a check for the presence of a particular software flaw vulnerability.

   3. The referenced OVAL Definition MUST have its @class attribute defined as ―patch‖ if it
      represents a check for the presence of a discrete patch.

   4. The referenced OVAL Definition MUST have its @class attribute defined as ―inventory‖ if it
      represents a check for the presence of a product of interest.

3.2.6.3 OCIL Questionnaire References

An XCCDF rule MAY reference an OCIL questionnaire. This SHOULD be done only for cases where
OVAL cannot perform the check.

3.2.6.4 Use of a Patches Up-To-Date Rule

An OVAL instance document MAY be used to represent a series of checks to verify that patches have
been installed. Historically, an XCCDF convention has been used to identify such a reference. An
XCCDF benchmark MAY include a patches up-to-date rule that references an OVAL patch source data
stream component. When implementing a patches up-to-date XCCDF rule, the following approach
SHALL be used:

   1. The source data stream MUST include an OVAL Patch source data stream component.

   2. The <xccdf:Rule> element that references an OVAL Patch source data stream component
      SHALL have the @id attribute value of ―security_patches_up_to_date‖.

   3. A single <xccdf:check> element SHALL be provided for the <xccdf:Rule> with a
      @system attribute value of ―http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5‖.

   4. Each <xccdf:check-content-ref> element SHALL have an @href attribute referencing
      a valid SCAP <oval-def:oval_definitions> document instance with the @name
      attribute omitted.
