       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


1922   Identity Resolution
1923   The process of collecting information about an applicant in order to uniquely distinguish
1924   an individual within the context of the population the CSP serves.

1925   Issuing Source
1926   An authority responsible for the generation of data, digital evidence (such as assertions),
1927   or physical documents that can be used as identity evidence.

1928   Kerberos
1929   A widely used authentication protocol developed at MIT. In “classic” Kerberos, users
1930   share a secret password with a Key Distribution Center (KDC). The user (Alice) who
1931   wishes to communicate with another user (Bob) authenticates to the KDC and the KDC
1932   furnishes a “ticket” to use to authenticate with Bob.
1933   See [SP800-63C] Sec. 11.2 for more information.

1934   Knowledge-Based Verification (KBV)
1935   Identity verification method based on knowledge of private information associated with
1936   the claimed identity. This is often referred to as knowledge-based authentication (KBA)
1937   or knowledge-based proofing (KBP).

1938   Manageability
1939   Per NISTIR 8062: Providing the capability for granular administration of personally
1940   identifiable information, including alteration, deletion, and selective disclosure.

1941   Memorized Secret
1942   A type of authenticator comprised of a character string intended to be memorized or
1943   memorable by the subscriber, permitting the subscriber to demonstrate something they
1944   know as part of an authentication process.

1945   Message Authentication Code (MAC)
1946   A cryptographic checksum on data that uses a symmetric key to detect both accidental
1947   and intentional modifications of the data. MACs provide authenticity and integrity
1948   protection, but not non-repudiation protection.

1949   Mobile Code
1950   Executable code that is normally transferred from its source to another computer system
1951   for execution. This transfer is often through the network (e.g., JavaScript embedded in a
1952   web page) but may transfer through physical media as well.

1953   Multi-Factor



                                                   53
