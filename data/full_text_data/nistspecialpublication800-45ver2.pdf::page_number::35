4.2     Security Management Staff

Because mail server security is tightly intertwined with the organization’s general information system
security posture, a number of IT and system security staff may be interested in mail server planning,
implementation, and administration. This section provides a list of those roles and identifies their
responsibilities as related to mail server security. These roles may vary with the organization, however,
and not all organizations will have the identical roles described here.
