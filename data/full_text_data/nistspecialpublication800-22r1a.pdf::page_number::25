A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



           For example, if ε = 1011010101, then n=10 and Sn = 1 + (-1) + 1 + 1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) + 1 +
           (-1) + 1 = 2.

                                                Sn
(2)        Compute the test statistic sobs =
                                                 n

                                                     2
           For the example in this section, sobs =        = .632455532.
                                                     10
                                     s     
(3)        Compute P-value = erfc  obs  , where erfc is the complementary error function as defined in
                                         2 
           Section 5.5.3.

                                                                 .632455532 
           For the example in this section, P-value = erfc                   = 0.527089.
                                                                      2     


2.1.5 Decision Rule (at the 1% Level)
If the computed P-value is < 0.01, then conclude that the sequence is non-random. Otherwise, conclude
that the sequence is random.

2.1.6 Conclusion and Interpretation of Results
Since the P-value obtained in step 3 of Section 2.1.4 is ≥ 0.01 (i.e., P-value = 0.527089), the conclusion is
that the sequence is random.

Note that if the P-value were small (< 0.01), then this would be caused by S n or sobs being large.
Large positive values of Sn are indicative of too many ones, and large negative values of Sn are indicative
of too many zeros.

2.1.7 Input Size Recommendation
It is recommended that each sequence to be tested consist of a minimum of 100 bits (i.e., n ≥ 100).

2.1.8 Example
(input)    ε = 11001001000011111101101010100010001000010110100011
               00001000110100110001001100011001100010100010111000

(input)            n = 100

(processing)       S100 = -16

(processing)       sobs = 1.6

(output)           P-value = 0.109599

(conclusion)       Since P-value ≥ 0.01, accept the sequence as random.
