                                                        CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS




Federal organizations are required to comply with the above federal policies in addition to internal
departmental or agency policies.


      Information System:

      An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection,
      processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information.*

      Information system components include, but are not limited to, mainframes, servers, workstations,
      network components, operating systems, middleware, and applications. Network components can
      include, for example, such devices as firewalls, sensors (local or remote), switches, guards,
      routers, gateways, wireless access points, and network appliances. Servers can include, for
      example, database servers, authentication servers, electronic mail and Web servers, proxy
      servers, domain name servers, and network time servers. Information system components are
      either purchased commercially off-the-shelf or are custom-developed and can be deployed in land-
      based, sea-based, airborne, and/or space-based information systems.**

      * As defined by 44 U.S.C., Sec 3502.
      ** As defined in NIST Special Publication 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal
      Information Systems and Organizations.


1.3       Audience

This document has been created for managers within federal organizations and those individuals
responsible for information systems or security at system and operational levels. It is also written to
assist emergency management personnel who coordinate facility-level contingencies with supporting
information system contingency planning activities. The concepts presented in this document are specific
to government systems, but may be used by private and commercial organizations, including contractor
systems. The audience includes the following types of personnel:

         Managers responsible for overseeing information system operations or mission/business
          processes that rely on information systems; 2
         Chief Information Officers (CIOs) with overall responsibility for the organization’s information
          systems; 3
         Senior Agency Information Security Officers (SAISOs) responsible for developing and
          maintaining the security of information systems at the organizational level; 4
         Information System Security Officers (ISSOs)/Information System Security Managers
          (ISSMs) and other staff responsible for developing, implementing, and maintaining an
          information system’s security activities;
         System engineers and architects responsible for designing, implementing, or modifying
          information systems;
         System administrators responsible for maintaining daily information system operations;


2
  Managers include Authorizing Officials, information system owners, and information owners.
3
  For organizations without a CIO position, FISMA requires a comparable executive to have authority over the information
  systems.
4
  SAISOs are also called Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs).
