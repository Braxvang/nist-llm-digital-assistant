pledges with respect to the payment of all or a part of the principal or interest on any debt
obligation of a non-Federal borrower to a non-Federal lender. In most cases, unauthorized
disclosure of loan guarantee information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Much loan guarantee information
includes information covered by the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. (The Privacy Act
Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and
Authentication information type.) Unauthorized disclosure of large volumes of information
protected under the Privacy Act can be expected to have a serious to severe effect on public
confidence in the agency. In such cases, the confidentiality impact can be moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for loan guarantee information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Loan guarantee
activities are not generally time-critical. In most cases, the adverse effects of unauthorized
modification or destruction of loan guarantee information on agency mission functions and
public confidence in the agency will be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for loan
guarantee information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to loan guarantee information. Loan
processes are generally tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of access to loan guarantee
information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: The provisional availability impact
level recommended for loan guarantee information is low.

D.24.3 General Insurance Information Type

General Insurance involves providing protection to individuals or entities against specified
risks. The specified protection generally involves risks that private sector entities are unable
or unwilling to assume or subsidize and where the provision of insurance is necessary to
achieve social objectives. The following provisional security categorization is recommended
for the general insurance information type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}
