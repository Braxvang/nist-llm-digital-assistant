 Technical Controls                   Security controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) for
 [FIPS 200]                           an information system that are primarily implemented
                                      and executed by the information system through
                                      mechanisms contained in the hardware, software, or
                                      firmware components of the system.
 Threat                               Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely
 [CNSSI 4009]                         impact organizational operations (including mission,
                                      functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets,
                                      individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an
                                      information system via unauthorized access, destruction,
                                      disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of
                                      service.
 Threat Assessment                    Process of formally evaluating the degree of threat to an
 [CNSSI 4009]                         information system or enterprise and describing the
                                      nature of the threat.
 Threat Source                        The intent and method targeted at the intentional
 [CNSSI 4009]                         exploitation of a vulnerability or a situation and method
                                      that may accidentally exploit a vulnerability.
 Trustworthiness                      The attribute of a person or enterprise that provides
 [CNSSI 4009]                         confidence to others of the qualifications, capabilities,
                                      and reliability of that entity to perform specific tasks and
                                      fulfill assigned responsibilities.
 Vulnerability                        Weakness in an information system, system security
 [CNSSI 4009]                         procedures, internal controls, or implementation that
                                      could be exploited by a threat source.
 Vulnerability Assessment             Systematic examination of an information system or
 [CNSSI 4009]                         product to determine the adequacy of security measures,
                                      identify security deficiencies, provide data from which to
                                      predict the effectiveness of proposed security measures,
                                      and confirm the adequacy of such measures after
                                      implementation.
