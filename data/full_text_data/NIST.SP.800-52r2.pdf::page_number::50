NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                             GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


4.4.2.9 Pre-Shared Key

Applies to TLS version 1.3

The Pre-Shared Key extension (pre_shared_key) is used to indicate the identity of the pre-shared
key to be used for PSK key establishment. In TLS 1.3, pre-shared keys may either be established
out-of-band, as in TLS 1.2 and prior versions, or in a previous connection, in which case they are
used for session resumption. Clients that support TLS 1.3 may be configured to use this
extension in order to allow session resumption or to allow the use of pre-shared keys that are
established out-of-band.

4.4.2.10 Pre-Shared Key Exchange Modes

Applies to TLS version 1.3

A TLS 1.3 client must send the Pre-Shared Key Exchange Modes extension
(psk_key_exchange_modes) if it sends the Pre-Shared Key extension. Otherwise, the server will
abort the handshake. TLS clients that support TLS 1.3 and the Pre-Shared Key extension shall
implement this extension.

4.4.2.11 Supported Versions

Applies to TLS version 1.3

The supported versions extension indicates which versions of TLS the client is able to negotiate.
A TLS 1.3 client shall send this extension in the ClientHello message.

4.4.2.12 Cookie

Applies to TLS version 1.3

The cookie extension allows the server to force the client to prove that it is reachable at its
apparent network address and offload state to the client. Clients that support TLS 1.3 shall
support the cookie extension in accordance with RFC 8446 [57].

4.4.2.13 Certificate Signature Algorithms

Applies to TLS versions: 1.2, 1.3

The Certificate Signature Algorithms extension (signature_algorithms_cert) indicates the
signature algorithms that may be used in certificates. This allows the entity requesting a
certificate (client or server) to request different signature algorithms for the certificate than for
the TLS handshake. A client may send this extension to the server and may receive this
extension from a server that is requesting certificate-based client authentication. This extension
does not need to be sent if the algorithms in the Signature Algorithms extension apply to
certificates as well. TLS client implementations that support TLS 1.3 shall support this
extension, and it should be supported for TLS 1.2.
