Service Interface: The abstract boundary that a service exposes. It defines the types of messages and
the message exchange patterns that are involved in interacting with the service, together with any
conditions implied by those messages. [1]

Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA): A collection of services. These services communicate with
each other. The communication can involve either simple data passing or it could involve two or more
services coordinating some activity. [14]

SOAP: An XML-based protocol for exchanging structured information in a decentralized, distributed
environment. [14]

SOAP Header: A collection of zero or more blocks of information prepended to a SOAP message, each
of which might be targeted at any SOAP receiver within the message path. [1]

SOAP Message: The basic unit of communication between SOAP nodes. [1]

Transport Layer Security (TLS): Provides privacy and data integrity between two communicating
applications. It is designed to encapsulate other protocols, such as HTTP. TLS v1.0 was released in
1999, providing slight modifications to SSL 3.0. [28]

Trust: The willingness to take actions expecting beneficial outcomes, based on assertions by other
parties. [14]

Trust Relationships: Policies that govern how entities in differing domains honor each other’s
authorizations. An authority may be completely trusted—for example, any statement from the authority
will be accepted as a basis for action—or there may be limited trust, in which case only statements in a
specific range are accepted. [14]

Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI): An XML-based lookup service for
locating Web services in an Internet Topology. UDDI provides a platform-independent way of describing
and discovering Web services and Web service providers. The UDDI data structures provide a
framework for the description of basic service information, and an extensible mechanism to specify
detailed service access information using any standard description language. [6]

Web Portal: Provides a single point of entry into the SOA for requester entities, enabling them to access
Web services transparently from any device at virtually any location. [29]

Web Service: A software component or system designed to support interoperable machine- or
application-oriented interaction over a network. A Web service has an interface described in a machine-
processable format (specifically WSDL). Other systems interact with the Web service in a manner
prescribed by its description using SOAP messages, typically conveyed using HTTP with an XML
serialization in conjunction with other Web-related standards. [14]

Web Service Interoperability (WS-I) Basic Profile: A set of standards and clarifications to standards
that vendors must follow for basic interoperability with SOAP products. [30]

Web Services Description Language (WSDL): An XML format for describing network services as a
set of endpoints operating on messages containing either document-oriented or procedure-oriented
information. WSDL complements the UDDI standard by providing a uniform way of describing the
abstract interface and protocol bindings and deployment details of arbitrary network services. [32], [8]
