Appendix Câ€”Example of Update Mechanism 2

This appendix provides an example of how Update Mechanism 2 could be implemented in a server. In
this example, BIOS update images are verified and flashed during the boot process, while the RTU
implemented as part of the BIOS has control of the system. Figure 2 shows an example system block
diagram for a server using this update mechanism. The BIOS flash SPI controller is accessible by just the
host. A potential BIOS update image is stored in the SP environment.
