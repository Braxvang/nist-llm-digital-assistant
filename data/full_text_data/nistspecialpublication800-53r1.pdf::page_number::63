AC-3      ACCESS ENFORCEMENT

          Control: The information system enforces assigned authorizations for controlling access to the
          system in accordance with applicable policy.
          Supplemental Guidance: Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies,
          rule-based policies) and associated access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists,
          access control matrices, cryptography) are employed by organizations to control access between
          users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes,
          programs, domains) in the information system. In addition to controlling access at the information
          system level, access enforcement mechanisms are employed at the application level, when
          necessary, to provide increased information security for the organization. Consideration is given
          to the implementation of a controlled, audited, and manual override of automated mechanisms in
          the event of emergencies or other serious events. If encryption of stored information is employed
          as an access enforcement mechanism, the cryptography used is FIPS 140-2 (as amended)
          compliant. Related security control: SC-13.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The information system restricts access to privileged functions (deployed in hardware, software,
                and firmware) and security-relevant information to explicitly authorized personnel.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Explicitly authorized personnel include, for example,
                security administrators, system and network administrators, and other privileged users.
                Privileged users are individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or
                administration functions (e.g., system administrators, information system security officers,
                maintainers, system programmers).
