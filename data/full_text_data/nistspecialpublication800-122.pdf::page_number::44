                           GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



   OMB reviews the proposed information collection and assigns a control number to the collection,
   which must be displayed on the collection form.
8. What are the general risks to individuals and the organization if PII is misused?

   Depending on the type of information lost, an individual may suffer social, economic, or physical
   harm. If the information lost is sufficient to be exploited by an identity thief, the person can suffer,
   for example, from a loss of money, damage to credit, a compromise of medical records, threats,
   and/or harassment. The individual may suffer tremendous losses of time and money to address the
   damage. Other types of harm that may occur to individuals include denial of government benefits,
   blackmail, discrimination, and physical harm.

   Organizations also face risks to their finances and reputation. If PII is misused, organizations may
   suffer financial losses in compensating the individuals, assisting them in monitoring their credit
   ratings, and addressing administrative concerns. In addition, recovering from a major breach is costly
   to many organizations in terms of time spent by key staff in coordinating and executing appropriate
   responses. If a loss of PII constitutes a violation of relevant law, the organization and/or its staff may
   be subject to criminal or civil penalties, or it may have to agree to receive close government scrutiny
   and oversight. Another major risk to organizations is that their public reputation and public
   confidence may be lost, potentially jeopardizing the organizations‘ ability to achieve their missions.

9. What should I consider when reviewing restrictions on collecting PII?

   Key considerations to review are any legal requirements that could impact PII collections. One
   should ask what laws, regulations, and guidance are applicable to the organization considering the
   type of PII that is collected (e.g., Privacy Act, Paperwork Reduction Act, and the E-Government Act
   for general PII; HIPAA for health PII; GLBA for financial PII; COPPA for children‘s PII). An
   organization‘s legal counsel and privacy officer should always be consulted to determine whether
   there are restrictions on collecting PII.
   Consistent with the Fair Information Practices of Collection Limitation and Use Limitation, one could
   more specifically ask if the collected PII is absolutely necessary to do business (i.e., does it support
   the business purpose of the system or the organization‘s mission?). If it does not serve a viable
   business purpose, then Federal agencies may not collect that PII. If the collection of PII does serve a
   business purpose, then it should be collected, used, shared, and disseminated appropriately.

10. What is different about protecting PII compared to any other data, and how should PII be
    protected?

   In many cases, protection of PII is similar to protection of other data and includes protecting the
   confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information. Most security controls used for other
   types of data are also applicable to the protection of PII. For PII, there are several privacy-specific
   safeguards, such as anonymization, minimization of PII collection, and de-identification.

   In addition to protection requirements for PII, there are other requirements for the handling of PII.
   The Fair Information Practices provide best practice guidelines, such as Purpose Specification, Use
   Limitation, Accountability, and Data Quality. Moreover, the factors for assigning a confidentiality
   impact level to PII are different than other types of data. Breaches to the confidentiality of PII harm
   both the organization and the individual. Harm to individuals should be factored in strongly because
   of the magnitude of the potential harm, such as identity theft, embarrassment, and denial of benefits.
