SP 800-152                                                 A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


             AC-4 (20)    A multi-level Federal CKMS could support a transaction
PF:4.7
                          between an entity from one security domain and an entity
                          from another security domain by:
                             a) Determining if the two FCKMS Security Policies are
                                multi-level,
                             b) Determining if the two policies have an acceptable
                                intersection of the level of protection that can be
                                provided for the information to be exchanged, and
                             c) Supporting that level of protection.
                          A Federal CKMS could support one or more multi-level
PF:4.8
                          security domains.

4.11.6 Upgrading and Downgrading
Under certain conditions, a domain authority could decide that a key and/or metadata from an
entity in a lower-level security domain (a domain providing less protection) can be accepted
and protected at the higher level required by its own FCKMS Security Policy. This process is
called upgrading. Upgrading should only be done if the authority responsible for the higher-
level domain trusts the source and authenticity of the key and/or metadata to be provided
from the lower level. Likewise, the domain authority for a higher-level security domain
might need to pass a key and/or metadata to a lower-level security domain entity, requiring
the protection on the key and/or metadata to be downgraded. In this case, the domain
authority for the higher-level domain must be assured that the key and/or metadata being
passed down only require the lower level of security provided by the receiverâ€™s lower-level
domain.

FR:4.24 The CKMS design shall specify if and how it supports the upgrading or
downgrading of keys and metadata.

FR:4.25 The CKMS design shall specify how upgrading or downgrading capabilities are
restricted to the domain authority.

                          In a Federal CKMS, upgrading and downgrading shall be
PR:4.18
                          under the control of an authorized domain authority.
                          In a Federal CKMS, a key and its associated metadata shall
PR:4.19
                          only be upgraded if the authority responsible for the higher-
                          level domain trusts the source and authenticity of the key
                          and/or metadata to be provided from the lower level domain.
                          In a Federal CKMS, a key and its associated metadata shall
PR:4.20
                          only be downgraded if the domain authority for the higher-
                          level domain has determined that the key and/or metadata
                          being passed down only requires the lower level of security
                          provided by the lower-level domain.
