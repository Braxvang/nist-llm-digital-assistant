D.8.1 Environmental Monitoring and Forecasting Information Type

Environmental Monitoring and Forecasting involves the observation and prediction of
environmental conditions. This includes b the monitoring and forecasting of water quality, water
levels, ice sheets, air quality, regulated and non-regulated emissions, as well as the observation
and prediction of weather patterns and conditions. The following provisional security
categorization is recommended for the environmental monitoring and forecasting information
type:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of environmental
monitoring and forecasting information on the ability of responsible agencies to observe and
predict environmental conditions. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most
environmental monitoring information are unlikely to have a serious adverse effect on agency
operations.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The most serious adverse effects are
likely to involve exposure of information that is proprietary to an organization or result in
damaging publicity for an organization. [Unauthorized disclosure of some information can have
serious economic impact on both individual companies and the broader market place. The
consequences of such unauthorized disclosures may have an adverse effect on public confidence
in the agency.] In such cases, the potential confidentiality impacts may be at least moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most environmental monitoring and forecasting information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of environmental monitoring
information and forecasting can be serious if the public is exposed to harmful emissions, polluted
water, etc.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may
adversely affect operations and public confidence in the agency, but also the agency mission. In
some cases, unauthorized modification or destruction of information can result in loss of human
life - a high-impact potential.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
environmental monitoring and forecasting information is moderate.
