sensitive metadata by one or more unauthorized entities. Depending on the key type and key
usage, the compromise of a key could result in:
      a) Loss of confidentiality,
      b) Loss of integrity,
      c) Loss of authentication,
      d) Loss of non-repudiation, or
      e) Some combination of these losses.
Note that a compromise of a secret or private key could result in a compromise of all the
information protected by the key and access to all security services supported by the key.
Also, note that the compromise of the sensitive metadata of a key may result in the
compromise of the key (see Section 6.8.2).

A key compromise could be prevented, undetected, detected, or suspected. An FCKMS
should be designed and operated to 1) prevent key compromises, 2) detect actual
compromises, 3) support the analysis of suspected compromises, and 4) minimize the risks of
undetected compromises. Establishing a cryptoperiod or usage limit for each key can reduce
the exposure caused by an undetected compromise7. See Section 6.8.1 of the Framework for
additional discussion.

A cryptographic key may be used for applying cryptographic protection (e.g., encryption or
generating a digital signature) or processing cryptographically protected information (e.g.,
decryption or verifying a digital signature). For symmetric algorithms, the same key is used
both to apply the protection and process the protected information. For public-key
algorithms, one key of a key pair is often used to apply the protection, and the other is used
to process the protected information; for public-key algorithms, key compromise is
concerned with the disclosure or modification of the private key of the key pair. Keys or key
pairs known or suspected of being compromised must not be used to apply cryptographic
protection, but they may be used to process cryptographically protected information, if
required and unmodified (e.g., for continuity of operations), and the risk of doing so is
acceptable.

An FCKMS should have the ability to rapidly revoke a key (see Section 6.8.3), replace keys
(both asymmetric and symmetric) and the ability to notify the relying parties (those who
make use of the key) of a compromise. A mobile FCKMS device should have the capability
of being deactivated remotely by the FCKMS management, and the sensitive keys and
metadata within the device should be destroyed if possible.

FR:6.102 The CKMS design shall specify the range of acceptable cryptoperiods or usage
limits of each type of key used by the system.

FR:6.103 For each key, a CKMS design shall specify the other key types that depend on the
key for their security and how those dependent keys are to be replaced in the event of a
compromise of the initial key.

    The usage of keys may be limited based on a criterion, such as the amount of data processed using the key.
