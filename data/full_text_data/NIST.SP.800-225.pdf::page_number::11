             IDENTITY & ACCESS MANAGEMENT

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the cornerstone of data protection, privacy,
and security. NIST’s IAM priority area provides the research, guidance, and technology
transition activities to help ensure that the right humans, devices, data, and processes
              have the right access to the right resources at the right time.

Major Accomplishments in FY 2022:
• A third revision of the Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees standard was
  published, which specifies secure and reliable forms of identity credentials for federal
  employees and contractors who need access to federal facilities and applications.
• The draft of NIST’s Digital Identity Guidelines was completed, incorporating comments
  submitted in response to the June 2020 Request for Comments (RFC), lessons learned from
  federal agencies and industry, and new content about emerging technologies, threats, and
  policies.
• Part 8 of the Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) was published. This report compiles and
  analyzes demographic summary measures for how face recognition false positive and false
  negative error rates differ across age, sex, and race-based demographic groups. This is a
  key step toward a metric that can be used to summarize demographic differentials, support
  standards development for measuring performance, and drive improvements in the
  technology.
• Guidance was provided for the implementation of DevSecOps primitives for reference
  platforms that host cloud-native applications with the publication of Application of
  DevSecOps Using a Service Mesh in Microservices-Based Infrastructure.
• NIST contributed to and helped finalize the international standard for Mobile Driving
  License (mDL) Applications, developed a reference implementation to test the standard,
  and created security and privacy considerations for the mDL ecosystem.
