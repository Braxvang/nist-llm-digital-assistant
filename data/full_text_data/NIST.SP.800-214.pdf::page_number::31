Secure software development practices should be integrated throughout SDLC models for three
reasons:
   1. To reduce the number of vulnerabilities in released software,
   2. To mitigate the potential impact of the exploitation of undetected or
      unaddressed vulnerabilities, and
   3. To address the root causes of vulnerabilities to prevent future recurrences.
In April 2020, NIST published the final version of a Cybersecurity White Paper on secure software
development practices, Mitigating the Risk of Software Vulnerabilities by Adopting a Secure
Software Development Framework (SSDF). The white paper recommends a core set of high-level
secure software development practices – called the Secure Software Development Framework
(SSDF) – to be added to each SDLC implementation. The SSDF practices are based on those
from established secure software development practice documents by other organizations.
The SSDF also provides a common vocabulary for secure software development that software
consumers can use to foster communications with software suppliers in acquisition processes
and other management activities.
Since NIST published the SSDF, there has been considerable interest from industry and others
in NIST in illustrating how the SSDF can be applied to particular SDLC models, especially
transitioning DevOps implementations to DevSecOps. NIST will continue to refresh and evolve
the SSDF in response to public feedback and the changing threats, vulnerabilities, practices,
and automation capabilities in software development.
Industrial Control System (ICS) Cybersecurity and Manufacturing Profile
A revision to NISTIR 8183, Cybersecurity Framework Manufacturing Profile, includes the
subcategory enhancements established in the NIST Framework for Improving Critical
Infrastructure Cybersecurity Version 1.1. These updates also include managing cybersecurity
within the supply chain, self-assessing cybersecurity risk, vulnerability disclosure, system
integrity, and more comprehensive controls for identity management.
The Manufacturing Profile was developed for manufacturers managing cybersecurity risk and is
aligned with manufacturing sector goals and industry best practices. It provides a voluntary, risk-
based approach for managing cybersecurity activities and reducing cyber risk to manufacturing
systems. The Manufacturing Profile is meant to enhance but not replace current cybersecurity
standards and industry guidelines that the manufacturer is embracing.
Systems Security Engineering
In FY 2020, NIST continued to foster the engineering-driven perspectives and actions necessary
to develop more defensible and survivable systems, including the machine, physical, and
human components of systems and the capabilities and services delivered by those systems.
The Systems Security Engineering (SSE) approach builds upon well-established international
standards for systems and software and fuses systems security engineering methods, practices,
and techniques. The initial volume in this new series, SP 800-160, Volume 2, Developing Cyber
Resilient Systems: A Systems Security Engineering Approach, describes an approach to
designing, building, and retrofitting engineered systems with the ability to anticipate, withstand,
recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems
