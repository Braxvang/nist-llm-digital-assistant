4.6.1   Select Appropriate Exit Strategy

As mentioned during the development of the exit strategy, an organization should have several exit
strategies prepared and ready for implementation (section 4.3.3). Often, an organization will be able to
plan in advance for the exit: the service provider and the organization have an agreed-on contract that
expires in 6 months, for example. However, this will not always be the case. The service arrangement
may not succeed as managers hoped, the service provider may not meet the targets, a new technology
may debut, or the service provider may even have suddenly filed for bankruptcy. Managers need to be
aware of these various scenarios and be ready to implement an exit strategy swiftly.

4.6.2   Implement Appropriate Exit Strategy

Once the circumstances become such that the service, service arrangement, or service provider need to be
retired and the appropriate exit strategy is selected, the project managers need to implement the
appropriate exit strategy. The exit strategy will best assure a careful ending and provide lessons-learned
for desired future IT security service implementations.
