Relying party            An individual or organization that relies on the certificate and
                         the CA that issued the certificate to verify the identity of the
                         user; the validity of the public key, associated algorithms and
                         any relevant parameters; and the user’s possession of the
                         corresponding private key.
Secret key               A cryptographic key that is used with a secret-key (symmetric)
                         cryptographic algorithm that is uniquely associated with one or
                         more entities and is not made public. The use of the term
                         “secret” in this context does not imply a classification level, but
                         rather implies the need to protect the key from disclosure.
Security association     A relationship between two network entities in which security
                         information is shared and used to support secure
                         communication between the two entities.
Security services        Mechanisms used to provide confidentiality, data integrity,
                         authentication or non-repudiation of information.
Self-signed              A public-key certificate whose digital signature may be verified
certificate              by the public key contained within the certificate. The signature
                         on a self-signed certificate protects the integrity of the data, but
                         does not guarantee authenticity of the information. The trust of
                         self-signed certificates is based on the secure procedures used to
                         distribute them.
Shall                    This term is used to indicate a requirement of a Federal
                         Information Processing Standard (FIPS) or a requirement that
                         must be fulfilled to claim conformance to this
                         Recommendation. Note that shall may be coupled with not to
                         become shall not.
Shared secret            A value that is generated during a key-agreement scheme; the
                         shared secret is used to derive keying material for a symmetric-
                         key algorithm.
Should                   This term is used to indicate a very important requirement.
                         While the “requirement” is not stated in a FIPS, ignoring the
                         requirement could result in undesirable results. Note that
                         should may be coupled with not to become should not.
Signature verification   Uses a digital-signature algorithm and a public key to verify a
                         digital signature.
Symmetric key            A single cryptographic key that is used with a secret
                         (symmetric) key algorithm.
Symmetric-key            A cryptographic algorithm that uses one shared key, a secret
algorithm                key.
Threat                   Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely
                         impact a system through unauthorized access, destruction,
