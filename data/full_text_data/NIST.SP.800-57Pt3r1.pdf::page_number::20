             Digital Signature keys used          RSA (2048 bits)

             (for Users or Devices)               ECDSA (Curves P-256 or P-384)


             CA and OCSP Responder                RSA (2048 or 3072bits)
             Signing Keys                         ECDSA (Curves P-256 or P-384)


                                                  RSA (2048 bits)
             Key Establishment keys
                                                  Diffie-Hellman (2048 bits)
             (for Users or Devices)
                                                  ECDH (Curves P-256 or P-384)


Note that some approved algorithms and key sizes, such as DSA 2048, are omitted to
enhance interoperability. RSA and ECDSA, which are included in Table 2-1 above, have
been widely deployed in PKIs. Therefore, they are recommended for use to enhance
interoperability. However, DSA (2048 and 3072) as specified in [FIPS 186-4] are
allowed as long as the required security strength is satisfied. For ECDSA, only the two
elliptic curves listed in Table 2-1 above of the elliptic curves are recommended for use in
PKIs for digital signatures [FIPS 186-4]. Similarly, Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
(ECDH) is recommended to support key establishment, rather than Elliptic Curve MQV.

While Table 2-1 is focused on the strength of the public key contained in a certificate, the
strength of the digital signature on a certificate itself is equally important. The signature
security strength also reflects the security strength of the hash algorithm, and possibly the
padding scheme8, in addition to the strength of the private key used to generate the
signature. Table 2-2 below summarizes the recommended algorithms, key sizes, hash
functions, and padding schemes for signing certificates and CRLs by CAs, and OCSP
status messages by OCSP responders.

  RSA has two padding schemes used in the PKI: PKCS #1 v1.5, and PSS. The security strength of a digital
signature generated using ECDSA is not affected by a padding scheme.
