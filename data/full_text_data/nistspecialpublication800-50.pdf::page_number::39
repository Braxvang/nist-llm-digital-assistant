NIST Special Publication 800-50



       Use – This category is for individuals who access IT resources and/or use IT to do their jobs.
Categories (or functional specialties) are arranged in each matrix along the top, from left to right. A
placeholder exists in the seventh column, called “Other,” designed to be used if an additional role
category or functional specialty is developed. These six categories allow a training course to be tailor-fit
to an audience and allow the course to address specific functions within a role. For example, a system
administrator may manage the function or may administer (operate) a system or systems. Training course
material should be organized by role – by an individual’s job function – within the organization.

In Figure 4-1, the sample matrix for a system administrator course, ten cells will be developed into the
course material. Each cell can be seen as a building block for the course material. In this example, most
of the cells fall in the “Implement and Operate” specialty or column, because it is assumed that the system
administrator will be running (operating) a system or systems. Because this course will address system
management, design, and development, several of the ten cells are shown in those specialties or columns.


4.2.2       Sources of Training Courses and Material

The first step in determining sources of training material to build a course(s) is to decide if the material
will be developed in-house or contracted out. If the agency has in-house expertise and can afford to
allocate the necessary resources to develop training material and courses, NIST Special Publication 800-
16 can be used.

Figure 4-2 contains some key issues to consider in making the decision to develop a course in-house or to
outsource.


         Do we have the in-house resources to do the job? This includes people with the right skills and
          enough people to do the work.
         Is it more cost-effective to develop the material in-house versus outsourcing?
         Is there a funding mechanism in place (budget)?
         Do we have a person on staff that can serve as the contracting officer’s technical representative
          (COTR) and effectively monitor contractor activity?
         Does the agency have the necessary resources (e.g., funding and staff with necessary expertise) to
          maintain the material, if it is developed by a contractor?
         Does the course content sensitivity preclude use of a contractor?
         Does outsourcing allow for critical training delivery schedules to be met?


                   Figure 4-2: Key Questions – Develop Training Material In-house or Outsource?

If the agency decides to outsource its training course development, there are a number of vendors that
offer “off-the-shelf” courses that are suitable for particular audiences or that can be developed for specific
audiences. Prior to selecting a particular vendor, agencies should have a thorough understanding of their
training needs and be able to determine if a prospective vendor’s material meets their needs.
