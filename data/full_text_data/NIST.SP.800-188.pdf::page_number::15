Executive Summary

Every federal agency creates and maintains internal datasets that are vital for fulflling
its mission. The Foundation for Evidence-based Policymaking Act of 2018 [2] and its
Phase 1 implementation memorandum M-19-23 [168] mandate that agencies also collect
and publish their government data in open, machine-readable formats when it is appropriate
to do so. Agencies can use de-identifcation to make government datasets available while
protecting the privacy of the individuals whose data are contained within those datasets.
The U.S. Government defnes personally identifable information (PII) as “information that
can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, either alone or when combined
with other information that is linked or linkable to a specifc individual.”[4]
For decades, de-identifcation based on simply removing identifying information was thought
to be suffcient to prevent the re-identifcation of individuals in large datasets. Since the
mid 1990s, a growing body of research has demonstrated the reverse, resulting in new pri-
vacy attacks that are capable of re-identifying individuals in “de-identifed” data releases.
For several years, the goals of such attacks appeared to be embarrassing the publishing
agency and achieving academic distinction for the privacy researcher [65]. More recently,
as high-resolution de-identifed geolocation data have become commercially available, re-
identifcation techniques have been used by journalists, activists, and malicious actors [130,
170, 90] to learn information about individuals that was intended to be kept confdential.
These attacks highlight the defciencies in traditional approaches to de-identifcation.
Formal models of privacy, like k-anonymity [151] and differential privacy [52], use mathe-
matically rigorous approaches that are designed to allow for the controlled use of confden-
tial data while minimizing the privacy loss suffered by the data subjects.1 Because there
is an inherent trade-off between the accuracy of published data and the amount of privacy
protection afforded to data subjects, most formal methods have some kind of parameter
that can be adjusted to control the “privacy cost” of a particular data release. Informally, a
data release with a low privacy cost causes little additional privacy risk to the participants,
while a higher privacy cost results in more privacy risk. When they are available and have
suffcient functionality for the task at hand, formal privacy methods should be preferred
over informal ad hoc methods.
Decisions and practices regarding the de-identifcation and release of government data can
be integral to the mission and proper functioning of a government agency. As such, an
agency’s leadership should manage these activities in a way that ensures performance and
1 While k-anonymity and differential privacy are both mathematically rigorous formal models, k-anonymity

 is a privacy framework based on the content of the published data, while differential privacy places bounds
 on the amount of information that can be learned about the confdential data from the published data.
