exploitation of unauthorized disclosure of logistics management information will range from
moderate to high. Some logistics management information is classified (e.g., some military
logistics information). The classified information is national security related and is outside the
scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most logistics management information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of logistics management information
usually depends on the urgency with which the information is needed or the immediacy with
which the information is used. In most cases, the information will not be needed urgently or
acted upon immediately.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external publication of
logistics management information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect public
confidence in the agency. However, damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
logistics management information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to logistics management information.
Functions and processes supported by most logistics management information are tolerant of
delays i.e., the data supporting the functions/processes are not time-critical. Typically,
disruption of access to logistics management information will have a limited adverse effect
on agency operations (including mission functions and public confidence in the agency),
agency assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Exceptions may include emergency
requirements to deploy personnel and their resources to support disaster management. In
such cases, delays may cost lives and major property damage. Consequently, the impact
level for logistics management information needed to respond to emergencies will be high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The availability impact level recommended for logistics
management information is low.
C.3.4.4 Services Acquisition Information Type

Services acquisition involves the oversight and/or management of contractors and service
providers from the private sector. The recommended security categorization for the services
acquisition information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}
