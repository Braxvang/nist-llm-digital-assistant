A.4      Proprietary Designs

Numerous companies have created their own proprietary RFID tag designs, many of which are based on
open standards. In the case of proprietary designs, readers of this document are encouraged to seek
information from the vendors about these products.

Two prominent examples of proprietary tags that are, in effect, proprietary extensions of open standards,
but offer extended features are item management tags and contactless smart cards. Item management tags
that are based on the air interface defined by ISO/IEC 18000-7 are widely used to monitor shipments of
cargo containers. US DoD uses these tags to track military cargo. Proprietary tags based on ISO/IEC
18000-7 operate at 433 MHz, can have a range of 100 meters, and can have user memory up to 128
kilobytes. Contactless smart cards are often based on ISO/IEC 14443 and are widely used in public
transportation and can also be used in access control, financial payment, gaming, loyalty card programs,
and toll road payment. Many contactless smart cards are enhanced with proprietary extensions and
security features.
