beforehand. In some cases, it may be necessary to ensure that the scene is physically secured to prevent
unauthorized access and alteration of the evidence. This may be as simple as having a physical security
staff member guard a room. There also may be situations where a law enforcement representative should
handle the data collection for legal reasons. This includes, but is not limited to, obtaining ISP records and
collecting data from external computer systems and unusual devices and media. Based on guidance from
legal advisors, organizations should determine in advance what types of data are best collected by law
enforcement officials.

Analysts should take into account what will be done with the collected data and plan for the potential
ramifications. In some cases, the data may be turned over to a law enforcement agency or another
external party for examination and analysis. This could result in the collected hardware being unavailable
for an extended period of time. If the original media needs to be kept secured for legal proceedings, it
could be unavailable for years. Another concern is that sensitive information unrelated to the
investigation (e.g., medical records, financial information) might be inadvertently captured along with the
desired data.

3.1.3   Incident Response Considerations

When performing forensics during incident response, an important consideration is how and when the
incident should be contained. Isolating the pertinent systems from external influences may be necessary
to prevent further damage to the system and its data or to preserve evidence. In many cases, the analyst
should work with the incident response team to make a containment decision (e.g., disconnecting network
cables, unplugging power, increasing physical security measures, gracefully shutting down a host). This
decision should be based on existing policies and procedures regarding incident containment, as well as
the team’s assessment of the risk posed by the incident, so that the chosen containment strategy or
combination of strategies sufficiently mitigates risk while maintaining the integrity of potential evidence
whenever possible.

The organization should also consider in advance the impact that various containment strategies may have
on the ability of the organization to operate effectively. For example, taking a critical system offline for
several hours to acquire disk images and other data might adversely affect the ability of the organization
to perform its necessary operations. Significant downtime could result in substantial monetary losses to
the organization. Therefore, care should be taken to minimize disruptions to an organization’s operations.

One step often taken to contain an incident is to secure the perimeter around a computer and limit access
to authorized personnel during the collection process to ensure that the evidence is not altered. Also, a list
of all users who have access to the computer should be documented, because these persons may be able to
provide passwords or information on where specific data is located. If the computer is connected to a
network, disconnecting network cables attached to the computer can prevent remote users from modifying
the computer’s data. If the computer uses a wireless network connection, the external network adapter
may be unplugged from the computer or the internal network adapter may be disabled to sever the
network connection. If neither option is possible, then powering off the wireless network access point
that the computer is using should achieve the same result; however, doing so may prevent users outside
the scope of the investigation from performing their daily routines. In addition, there could be more than
one access point within range of the computer. Some wireless network adapters automatically attempt to
connect to other access points when the primary access point is unavailable, so that containing the
incident in this way could involve disconnecting several access points.
