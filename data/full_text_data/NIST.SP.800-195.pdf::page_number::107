      The group is recognized for exceptional technical innovation in leading a global effort to develop Federal Information
      Processing Standard (FIPS) 202, the “SHA-3” hash function standard. Cryptographic hash functions are critical components
      of the technologies (e.g., digital signatures and message authentication) that secure global communications, international
      electronic commerce and more. Advances in cryptanalysis in 2004-2007 weakened the security of many widely used hash
      functions, broadly threatening cybersecurity. SHA-3 is intended to provide security for decades.
