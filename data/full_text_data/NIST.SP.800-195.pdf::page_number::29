ASSESSMENT TESTING TOOLS
         ITL supports the development of biometric
conformance testing methodology standards and other
conformity assessment efforts through active technical
participation in the development of these standards and
the development of associated conformance test software,
architectures and test suites, collectively known as Biometric
Conformance Test Software (BioCTS). These test tools are
developed to promote the adoption of these standards
and to support users, product developers, and testing labs
that require conformance to selected biometric standards.
ITL contributes to the development of biometric standards
and participates in the INCITS Technical Committee M1                                       Figure 4: ANSI/NIST-ITL Extractor Software
