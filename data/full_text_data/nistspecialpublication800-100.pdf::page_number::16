CHAPTER 2                                         Information Security Governance


   • Clear and comprehensive mission, vision, goals, and objectives and how they
     relate to agency mission;
   • High-level plan for achieving information security goals and objectives,
     including short- and mid-term objectives and performance targets, specific for
     each goal and objective, to be used throughout the life of this plan to manage
     progress toward successfully fulfilling the identified objectives; and
   • Performance measures to continuously monitor accomplishment of identified
     goals and objectives and their progress toward stated targets.
    Agencies should document their information security strategy in an information
security strategic plan or another document, if appropriate. Regardless of how the
information security strategy is documented, its contents should be aligned with the
overall agency strategic planning activities. The document should be revisited when a
major change in the agency information security environment occurs, including:
   • Change in applicable legislation, regulations, or directives;
   • Change in agency mission priorities; and
   • Emerging information security issues, such as changes in threat and
     vulnerability environment or the introduction of new technologies.

2.2.2 Information Security Governance Structures
   Information security governance structures can be characterized in a number of
ways. There are two basic models of information security governance structures:
centralized and decentralized. While agency heads are ultimately responsible for
managing and governing their respective agency, the authority and responsibility
over information security differs in the two types of structures. Key characteristics of
the two structures are:
   • Centralized. Departmental CIO or, in some instances, the SAISO has line-item
     budget control over all information security activities throughout the
     department. All information security practitioners within the department report
     to the departmental SAISO, who is responsible for ensuring implementation
     and monitoring of information security controls throughout the entire
     department.
   • Decentralized. Departmental SAISOs have policy development and oversight
     responsibilities. Departmental SAISOs have budget responsibilities over the
     departmental information security program, but not over the operating units’
     information security programs. Operating unit SAISOs report to the unit head,
     not to the departmental SAISO. Operating unit SAISOs are responsible for
     implementing and monitoring information security practices within their
     respective operating units.
    Completely centralized or decentralized information security governance
implementations are quite rare. In reality, the variety of implemented information
security governance structures spans the continuum from a centralized structure at
one end to a decentralized structure at the other. Agencies usually adopt hybrid
structures that include some characteristics of both centralized and decentralized
types of structures, and they adopt the particular mix of these characteristics to fit
their agency mission, size, homogeneity of their components, and existing
governance structure.
