Opportunities to Engage with the NIST
Cybersecurity & Privacy Program
Stakeholders are an important force behind NISTâ€™s cybersecurity and privacy programs. NIST
counts on developers, providers, and everyday users of cybersecurity and privacy technologies
and information to guide priorities in serving the public and private sectors. Stakeholders are also
vital when it comes to decisions about the best methods and formats for delivering information
and services.
NIST engages in many ways, both formal and informal. NIST participates in various forums,
Communities of Interest (COI), joint research efforts, standards development organizations,
Guest researcher projects, student programs, and other partnership opportunities that are
available; hosts/sponsors various cybersecurity and privacy events; and gathers public feedback
on NIST publications, blogs, and social media.
Further details on engaging with NIST on Cybersecurity and Privacy are available
at https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity/cybersecurity-privacy-stakeholder-engagement.
Funding Opportunities at NIST
NIST funds industrial and academic research in several ways. The Small Business Innovation
Research Program funds research and development (R&D) proposals from small businesses.
NIST offers grants to encourage work in the fields of precision measurement, fire research, and
materials science. Grants and awards supporting research by industry, academia, and other
institutions are also available on a competitive basis through various Institute offices.
For general information on the NIST grants programs, please contact Mr. Christopher Hunton
