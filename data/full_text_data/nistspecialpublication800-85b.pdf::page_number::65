Precondition(s)         1. All templates have been generated and stored on the PIV card.
                        2. A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                        3. A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and the
                             contact reader.
                        4. The test application is currently connected to the card application
                             which is accessible through card handle.
                        5. A valid Card Holder Facial Image object is present on the PIV card.
                        6. Security conditions to read the object are met.
Test Scenario           1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                        2. Set OID := <<Card Holder Facial Image
                           (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.96.48)>>
                        3. Call pivGetData w/
                            • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                        4. Extract the BDB Length field of CBEFF Header.
                        5. Extract the SB Length field of CBEFF Header.
Expected Result(s) 1. From step 4: BDB Length field is non-zero and the recorded length
                      match the actual length.
                   2. From step 5: SB Length field is non-zero and the recorded length match
                      the actual length.
                   3. The Card Holder Facial Image object length is equal to CBEFF Header
                      length + BDB Length + SB Length.
