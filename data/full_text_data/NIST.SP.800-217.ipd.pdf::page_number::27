      NIST SP 800-217 ipd                         Guidelines for PIV Federation (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


707   process MAY be augmented by automated processes, including dynamic discovery
708   and registration of the identifiers and key material for the IdP and RP in the federation
709   protocol.

710   4.1.3. FAL3
711   All of the requirements for FAL1 and FAL2 apply at FAL3 except where overridden by
712   more specific or stringent requirements in this section.
713   Trust establishment of the PIV IdP at FAL3 SHALL be done through a trusted process
714   whereby the RP ensures that the PIV IdP is the official home IdP that represents the
715   agencies and accounts in question. The establishment of identifiers and key material for
716   the IdP and RP in the federation protocol SHALL occur through a static process between
717   the IdP and RP.
718   As defined in [SP800-63C], FAL3 requires the establishment of a bound authenticator,
719   which the subscriber presents directly to the RP alongside the federation assertion from
720   the IdP. Though most PIV credentials can be used as bound authenticators at FAL3,
721   the nature of the binding depends on the type of authenticator, its use, and its phishing
722   resistance qualities.
723   PKI-based credentials, such as the PIV authentication certificate on the PIV Card, MAY
724   be used as an IdP-managed bound authenticator, as shown in Figure 2. When a certificate
725   is used in this fashion, the assertion SHALL contain the Distinguished Name of the
726   certificate as an attribute in the assertion to identify the specific certificate used as an
727   authenticator. If the RP uses a just-in-time provisioning method for the RP subscriber
728   account (as defined in [SP800-63C]), the RP SHALL compare the attributes of the
729   certificateâ€™s Distinguished Name with other attributes from the federation transaction
730   when first associating a Distinguished Name with a federated identifier. For example, if
731   the certificate includes one email address and the federation transaction gives the RP a
732   different email address, the RP needs to decide if the transaction should be rejected or if
733   this specific discrepancy is expected for its use case and security profile.
734   Non-PKI-based derived PIV credentials and authenticators other than PIV credentials
735    MAY be used as RP-managed bound authenticators, as shown in Figure 3, provided the
736   authenticators meet the phishing resistance requirements in [SP800-63C]. Note that with
737   RP-managed bound authenticators, the IdP does not see the authenticator directly. The RP
738    SHALL conduct an appropriate binding ceremony, as defined in [SP800-63C].

739   In their use as bound authenticators at FAL3, authenticators from PIV credentials do not
740   function as PIV credentials at the RP. However, the same authenticator MAY be used as
741   both a derived PIV authenticator at the IdP and a bound authenticator at the RP in a single
742   transaction provided that both the IdP and RP separately verify the authenticator.
743   In the case of a lost bound authenticator, the RP SHALL provide mechanisms for
744   unbinding old authenticators and binding a new authenticator at FAL3.
