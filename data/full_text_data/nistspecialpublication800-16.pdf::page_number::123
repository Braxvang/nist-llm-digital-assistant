Information Technology Security Training Requirements




       INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING MATRIX                                  — Cell 3.2D
 Training Area: System Life Cycle Security               — Development
 Functional Specialty: Implement & Operate

 Definition   —         The system life cycle is a model for building and operating an IT system
                        from its initial inception to its termination and disposal of assets. The
                        model includes six phases: Initiation, Development, Test and Evaluation,
                        Implementation, Operations, and Termination. Life cycle security is the
                        ensemble of processes and procedures which ensures data confidentiality, as
                        needed, as well as data and system integrity, and availability.


                        The development phase is the series of steps followed to ensure that
                        security requirements are considered, resolved, and incorporated as
                        information systems and technologies are developed or changed.

 Behavioral Outcome          —    Individuals responsible for system implementation or operation are
                                  able to assemble, integrate, and install systems so that the
                                  functionality and effectiveness of safeguards can be tested and
                                  evaluated.

 Sample Learning Objectives —

 At the conclusion of this module, individuals will be able to:

 1.    Beginning   —   Install and operate the IT systems in a test configuration in a manner that

       does not alter the program code or compromise security safeguards.


 2.    Intermediate   — Analyze system performance           for potential security problems (e.g., failure
       to update access control tables, corrupted data).


 3.    Advanced    — Provide      direction to system developers regarding correction of security
       problems identified during testing.
