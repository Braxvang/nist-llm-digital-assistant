                                                                          GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


much more than it is with IPv4 today for initial IPv6 use. IPsec is covered in detail in Section 5.3.

Network reconnaissance is typically the first step taken by an attacker to identify assets for exploitation
(RFC 5157).8 Reconnaissance attacks in an IPv6 environment differ dramatically from current IPv4
environments. Due to the size of IPv6 subnets (264 in a typical IPv6 environment compared to 28 in a
typical IPv4 environment), traditional IPv4 scanning techniques that would normally take seconds could
take years on a properly designed IPv6 network. This does not mean that reconnaissance attacks will go
away in an IPv6 environment; it is more likely that the tactics used for network reconnaissance will be
modified. Attackers will still be able to use passive techniques, such as Domain Name System (DNS)
name server resolution, to identify victim networks for more targeted exploitation. Additionally, if an
attacker is able to obtain access to one system on an IPv6 subnet, the attacker will be able to leverage
IPv6 neighbor discovery to identify hosts on the local subnet for exploitation. Neighbor discovery-based
attacks will also replace counterparts on IPv4 such as ARP spoofing.

Prevention of unauthorized access to IPv6 networks will likely be more difficult in the early years of IPv6
deployments. IPv6 adds more components to be filtered than IPv4, such as extension headers, multicast
addressing, and increased use of ICMP. These extended capabilities of IPv6, as well as the possibility of
an IPv6 host having a number of global IPv6 addresses, potentially provides an environment that will
make network-level access easier for attackers due to improper deployment of IPv6 access controls.
Moreover, security related tools and accepted best practices have been slow to accommodate IPv6. Either
these items do not exist or have not been stress tested in an IPv6 environment. Nevertheless, global
aggregation of IPv6 addresses by ISPs should allow enhanced anti-spoofing filtering across the Internet
where implemented.

Attacks that focus on exploitation above the IP layer, such as application-based attacks and viruses, will
not see a difference in the types of threats faced in an IPv6 environment. Most likely, some worms will
use modified IPv6 reconnaissance techniques for exploitation. Additionally, because many IPv4
broadcast capabilities have been replaced with IPv6 multicast functionality, broadcast amplification
attacks will no longer exist in an IPv6 environment.

From this comparison of IPv4 and IPv6 threats, one can surmise that IPv6 will not inherently be either
more or less secure than IPv4. While organizations are in the process of deploying IPv6, the lack of
robust IPv6 security controls (described in Section 6) and a lack of overall understanding of IPv6 by
security staff may allow attackers to exploit IPv6 assets or leverage IPv6 access to further exploit IPv4
assets. There is a very likely possibility that many IPv6 services will rely on tunneling IPv6 traffic in
IPv4 for infrastructures that do support the protocol, which will also increase the complexity for security
staff. Additionally, since IPv6 systems and capabilities are not yet widely used in production
environments, there is a distinct possibility that the number of vulnerabilities in software from
implementing IPv6 capabilities could rise, as IPv6 networks are increasingly deployed.

Based on of the threat comparison between IPv4 and IPv6, the following actions are recommended to
mitigate IPv6 threats during the deployment process:

 Apply different types of IPv6 addressing (privacy addressing, unique local addressing, sparse
  allocation, etc) to limit access and knowledge of IPv6-addressed environments.
 Assign subnet and interface identifiers randomly to increase the difficulty of network scanning.
