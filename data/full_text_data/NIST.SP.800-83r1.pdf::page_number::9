                                 GUIDE TO MALWARE INCIDENT PREVENTION AND HANDLING FOR DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS


Organizations should incorporate malware incident prevention and handling into their awareness
programs.

Organizations should implement awareness programs that include guidance to users on malware incident
prevention. All users should be made aware of the ways that malware enters and infects hosts, the risks
that malware poses, the inability of technical controls to prevent all incidents, and the importance of users
in preventing incidents, with an emphasis on avoiding social engineering attacks. Awareness programs
should also make users aware of policies and procedures that apply to malware incident handling, such as
how to identify if a host may be infected, how to report a suspected incident, and what users might need
to do to assist with incident handling. In addition, the organization should conduct awareness activities for
IT staff involved in malware incident prevention and provide training on specific tasks.

Organizations should have vulnerability mitigation capabilities to help prevent malware incidents.

Organizations should have documented policy, processes, and procedures to mitigate known
vulnerabilities that malware might exploit. Because a vulnerability usually can be mitigated through one
or more methods, organizations should use an appropriate combination of techniques, including security
automation technologies with security configuration checklists and patch management, and additional
host hardening measures so that effective techniques are readily available for various types of
vulnerabilities.

Organizations should have threat mitigation capabilities to assist in containing malware incidents.

Organizations should perform threat mitigation to detect and stop malware before it can affect its targets.
The most commonly used malware threat mitigation technical control is antivirus software; organizations
should deploy antivirus software on all hosts for which satisfactory antivirus software is available.
Additional technical controls that are helpful for malware threat mitigation include intrusion prevention
systems, firewalls, content filtering and inspection, and application whitelisting. The System and
Information Integrity family of security controls in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Recommended
Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, recommends having malware
protection mechanisms on various types of hosts, including workstations, servers, mobile computing
devices, firewalls, email servers, web servers, and remote access servers.

Organizations should consider using defensive architecture methods to reduce the impact of
malware incidents.

No matter how rigorous vulnerability and threat mitigation efforts are, malware incidents will still occur.
Organizations should consider altering the defensive architecture of their hostsâ€™ software to help mitigate
those incidents that still occur. One technique is sandboxing, which is a security model where applications
are run within a controlled environment that restricts what operations the applications can perform and
isolates them from other applications. Another technique is browser separation, which involves using
different web browsers for different types of website access (corporate applications, general access, etc.)
Finally, segregation through virtualization techniques separate applications or operating systems from
each other through the use of virtualization, such as having one OS instance for corporate applications
and another OS instance for all other activity.

Organizations should have a robust incident response process capability that addresses malware
incident handling.

As defined in NIST SP 800-61, Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, the incident response
process has four main phases: preparation, detection and analysis, containment/eradication/recovery, and
