A. Requirements must be prioritized to address the most pressing security
   investment needs first. Specific prioritization criteria will vary from agency to
   agency depending on specific agency mission and goals and applicable legislation
   and regulations. Priorities may be based on agency mission, Executive Branch
   guidance such as the President’s Management Agenda (PMA), OMB guidance, or
   other external/internal priorities. Examples of security priorities include certifying
   and accrediting all systems or implementing public key infrastructure (PKI)
   throughout the enterprise. It is important to note that OMB/Executive Branch
   guidance or laws should be ranked highest among these priorities.
