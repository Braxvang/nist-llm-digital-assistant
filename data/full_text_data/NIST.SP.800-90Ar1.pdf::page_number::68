       1. status: The status returned from Hash_df. The status will indicate SUCCESS or
          ERROR_FLAG.
       2. requested_bits: The result of performing the Hash_df.
    Hash_df Process:
       1. temp = the Null string.

                                                      Comment : In step 4.1, no_of_bits_to_return is used
                                                      as a 32-bit string.

             4.2 counter = counter + 1.
       5. requested_bits = leftmost (temp, no_of_bits_to_return).
       6. Return (SUCCESS, requested_bits).
    10.3.2      Derivation Function Using a Block Cipher Algorithm (Block_Cipher_df)

    This derivation function is used by the CTR_DRBG that is specified in Section 10.2. BCC and
    Block_Encrypt are discussed in Section 10.3.3. Let outlen be its output block length, which is a
    multiple of eight bits for the approved block cipher algorithms, and let keylen be the key length.
    The following or an equivalent process shall be used to derive the requested number of bits.
    Block_Cipher_df (input_string, no_of_bits_to_return):
       1. input_string: The string to be operated on. This string shall be a multiple of eight bits.
       2. no_of_bits_to_return: The number of bits to be returned by Block_Cipher_df. The
          maximum length (max_number_of_bits) is 512 bits for the currently approved block
          cipher algorithms.
    Output:
       1. status: The status returned from Block_Cipher_df. The status will indicate SUCCESS or
          ERROR_FLAG.
       2. requested_bits: The result of performing the Block_Cipher_df.
    Block_Cipher_df Process:
       1. If (number_of_bits_to_return > max_number_of_bits), then return an ERROR_FLAG
          and a Null string.
