OT Discussion: Example compensating controls include providing increased personnel security
and auditing. The organization carefully considers the appropriateness of a single individual
performing multiple critical roles.

 (10)       EXECUTING PRIVILEGED FUNCTIONS

OT Discussion: Example compensating controls include providing increased personnel security
and auditing. The organization carefully considers the appropriateness of a single individual
having multiple critical privileges. System privilege models may be tailored to enforce integrity
and availability (e.g., lower privileges include read access, and higher privileges include write
access).
Control Enhancement: (1) (2) (3) (5) (9) OT Discussion: When OT components (e.g., PLCs)
cannot support the logging of privileged functions, other system components within the
authorization boundary may be used (e.g., engineering workstations or physical access
monitoring).
Control Enhancement: (7) No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (10) OT Discussion: Example compensating controls include enhanced
auditing.
