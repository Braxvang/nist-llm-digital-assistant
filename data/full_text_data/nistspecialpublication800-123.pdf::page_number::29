                                                                           GUIDE TO GENERAL SERVER SECURITY



 Check the Organization’s Password Policy—Set account passwords appropriately. Elements that
  may be addressed in a password policy include the following:

    –   Length—a minimum length for passwords.

    –   Complexity—the mix of characters required. An example is requiring passwords to contain
        uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and nonalphabetic characters, and to not contain “dictionary”
        words.

    –   Aging—how long a password may remain unchanged. Many policies require users and
        administrators to change their passwords periodically. In such cases, the frequency should be
        determined by the enforced length and complexity of the password, the sensitivity of the
        information protected, and the exposure level of passwords. If aging is required, consideration
        should be given to enforcing a minimum aging duration to prevent users from rapidly cycling
        through password changes to clear out their password history and bypass reuse restrictions.

    –   Reuse—whether a password may be reused. Some users try to defeat a password aging
        requirement by changing the password to one they have used previously. If reuse is prohibited by
        policy, it is beneficial, if possible, to ensure that users cannot change their passwords by merely
        appending characters to the beginning or end of their original passwords (e.g., original password
        was “mysecret” and is changed to “1mysecret” or “mysecret1”).

    –   Authority—who is allowed to change or reset passwords and what sort of proof is required
        before initiating any changes.

    –   Password Security—how passwords should be secured, such as not storing passwords
        unencrypted on the server, and requiring administrators to use different passwords for their server
        administration accounts than their other administration accounts.

 Configure Computers to Prevent Password Guessing—It is relatively easy for an unauthorized
  user to try to gain access to a computer by using automated software tools that attempt all passwords.
  If the OS provides the capability, configure it to increase the period between login attempts with each
  unsuccessful attempt. If that is not possible, the alternative is to deny login after a limited number of
  failed attempts (e.g., three). Typically, the account is “locked out” for a period of time (such as 30
  minutes) or until a user with appropriate authority reactivates it.

    The choice to deny login is another situation that requires the server administrator to make a decision
    that balances security and convenience. Implementing this recommendation can help prevent some
    kinds of attacks, but it can also allow an attacker to use failed login attempts to prevent user access,
    resulting in a DoS condition. The risk of DoS from account lockout is much greater if the server is
    externally accessible and an attacker knows or can surmise a pattern to your naming convention that
    allows them to guess account names.

    Failed network login attempts should not prevent an authorized user or administrator from logging in at
    the console. Note that all failed login attempts, whether via the network or console, should be logged.
    If the server will not be administered remotely, disable the ability for the administrator or root level
    accounts to log in from the network.

 Install and Configure Other Security Mechanisms to Strengthen Authentication—If the
  information on the server requires it, consider using other authentication mechanisms such as
  biometrics, smart cards, client/server certificates, or one-time password systems. They can be more
