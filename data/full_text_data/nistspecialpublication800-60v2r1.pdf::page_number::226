Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
criminal rehabilitation information is low.

D.19 General Sciences and Innovation
General Science and Innovation includes all Federal activities to meet the national need to
advance knowledge in this area. This includes general research and technology programs, space
exploration activities, and other research and technology programs that have diverse goals and
cannot be readily classified into another mission area or information type.

D.19.1 Scientific and Technological Research and Innovation Information Type

Scientific and Technological Research and Innovation includes all federal activities whose goal
is the creation of new scientific and/or technological knowledge as a goal in itself, without a
specific link to the other mission areas or information types identified in the BRM. Most
sensitive information is developed under research and development programs that directly
support another of the mission areas described in this Appendix and are not included here. Some
information associated with scientific and technical research and innovation is national security
information and is outside the scope of this guideline. The recommended provisional
categorization for the scientific and technical research and innovation information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Moderate), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of scientific and
technical research and innovation information on the ability of responsible agencies to create
new scientific and/or technological knowledge as a goal in itself, without a specific link to other
program areas or information types. Many scientific and technical research and innovation
activities are conducted in association with public institutions of higher learning, and the findings
resulting from those activities are intended for publication.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The pre-publication disclosure or
other unauthorized disclosure of information associated with competition for funding and
recognition (e.g., grants, development contract, patent rights, and copyrights) can have a serious
adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. In such cases, the
confidentiality impact level associated for scientific and technical research and innovation
information will be moderate.

In some cases, the information associated with scientific and technical research and innovation is
classified or otherwise qualified as national security information. Such information is outside
the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most scientific and technical research and innovation information is low.
