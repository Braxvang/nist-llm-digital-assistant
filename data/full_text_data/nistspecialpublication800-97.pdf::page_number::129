                                   ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



The team agreed that the need for immediate security coupled with the diversity of equipment and
configurations meant that an upgrade could not happen in one step; there would need to be an interim
solution before they could upgrade to the end state.

9.2.1   Phase 1: Initiation

The first step was to inventory the existing WLAN infrastructure, which had grown without a cohesive
plan or tight configuration management. A survey found that computers with WLAN client software
could support TKIP (although few were using it), while only a few could support CCMP. The IT
department managed four ESSs and two BSSs collectively supported by 14 APs with varying capabilities
and security configurations. The ESS that supported the IT department used a RADIUS-based AAA
server for authentication based on smart cards with PKI certificates. The smart card solution also
provided physical access control for the server room and logical access control for several network
management consoles. Figure 9-2 depicts the network prior to the migration. Table 9-1 lists a summary
of the AP inventory for Figure 9-2.
