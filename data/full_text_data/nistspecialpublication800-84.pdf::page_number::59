                                   GUIDE TO TEST, TRAINING, AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR IT PLANS AND CAPABILITIES



The scenario is developed by the functional exercise team during the Development Phase. Scenario
documentation may include a brief Scenario Background designed to provide participants a sense of the
world/local situation in the weeks or months before the start of the exercise. This information will be
provided to participants in briefings before the exercise or at the beginning of the exercise event. The
scenario itself portrays the events that will occur during the conduct of the event. These events will also
become a part of the Master Scenario Events List and will be introduced into exercise play in the form of
Injects.

SAMPLE SCENARIO BACKGROUND

D-Day Minus 20

International tensions have dramatically risen overseas involving strategic interests of the United States.
Despite attempts to resolve disputes diplomatically, troops from hostile countries deploy and appear
poised to make a major military incursion against nations allied to the United States. U.S. intelligence
agencies also detect documented attempts by hostile nations to destabilize the governments and
economies of allies, which would have an adverse impact on U.S. military and economic interests in the
region.

D-Day Minus 10

As tensions continued to build, hostile entities undertake small-scale military operations against allied and
U.S. interests overseas. A U.S. reconnaissance plane is shot down and the bodies of the dead crew are
displayed on television. An emergency Cabinet meeting is called and it is decided that the U.S. military
will deploy to the region to protect allied governments and U.S. interests. It is anticipated that an initial
operational capability to defend U.S. interests will not be complete until next month.

D-Day Minus 5

In response to the U.S. declaration to send troops and materiel to the region, hostile nations vow to take
whatever actions are necessary to “strike a vicious blow against the American imperialists.” They state
that any war that the U.S. provokes will also be fought on the American homeland. U.S. intelligence
agencies soon detect an increase of cyber attacks against U.S. and threats to carry out terrorist attacks
against the U.S. government. Intelligence also indicates that hostile foreign interests within the U.S. are
increasingly active and terrorist cells in other countries have been activated to potentially carry out attacks
against the U.S., both overseas and within U.S. borders. U.S. government officials suspect that the hostile
nations hope to weaken U.S. public support and impede the military’s capability to deploy by engaging in
actions that might include the use of weapons of mass destruction and cyberterrorism. Nevertheless, the
U.S. military continues to deploy to the region.
