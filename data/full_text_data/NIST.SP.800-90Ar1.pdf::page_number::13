NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                         Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


                             2. The generation of keying material, or
                             3. A digital signature computation or verification.
Deterministic Algorithm   An algorithm that, given the same inputs, always produces the
                          same outputs.
Deterministic Random      An RBG that includes a DRBG mechanism and (at least
Bit Generator (DRBG)      initially) has access to a randomness source. The DRBG
                          produces a sequence of bits from a secret initial value called a
                          seed, along with other possible inputs. A DRBG is often
                          called a Pseudorandom Number (or Bit) Generator. Contrast
                          with NRBG.
DRBG Mechanism            The portion of an RBG that includes the functions necessary
                          to instantiate and uninstantiate the RBG, generate
                          pseudorandom bits, (optionally) reseed the RBG and test the
                          health of the the DRBG mechanism.
DRBG Mechanism            A conceptual boundary that is used to explain the operations
Boundary                  of a DRBG mechanism and its interaction with and relation to
                          other processes. (See min-entropy.)

Entropy                   A measure of the disorder, randomness or variability in a
                          closed system. Min-entropy is the measure used in this
                          Recommendation.
Entropy Input             An input bitstring that provides an assessed minimum amount
                          of unpredictability for a DRBG mechanism. (See min-
                          entropy.)

Entropy Source            A combination of a noise source (e.g., thermal noise or hard
                          drive seek times), health tests, and an optional conditioning
                          component. The entropy source produces random bitstrings to
                          be used by an RBG.
Equivalent Process        Two processes are equivalent if, when the same values are
                          input to each process, the same output is produced.
Exclusive-or              A mathematical operation; the symbol ⊕, defined as:
                               0⊕0=0                    1⊕0=1
                               0⊕1=1                    1⊕1=0
                          Equivalent to binary addition without carry.

Fresh Entropy             A bitstring output from an entropy source, an NRBG or a
                          DRBG that has access to a Live Entropy Source that is being
                          used to provide prediction resistance.
Full Entropy              For the purposes of this Recommendation, a source of full-
                          entropy bitstrings serves as a practical approximation to a
