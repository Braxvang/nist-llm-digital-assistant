ID and object class bits if their identifiers are encoded in an EPC identifier format. Figure 5-1 shows an
example 96-bit EPC and how it can be parsed into the four aforementioned, individual fields.

Tags must have programmable identifiers to support the control. Even tags that are designed to support
standard tag formats can still be assigned non-standard identifiers in the field. However, some tags have
factory-initialized identifiers that cannot be modified after manufacture.

Applicability: Any applications in which the implementing organization determines that the revelation
of a tag’s identifier is a business intelligence risk.

Benefits: Adversaries cannot obtain information about tagged items from the identifier alone.

Weaknesses:

 The use of non-revealing identifier precludes an organization from realizing benefits that come from
  standard identifier formats that reveal organization and item type information. For example, standard
  identifier formats are particularly advantageous when designing and maintaining distributed databases
  in inter-enterprise systems. Lookup and query functions are much easier in such databases when the
  identifiers provide information on where item data is located.
 If identifiers are assigned randomly, then a potential exists that two tags may be assigned the same
  identifier. The likelihood of such an event is very small, but it could lead to errors in the supported
  business process. 45
 If there is logic in how the identifiers are assigned, an adversary may uncover the method that is used,
  which would defeat the control. For example, an adversary knows that an identifier was assigned to a
  certain item and that all items of that type were assigned sequentially, then the adversary may be able
  to deduce the approximate range of identifiers that correspond to items of that type. Similarly, when
  identifiers are serialized, the adversary may be able to deduce the approximate time of the assignment
  based on the identifier.
5.2.8     Fallback Identification System

Control: A fallback identification system provides an alternative means to identify, authenticate, or
verify an object when the RFID system is unavailable or an individual tag is inoperable. Options include
text labels and AIDC technology such as bar codes. 46 The fallback may consist of just an identifier, or it
may also include additional data about the tagged object. The fallback system is accompanied by
standard operating procedures and operator training to ensure that personnel know when and how to use
it.

45
     When two tags are assigned the same identifier, the event is called a collision. If identifiers are randomly assigned, a
     collision is expected after approximately the square root of the total number of possible identifiers. Therefore, in the case of
     a 96-bit EPC, a collision is expected after approximately 248 tags, which is an enormous number not likely to be encountered
     in most RFID applications.
46
     If the RFID application’s objective is to provide security or authentication, then a fallback technology such as holograms or
     other optical security features may be used.
