    3.14 Random Excursions Test
    This test is based on considering successive sums of the binary bits (plus or minus simple ones) as a one-
    dimensional random walk. The test detects deviations from the distribution of the number of visits of the
    random walk to a certain “state,” i.e., any integer value.

    Consider the random walk Sk = X1 + … + Xk as a sequence of excursions to and from zero

                                    (i,…,l) : Si−1 = Sl +1 = 0,Sk ≠ 0 for1 ≤ k ≤ l .
    Let J denote the total number of such excursions in the string. The limiting distribution for this (random)
    number J (i.e., the number of zeros among the sums Sk, k = 1, 2, …, n when S0 = 0) is known to be

                                               
                                                     ∫ e du,z > 0 .

    The test rejects the randomness hypothesis immediately if J is too small, i.e., if the following P-value is
    small:

                                P ( J < J(obs)) ≈           ∫
                                                          π o
                                                              e        du = P  ,
                                                                               2 2n 
                                                                                            .


    If J < max(0.005 n,500) , the randomness hypothesis is rejected. Otherwise the number of visits of the
    random walk S to a certain state is evaluated.
