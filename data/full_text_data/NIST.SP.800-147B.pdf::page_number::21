Appendix Aâ€” Summary of Requirements

This appendix contains a summary of the secure BIOS update guidelines for system BIOS
implementations found in Section 3. These guidelines are intended for platform vendors designing,
implementing, or selecting a system BIOS implementation. Readers should consult the relevant sections
in the main body of this document for additional informative text that further describes the intent and
context of the guidelines.

1. BIOS Update Authentication
    1-A     Authenticated BIOS update mechanisms shall be implemented in an RTU (see Section 2.5).
    1-B     The Verification Component of the RTU shall contain the digital signature verification
            algorithm and a key store. The key store shall include the public key needed to verify the
            signature of the BIOS update image or an approved cryptographic hash [FIPS180-4] of the key.
            In the latter case, the update mechanism shall hash the public key provided with the BIOS
            update image and ensure that it matches a hash which appears in the key store before using the
            provided public key to verify the signature on the BIOS update image.

    1-C     BIOS images shall be signed in conformance with NIST SP 800-89, Recommendation for
            Obtaining Assurances for Digital Signature Applications [SP800-89], using an approved
            digital signature algorithm as specified in NIST FIPS 186-4, Digital Signature Standard
            [FIPS186-4], that provides at least 112 bits of security strength, in accordance with NIST SP
            800-131A, Transitions: Recommendation for Transitioning the Use of Cryptographic
            Algorithms and Key Lengths [SP800-131A].
    1-D     Authenticated update mechanisms shall ensure that BIOS update images have been digitally
            signed and that the digital signature can be verified using a key stored or verified the RTU
            before updating the BIOS.
    1-E     Recovery mechanisms should also use an authenticated update mechanism, unless the recovery
            process meets the guidelines for a secure local update.
    1-F     The system should provide mechanisms capable of preventing unauthorized update of the
            BIOS to an earlier authentic version.

2. Secure Local Update (Optional)
    Servers may optionally include a secure local update mechanism, where physical presence authorizes
    installation of BIOS update images without necessarily using the authenticated update mechanisms.
    2-A     Secure local update mechanisms shall authorize and authenticate the BIOS update image by
            requiring that an administrator physically touch the server itself to conduct the update.

3. Integrity Protection
    3-A     The integrity of the system BIOS shall be maintained between the verification of the system
            BIOS by the RTU, and the execution of the system BIOS during the boot process.
    3-B     System flash memory containing BIOS, excluding configuration data based by the system
            BIOS that is stored in non-volatile memory, should be protected from modifications outside the
            authenticated BIOS update mechanisms.
          3-B.i     If implemented, BIOS flash protections shall be engaged prior to execution of code
                    outside the RTU.
