       December 2022                                                       Federation and Assertions


1970         owned by the patient, while some data is only updated by a hospital or doctor’s
1971         practice.
1972       • Provide users with the ability to easily verify, view, and update attributes. Identities
1973         and user roles are dynamic and not static; they change over time (e.g., age, health,
1974         and financial data). The ability to update attributes or make attribute release
1975         decisions may or may not be offered at the same time. Ensure the process for how
1976         users can change attributes is well known, documented, and easy to perform.
1977       • Provide users means for updating data, even if the associated entity no longer exists.
1978       • Provide users means to delete their identities completely, removing all information
1979         about themselves, including transaction history. Consider applicable audit, legal, or
1980         policy constraints that may preclude such action. In certain cases, full deactivation
1981         is more appropriate than deletion.
1982       • Provide users with clear, easy-to-find, site/application data retention policy
1983         information.
1984       • Provide users with appropriate anonymity and pseudonymity options, and the
1985         ability to switch among such identity options as desired, in accordance with an
1986         organization’s data access policies.
1987       • Provide means for users to manage each IdP to RP connection, including complete
1988         separation as well as the removal of RP access to one or more attributes.

1989   10.2.2. User Perspectives of Trust and Beneﬁts
1990   Many factors can influence user adoption of federated identity systems. As with any
1991   technology, users may value some factors more than others. Users often weigh perceived
1992   benefits versus risks before making technology adoption decisions. It is critical that
1993   IdPs and RPs provide users with sufficient information to enable them to make informed
1994   decisions. The concepts of trust and tiers of trust — fundamental principles in federated
1995   identity systems — can drive user adoption. Finally, a positive user experience may also
1996   result in increased user demand for federation, triggering increased adoption by RPs.
1997   This sub-section is focused primarily on user trust and user perceptions of benefits versus
1998   risks.
1999   To encourage user adoption, IdPs and RPs need to establish and build trust with users and
2000   provide them with an understanding of the benefits and risks of adoption. The following
2001   factors should be considered:
2002       • Allow users to control their information disclosure and provide explicit consent
2003         through the appropriate use of notifications (see Sec. 9.2). Balancing the content,
2004         size, and frequency of notifications is necessary to avoid thoughtless user click-
2005         through.
