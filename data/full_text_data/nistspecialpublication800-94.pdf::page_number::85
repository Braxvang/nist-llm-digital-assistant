                                                   GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



8.     Using and Integrating Multiple IDPS Technologies

As Sections 4 through 7 have explained, the four primary types of IDPS technologies—network-based,
wireless, network behavior analysis (NBA), and host-based—each offer fundamentally different
information gathering, logging, detection, and prevention capabilities. Each technology type offers
benefits over the other, such as detecting some events that the others cannot, detecting some events with
significantly greater accuracy than the other technologies, and performing in-depth analysis without
significantly impacting the performance of the protected hosts. Accordingly, organizations should
consider using multiple types of IDPS technologies to achieve more comprehensive and accurate
detection and prevention of malicious activity, with lower rates of false positives and false negatives.
This section provides guidance on using multiple IDPS technologies to create a broader IDPS solution
and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using multiple technologies.

Organizations that are planning to use multiple types of IDPS technologies, or even multiple products
within a single IDPS technology class, should consider whether or not the IDPS products should be
integrated in some way, either working together directly or feeding their data into a centralized logging
system or security information and event management system. This section explains how different IDPS
products can be integrated, and the benefits and limitations of the integration methods. It also provides
overviews of other technologies that complement IDPS technologies and discusses how they can be
included in an IDPS solution to further improve detection and prevention.

8.1    The Need for Multiple IDPS Technologies

In many environments, a robust IDPS solution cannot be achieved without using multiple types of IDPS
technologies. For example, network-based IDPSs cannot monitor wireless protocols, and wireless IDPSs
cannot monitor application protocol activity. Table 8-1 provides a high-level comparison of the four
primary IDPS technology types. The strengths listed in the table indicate the roles or situations in which
each technology type is generally superior to the others. A particular technology type may have
additional benefits over others, such as logging additional data that would be useful for validating alerts
recorded by other IDPSs, or preventing intrusions that other IDPSs cannot because of technology
capabilities or placement (e.g., on the host instead of on the network).
