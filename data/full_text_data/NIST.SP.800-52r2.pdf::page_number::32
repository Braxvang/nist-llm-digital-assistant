NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                                                   GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


attacks by binding the master secret to a hashed log of the full handshake. The server shall
support the use of this extension.

3.4.1.4 Signature Algorithms

Applies to TLS versions: 1.2, 1.3

Servers shall support the processing of the signature algorithms extension received in a
ClientHello message. The extension, its syntax, and processing rules are described in Sections
7.4.1.4.1, 7.4.2, and 7.4.3 of RFC 5246 [25] and Section 4.2.3 of RFC 8446 [57]. Note that the
extension described in RFC 8446 updates the extension described in RFC 5246 by adding an
additional signature scheme.

3.4.1.5 Certificate Status Request

Applies to TLS versions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3

When the client wishes to receive the revocation status of the TLS server certificate from the
TLS server, the client includes the Certificate Status Request (status_request) extension in the
ClientHello message. Upon receipt of the status_request extension, a server with a certificate
issued by a CA that supports OCSP shall include the certificate status along with its certificate
by sending a CertificateStatus message immediately following the Certificate message. 25 While
the extension itself is extensible, only OCSP-type certificate status is defined in [29]. This
extension is also called OCSP stapling.

3.4.2     Conditional TLS Extensions

Support the use of the following TLS extensions under the circumstances described in the
following subsections:

     1. The Fallback Signaling Cipher Suite Value (SCSV) shall be supported if the server
        supports versions of TLS prior to TLS 1.2 and does not support TLS 1.3.
     2. The Supported Groups extension shall be supported if the server supports ephemeral
        ECDH cipher suites or if the server supports TLS 1.3.
     3. The Key Share extension shall be supported if the server supports TLS 1.3.
     4. The EC Point Format extension shall be supported if the server supports EC cipher
        suites.
     5. The Multiple Certificate Status extension should be supported if status information for
        the serverâ€™s certificate is available via OCSP and the extension is supported by the server
        implementation.
     6. The Trusted CA Indication extension shall be supported if the server communicates with
        memory-constrained clients (e.g., low-memory client devices in the Internet of Things)
        and the server has been issued certificates by multiple CAs.



25 In TLS 1.3, the server includes the certificate status in the Certificate message.
