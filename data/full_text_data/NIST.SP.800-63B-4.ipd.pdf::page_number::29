      NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines

769   For the Password-based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) [SP800-132], the cost
770   factor is an iteration count: the more times the PBKDF2 function is iterated, the longer it
771   takes to compute the password hash. Therefore, the iteration count SHOULD be as large
772   as verification server performance will allow, typically at least 10,000 iterations.
773   In addition, verifiers SHOULD perform an additional iteration of a keyed hashing or
774   encryption operation using a secret key known only to the verifier. This key value, if used,
775    SHALL be generated by an approved random bit generator [SP800-90Ar1] and provide at
776   least the minimum security strength specified in the latest revision of NIST SP 800-131A,
777   Transitioning the Use of Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Lengths [SP800-131A] (112
778   bits as of the date of this publication). The secret key value SHALL be stored separately
779   from the hashed memorized secrets (e.g., in a specialized device like a hardware security
780   module). With this additional iteration, brute-force attacks on the hashed memorized
781   secrets are impractical as long as the secret key value remains secret.

782   5.1.2. Look-Up Secrets
783   A look-up secret authenticator is a physical or electronic record that stores a set of secrets
784   shared between the claimant and the CSP. The claimant uses the authenticator to look
785   up the appropriate secrets needed to respond to a prompt from the verifier. For example,
786   the verifier could ask a claimant to provide a specific subset of the numeric or character
787   strings printed on a card in table format. A common application of look-up secrets is
788   the use of one-time “recovery keys” stored by the subscriber for use in the event another
789   authenticator is lost or malfunctions. A look-up secret is something you have.

790   5.1.2.1. Look-Up Secret Authenticators
791   CSPs creating look-up secret authenticators SHALL use an approved random bit
792   generator [SP800-90Ar1] to generate the list of secrets and SHALL deliver the
793   authenticator securely to the subscriber. Look-up secrets SHALL have at least 20 bits
794   of entropy.
795   Look-up secrets MAY be distributed by the CSP in person, by postal mail to the
796   subscriber’s address of record, or by online distribution. If distributed online, look-
797   up secrets SHALL be distributed over a secure channel in accordance with the post-
798   enrollment binding requirements in Sec. 6.1.2.
799   If the authenticator uses look-up secrets sequentially from a list, the subscriber MAY
800   dispose of used secrets, but only after a successful authentication.

801   5.1.2.2. Look-Up Secret Veriﬁers
802   Verifiers of look-up secrets SHALL prompt the claimant for the next secret from
803   their authenticator or for a specific (e.g., numbered) secret. A given secret from an
804   authenticator SHALL be used successfully only once. If the look-up secret is derived
805   from a grid card, each cell of the grid SHALL be used only once.
