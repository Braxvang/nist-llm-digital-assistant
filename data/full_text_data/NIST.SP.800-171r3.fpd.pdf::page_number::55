       NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                      Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
       November 2023

1460                  3. Modify access authorization to correspond with any changes in operational need.

1461           DISCUSSION
1462           Security-related system property includes hardware authentication tokens, system administration
1463           technical manuals, keys, identification cards, and building passes. Exit interviews ensure that
1464           terminated individuals understand the security constraints imposed by being former employees
1465           and that accountability is achieved for the organizational property. Security topics at exit
1466           interviews include reminding individuals of potential limitations on future employment and
1467           nondisclosure agreements. Exit interviews may not always be possible for some individuals,
1468           including in cases related to the unavailability of supervisors, illnesses, or job abandonment.
1469           The timely execution of termination actions is essential for individuals who have been terminated
1470           for cause. Organizations may consider disabling the accounts of individuals who are being
1471           terminated prior to the individuals being notified. This requirement applies to the reassignment or
1472           transfer of individuals when the personnel action is permanent or of such extended duration as to
1473           require protection. Protections that may be required for transfers or reassignments to other
1474           positions within organizations include returning old and issuing new identification cards, keys,
1475           and building passes; changing system access authorizations (i.e., privileges); closing system
1476           accounts and establishing new accounts; and providing access to official records to which
1477           individuals had access at previous work locations in previous system accounts.

1482   3.10.1. Physical Access Authorizations
1483             REQUIREMENT: 03.10.01
1484             a. Develop, approve, and maintain a list of individuals with authorized access to the physical
1485                location where the system resides.
1486             b. Issue authorization credentials for physical access.
1487             c.    Review the physical access list periodically.
1488             d. Remove individuals from the physical access list when access is no longer required.

1489             DISCUSSION
1490             A facility can include one or more physical locations containing systems or system components
1491             that process, store, or transmit CUI. Physical access authorizations apply to employees and
1492             visitors. Individuals with permanent physical access authorization credentials are not considered
1493             visitors. Authorization credentials include identification badges, identification cards, and smart
1494             cards. Organizations determine the strength of the authorization credentials consistent with
1495             applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.
1496             Physical access authorizations may not be necessary to access certain areas within facilities that
1497             are designated as publicly accessible.
