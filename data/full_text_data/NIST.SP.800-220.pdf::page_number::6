The question of when a large-scale quantum computer will be built is a complicated one. In the
past, it was less clear that large quantum computers were a physical possibility, but many scientists
now believe it to be merely a significant engineering challenge. Some engineers even predict that,
within the next 20 years, sufficiently large quantum computers will be built to break essentially all
public-key schemes currently in use. Historically, it has taken decades to deploy modern public-key
cryptography infrastructures, so efforts to prepare information security systems that are resistant
to quantum computing must begin now.
Motivated by these considerations, NIST is in the process of selecting public-key (quantum-
resistant) cryptographic algorithms through a public, competition-like process. The intent is for
new public-key cryptography standards to specify one or more additional unclassified, publicly-
disclosed digital signature, public-key encryption, and key-establishment algorithms. These
algorithms will be available worldwide and capable of protecting sensitive government information
well into the foreseeable future, including after the advent of quantum computers.
In Fiscal Year (FY) 2021, NIST continued evaluating the 15 algorithms still in the third round of
analysis. NIST mathematicians and computer scientists consider these algorithms the strongest
candidates for standardization. The list includes seven “finalists” for public-key encryption, key-
establishment, and digital signature algorithms, as well as eight “alternates", which will likely need
another round of evaluation. (The complete list is available on the NIST PQC website and is
described in the Status Report on the Second Round of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography
Standardization Process, NISTIR [NIST Interagency or Internal Report] 8309). In June 2021, NIST
(virtually) held its third Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Conference. Each candidate
team gave updates on their algorithms, and several researchers also presented their results.
In 2022, NIST expects to announce the algorithms that will be standardized and those that will
be studied in a fourth round. NIST is also planning to issue a new Call for Proposals for public-
key digital signature schemes to diversify its signature portfolio. This accomplishment represents
several years of intensive research and industry collaboration. NIST appreciates the input of all
submitters and those providing comments during the evaluation process.
Lightweight Cryptography
NIST has initiated a lightweight cryptography standardization process to solicit, evaluate, and
standardize lightweight Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) and hashing
schemes suitable for use in constrained environments where the requirements and performance
of the currently approved NIST cryptographic algorithms are not acceptable. In August 2018,
NIST published a Federal Register notice that specified the technical requirements for the target
cryptographic algorithms and explained the evaluation criteria and a tentative timeline. The
standardization process consists of multiple rounds, where, in each round, the field is narrowed to
focus on the most promising candidates. In April 2019, NIST announced 56 first-round candidates,
and after four months of evaluation, 32 of these candidates proceeded to the second round of
evaluation.
The main goals of the standardization process during FY 2021 were to evaluate the security and
performance of the 32 second-round candidates and to select the finalists that would advance to the
last round of the evaluation. Additionally, NIST researchers continued to collaborate with the public
at international conferences such as the International Cryptographic Module Conference (ICMC
2021), the 2021 Security and Implementation of Lightweight Cryptography (SILC) Workshop, the
Cryptographer's Track at the RSA Conference (CT-RSA), and the Crypto 2021 Conference that
was organized by the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR).
