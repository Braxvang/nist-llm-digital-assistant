established at Tiers 1 or 2, they facilitate the consistent implementation of ISCM across the
organization and better support data reuse and judicious use of resources. Data collection,
analysis, and reporting are automated where possible. 12 Through the use of automation, it is
possible to monitor a greater number of security metrics with fewer resources, higher frequencies,
larger sample sizes,13 and with greater consistency and reliability than is feasible using manual
processes. Organizations regularly review the ISCM strategy to ensure that metrics continue to be
relevant, meaningful, actionable, and supportive of risk management decisions made by
organizational officials at all tiers.

     Care must be taken in determining how best to use security-related information from individual information
     systems in calculating organizational metrics for security and risk. Dashboards and metrics, designed to provide
     organizational situational awareness of security and risk, can provide a false sense of security if used without
     continued assurance of the relevance of the metrics.

     If an organization does not have the resources or infrastructure necessary to assess every relevant object within its
     information infrastructure, sampling is an approach that may be useful in reducing the level of effort associated
     with continuous monitoring. Additional information is provided in Section 3.1.4.
