CHAPTER 8                                                                              Security Planning


     • Agency experts in the common control areas identified have been consulted as
       part of the process.
    While the concept of security control partitioning into common security controls
and system-specific controls is straightforward and intuitive, the application of this
principle within an agency takes planning, coordination, and perseverance. If an
agency is just beginning to implement this approach or has only partially
implemented this approach, it may take some time to get the maximum benefits
from security control partitioning and the associated reuse of assessment evidence.
Because of the potential dependence on common security controls by many of an
agency's information systems, a failure of such common controls may result in a
significant increase in agency-level risk—risk that arises from operating the systems
that depend on these security controls.

8.5 Security Control Selection
    An agency must meet the minimum security requirements in FIPS 199 by
selecting the appropriate security controls and assurance requirements as described
in NIST SP 800-53. The process of selecting the appropriate security controls and
assurance requirements for agency information systems to achieve adequate
security 62 is a multifaceted, risk-based activity involving management and
operational personnel within the agency. Security categorization of federal
information and information systems, as required by FIPS 199, is the first step in the
risk management process. 63 Subsequent to the security categorization process, an
agency must select an appropriate set of security controls for their information
systems that satisfy the minimum security requirements set forth in FIPS 200. The
selected set of security controls must be one of three security control baselines from
NIST SP 800-53 (see Table 8-2) that are associated with the designated impact
levels of the agency information systems as determined during the security
categorization process.
     • For low-impact information systems, an agency must, at a minimum, use the
       security controls from the low baseline of security controls defined in NIST SP
       800-53 and must ensure that the minimum assurance requirements associated
       with the low baseline are satisfied.
     • For moderate-impact information systems, an agency must, at a minimum,
       employ the security controls from the moderate baseline of security controls
       defined in NIST SP 800-53 and must ensure that the minimum assurance
       requirements associated with the moderate baseline are satisfied.
     • For high-impact information systems, an agency must, at a minimum, use the
       security controls from the high baseline of security controls defined in NIST SP
       800-53 and must ensure that the minimum assurance requirements associated
       with the high baseline are satisfied.




62
   OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, defines adequate security as security commensurate with the risk
   and the magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of
   information.
63
   Security categorization must be accomplished as an enterprise-wide activity with the involvement of
   senior-level organizational officials including, but not limited to, CIOs, SAISOs, authorizing officials (also
   known as accreditation authorities), information system owners, and information owners. NIST SP 800-
   60 provides implementation guidance for FIPS 199.
