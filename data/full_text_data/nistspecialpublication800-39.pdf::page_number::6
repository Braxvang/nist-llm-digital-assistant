                 DEVELOPING COMMON INFORMATION SECURITY FOUNDATIONS
                             COLLABORATION AMONG PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES

  In developing standards and guidelines required by FISMA, NIST consults with other federal agencies
  and offices as well as the private sector to improve information security, avoid unnecessary and costly
  duplication of effort, and ensure that NIST publications are complementary with the standards and
  guidelines employed for the protection of national security systems. In addition to its comprehensive
  public review and vetting process, NIST is collaborating with the Office of the Director of National
  Intelligence (ODNI), the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Committee on National Security
  Systems (CNSS) to establish a common foundation for information security across the federal
  government. A common foundation for information security will provide the Intelligence, Defense, and
  Civil sectors of the federal government and their contractors, more uniform and consistent ways to
  manage the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the
  Nation that results from the operation and use of information systems. A common foundation for
  information security will also provide a strong basis for reciprocal acceptance of security assessment
  results and facilitate information sharing. NIST is also working with public and private sector entities
  to establish mappings and relationships between the security standards and guidelines developed by
  NIST and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and International Electrotechnical
  Commission (IEC).
