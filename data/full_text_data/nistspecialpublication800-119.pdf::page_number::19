                                                               GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


Section 4.4 describes Mobile IPv6 in detail.

  2.3.7   Quality of Service (QoS)

IP (for the most part) treats all packets alike, as they are forwarded with best effort treatment and no
guarantee for delivery through the network. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) adds delivery
confirmations but has no options to control parameters such as delay or bandwidth allocation. QoS offers
enhanced policy-based networking options to prioritize the delivery of information. Existing IPv4 and
IPv6 implementations use similar QoS capabilities, such as Differentiated Services and Integrated
Services, to identify and prioritize IP-based communications during periods of network congestion.
Within the IPv6 header two fields can be used for QoS, the Traffic Class and Flow Label fields. The new
Flow Label field and enlarged Traffic Class field in the main IPv6 header allow more efficient and finer
grained differentiation of various types of traffic. The new Flow Label field can contain a label
identifying or prioritizing a certain packet flow such as voice over IP (VoIP) or videoconferencing, both
of which are sensitive to timely delivery. IPv6 QoS is still a work in progress and security should be
given increased consideration in this stage of development. Section 4.3 describes QoS in detail.

  2.3.8   Route Aggregation

IPv6 incorporates a hierarchal addressing structure and has a simplified header allowing for improved
routing of information from a source to a destination. The large amount of address space allows
organizations with large numbers of connections to obtain blocks of contiguous address space.
Contiguous address space allows organizations to aggregate addresses under one prefix for identification
on the Internet. This structured approach to addressing reduces the amount of information Internet
routers must maintain and store and promotes faster routing of data77. Additionally, it is envisioned that
IPv6 addresses will primarily be allocated only from Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to customers. This
will allow for ISPs to summarize route advertisements to minimize the size of the IPv6 Internet routing
tables. This is covered in more detail in Section 3.2.

  2.3.9   Efficient Transmission

IPv6 packet fragmentation control occurs at the IPv6 source host, not at an intermediate IPv6 router.
With IPv4, a router can fragment a packet when the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the next link
is smaller than the packet it has to send. The router does this by slicing a packet to fit into the smaller
MTU and sends it out as a set of fragments. The destination host collects the fragments and reassembles
them. All fragments must arrive for the higher level protocol to get the packet. Therefore, when one
fragment is missing or an error occurs, the entire transmission has to be redone. In IPv6, a host uses a
procedure called Path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU) Discovery to learn the path MTU size and
eliminate the need for routers to perform fragmentation. The IPv6 Fragment Extension Header is used
when an IPv6 host wants to fragment a packet, so fragmentation occurs at the source host, not the router,
which allows efficient transmission. PMTU is discussed in Section 3.5.5, and Section 4.5 describes
efficient transmission in detail.

2.4   IPv4 and IPv6 Threat Comparison

The deployment of IPv6 can lead to new challenges with respect to the types of threats facing an
organization. This section provides a high-level overview as to how threats differ from an IPv4
environment to an IPv6 environment and combined IPv4-IPv6 environment. The following chapters
provide additional details to these threats as required. It should be noted that many IPv6 threat
discussions rely on IPsec to provide protection against attack. Due to issues with key management and
overall configuration complexity (including applications), it is possible that IPsec will not be deployed
