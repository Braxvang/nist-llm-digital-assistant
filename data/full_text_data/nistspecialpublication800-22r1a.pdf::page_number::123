F.1           Rank Computation of Binary Matrices

Apply elementary row operations where the addition operator is taken to be the exclusive-OR operation.
The matrices are reduced to upper triangular form using forward row operations, and the operation is
repeated in reverse in order using backward row operations in order to arrive at a matrix in triangular
form. The rank is then taken to be the number of nonzero rows in the resulting Gaussian reduced matrix.

Forward Application of Elementary Row Operations:

Let each element in the m by m matrix be designated as ai,j

1.      Set i = 1

2.      If element ai,i = 0 (i.e., the element on the diagonal ≠ 1), then swap all elements in the ith row
        with all elements in the next row that contains a one in the ith column (i.e., this row is the kth row,
        where i < k ≤ m) . If no row contains a “1” in this position, go to step 4.

3.      If element ai,i = 1 , then if any subsequent row contains a “1” in the ith column, replace each
        element in that row with the exclusive-OR of that element and the corresponding element in the
        ith row.

        a.      Set row = i + 1
        b.      Set col=i.
        c.      If arow,col = 0, then go to step 3g.
        d.          a row,col = a row,col ⊕ ai,col
        e.      If col=m, then go to step 3g.
        f.      col=col+1; go to step 3d.
        g.      If row = m, then go to step 4.
        h.      row=row+1; go to step 3b.

4.      If i<m-1, then i=i+1; go to step 2.

5.      Forward row operations completed.

Backward Application of Elementary Row Operations:

1.      Set i=m.

2.      If element ai,i = 0 (i.e., the element on the diagonal ≠ 1), then swap all elements in the ith row
        with all elements in the next row that contains a one in the ith column (i.e., this row is the kth row,
        where 1 ≤ k < i) . If no row contains a “1” in this position, go to step 4.

3.      If element ai,i = 1 , then if any preceding row contains a “1” in the ith column, replace each
        element in that row with the exclusive-OR of that element and the corresponding element in the
        ith row.
