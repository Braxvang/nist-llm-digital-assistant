  C   Appendix: VOIP Terms


      Application Level Gateway (ALG) – Application Level Gateways (ALGs) are
      application specific translation agents that allow an application (like VOIP) on a
      host in one address realm to connect to its counterpart running on a host in
      different realm transparently. An ALG may interact with NAT to set up state, use
      NAT state information, modify application specific payload and perform
      whatever else is necessary to get the application running across disparate address
      realms.

      Abstract syntax notation one (ASN.1): A standard, flexible method that (a)
      describes data structures for representing, encoding, transmitting, and decoding
      data, (b) provides a set of formal rules for describing the structure of objects
      independent of machine-specific encoding techniques, (c) is a formal network-
      management Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) language
      that uses human-readable notation and a compact, encoded representation of the
      same information used in communications protocols, and (d) is a precise, formal
      notation that removes ambiguities.

      Call Processor – component that sets up and monitors the state of calls, and
      provides phone number translation, user authorization, and coordination with
      media gateways.

      Codec – coder/decoder, which converts analog voice into digital data and back
      again, and may also compress and decompress the data for more efficient
      transmission.

      Firewall Control Proxy - component that controls a firewall’s handling of a call.
      The firewall control proxy can instruct the firewall to open specific ports that are
      needed by a call, and direct the firewall to close these ports at call termination.

      H.323 - The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) standard for packet-
      switched network voice and video calling and signaling.

      Jitter - non-uniform delays that can cause packets to arrive and be processed out
      of sequence

      Latency – time delay in processing voice packets.

      Media gateway - the interface between circuit switched networks and IP network.
      Media gateways handle analog/digital conversion, call origination and reception,
      and quality improvement functions such as compression or echo cancellation.
