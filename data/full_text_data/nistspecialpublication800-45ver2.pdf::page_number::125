                    Identify network services that will be provided or supported by the mail server
                    Identify users and categories of users of the mail server and determine privilege
                    for each category of user
                    Determine how the mail server will be managed (e.g., locally, remotely)
                    Identify user authentication methods for the mail server
                    Identify security or privacy requirements for email address-related information
                    Choose appropriate operating system for mail server
                    Minimal exposure to vulnerabilities
                    Ability to restrict administrative or root level activities to authorized users only
