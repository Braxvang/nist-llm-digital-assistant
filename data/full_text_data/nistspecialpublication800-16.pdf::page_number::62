                       IT Security Body of Knowledge Topics and Concepts

 6.   SENSmVITY
      An IT environment consists of the system, data, and applications which must be examined
      individually and in total. All FT systems and applications require some level of protection
      (to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability) which is determined by an evaluation

      of the sensitivity and criticality of the information processed, the relation of the system to
      the organization missions and the economic value of the system components.

         Confidentiality
         Integrity
         Availability
         Criticality
         Aggregation

 7.   RISK MANAGEMENT
      The on-going process of assessing the risk to FT resources and information, as part of a risk-
      based approach used to determine adequate security for a system, by analyzing the threats
      and vulnerabilities and selecting appropriate cost-effective controls to achieve and maintain
      an acceptable level of risk.
