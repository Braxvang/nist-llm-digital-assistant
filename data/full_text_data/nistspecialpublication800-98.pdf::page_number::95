#   OECD Privacy
                                   Definition                                    RFID Considerations
      Principle
                                                                 entities were responsible for which data elements at
                                                                 which time are critical to the success of data quality
                                                                 efforts.
3     Purpose        The purposes for which personal data        Organizations should be able to specify their own
    Specification    are collected should be specified not       purposes for collecting personal data but may not be
                     later than at the time of the data          able to determine the potential purposes of those
                     collection. Subsequent use should           engaged in surreptitious reading of tags. In some
                     be limited to the fulfillment of those      cases, even the existence of a tag could be used for
                     purposes. In the event subsequent           tracking or targeting purposes for which there are few
                     purposes arise, they should be              practical countermeasures.
                     specified on each occasion of change        RFID applications involving multiple enterprises
                     and compatible with the original            should be accompanied by an MOU or MOA clearly
                     purposes.                                   delineating the purposes for which RFID data may be
                                                                 used, as each party to the agreement may be
                                                                 unfamiliar with the potential purposes of other parties.
4   Use Limitation   Personal data should not be                 Similar to the collection limitation, organizations can
                     disclosed, made available or                enforce this principle on their own information
                     otherwise used for purposes other           systems but may find it challenging to prevent
                     than those specified.                       authorized parties from surreptitiously reading tags
                                                                 for other purposes.
5     Security       Personal data should be protected by        This document describes several security
     Safeguards      reasonable security safeguards              mechanisms for safeguarding personal data. The
                     against such risks as loss or               adequacy of any given set of safeguards needs to be
                     unauthorized access, destruction,           evaluated in the context of a particular RFID system.
                     use, modification or disclosure of
                     data.
6     Openness       There should be a general policy of         No characteristic of RFID technology prevents a
                     openness about developments,                general policy of openness although this principle
                     practices, and policies with respect to     may not be consistent with RFID applications
                     personal data. Means should be              supporting intelligence or law enforcement missions
                     readily available of establishing the       because of the secrecy required for their
                     existence and nature of personal            effectiveness.
                     data, the main purposes of their use,
                     as well as the identity and usual
                     residence of the data controller.
7     Individual     An individual should have the right to      Organizations should be able to design RFID
     Participation   learn whether a data controller has         systems consistent with this principle in most cases,
                     data relating to the individual, and, if    especially when the system manages sensitive PII
                     so, to obtain that data within a            data elements, such as a Social Security Number or
                     reasonable time period, at a charge         financial account number. The individual participation

                     intelligible form. If a request is denied   amount of data stored was relatively limited. In some
                     for some reason, the individual             applications, the nature of the data and the large

                     denial and be able to challenge the         individual participation is realistic. For example,
                     denial. The individual should also be       many casinos now have RFID-enabled poker chips to

                     appropriate.                                even if this information is stored in the system for

8   Accountability   A data controller should be                 In general, nothing about RFID technology prevents
                     accountable for complying with              accountability with the caveat that organizations may
