                                                                                                           key that is used to wrap very large numbers of keys over a short period of time is on the
                                                                                                           order of a day or a week. If a relatively small number of keys are to be wrapped under a

                                                                                                           two years. In the case of a key-wrapping key that is used for only a single message or
                                                                                                           communications session, the cryptoperiod would be limited to a single communication
                                                                                                           session. It is recommended that a recipient-usage period extend no more than three years
                                                                                                           beyond the end of the originator-usage period.

                                                                                                        reseeding). The cryptoperiod consists of only an originator-usage period.
                                                                                                        b. Cryptoperiod: Assuming the use of an approved RBG, the maximum cryptoperiod of a
                                                                                                        symmetric RBG key is determined by the design of the RBG (see SP 800-90).
                                                                                                    9. Symmetric master key/key-derivation key:
                                                                                                        a. Type Considerations: A symmetric master key (also called a key-derivation key) may be
                                                                                                           used multiple times to derive other keys using a (one-way) key-derivation function or
                                                                                                           method (see Section 8.2.4). Therefore, the cryptoperiod consists of only an originator-
                                                                                                           usage period for this key type. A suitable cryptoperiod depends on the nature and use of
                                                                                                           the key(s) derived from the master key and on considerations provided earlier in Section
                                                                                                           5.3. The cryptoperiod of a key derived from a master key could be relatively short (e.g.,
                                                                                                           a single use, communication session, or transaction). Alternatively, the master key could

                                                                                                           or different purposes. The cryptoperiod of the derived keys depends on their use (e.g.,
                                                                                                           as a symmetric data-encryption or integrity authentication key).

                                                                                                           year, depending on its usage environment, the sensitivity/criticality of the information
                                                                                                           protected by the derived keys, and the number of keys derived from the master key.
                                                                                                    10. Private key-transport key:
                                                                                                        a. Type Considerations: A private key-transport key may be used multiple times to decrypt
                                                                                                           keys. Due to the potential need to decrypt keys at a time after they have been encrypted
                                                                                                           for transport, the cryptoperiod of the private key-transport key may be longer than the
                                                                                                           cryptoperiod of the associated public key. The cryptoperiod of the private key is the

                                                                                                           received messages are stored and decrypted at a later time, the cryptoperiod of a private
