NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

             industrial applications. Physical and environmental issues within OT
             environments may decrease the reliability of biometric authorized
             authentication. Organizations may need to coordinate with system
             vendors or manufacturers regarding their specific physical and
             environmental properties and biometric authentication requirements.

6.2.1.4.3.      Smart Card Authentication
Smart cards come in a variety of form factors, from USB devices to embedded chips on cards the
size of credit cards that can be printed and embossed. Smart cards can be customized,
individualized, and issued in-house or outsourced to service providers who manufacture
hundreds or thousands per day. Smart cards enhance software-only solutions, such as password
authentication, by offering an additional authentication factor and removing the human element
in memorizing complex secrets by:
   •   Isolating security-critical computations that involve authentication, digital signatures, and
       key exchange from other parts of the system that do not have a need to know
   •   Enabling the portability of credentials and other private information between computer
       systems
   •   Providing tamper-resistant storage for protecting private keys and other forms of personal
       information
Most issues regarding the use of smart cards are logistical and focus on issuing cards,
particularly replacing lost or stolen cards.
             OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
             Although smart cards offer useful functionality, their implementation in
             OT must consider the overall security context of the OT environment.
             The necessary identification of individuals, issuance of cards, revocation
             if compromise is suspected, and the assignment of authorizations to
             authenticated identities represents a significant initial and ongoing
             challenge. In some cases, corporate IT or other resources may be
             available to assist in the deployment of smart cards and the required
             public key infrastructures. Organizations should also consider the impact
             on OT operational capabilities if dependency on IT systems and services
             are required to support the smart card technology.
             Additionally, if smart cards are implemented in an OT setting,
             organizations should consider provisions for managing lost or damaged
             cards, the costs to incorporate and sustain a respective access control
             system, and a management process for card distribution and retrieval.
             These procedures should consider the ability to grant temporary access to
             OT personnel to prevent operational or safety disruptions.
             A common approach in the Federal Government is based on the
             standardization on Federal PIV smart cards, which allows organizations
             to use the same credential mechanism in multiple applications with one
             to three factors for authentication (i.e., Card-Only, Card+PIN,
