SP 800-152                                                A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


Suspended state           A lifecycle state of a key whereby the use of the key for
                          applying cryptographic protection has been temporarily
                          suspended.
Semantics of a language   The meanings of all the language's acceptable sentences.
Symmetric key             See Secret key.
Syntax                    The rules for constructing or recognizing the acceptable
                          sentences of a language.
System administrator      An FCKMS role that is responsible for the personnel, daily
                          operation, training, maintenance, and related management of
                          an FCKMS other than its keys. The system administrator is
                          responsible for initially verifying individual identities, and
                          then establishing appropriate identifiers for all personnel
                          involved in the operation and use of the FCKMS.
System authority          An FCKMS role that is responsible to executive-level
                          management (e.g., the Chief Information Officer) for the
                          overall operation and security of an FCKMS. A system
                          authority manages all operational FCKMS roles.
Third-party testing       Independent testing by an organization that was not involved
                          in the design and implementation of the object being tested
                          (e.g., a system or device) and is not intended as the eventual
                          user of that object.
Trust                     A characteristic of an entity that indicates its ability to
                          perform certain functions or services correctly, fairly and
                          impartially, along with assurance that the entity and its
                          identifier are genuine.
Trust anchor              A CA with one or more trusted certificates containing public
                          keys that exist at the base of a tree of trust or as the strongest
                          link in a chain of trust and upon which a Public Key
                          Infrastructure is constructed.
                          “Trust anchor” also refers to the certificate of this CA.
Trusted channel           A protected communication link established between the
                          cryptographic module and a sender or receiver (including
                          another cryptographic module) to securely communicate and
                          verify the validity of plaintext CSPs, keys, authentication data,
                          and other sensitive data. Also called a secure channel.

Trusted (secure)          An operating system that manages data to make sure that it
operating system          cannot be altered, moved, or viewed except by entities having
                          appropriate and authorized access rights.
