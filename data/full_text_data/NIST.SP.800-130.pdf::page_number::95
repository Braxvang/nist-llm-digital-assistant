11.1.4 Penetration Testing
Penetration testing tests the CKMS to verify the extent to which it resists active attempts
to compromise its security. This type of testing requires security experts who are
knowledgeable about the typical attack techniques and system weaknesses, and who also
have the ability to create and try new or unsuspected attack methods. The attack group
should contain some individuals who are not part of the CKMS design team and who do
not have preconceived notions about its security. Successful attack methods often involve
using the system in unintended or unsuspected ways.

FR:11.9 The CKMS design shall specify the results of any completed penetration testing
performed to date.

11.2 Periodic Security Review
This review consists of an examination of the system controls, physical controls,
procedural controls and personnel controls to ensure that these controls are in place and
operational as claimed. Changes to the system since the previous security review should
be examined to ensure that the products/devices are operating with the latest updates and
security patches in secure configurations, and that the products continue to maintain their
third-party security ratings. Issues identified as the result of the review should be
addressed. In addition, periodic functional and security testing should be performed (see
Section 9.6).

FR:11.10 The CKMS design shall specify the periodicity of security reviews.

FR:11.11 The CKMS design shall specify the scope of the security review in terms of
the CKMS devices.

FR:11.12 The CKMS design shall specify the scope of the periodic security review in
terms of the activities undertaken for each CKMS device under review.

FR:11.13 The CKMS design shall specify the functional and security testing to be
performed as part of the periodic security review.

11.3 Incremental Security Assessment
When the system has undergone significant changes, an incremental assessment of the
changes in the following areas described in Section 11.1 should be performed:
    a) Changes to third-party-validated devices since the previous security assessment,
    b) Architecture review of the system design changes, and
    c) Functional and security testing of the CKMS.

If the cumulative system changes are significant, a full CKMS security assessment as
specified in Section 11.1 should be conducted.

FR:11.14 The CKMS design shall specify the circumstances under which an incremental
security assessment should be conducted.
