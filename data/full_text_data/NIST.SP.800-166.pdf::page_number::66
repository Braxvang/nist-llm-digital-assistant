8.3.3.9 Internal Authenticate with an Invalid Key Reference

 Test Assertion       TA-08.03.03.09
 Purpose              Verifies that the Derived PIV Application responds to the GENERAL
                      AUTHENTICATE command appropriately when authenticating to the
                      test toolkit application using an invalid key reference.

 Precondition(s)      •   A token with the Derived PIV Application is inserted into an
                          appropriate token reader.
                      •   Suitable drivers have been loaded between the test system and an
                          instance of the reader.
                      •   The Derived PIV Application Password is recorded.
                      •   The Derived PIV Application Password’s retry counter is not 0.
 Test Scenario        1. Send the SELECT command with
                            • AID == 'A0 00 00 03 08 00 00 20 00 01 00'
                      2. Send the VERIFY command with
                            • P2, key reference value, is set to '80'
                            • Data field of the command will contain the
                               correct Derived PIV Application Password, padded
                               with 'FF' (if necessary) to complete the total
                               length of the value to 8 bytes
                      3. Send the GENERAL AUTHENTICATE command
                            • CLA is set to:
                                1. '00' if command chaining is not needed or
                                2. '10' if command chaining is used. (The last
                                   chain of the command sets CLA to '00')
                            • P1, algorithm reference, is set to '07' or '11'
                            • P2, key reference, is set to an incorrect key
                               reference (one that is not supported)
                            • Data field in the command is to include '81'
                               specifying a challenge, followed by a randomly
                               generated challenge, and '82 00' in order to
                               request a response
 Expected Result(s)   1. From Step 1, the command returns the application property template
                         with the status word '90 00'.
                      2. From Step 2, the command returns status word '90 00'.
