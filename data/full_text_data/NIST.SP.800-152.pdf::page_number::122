SP 800-152                                               A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


11 Security Assessment
Security should be assessed periodically throughout the entire lifetime of a Federal
CKMS. This section describes assessments that should be made prior to its initial
operation, during periodic (e.g., annual) reviews, and after major changes. For additional
information on security assessment practices and controls, see [SP 800-37], [SP 800-53],
[SP 800-53A], and [SP 800-115].

A team of experienced people should perform a security assessment with expertise in
several areas that are selected, based on the type of assessment being conducted. A
security-assessment team should consist of individuals who possess expertise in these
areas and in the planned security assessment topic.

11.1 Full Security Assessment

Following installation, but prior to its initial operation, the security of an FCKMS should
be fully assessed.

FR:11.1 The CKMS design shall specify the necessary assurance activities to be
undertaken prior to or in conjunction with a full CKMS security assessment.

FR:11.2 The CKMS design shall specify the circumstances under which a full security
assessment is to be repeated.

               CA-1        A Federal CKMS shall undergo a full security assessment
PR:11.1
               CA-2        including the following:
               SA-11

                                  along with a written justification as to how the
                                  FCKMS supports the goals;
