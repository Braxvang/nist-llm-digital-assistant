GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



Most products do not have agents for other types of hosts, such as network devices (e.g., firewalls,
routers, switches).

7.1.2   Network Architectures

The network architecture for host-based IDPS deployments is typically very simple. Because the agents
are deployed to existing hosts on the organizationâ€™s networks, the components usually communicate over
those networks instead of using a separate management network. Most products encrypt their
communications, preventing eavesdroppers from accessing sensitive information. Appliance-based
agents are typically deployed inline immediately in front of the hosts that they are protecting. Figure 7-1
shows an example of a host-based IDPS deployment architecture.
