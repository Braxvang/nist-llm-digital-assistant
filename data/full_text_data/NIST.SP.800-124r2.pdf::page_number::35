4.3.1. EMM Technologies
EMM and its supporting technologies can mitigate several of the threats defined in Section 3 and
prevalent in the mobile ecosystem. EMM can assist in preventing a misconfigured device from
connecting to the enterprise by securely configuring device settings prior to granting access to
enterprise resources. An EMM can also actively deny a device access to enterprise data if it is in
an insecure state. If an employee loses their device or it is stolen, the EMM can wipe the
enterprise data on the device. EMMs can also help manage what information is shared on a
device lock screen. Depending on the EMM’s capabilities, the list of issues that can be mitigated
may be much larger because some EMMs can be used to manage and configure other
technologies like MTD and VPN applications.
Threats Addressed: Accessing enterprise resources via a misconfigured device, device loss and
theft, information loss due to insecure lock screen, data loss via synchronization, insider threat,
use of untrusted mobile devices
