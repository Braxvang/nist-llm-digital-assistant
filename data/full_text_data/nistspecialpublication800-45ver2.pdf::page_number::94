GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



 Threat level faced by the mail server
 Effort required to data reconstruction without data backup
 Other data backup or redundancy features of the mail server (e.g., Redundant Array of Inexpensive
  Disks [RAID]).
When archiving or backing up email data, organizations should generally conform to the following
guidelines:

 Employ write-once, read-many media (to prevent the alteration or accidental erasure of archived
  information)
 Contain a verification capability to ensure that data is being correctly backed up or archived
 Include the capability to serialize and time-date the information stored
 Provide for easy retrieval of indexes and records preserved on the backup media
 Maintain at least two copies in two geographically distinct locations
 Accurately organize and index all information maintained on both original and duplicate storage
  media.
9.3     Recovering from a Security Compromise

Most organizations eventually face a successful compromise of one or more hosts on their network. The
first step in recovering from a compromise is to create and document the required policies and procedures
for responding to successful intrusions before an intrusion. 60 The response procedures should outline the
actions that are required to respond to a successful compromise of the mail server and the appropriate
sequence of these actions (sequence can be critically important). Most organizations already have a
dedicated incident response team in place which should be contacted immediately when there is suspicion
or confirmation of a compromise. In addition, the organization may wish to ensure that some of its staff
are knowledgeable in the fields of computer and network forensics. 61

A mail server administrator should follow the organization’s policies and procedures for incident
handling, and the incident response team should be contacted for guidance before taking any action after a
suspected or confirmed security compromise. Examples of steps commonly performed after discovering
a successful compromise are as follows:

 Report the incident to the organization’s computer incident response capability
 Isolate the compromised systems or take other steps to contain the attack so that additional
  information can be collected 62
 Consult, as appropriate, with management, legal counsel, and law enforcement expeditiously

      (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/).

      More information on computer and network forensics is available from NIST SP 800-86, Guide to Integrating Forensic
      Techniques into Incident Response (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/).
62
      Isolating the system must be accomplished with great care if the organization wishes to collect evidence. Many attackers
      configure compromised systems to erase evidence if a compromised system is disconnected from the network or rebooted.
      One method to isolate a system would be to reconfigure the nearest upstream switch or router.
