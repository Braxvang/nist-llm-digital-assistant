 Information System-          Risks that arise through the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or
 related Security Risks       availability of information or information systems and consider
                              impacts to the organization (including assets, mission, functions,
                              image, or reputation), individuals, other organizations, and the
                              Nation. See Risk.

 Information System           Individual with assigned responsibility for maintaining the
 Security Officer (ISSO)      appropriate operational security posture for an information
 [CNSSI 4009]                 system or program.

 Information Technology       Any equipment or interconnected system or subsystem of
 [40 U.S.C., Sec. 1401]       equipment that is used in the automatic acquisition, storage,
                              manipulation, management, movement, control, display,
                              switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or
                              information by the executive agency. For purposes of the
                              preceding sentence, equipment is used by an executive agency if
                              the equipment is used by the executive agency directly or is used
                              by a contractor under a contract with the executive agency which:
                              (i) requires the use of such equipment; or (ii) requires the use, to a
                              significant extent, of such equipment in the performance of a
                              service or the furnishing of a product. The term information
                              technology includes computers, ancillary equipment, software,
                              firmware, and similar procedures, services (including support
                              services), and related resources.

 Information Type             A specific category of information (e.g., privacy, medical,
 [FIPS 199]                   proprietary, financial, investigative, contractor sensitive, security
                              management) defined by an organization or in some instances, by
                              a specific law, Executive Order, directive, policy, or regulation.

 Integrity                    Guarding against improper information modification or
 [44 U.S.C., Sec. 3542]       destruction, and includes ensuring information non-repudiation
                              and authenticity.

 Interview                    A type of assessment method that is characterized by the process
 [NISTIR 7298]                of conducting discussions with individuals or groups within an
                              organization to facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or
                              lead to the location of evidence, the results of which are used to
                              support the determination of security control effectiveness over
                              time.

 Intrusion Detection and      Software that automates the process of monitoring the events
 Prevention System (IDPS)     occurring in a computer system or network and analyzing them
 [NISTIR 7298]                for signs of possible incidents and attempting to stop detected
                              possible incidents.
