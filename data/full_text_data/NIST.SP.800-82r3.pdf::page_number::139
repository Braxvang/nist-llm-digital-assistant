            Most wireless field networks are inherently less reliable than their wired
            counterparts due to their susceptibility to signal jamming, distance
            limitations, and line-of-sight requirements. Work with the system vendor
            to design a wireless network that is appropriate for the application.

6.2.10.        Remote Access
Security controls should be implemented to prevent unauthorized remote access to the
organization’s networks, systems, and data. A virtual private network (VPN) is a set of protocols
designed to support secure remote access to network environments. A VPN can provide both
strong authentication and encryption to secure communication data by establishing a private
network that operates as an overlay on a public infrastructure. The most common types of VPN
technologies are:
   •   Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). IPsec supports two encryption modes: transport and
       tunnel. Transport mode encrypts only the data portion (i.e., payload) of each packet while
       leaving the packet header untouched. The more secure tunnel mode adds a new header to
       each packet and encrypts both the original header and the payload. On the receiving side,
       an IPsec-compliant device decrypts each packet.
   •   Transport Layer Security (TLS). Sometimes referred to by the legacy terminology of
       Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), TLS provides a secure channel between two machines that
       encrypts the contents of each packet. TLS is most often recognized for securing
       Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic in a protocol implementation known as
       HTTP Secure (HTTPS). However, TLS is not limited to HTTP traffic and can be used to
       secure many application-layer programs. Only TLS 1.2 or above should be considered.
   •   Secure Shell (SSH). SSH is a command interface and protocol for securely gaining
       access to a remote computer. It is widely used by network administrators to remotely
       control Linux-based servers. SSH is a secure alternative to a telnet application, is
       included in most UNIX distributions, and is typically added to other platforms through a
       third-party package.

            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Many OT security architectures are designed with multiple levels, such
            as in the Purdue model. This can significantly limit access, which can
            minimize accidental or unauthorized disruptions to operations. A process
