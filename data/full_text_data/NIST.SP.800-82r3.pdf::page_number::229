E.3.6. Remote Access
Security controls should be implemented to prevent unauthorized remote access to an
organization’s networks, systems, and data. A virtual private network (VPN) is a set of
technologies and protocols designed to support secure remote access to network environments. A
VPN can provide both strong authentication and encryption to secure communication data by
establishing a private network that operates as an overlay on a public infrastructure. The most
common types of VPN technologies are:
   •   Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). IPsec supports two encryption modes: transport and
       tunnel. Transport mode encrypts only the data portion (payload) of each packet while
       leaving the packet header untouched. The more secure tunnel mode adds a new header to
       each packet and encrypts both the original header and the payload. On the receiving side,
       an IPsec-compliant device decrypts each packet. See NIST SP 800-77, Rev. 1, Guide to
       IPsec VPNs for more information.
   •   Transport Layer Security (TLS). Sometimes referred to by the legacy terminology of
       Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), TLS provides a secure channel between two machines that
       encrypts the contents of each packet. TLS is most often recognized for securing HTTP
       traffic in a protocol implementation known as HTTP Secure (HTTPS). However, TLS is
       not limited to HTTP traffic and can be used to secure many application-layer programs.
       For more information, see NIST SP 800-52, Rev. 2, Guidelines for the Selection,
       Configuration, and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations.
   •   Secure Shell (SSH). SSH is a command interface and protocol for securely gaining
       access to a remote computer. It is widely used by network administrators to remotely
       control Linux-based servers. SSH is a secure alternative to a telnet application, is
       included in most UNIX distributions, and is typically added to other platforms through a
       third-party package.
When implemented with diligence, remote access technologies can improve an organization’s
capabilities. There are several options for remote access and desktop control, including the
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), screens, and other stand-alone packages. If remote
technologies are not managed properly using vulnerability and patch management, these
connections can serve as another channel for an adversary to exploit.
