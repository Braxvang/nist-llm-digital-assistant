treated as a loss of availability, and in general, loss of availability for the majority of systems
does not cause derogation in safety. That is, if the operational parameters for an Instrument
Landing System are detected to be out of established tolerances, the system is immediately
removed from service - it is powered down and users are notified that the particular service is not
available. In most cases, a loss of availability is preferred to continued availability with
degraded integrity. The impacts of the loss of availability due to the loss of integrity include
system-wide air traffic delays, diversion of traffic to alternate airports - and the economic losses
related to those delays, diversions, etc. Severe impacts are not the norm because the loss of
availability is assumed to be inevitable, and the systems have been designed to accommodate
failures. In light of the above, the Recommended Integrity Impact Level is moderate.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for most
air transportation information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to air transportation information.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Some air transportation functions are
time-critical (e.g., air traffic control instructions, position reports, situational awareness,
separation, weather reports for the terminal area, microburst tracking, maintenance trouble
reports). Loss of availability of time-critical information necessary to these functions can result
in large-scale property loss and in loss of human lives. Timing plays a large part in the
availability impact of air transportation information. For example, the time criticality of weather
information may be measured in minutes or hours in the case of pre-flight and mid-flight
operations. However, on final landing approach, up to the second availability may be required
(e.g., detection of microbursts in the terminal area). Air operations are not tolerant of
information loss. The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) supplements the availability of
information available from the Department of Defense's Global Positioning Systems (GPS).
Because of the potential system-wide impacts from a loss of availability of this system, it would
be appropriately categorized as having a high availability impact.

The following example illustrates the use of controls to address a high integrity impact level:
The systems designed for command and control for air traffic control (e.g., the NAS systems)
have been designed for robust operations. However, in general, loss of availability for the
majority of systems does not cause derogation in safety. The impacts of a loss of availability (or
the loss of availability due to the loss of integrity) include local or system-wide air traffic delays,
diversion of traffic to alternate airports, etc., and the economic losses related to those delays,
diversions, etc. Severe impacts are not the norm because the loss of availability is inevitable, and
the systems have been designed to accommodate failures. In light of the above, the
Recommended Availability Impact Level is moderate.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended
for most air transportation information is low.
