                                                       GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



the origin of the event.12 Another helpful action is to implement centralized logging, which means that
certain systems and applications forward copies of their logs to secure central log servers. Centralized
logging prevents unauthorized users from tampering with logs and employing anti-forensic techniques to
impede analysis.13 Performing regular backups of systems allows analysts to view the contents of the
system as they were at a particular time. In addition, as described in Sections 6 and 7, security monitoring
controls such as intrusion detection software, antivirus software, and spyware detection and removal
utilities can generate logs that show when and how an attack or intrusion took place.

Another proactive data collecting measure is the monitoring of user behavior, such as keystroke
monitoring, which records the keyboard usage of a particular system. Although this measure can provide
a valuable record of activity, it can also be a violation of privacy unless users are advised through
organizational policy and login banners that such monitoring may be performed. Most organizations do
not employ techniques such as keystroke monitoring except when gathering additional information on a
suspected incident. Authority for performing such monitoring should be discussed with legal advisors
and documented clearly in the organization’s policy.

3.1.2     Acquiring the Data

After identifying potential data sources, the analyst needs to acquire the data from the sources. Data
acquisition should be performed using a three-step process: developing a plan to acquire the data,
acquiring the data, and verifying the integrity of the acquired data. Although the following items provide
an overview of these three steps, the specific details behind steps 2 and 3 vary based on the type of data
being acquired. Sections 4.2, 5.2, 6.3, and 7.3 provide more detailed explanations of acquiring and
verifying the integrity of data files, OS data, network traffic data, and application data, respectively.

     1. Develop a plan to acquire the data. Developing a plan is an important first step in most cases
        because there are multiple potential data sources. The analyst should create a plan that prioritizes
        the sources, establishing the order in which the data should be acquired. Important factors for
        prioritization include the following:

          ! Likely Value. Based on the analyst’s understanding of the situation and previous experience
            in similar situations, the analyst should be able to estimate the relative likely value of each
            potential data source.
          ! Volatility. Volatile data refers to data on a live system that is lost after a computer is
            powered down or due to the passage of time. Volatile data may also be lost as a result of
            other actions performed on the system. In many cases, acquiring volatile data should be
            given priority over non-volatile data. However, non-volatile data may also be somewhat
            dynamic in nature (e.g., log files that are overwritten as new events occur).
          ! Amount of Effort Required. The amount of effort required to acquire different data sources
            may vary widely. The effort involves not only the time spent by analysts and others within
            the organization (including legal advisors) but also the cost of equipment and services (e.g.,
            outside experts). For example, acquiring data from a network router would probably require
            much less effort than acquiring data from an ISP.

     If auditing was not enabled on a system when an event occurred, incident handlers might enable auditing after the event is
     discovered in an attempt to record evidence of ongoing activity. Because this could alter evidence of the incident and alert
     an attacker to the presence of the incident handlers, the impact of enabling auditing should be considered, and incident
     handlers should document their actions.
