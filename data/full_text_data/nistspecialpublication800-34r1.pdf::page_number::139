Appendix Fâ€”Contingency Planning and the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The system development life cycle (SDLC) refers to the full scope of activities conducted by federal
information system owners associated with a system during its life span. The life cycle, depicted in
Figure F-1, begins with Initiation and ends with Disposition. 47 Although contingency planning is
associated with activities occurring mostly in the Operation/Maintenance phase, identification and
integration of contingency and continuity strategies at all phases of the information system life cycle
allow the owner to build layered protection against risks and assist implementation of effective recovery
strategies early on in the system development. This approach reduces overall contingency planning costs,
enhances contingency capabilities, and reduces impacts to system operations when the contingency plan
is implemented. This section introduces common ways in which contingency strategies can be
incorporated throughout the SDLC. A summary of implementation periods for CP controls throughout
the SDLC is provided in Table F-1. For a specific description of contingency activities and strategies, see
Chapter 5, Technical Contingency Planning Considerations.

Initiation Phase. Contingency planning requirements should be considered when a new information
system is conceived. During Initiation, early contingency planning considerations may become apparent
as information system requirements are identified and matched to their related operational functions, a
risk assessment is conducted to understand what the system will need protection against, and
confidentiality, integrity, and availability objectives are set. High information system availability
requirements may indicate that redundant, real-time mirroring at an alternate site and failover capabilities
should be built into the system design. Similarly, if the system is intended as a virtual application, the
design may need to include additional features, such as remote diagnostic or self-healing capabilities.

     There are several models of the system development life cycle. The model used for this document is consistent with NIST
     Special Publication 800-64, Rev. 1, Security Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle.
