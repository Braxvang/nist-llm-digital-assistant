NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                       Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
December 2023                                                                              and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

     EI-12      A full set of fingerprints is collected from a PIV applicant who lacks an on- [FIPS201], Sec. 2.3 –Biometric Data
                record background investigation. If fewer than 10 fingers are available, the Collection for Background
                missing fingers are labeled before transmitting the fingerprints to the FBI to Investigations
                conduct a background investigation.
                                                                                               [SP800-76], Sec. 3.2 – Fingerprint
                Assessment                                                                     Image Acquisition
                Determine that:
                    (i) The requirement that the issuing facility captures the 10 fingerprints
                        of the applicant and labels any missing fingers is documented
                        (review).
                   (ii) The issuing facility captures the 10 fingerprints of the applicant and
                        labels any missing fingers (observe).
                  (iii) If no fingers are available to be imaged, guidance is sought from
                        respective investigative service providers for alternative means of
                        performing law enforcement checks (review).
     EI-13      If the identity proofing and enrollment process is performed over multiple      [FIPS201], Sec. 2.1 – Control
  (UPDATED)     visits, an automated biometric verification attempt that compares the           Objectives
                applicant’s newly captured biometric characteristics against biometric data
                collected during a previous visit is performed at each visit and results in a   [FIPS201], Sec. 2.4 – Biometric
                positive verification decision.                                                 Data Collection for PIV Card

                Assessment                                                                      [FIPS201], Sec. 2.5 – Biometric
                Determine that:                                                                 Data Use
                   (i) If multiple sessions are needed for identity-proofing, registration,
                       and issuance, the applicant is linked through a positive biometric
                       verification decision obtained from an automated comparison of
                       biometric characteristics captured at a previous session to
                       biometric characteristics captured during the current session
                       (review, observe).
                  (ii) No substitution occurs in the identity proofing process. More
                       specifically, the individual who appears for identity proofing and
                       whose fingerprints are checked against databases is the person to
                       whom the credential is issued (review, observe).
     EI-14      If supervised remote identity proofing is used, it meets the following            [FIPS201], Sec. 2.7.1 –Supervised
    (NEW)       requirements at a minimum: (i) the station is maintained in a controlled-         Remote Identity Proofing
                access environment; (ii) the station is monitored by staff at the station
                location while it is being used; (iii) a live operator participates remotely with
                the applicant for the entirety of the identity proofing session; (iv) operators
                have undergone a training program to detect potential fraud and to
                properly perform a supervised remote identity proofing session; (v) the
                operator monitors the entire identity proofing session with at least one
                continuous, high-resolution video transmission of the applicant; (vi) the
                operator requires all actions taken by the applicant during the identity
                proofing session to be clearly visible to the operator; (vii) the operator
                validates the physical or cryptographic security features of the primary and
                secondary identity source documents using scanners and sensors that are
                integrated into the station; and (viii) all communications occur over a
                mutually authenticated protected channel.

                Assessment
                Determine that:
                   (i) The station is maintained in a controlled access environment
                       (observe).
                  (ii) The station is monitored by staff at the station location while it is
                       being used (observe).
                 (iii) A live operator participates remotely with the applicant for the
                       entirety of the identity proofing session (observe).
