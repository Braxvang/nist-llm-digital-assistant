8.2     Case Study #2: Supply Chain Management of Hazardous Materials

The Radionuclide Transportation Agency (RTA) oversees the movement of radioactive research materials
between production facilities, national laboratories, military installations, and other relevant locations.
The RTA oversight of the supply chain for these materials involves many of the same issues as in most
any other supply chain. The agency wants to know who is in possession of what quantity of materials at
any given time. It also wants to locate materials at a site quickly, without having to search through
numerous containers to find them. Bar code technology does not provide that capability.

Some of RTA’s requirements are more unique. For instance, much of the transported radionuclide
material must be closely monitored because extreme temperatures or excessive vibration can make it
useless for its intended applications. Consequently, RTA wants temperature and vibration sensors to
continuously measure environmental conditions and record readings on the tag. Additionally, the
handling of RTA-regulated materials is a homeland and national security issue. If the materials were to
fall into unauthorized hands, they could endanger the public welfare.

8.2.1    Phase 1: Initiation

The project team began with a risk assessment, which identified a number of concerns, the most
significant of which were as follows:

 An adversary could identify and target a vehicle containing RTA-regulated material.
 An adversary could eavesdrop on tag transactions to learn the characteristics of the material, which
  could help determine whether it is worth stealing.
 An adversary could damage or disable a tag, making it easier to steal material without detection.
 An adversary could alter sensor or manifest data stored on the tag in an effort to undermine the
  business processes for which the material is being used.
 The radiation from readers could accidentally cause combustion of collocated volatile materials when
  several of them are operating concurrently in close proximity.
To help address the risks, RTA established a policy that required that tagged items only be identifiable
during embarkation, debarkation, and storage, but not during transport. The policy further stated that tag-
reader communication should be authenticated whenever technically feasible with commercial-off-the-
shelf systems. The RTA conducted a privacy assessment that identified that the system would handle PII
due to the need to associate materials with particular individuals, although most such information was
already contained in existing logs. The agency updated its privacy disclosure statement for employees
and contractors to account for the new technology. Finally, it required that all personnel involved in
handling of the tagged materials be provided RFID security and privacy awareness training. The agency
already had a HERF policy, but everyone agreed the introduction of the RFID system would require the
agency to revisit the efficacy of these HERF-related controls.
