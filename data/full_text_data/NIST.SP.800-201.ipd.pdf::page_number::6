      NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                   Cloud Computing Forensic
      February 2023                                                                   Reference Architecture

129   Call for Patent Claims
130   This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use
131   would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information
132   Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication). Such guidance and/or requirements may be
133   directly stated in this ITL Publication or by reference to another publication. This call also
134   includes disclosure, where known, of the existence of pending U.S. or foreign patent applications
135   relating to this ITL draft publication and of any relevant unexpired U.S. or foreign patents.
136   ITL may require from the patent holder, or a party authorized to make assurances on its behalf,
137   in written or electronic form, either:
138       a) assurance in the form of a general disclaimer to the effect that such party does not hold
139          and does not currently intend holding any essential patent claim(s); or
140       b) assurance that a license to such essential patent claim(s) will be made available to
141          applicants desiring to utilize the license for the purpose of complying with the guidance
142          or requirements in this ITL draft publication either:
143              i.    under reasonable terms and conditions that are demonstrably free of any unfair
144                    discrimination; or
145             ii.    without compensation and under reasonable terms and conditions that are
146                    demonstrably free of any unfair discrimination.
147   Such assurance shall indicate that the patent holder (or third party authorized to make assurances
148   on its behalf) will include in any documents transferring ownership of patents subject to the
149   assurance, provisions sufficient to ensure that the commitments in the assurance are binding on
150   the transferee, and that the transferee will similarly include appropriate provisions in the event of
151   future transfers with the goal of binding each successor-in-interest.
152   The assurance shall also indicate that it is intended to be binding on successors-in-interest
153   regardless of whether such provisions are included in the relevant transfer documents.
154   Such statements should be addressed to: sp800-201@nist.gov
