validate operational procedures, operational-level personnel should be invited to the exercise. Finally, if
the primary objective is to validate the full-scale readiness of a plan, both senior-level personnel and
operational-level personnel should participate. Once the appropriate participants have been identified,
they should receive a written invitation or announcement of the exercise as soon as possible. This is
typically accomplished in the form of an e-mail or memorandum by a member of the functional exercise
design team, but, if more appropriate, may instead be distributed by a member of management.

5.2.5    Identify the Functional Exercise Staff

The design team usually designates an exercise director, who is responsible for all aspects of the exercise,
including staffing, development, conduct, and logistics. The exercise director designates one or more
controllers, who monitor, manage, and control exercise activity; data collectors, who record information
about the actions that occur during the exercise; and simulators, who simulate or otherwise represent non-
participating individuals and organizations whose input is necessary to the flow of the exercise. The
controllers, data collectors, and simulators should be thoroughly familiar with the content of the IT plan
being exercised and with the exercise objectives.

The exercise director, controllers, data collectors, and simulators should meet before the event to discuss
the details surrounding the exercise, including its scope and objectives. At this time, the exercise director,
controllers, data collectors, and simulators review the results from previous tabletop and functional
exercises, if applicable, to heighten their awareness of potential issues before the event.

5.2.6    Coordinate the Logistics

One or more members of the design team should typically be responsible for coordinating the exercise
eventâ€™s logistics. The logistics coordinator(s) typically begin to do this approximately three months
before the conduct of the functional exercise. The checklist in Table 5-1 can be used as a starting point
by the logistics coordinator(s) to ensure the necessary tasks are completed.

                        Table 5-1. Sample Logistics Checklist for Functional Exercise Events

                                   Logistics                                     Target Date         Completed
Select a date for exercise conduct
Make arrangements with facility manager(s) at the facilities at which the
exercise is conducted
Identify the controllers, data collectors, and simulators
Identify participants
Invite participants
Coordinate the development of controller, data collector, simulator, and
participant books
Arrange for the printing of name tags for controllers, data collectors, and
simulators to ensure they are readily recognizable during the exercise
Arrange for transportation and billeting, if applicable
Ensure that appropriate equipment is available and properly configured to
function at exercise site(s)
Arrange for refreshments, if appropriate
Create a supplies checklist to include items such as power strips, extension
cords, markers, and tape for the control cell
Copy all files as a backup onto a CD-ROM, USB flash drive, or other
removable media
