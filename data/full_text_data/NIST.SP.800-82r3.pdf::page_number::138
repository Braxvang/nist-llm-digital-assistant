            directional antennas to extend the effective range of a wireless network
            beyond the standard range.
            Organizations may choose to implement a wireless mesh network to
            improve resiliency or to eliminate areas with poor signal strength. Mesh
            networks can provide fault tolerance through alternate route selection
            and preemptive fail-over of the network. Organizations should also
            consider the performance and security impacts associated with the use of
            mesh networks. For example, when roaming between access points,
            devices may experience temporary communication loss. Roaming may
            also require different security controls to reduce the transition time.
            Organizations will need to find the appropriate balance between
            functional capabilities and cybersecurity to achieve the risk tolerance.
            Wireless LANs
                   •   Wireless device communications should be encrypted, and the
                       encryption must not degrade the operational performance of the
                       end devices. To reduce encryption latency, encryption should be
                       considered at OSI Layer 2 rather than at Layer 3. The use of
                       hardware accelerators to perform cryptographic functions should
                       also be considered.
                   •   Wireless access points should establish independent network
                       segments (rather than extending an existing segment) and be used
                       in combination with a boundary protection device to restrict and
                       control communication.
                   •   Wireless access points should be configured to have a unique
                       service set identifier (SSID) and enable media access control
                       (MAC) address filtering at a minimum.
                   •   Wireless devices may require different security controls and
                       should be zoned accordingly.
                   •   An adaptive routing protocol should be considered if the devices
                       are to be used for wireless mobility. The convergence time of the
                       network should be as fast as possible to support rapid network
                       recovery in the event of a failure or power loss.
            Wireless Field Networks
            When implementing a wireless field network, the following security
            features should be considered:
                   •   Selecting a standard, non-proprietary protocol (e.g., IEEE
                       802.15.x)
                   •   Ensuring that encryption is used between field instruments and
                       wireless access points
                   •   Allowlisting devices into the wireless device manager so that
                       rogue devices cannot connect
