                                                                                   GUIDE TO SECURE WEB SERVICES



the user operates, a portal, a requester, a provider service, an SSO server, and SAML-enabled Web
applications.




                                 Figure 4-1. Web Services Trust Relationships

In a Web services trust environment, a user will communicate with an SSO server and one or more
SAML-enabled Web applications, as shown in Figure 4-1. For this SSO environment to function
correctly, all three entities must trust each other. A user may also access a portal application, which
provides Web service proxy agents access to providers on behalf of the user. In addition, requesters will
often talk to providers on their own behalf. For all of these interactions to function, the entities involved
must trust one another. WS-Security enables two Web services to trust each other, while SAML enables
one entity to assert that it trusts another entity. In this type of configuration, it is possible to build a chain
of trust, where a Web service trusts another Web service regardless of the fact the two Web services have
no direct relationship.

4.2    Using the Portal to Control User Authorization and Access to Web Services

A portal may use SAML assertions to express a user’s identity to other Web services, so SAML
assertions may be extended into authorization and access controls. Portals can be implemented using one
of the available Liberty or SAML libraries or using one of the many COTS products that will act as an
identity server. By implementing an identity server, the portal’s presentation functions are combined with
the SSO and distributed access management services, providing only authorized information to be
presented to the user.

COTS identity servers provide robust support for the complexities of the SAML specification.
Additionally, most COTS identity providers support a wide variety of authentication mechanisms—from
certificates to passwords. While these are designed to prevent attacks at the protocol level, COTS identity
providers must be configured correctly to be secure.
