Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access employee relations information.
Employee relations processes are generally tolerant of delay. Typically, disruption employee
relations information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended
employee relations information is low.
C.3.3.8 Labor Relations Information Type

Labor Relations manages the relationship between the agency and its unions and bargaining
units. This includes negotiating and administering labor contracts and collective bargaining
agreements; managing negotiated grievances; and participating in negotiated third party
proceedings. The recommended provisional security categorization for labor relations
information is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of labor relations
information on the ability of responsible agencies to manage the relationship between the agency
and its unions and bargaining units. This includes negotiating and administering labor contracts
and collective bargaining agreements; managing negotiated grievances; and participating in
negotiated third party proceedings. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of the majority
of labor relations information will result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In cases where the consequences of
unauthorized disclosure of labor relations information could seriously affect the agencies mission
capability, protection of agency assets, and safety of individuals, the confidentiality impact level
might be moderate

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for disclosure of labor relations information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of labor relations information depends
mostly on the criticality of the information with respect to agency mission capability, protection
of agency assets, and safety of individuals. Although there can be serious short-term effects for
individuals, the effects of modifications or deletion of this information are generally limited with
respect to agency mission capabilities or assets.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In some cases (e.g., where an agencyâ€™s
