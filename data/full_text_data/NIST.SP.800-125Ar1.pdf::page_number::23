6. SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HY-BF4

6.1 VM Image Management

Since VM-based software (e.g., Guest OS, Middleware, and Applications) shares physical memory of the
virtualized host with hypervisor software, it is no surprise that a VM is the biggest source of all attacks
directed at the hypervisor. In operational virtualized environments, VMs are rarely created from scratch, but
rather from VM Images. VM Images are templates used for creating running versions of VMs. An
organization may have its own criteria for classifying the different VM Images it uses in its VM Library.
Some commonly used criteria include: processor load (VM used for compute-intensive applications);
memory load (VM used for memory-intensive applications, such as Database processing); and application
sensitivity (VM running mission-critical applications utilizing mission-critical data). For each VM image
type, the following practices must be followed to ensure that the resulting operational VMs are secure:

•   Documentation on the Gold Image for each VM Image type. A Gold Image is defined by a set of
    configuration variables associated with the VM Image. The configuration variables should include, at
    the minimum, the Guest OS make, version, patch level, date of creation, number of vCPU cores, and
    memory size.
•   Each VM Image in the VM Image Library must have an associated digital signature.
•   Access privileges to the VM Image Library must be controlled through a robust access control
    mechanism.
•   Access to the server storing VM Images should have a secure protocol.

The security recommendations relating to the above practices are as follows:

Security Recommendation HY-SR-9: Gold standard must be defined for VMs of all types, and VM
Images that do not conform to the standard should not be allowed to be stored in the VM Image server
or library. Images in the VM Image library should be periodically scanned for outdated OS versions and
patches, which could result in a drift from the standard.

Security Recommendation HY-SR-10: Every VM Image stored in the image server should have a digital
signature attached to it as a mark of authenticity and integrity, signed using trustworthy, robust
cryptographic keys.

Security Recommendation HY-SR-11: Permissions for checking into and out of images from the
VM Image library should be enforced through a robust access control mechanism and limited to an
authorized set of administrators. In the absence of an access control mechanism, VM image files
should be stored in encrypted devices that can only be opened or closed by a limited set of authorized
administrators with passphrases of sufficient complexity.

Security Recommendation HY-SR-12: Access to the server storing VM images should always
be through a secure protocol such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).

6.2 VM Live Migration

 Live migration is a functionality present in all hypervisors, which enables a VM to be migrated or moved
from one virtualized host to another while the guest OS and applications on it are still running. This
functionality provides key benefits such as fault tolerance, load balancing, and host maintenance, upgrades,
and patching. In live migration, the state of the guest OS on the source host must be replicated on the
destination host. This requires migrating memory content, processor state, storage (unless the two hosts share
a common storage), and network state.
