                                             GUIDE TO STORAGE ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES FOR END USER DEVICES



Appendix A—Alternatives to Encrypting Storage on End User Devices

Section 3 describes commonly used technologies for storage encryption—full disk, virtual disk and
volume, and file/folder encryption. Organizations should not feel compelled to use only these methods to
encrypt stored information; there are many other acceptable methods. The following are some examples:

 Applications can encrypt the information that they store. For example, a commercial off-the-shelf
  (COTS) backup utility might be capable of encrypting its backups, and a compression utility might
  have an option to encrypt archives that a user creates. Another example is a database that can be
  configured to encrypt fields that contain sensitive information. An application could also store
  sensitive information in an alternate format, such as cryptographic hashes of passwords instead of the
  passwords themselves.

 Sensitive information could be accessed only through a virtual machine and stored as part of the
  virtual machine. If the virtual machine software itself does not provide an encryption capability, the
  virtual machine data, which is a single file, could be protected through storage encryption software.

In some cases, organizations may decide that the best way to address the problem of protecting sensitive
information on end user devices is not to store the information on the devices. Examples of how this
might be implemented include the following:

 Preventing access to sensitive information from higher-risk devices, such as mobile devices

 Using a thin client solution, such as terminal services, a thin Web-based application, or a portal, to
  access the information, and configuring the thin client solution to prohibit file transfers of the
  sensitive information to the end user device

 Configuring the organization’s devices (including desktop computers) to prevent writing sensitive
  information to removable media, such as CDs or USB flash drives, unless the information is properly
  encrypted

 Permitting users to access files or databases containing sensitive information only through well-
  secured applications that restrict access as tightly as possible. For example, suppose that an
  organization has a database containing thousands of records on employees’ benefits. Instead of
  allowing a user to have full and direct access to the database, which could allow the user to transfer
  all the database records to the user’s device, the organization could permit the user to access only the
  necessary records and record fields. If the user only needs access to general demographic
  information, and does not need to access any information related to the employees’ identities, then the
  user would not be able to access any sensitive information.

 Removing unneeded sensitive information from files or databases.

Organizations should be aware that if sensitive information can be viewed from end user devices, the
information is still at some risk of exposure, even if it is not stored there. The information could be
recorded in screen captures, printed, or monitored by malware, for example.

Organizations should also be aware that the use of general access control mechanisms is typically
insufficient to protect sensitive information on end user devices. For example, a password generally
cannot be used instead of cryptography to protect stored information. Although requiring a BIOS
password can prevent an attacker from booting a computer regularly, the attacker could still access the
information by placing the storage media in a different computer. Using an OS password is also
