cause could be any number of things. Without fundamental assurance of correct implementation
and continued effectiveness of security controls that are not associated with the metric, the root
cause analysis is going to be hampered, and the analysis may be inappropriately narrowed to a
predetermined list, overlooking the true problem. For detailed information on establishing
metrics, see NIST SP 800-55, as amended.

Primary Roles: Risk Executive (Function), Chief Information Officer, Senior Information
Security Officer

Supporting Roles: Authorizing Officials, Information System Owner/Common Control Provider

Expected Input: Organizational risk assessment, organizational risk tolerance, current threat
information, reporting requirements, current vulnerability information

Expected Output: Established metrics to convey security status and security control
effectiveness at all three tiers, and to give recipients/users of reports visibility into assets,
awareness of vulnerabilities, and knowledge of threats

3.2.2 ESTABLISH MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT FREQUENCIES
Determining frequencies for security status monitoring and for security control assessments are
critical functions of the organization’s ISCM program. For some organizations, dashboards and
ongoing assessments are a shift away from the model of complete security control assessments
conducted at a distinct point in time. For this shift to be constructive and effective from security,
assurance, and resource use perspectives, organizations determine the frequencies with which
each security control or control element is assessed for effectiveness and the frequencies with
which each metric is monitored.

Security control effectiveness across a tier or throughout the organization can itself be taken as a
security metric and as such may have an associated status monitoring frequency. Though
monitoring and assessment frequencies are determined for each individual metric and control,
organizations use this data of different latencies to create a holistic view of the security of each
system as well as a view of the security of the enterprise architecture. As the monitoring program
matures, monitoring and assessment frequencies are important in the context of how the data is
used and the question When did the system receive authorization to operate? will become less
meaningful than How resilient is the system?

Considerations in Determining Assessment and Monitoring Frequencies.

Organizations take the following criteria into consideration when establishing monitoring
frequencies for metrics or assessment frequencies for security controls:
•    Security control volatility. Volatile security controls are assessed more frequently, whether
     the objective is establishing security control effectiveness or supporting calculation of a
     metric.33 Controls in the NIST SP 800-53 Configuration Management (CM) family are a
     good example of volatile controls. Information system configurations typically experience
     high rates of change. Unauthorized or unanalyzed changes in the system configuration often
     render the system vulnerable to exploits. Therefore, corresponding controls such as CM-6,

     Security control volatility is a measure of how frequently a control is likely to change over time subsequent to its
     implementation.
