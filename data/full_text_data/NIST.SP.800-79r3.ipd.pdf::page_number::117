NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                       Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
December 2023                                                                              and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

    Identifier                           Issuer Control                             Applicability             Source


                  Assessment
                  Determine that:
                      (i) The issuer has developed and follows compliant
                          processes to terminate derived PIV credentials
                          (review, observe).
    MP(DC)-18     All derived PIV credentials associated with a given PIV               DPCI        [SP800-157], Sec. 2.4 –
   (UPDATED)      Card are invalidated when the associated PIV identity                             Invalidation
                  account is terminated.

                  Assessment
                  Determine that:
                       (i) The issuer has implemented a process to invalidate
                           all issued derived PIV credentials when the PIV
                           identity account is terminated (review, test).
                      (ii) The issuer continuously monitors the associated
                           PIV identity account to determine its termination
                           status (review).
    MP(DC)-19     If the subscriber’s PIV Card is reissued as a result of a           PKI-AAL2,     [SP800-157], Sec. 2.3.1 –
     (NEW)        change in the subscriber’s name and the subscriber’s                PKI-AAL3      PKI-Based Derived PIV
                  name appears in the derived PIV authentication certificate,                       Credential Maintenance
                  a new derived PIV authentication certificate is issued with
                  the new name, and the previous certificate is invalidated.

                  Assessment
                  Determine that:
                       (i) The issuer has procedures for updating a derived
                           PIV authentication certificate as part of a reissuance
                           of a subscriber’s PIV Card (review, observe).
                      (ii) The existing derived PIV authentication certificate is
                           revoked (review, observe, test).
    MP(DC)-22     If the activation secret is forgotten or the permitted number       PKI-AAL2,     [SP800-157], Sec. 3.1.4 –
     (NEW)        of consecutive wrong attempts is reached, the organization          PKI-AAL3      Activation Data
                  is required to input the PIN unblocking key (PUK). If the
                  PUK is not implemented by the authenticator or cannot be
                  provided, the authenticator certificates are revoked, or the
                  associated private keys are destroyed or zeroized.

                  Assessment
                  Determine that:
                       (i) The PIN unblocking key is entered if the maximum
                           number of consecutive wrong attempts is reached
                           prior to resetting the memorized secret or the
                           biometric activation factor (review, observe, test).
                      (ii) If the PIN unblocking key cannot be entered, the
                           authentication certificates are revoked, or the
                           private keys are zeroized or destroyed (observe,
                           test).
    MP(DC)-24     If the memorized secret used for activation or the biometric          DPCI        [SP800-157], Sec. 3.1.4 –
     (NEW)        activation factor needs to be changed, entry of the current                       Activation Data
                  memorized secret is required to change the value.
                                                                                                    [SP800-157], Sec. 3.2.3 –
                  Assessment                                                                        Activation Data
                  Determine that:
                    (i) Entry of the current activation secret is required
                        prior to changing the memorized secret or the
                        biometric activation factor (review, observe, test);
