2.4.1   Middleware

RFID middleware is responsible for preparing data collected from readers in the RF subsystem for the
analytic systems that directly support business processes. Middleware hides the complexity and
implementation details of the RF subsystem from the analytic systems. This allows the developers and
users of the analytic systems to focus on the business implications of RFID data rather than the intricacies
of wireless communication. For example, middleware filters duplicate, incomplete, and erroneous
information it receives from readers. Middleware filtering is especially useful for applications in which
large numbers of tags are in close proximity and for challenging RF environments, such as those
containing reflective materials. The middleware can immediately transfer the filtered data to the analytic
systems or aggregate and store it for later retrieval.

System administrators also use middleware to monitor and manage readers. For example, system
administrators use middleware to adjust the power output and duty cycle to reduce the number of
transaction errors. Many middleware products also support event-based triggers that perform actions
automatically under certain conditions. Middleware transaction logs help with the identification of
anomalous behavior, which could help an organization detect unauthorized use of the RFID system.
Many middleware products also provide additional features, such as support for printing RFID labels that
provide benefits beyond data and device management.

2.4.2   Analytic Systems

Analytic systems are composed of databases, data processing applications, and Web servers that process
the data outputs of middleware based on business requirements and user instructions. They contain
customized business logic for each business process they support. For example, the analytic systems of
an RFID system supporting logistics may include customized rules for automated inventory management,
procurement, shipping, receiving, and billing.
