Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
judicial hearings information is low.

D.17.2 Legal Defense Information Type

Legal defense refers to the representation of a defendant in a criminal/civil court of law in an
attempt to provide constitutional guarantees to legal representation. The sensitivity of much legal
information is highly lifecycle-dependent. From a confidentiality perspective, most information
associated with litigation and judicial activities is in the public record after the information has
been presented in court. The recommended provisional security categorization for the legal
defense information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, High), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of legal defense
information on the representation of a defendant in a criminal/civil court of law and on the ability
of the government to provide constitutional guarantees to legal representation. Dissemination of
legal defense information is governed by privacy laws and by Rules of Criminal Procedure,
Rules of Civil Procedure, and other laws governing adversarial legal proceedings. While much
information associated with legal defense is public, some information is sealed by the court or is
otherwise protected from disclosure. Violation of rules regarding unauthorized disclosure is
punishable by law, disbarment, fine, and/or imprisonment. Generally, the unauthorized
disclosure of legal defense information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, assets, or individuals. Where unauthorized disclosure of information might have a
serious adverse effect on legal defense, there is a presumption of a miscarriage of justice. If an
unauthorized disclosure is discovered, the legal proceeding may be jeopardized (e.g., a mistrial
may be declared). The cost to the government and others in terms of finance, time, and
disruption to normal operations can be severe. If suspicion is raised concerning government
complicity or negligence, serious loss of public confidence in government agencies or the legal
process may result.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where the life of a victim, witness,
or informant may be endangered by disclosure, the confidentiality impact will be high. Also,
where the consequences of a miscarriage of justice are likely to endanger public safety (e.g.,
release of a terrorist or other murderer), the confidentiality impact will be high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: Given legal consequences of unauthorized disclosure,
the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for legal defense information is
moderate.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Legal defense
activities are not typically time-critical. In most cases, unauthorized modification or destruction
