SP 800-132      Recommendation for Password-Based Key Derivation           December 2010



                             mk = PBKDF (PRF, C) (P, S, kLen).

The kLen value shall be at least 112 bits in length.

A generic diagram of the PBKDF is given in Figure 1. The design rationale on generic
PBKDFs is available in Appendix A.2.

5.1      The Salt (S)

All or a portion of the salt shall be generated using an approved Random Bit Generator
(e.g., see [5]). The length of the randomly-generated portion of the salt shall be at least
128 bits.

More information on the length and optional format of the salt is available in Appendix
A.2.1.

5.2      The Iteration Count (C)

The iteration count C is a fixed value that determines how many times the PRF iterates to
generate one block of the MK. The iteration count shall be selected as large as possible,
as long as the time required to generate the key using the entered password is acceptable
for the users. Since the capability of user machines varies (e.g., from a smart card to high-
end workstations or servers), reasonable iteration counts vary accordingly. A minimum
iteration count of 1,000 is recommended. For especially critical keys, or for very
powerful systems or systems where user-perceived performance is not critical, an
iteration count of 10,000,000 may be appropriate.

More information on the selection of the iteration count is available in Appendix A.2.2.
