         SN-5.4 Resolve stakeholder requirements issues related to protection needs.
         Note: Any change to stakeholder requirements signifies a need to reassess protection needs and
         determine whether any subsequent changes are required.

SN-6     MANAGE THE STAKEHOLDER NEEDS AND REQUIREMENTS DEFINITION
         SN-6.1 Obtain explicit agreement that the stakeholder requirements satisfactorily address
                protection needs.
         SN-6.2 Record asset protection data.
         SN-6.3 Maintain traceability between stakeholder protection needs and stakeholder
                requirements.
         SN-6.4 Provide the security-relevant artifacts that have been selected for baselines.

H.3.     System Requirements Definition
The purpose of the System Requirements Definition process is to transform the stakeholder, user-
oriented view of desired capabilities into a technical view of a solution that meets the operational
needs of the user.

H.3.1. Security Purpose
-   Provide an accurate and complete representation of stakeholder protection needs (as
    expressed in the stakeholder requirements) in the system requirements.

H.3.2. Security Outcomes
-   Security aspects of the system description – including system interfaces, functions, and
    boundaries for a system solution – are defined.
-   Security-relevant system requirements and security-driven design constraints are defined.
-   Security performance measures are defined.
-   Security aspects of the system requirements are analyzed.
-   Enabling systems or services needed for the security aspects of the system requirements
    definition are available.
-   Traceability of the security aspects of system requirements and associated security-relevant
    constraints to stakeholder requirements is established.
