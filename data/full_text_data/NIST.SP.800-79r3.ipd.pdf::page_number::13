      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                 Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                        and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

315   developing an acceptable operations plan, drawing the issuer’s authorization boundary,
316   evaluating the findings of all control assessments, and making a proper authorization decision.
317   Since organizations may vary significantly in how they choose to structure their operations, these
318   guidelines have been developed to support organizational flexibility and minimize the effort
319   needed to assess, authorize, and monitor the reliability of issuers. The authorization methodology
320   also generates assessment findings and resulting authorization decisions that are consistent and
321   repeatable. These characteristics provide assurance to an organization’s management that an
322   issuer who has been authorized based on these guidelines can be trusted as a provider of secure
323   and reliable identification credentials, as required by [HSPD-12].
324   This document shall be used by both small and large organizations (i.e., federal departments and
325   agencies) and can be applied whether their issuance processes are:
326       •   Centrally located,
327       •   Geographically dispersed, or
328       •   Outsourced in varying degrees to other organizations or service providers.
