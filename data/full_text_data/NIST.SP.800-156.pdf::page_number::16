    <SecondaryIdentifier>:
          This element contains the Secondary Identifier of the subject of the chain-of-
          trust enrollment record. The Secondary Identifier is defined in [FIPS201] as
          pre-names or given names of the PIV Cardholder. The <SecondaryIdentifier>
          element is always included in the PersonalInformationType complex type
          and occurs only once. The data is provided in an xs:string format.

    <PrintedName>:
           This element contains the Printed Name of the subject of the chain-of-trust
           enrollment record. The Printed Name is a combination of the card holder’s
           primary and secondary identifiers, as it is to be printed on the PIV Card
           according to [FIPS201]. The <PrintedName> element is always included in
           the PersonalInformationType complex type and only occurs once. The data
           is provided in an xs:string format.

    <SSN>:
         This element may contain the Social Security Number of the subject of the
         chain-of-trust enrollment record.1 The <SSN> element is optional, and may
         occur only once if included in the PersonalInformationType complex type.
         The data is provided in an xs:string format.

    <IsUSCitizen>:
          This element is required, occurs once in the PersonalInformationType
          complex type and contains a boolean value. If the subject of the chain-of-trust
          enrollment record is a U.S. Citizen, then the value is set to true. If the subject
          of the chain-of-trust enrollment record is not a U.S. Citizen, then the value is
          set to false. The data is provided in an xs:boolean format. If the
          <IsUSCitizen> element is false, then at least one country is specified in
          <CitizenshipCountryCode>.

    <CitizenshipCountryCode>:
           This element is required if <IsUSCitizen> is set to false and optional if
           <IsUSCitizen> is set to true. The element contains the countries of citizenship
           of the subject of the chain-of-trust enrollment record. The country code is
           formatted in an abbreviation (alpha-3 format), as documented in [ISO3166].
           The <CitizenshipCountryCode> element may occur once for each citizenship
           the applicant possesses. The data is provided in an xs:string format.




1To eliminate unnecessary use of the SSN, whenever possible, departments and agencies should
avoid using the <SSN> element. See the attachment to OMB M-07-16 [M-07-16], Section 2:
