technique(s) to use in attacking a target, and/or information regarding the capabilities, intent, and
plans of our adversaries. Where unauthorized disclosure of disaster preparedness and planning
information associated with critical infrastructures, large groups of people, or key national assets
is expected to be of direct use to terrorists, the confidentiality impact level is recommended to be
high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most disaster preparedness and planning information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of disaster preparedness and planning
information depend on whether the information is time-critical.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction
of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may
adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the
mission will usually be limited. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction
of information can be very serious or catastrophic if the data is time-critical operational
information. In such cases, the impact level assigned would be moderate or high.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
most disaster preparedness and planning information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to disaster preparedness and planning
information. Generally, missions supported by disaster preparedness and planning
information are not reliably tolerant of delays.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: If emergency responders and those
responsible for repair and restoration activities are unable to access preparedness and
planning information in the event of an actual emergency the consequences may include
confusion and delays. In such cases, the availability impact level can be moderate or high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
disaster preparedness and planning information is low.

D.4.3 Disaster Repair and Restoration Information Type

Disaster repair and restoration involves the cleanup and restoration activities that take place after
a disaster. This involves the cleanup and rebuilding of any homes, buildings, roads,
environmental resources, or infrastructure that may be damaged due to a disaster. The
recommended provisional categorization of the disaster repair and restoration information type
follows:


                                                118
