    IMPERATIVE 1
    Advancing Cybersecurity and Privacy Standards

    NIST leverages foundational and applied research as well as extensive experience
    acquired through decades of leadership and participation in developing national and
    international standards to advance cybersecurity and privacy standards. Today, these
    standards activities span cybersecurity, privacy, and cryptography, as well as newer and
    emerging technology spaces such as Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things.
    About 40 NIST staff work with industry and other agencies to develop cybersecurity and
    privacy standards through voluntary consensus Standards Developing Organizations
    (SDOs). The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) has provided additional focus and a
    systematic approach to standards work in this space. This international standards
    strategy follows the guidelines defined in NISTIR 8074, Cybersecurity Interagency Report
    on Strategic U.S. Government Engagement in International Standardization to Achieve
    U.S. Objectives for Cybersecurity.
