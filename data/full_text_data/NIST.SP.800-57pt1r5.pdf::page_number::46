                                                                                                    identifier, purpose, or a counter) must be protected to ensure that the associated keying material

                                                                                                 In general, a single key shall be used for only one purpose (e.g., encryption, integrity
                                                                                                 authentication, key wrapping, random bit generation, or digital signatures). There are several
                                                                                                 reasons for this:
                                                                                                       1. The use of the same key for two different cryptographic processes may weaken the security
                                                                                                          provided by one or both of the processes.
                                                                                                       2. Limiting the use of a key limits the damage that could be done if the key is compromised.
                                                                                                       3. Some uses of keys interfere with each other. For example, consider a key pair used for both
                                                                                                          key transport and digital signatures. In this case, the private key is used as both a private
                                                                                                          key-transport key to decrypt the encrypted keys and as a private signature key to generate
                                                                                                          digital signatures. It may be necessary to retain the private key used for transport key
