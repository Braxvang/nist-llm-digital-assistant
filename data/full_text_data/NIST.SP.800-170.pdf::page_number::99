                                  The editor, Patrick O’Reilly of the Computer Security Division, wishes to thank his colleagues in the
                                Computer Security Division, who provided write-ups on their 2013 project highlights and accomplishments
                                for this annual report (their names are mentioned after each project write-up). The editor would also like
                                to acknowledge Barbara Guttman, Kevin Stine, Jim Foti (ITL, NIST), Greg Witte, Chris Johnson and Doug
