                           specified within this Framework.
                           The unauthorized disclosure, modification, substitution or use of
Compromise                 sensitive data (e.g., keys, metadata, and other security-related
                           information).
                           A key lifecycle state in which a key is designated as
                           compromised and is not to be used to apply cryptographic
Compromised State
                           protection to data. Under certain circumstances, the key may be
                           used to process already-protected data.
                           To defeat cryptographic mechanisms, and more generally,
Cryptanalyze               information security services by the application of mathematical
                           techniques.
                           The use of one or more cryptographic techniques by a CKMS to

                           establish a trusted association between a key and selected
(Binding)
                           metadata elements.
                           An explicitly-defined perimeter that establishes the boundary of

                           A string of bits, integers, or characters that constitute a parameter
Cryptographic Key (Key)
                           to a cryptographic algorithm.
                           A system for the management of cryptographic keys and their

Management System
                           recovery, use, revocation, and destruction).
                           A set of hardware, software and/or firmware that implements
Cryptographic Module
                           security functions (e.g. cryptographic algorithms and key
