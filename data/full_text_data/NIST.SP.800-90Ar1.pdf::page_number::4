NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                                 Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                        Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


                         Reports on Computer Systems Technology

The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical leadership for the Nation’s
measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test methods, reference data, proof of
concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the development and productive use of
information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the development of management, administrative,
technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of other than
national security-related information in Federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series
reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its
collaborative activities with industry, government, and academic organizations.



                                                Abstract
This Recommendation specifies mechanisms for the generation of random bits using
deterministic methods. The methods provided are based on either hash functions or block cipher
algorithms.


                                               Keywords
Deterministic random bit generator (DRBG); entropy; hash function; random number generator.
