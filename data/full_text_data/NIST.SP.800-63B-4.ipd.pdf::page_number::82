2368   Multi-factor authenticators (e.g., multi-factor OTP devices, multi-factor cryptographic
2369   software, and multi-factor cryptographic devices) also inherit their secondary factorâ€™s
2370   usability considerations. As biometrics are only allowed as an activation factor in multi-
2371   factor authentication solutions, usability considerations for biometrics are not included in
2372   Figure 3 and are discussed in Sec. 10.4.
