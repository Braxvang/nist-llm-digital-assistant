              The contents of this publication can be used for many different assessment-related purposes
              to determine organizational compliance with the security requirements. The broad range of
              potential assessment methods and objects listed in this publication does not necessarily
              reflect and should not be directly associated with actual compliance or noncompliance.
              Rather, the selection of specific assessment methods and objects from the list provided can
              help generate a picture of overall compliance with the security requirements. There is no
              expectation about the number of methods or objects needed to determine compliance with
              the security requirements. Moreover, the entire list of potential assessment objects should
              not be viewed as required artifacts needed to determine compliance. Organizations have
              the flexibility to determine the specific methods and objects sufficient to obtain the needed
              evidence to support any claims of compliance.
