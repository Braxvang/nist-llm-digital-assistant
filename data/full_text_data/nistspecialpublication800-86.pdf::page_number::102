GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



The following are additional questions for this scenario:

    1. How would the forensic activity change if the DDoS attack appeared to be coming from a
       network in a different state? In a different country?

    2. How would the forensic activity change if the DDoS attack appeared to be coming from a
       business partner’s network?

Scenario 2: Online Payment Problems

Over the course of a week, the number of phone calls coming into the organization’s help line for online
bill presentment and payment increases by 400 percent. Most callers complain of having to resubmit
payment information multiple times, and many cannot complete their payment.

The following are additional questions for this scenario:

    1. The problems could have a non-technical cause, such as a lack of clear instructions for new users.
       How should the technical and non-technical aspects of the investigation be coordinated and
       balanced?

    2. How might privacy considerations affect the use of forensic tools and techniques?

    3. How would forensic tools and techniques be used if application developers were confident that an
       operational problem was causing the issues?

Scenario 3: Unknown Wireless Access Point

On a Monday morning, the organization’s help desk receives calls from five users on the same floor of a
building who state that they are having problems with their wireless access. A network administrator who
is asked to assist in resolving the problem brings a laptop with wireless capability to the users’ floor. As
he views his wireless networking configuration, he notices that there is a new wireless access point listed
as available. Based on the insecure configuration settings transmitted by the access point, the
administrator does not believe that his team deployed it.

The following are additional questions for this scenario:

    1. What types of forensic tools might be used to locate the access point overtly? Covertly?

    2. How would the forensic activities change if it was determined that the access point was deployed
       for a legitimate business purpose, such as temporary work at the office by a contractor?

    3. How would the forensic activities change if it was determined that an unknown individual had
       been seen deploying the access point?

Scenario 4: Reinfected Host

During the past 2 weeks, a user has needed to have the same virus removed from a laptop computer twice,
and the user is now reporting similar symptoms again. The technical support staff who handled the
previous infections confirmed that the antivirus software on the computer was enabled and up to date and
were unable to determine how the virus was reinfecting the computer.

The following are additional questions for this scenario:


                                                    B-2
