over the entire DNS message and a secret random string that is known by both
authoritative DNS servers in the transaction, and transmitting the result in a Transaction
Signature (TSIG) RR appended to the original message. Transaction authentication is
usually used for special transactions, such as zone transfers or dynamic updates. A zone
transfer is a special query type that is used to keep secondary authoritative servers up-to-
date with the most recent version of the zone data. Dynamic update is a feature that
allows an authorized administrator to add or delete DNS data by sending a specially
formatted message. This is frequently used in local area networks where the Dynamic
Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is used to assign IP addresses dynamically. The
DHCP server may update the DNS server by sending a dynamic update message to
reflect network changes.

The currently defined algorithms used in TSIG authentication are HMAC using SHA-1
and the SHA-2 family of hash algorithms (SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512).
The use of SHA-1 is acceptable for current security practices when using HMAC with a
suitably random secret string. All DNS server administrators taking part in the transaction
must agree on which algorithm and secret string size will be used for transaction
authentication and must ensure that all parties have the same secret random string (which
may include out-of-band transactions to distribute keys).

8.1.3       DNS Cryptographic Algorithms/Schemes, Modes and Combinations
DNS does not support algorithms in isolation, but specifies suites of algorithms and
schemes. Algorithm/scheme combinations for zone data signing and for message
authentication are provided in Table 8-1 ([RFC 6944], [RFC 6605]) and Table 8-2 ([RFC
3645], [RFC 4635]):
