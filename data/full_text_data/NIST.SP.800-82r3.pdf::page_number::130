NIST SP 800-82r3                                              Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

                       diverse location that cannot be destroyed by the same [hurricane,
                       wildfire, tornado] that may destroy the PLC).
                   •   Test the restoration process from backup data as part of
                       contingency plan testing.
                   •   Ensure that backup procedures are included in configuration or
                       change management processes.
                   •   Secure backups according to access control requirements.
                   •   Monitor environmental conditions where backup media is stored.

6.2.4.4.       Physical Operating Environment (PR.IP-5)
Managing the physical operating environment includes emergency protection controls, such as
emergency shutdown of the system, backup for power and lighting, controls for temperature and
humidity, and protection against fire and water damage. Organizations should develop policies
and procedures to ensure that environmental operating requirements for assets are achieved.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should consider the following factors when identifying
            potential countermeasures to protect the physical operating environment:
                   •   Environmental factors. Environmental factors can be important.
                       For example, if a site is dusty, systems should be placed in a
                       filtered environment, especially if the dust is likely to be
                       conductive or magnetic, as in the case of sites that process coal or
                       iron. If vibration is likely to be a problem, systems should be
                       mounted on rubber bushings to prevent disk crashes and wiring
                       connection problems. In addition, environments that contain
                       systems and media (e.g., backup tapes, floppy disks) should have
                       stable temperature and humidity. An alarm to the OT system
                       should be generated when environmental specifications, such as
                       temperature or humidity, are exceeded.
                   •   Environmental control systems. HVAC systems for control
                       rooms must support OT personnel during normal operation and
                       emergency situations, which could include the release of toxic
                       substances. Risk assessments should consider the risk of
                       operating an HVAC system (e.g., air intakes) in an occupied
                       shelter during a toxic release, as well as continued operation
                       during a power outage (e.g., using an uninterruptible power
                       supply in critical environments). Additionally, fire systems must
                       be carefully designed to avoid causing more harm than good
                       (e.g., to avoid mixing water with incompatible products). HVAC
                       and fire systems have significant roles that arise from the
                       interdependence of process control and security. For example,
                       fire prevention and HVAC systems that support industrial control
                       computers need to be protected against cyber incidents.
