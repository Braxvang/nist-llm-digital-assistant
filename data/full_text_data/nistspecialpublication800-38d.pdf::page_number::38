Appendix D: Protection Against Replay of Messages

As described in Appendix B, the successful verification of the tag within the authenticated
decryption function gives assurance of the authenticity of the data; however, the party that
presents the input data to the authenticated decryption function may not be the original source of
the plaintext and AAD. In other words, GCM, like many other authentication mechanisms, does
not inherently prevent an adversary from intercepting the output of an invocation of
authenticated encryption and “replaying” it for authenticated decryption at a later time, for
example, in an attempt to impersonate a party that has access to the key. In some protocols an
adversary may even be able to use data that the verifier itself generated earlier in the protocol.

The controlling system or protocol may protect against such an event by monitoring for any
duplication of the IVs that are presented for authenticated decryption. Alternatively, certain
identifying information can be incorporated into the AAD. Examples of such information
include a sequential message number or a timestamp. Upon successful verification of
authenticity, this information may provide a means for the detection of replayed messages, out-
of-sequence messages, or missing messages.
