9. Information Technology
   Contingency Planning
    Information technology (IT) contingency planning is one modular piece of a
larger contingency and continuity of operations (COOP) planning process that
encompasses IT, business processes, risk management, financial management, crisis
communications, safety and security of personnel and property, and continuity of
government. Each piece is operative in its own right, but in concert creates synergy
that efficiently and effectively protects the entire organization. 64
    Contingency planning for information systems is a required process for
developing general support systems (GSS) and major applications (MA) with
appropriate backup methods and procedures for implementing data recovery and
reconstitution against IT risks. 65 Risks to information systems may be natural,
technological, or human in nature. Contingency planning consists of a process for
recovery and documentation of procedures for conducting recovery. National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-34,
Contingency Planning for Information Technology Systems, details a seven-step
methodology for developing an IT contingency process and plan. Planning,
implementing, and testing the contingency strategy are addressed by six of the
seven steps; documenting the plan and establishing procedures and personnel
organization to implement the strategy is the final step. SP 800-34 also includes
technical considerations for developing recovery strategies.
   Figure 9-1 highlights contingency planning activities involved in each step that
should be addressed during all phases of the system development life cycle (SDLC). 66
    The capability to recover and reconstitute data should be integral to the
information system design concept during the Initiation phase. Recovery strategies
should be built into the GSS or MAâ€™s architecture during the Development phase. The
contingency processes should be tested and maintained during the Implementation
phase; contingency plans should be exercised and maintained during the
Operations/Maintenance phase. When the information system has reached the
Disposal phase, the legacy system should remain intact and operational as a
contingency to the replaced information system until, at least, the new system has
been sufficiently tested. At some point, the legacy system may no longer support
the needs of the organization, and the recovery strategy may transition away from
the legacy system to a new recovery strategy designed during the Development
phase of the new system.

   All departments and agencies must have IT contingency plans for certified and accredited systems and
   must also have an organizational Continuity of Operations (COOP) plan for essential federal functions.
