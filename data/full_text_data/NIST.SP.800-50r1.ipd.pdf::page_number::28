      NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                      Building a Cybersecurity and
      August 2023                                                                 Privacy Learning Program

       Step             Description
       Objectives       Based on the strategic goals, develop objectives that include distinct
                        measurable outcomes and the types of metrics associated with the program
                        element.
       Tactic           Based on the objectives, develop tactics (i.e., the mechanism that the CPLPs
                        will use to achieve a program objective in part or in full). Examples include a
                        phishing exercise to promote awareness of social engineering attacks,
                        enterprise-wide newsletters or other announcement mediums, webinars on
                        multi-factor authentication basics and procedures, or brainstorming sessions
                        with subject matter experts on scenario development.

699   The following two example scenarios demonstrate each of the implementation steps.
700   Scenario 1: Protecting Sensitive Printed PII
701   A physical security review of an area in the organization where sensitive personally identifiable
702   information (PII) is routinely handled by many employees finds that basic steps are not being
703   taken to maintain a “clean desk.” Privacy policy requires files that contain sensitive PII to be
704   kept in folders in locked cabinets. During the review, printed files containing sensitive PII were
705   located in paper stacks and in folders loosely placed on the top of the desks.
706   The organizational strategy is to improve the handling of printed sensitive PII and ensure that
707   personnel follow the protection requirements. The Learning Program Manager determines that a
708   fresh, eye-catching awareness product may encourage better employee adherence to policy and
709   reduce this risk.
710   An executive offers available funding dedicated to producing printed materials. The Learning
711   Program Manager may be able to utilize that funding to print “Keep It Clean” stickers to attach
712   to work folders and provide a case of such folders to each member of the workforce in the area
713   that handles sensitive PII materials.
714   In this example, the privacy Learning Program Manager participated in the continual monitoring
715   of the workplace and risks, coordinated the budget, planned the printing of the stickers, and
716   worked with management to deliver the materials. Because this is a one-time issue, the planning
717   steps were streamlined under the existing program.
718          Strategy – Meet privacy compliance requirements
719          Strategic Goal – Support the organization’s Privacy Program
720          Objective – Ensure that all employees who handle sensitive PII are trained and aware of
721          privacy responsibilities
722          Tactic – Provide “Keep It Clean” stickers on folders to each employee in areas of the
723          organization where sensitive PII is processed
724
725   Scenario 2: Developing new regulatory-required training program
726   A new regulation requires all cybersecurity professionals to implement a specific procedure in
727   their daily routines.
