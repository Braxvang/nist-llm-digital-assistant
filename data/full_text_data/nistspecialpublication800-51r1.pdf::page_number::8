accessing CVE entries. NVD offers CVE search capabilities, as well as a variety of XML and RSS data
feeds with CVE entries and supplemental information to support security automation technologies. NVD

The MITRE Corporation maintains information on the use of CVE. Vendors that include CVE identifiers
in their security advisories are listed at http://cve.mitre.org/compatible/alerts_announcements.html.
Products and services that have been reviewed and evaluated by the MITRE Corporation and determined
to be “CVE-compatible”, which means that they meet a set of CVE requirements, are listed at

2.2   Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) 5

The CCE 5 vulnerability naming scheme is for a dictionary of names for software security configuration
settings. Each type of security-related configuration issue is assigned a unique identifier to facilitate fast
and accurate correlation of configuration data across multiple information sources and products.

There are five attributes in a CCE entry: a unique identifier number, a description of the configuration
issue, logical parameters of the CCE, the associated technical mechanisms related to the CCE, and
references to additional sources of information. Figure 2 provides an example of these attributes for a
CCE 5 entry for Windows XP.

          CCE ID:         CCE-3108-8
