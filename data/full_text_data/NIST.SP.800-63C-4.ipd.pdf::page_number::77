       NIST SP 800-63C-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                                      Federation and Assertions


2006      • For attribute sharing, consider the following:
2007           – Provide a means for users to verify those attributes and attribute values that
2008             will be shared. Follow good security practices (see Sec. 7.3 and Sec. 8).
2009           – Enable users to consent to a partial list of attributes, rather than an all-or-
2010             nothing approach. Allow users some degree of online access, even if the user
2011             does not consent to share all information.
2012           – Allow users to update their consent to their list of shared attributes.
2013           – Minimize unnecessary information presented to users. For example, do
2014             not display system generated attributes (such as pairwise pseudonymous
2015             identifiers) even if they are shared with the RP as part of the authentication
2016             response.
2017           – Minimize user steps and navigation. For example, build attribute consent into
2018             the protocols so they’re not a feature external to the federated transaction.
2019             Examples can be found in standards such as OAuth or OpenID Connect.
2020           – Provide effective and efficient redress methods such that a user can recover
2021             from invalid attribute information claimed by the IdP or collected by the RP.
2022           – Minimize the number of times a user is required to consent to attribute sharing.
2023             Limiting the frequency of consent requests avoids user frustration from
2024             multiple requests to share the same attribute.
2025      • Collect information for constrained usage only, and minimize information
2026        disclosure (see Sec. 9.3). User trust is eroded by unnecessary and superfluous
2027        information collection and disclosure or user tracking without explicit user consent.
2028        For example, only request attributes from the user that are relevant to the current
2029        transaction, not for all possible transactions a user may or may not access at the RP.
2030      • Clearly and honestly communicate potential benefits and risks of using federated
2031        identity to users. Benefits that users value include time savings, ease of use,
2032        reduced number of passwords to manage, and increased convenience.
2033   User concern over risk can negatively influence willingness to adopt federated identity
2034   systems. Users may have trust concerns, privacy concerns, security concerns, and single-
2035   point-of-failure concerns. For example, users may be fearful of losing access to multiple
2036   RPs if a single IdP is unavailable, either temporarily or permanently. Additionally, users
2037   may be concerned or confused about learning a new authentication process. In order to
2038   foster the adoption of federated identity systems, the perceived benefits must outweigh
2039   the perceived risks.
