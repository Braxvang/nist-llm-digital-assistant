NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                          GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


In each case, the client verifies the digital signatures on the DNS records in accordance with the
DNSSEC as described in RFC 4033 [2].

E.3      Encrypted Server Name Indication

More information is encrypted in the TLS 1.3 handshake than in earlier versions of TLS;
however, the client still sends the server name indication (SNI) extension (see Section 3.4.1.2) to
the server in plain text. This means that an eavesdropper can determine the domain name of the
server to which a client is connecting even if the eavesdropper was unable to listen in on the
clientâ€™s DNS lookup and even if the server is hosting multiple domain names at the same IP
address.

The TLS working group is working on the development of a mechanism for SNI encryption,
which would allow the client to send the SNI to the server in encrypted form so that this
information would not be accessible to eavesdroppers [35, 58]. Enabling support for this
mechanism in TLS clients and servers would provide an additional level of privacy to TLS
clients.
