In the following schemes, the initial steps of a scheme specified in Sections 4.3.1 - 4.3.3
are executed first, with the following changes:
   •   user_supplied_info becomes user_supplied_info1,
   •   the other_info within user_supplied_info1 becomes other_info1.
   •   TTA_supplied_info becomes TTA_supplied_info1,
   •   timestamp becomes timestamp1,
   •   TTA becomes TTA1 (alternatively represented as TTA1 in a subscript), and
   •   TSP becomes TSP1.
The schemes indicate the use of two TTAs: TTA1 and TTA2. TTA2 may, in fact, be the
same TTA as TTA1.

4.4.1 Entity A Requests the Second Timestamp
Both timestamps may be obtained by entity A. The TTA(s) providing the timestamps
must be trusted by both entity A and entity B, and also by any third party that needs to be
convinced of the signature generation time.
Figure 5 shows that the first timestamp is obtained as specified in Section 4.3.1, 4.3.2, or
4.3.3, after which entity A requests a second timestamp. The first two steps are the same
as those specified for the schemes in 4.3.1 - 4.3.3.

 Figure 5: After Using a Scheme from 4.3, Entity A Requests a Second Timestamp
The process continues as follows:
   3. Entity A generates SIGA(M, TSP1) and sends it (and possibly other information)
      to TTA2 in a second timestamp request, i.e., user_supplied_info2 =


                                                                       19
