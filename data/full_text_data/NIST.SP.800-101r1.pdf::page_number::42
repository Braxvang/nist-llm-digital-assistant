                                                              Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics

             Shielded Containers - A portable shielded container may allow examinations to be
              conducted safely once the phone is situated inside. Cables connected to the container
              must be fully isolated to prevent network communications from occurring. This
              method is one of the most frequently used.

             Shielded Work Areas - Shielding an entire work area can be an expensive but
              effective way to conduct examinations safely in a fixed location. A “Faraday tent” is a
              cheaper alternative that also allows portability. Feeding cables into the tent is
              problematic, however, since without proper isolation they can behave as an antenna,
              defeating the purpose of the tent. The workspace may also be very restrictive.

             Disabling Network Service - The cellular carrier providing service to the mobile
              device might be able to disable service. The service provider or network operator must
              be determined and contacted with details identifying the service to be disabled (e.g.,
              the equipment identifier, subscriber identifier, phone number). Such information is not
              always readily available, however, and the coordination and confirmation process
              may also impose delays.

             Jamming/Spoofing Devices - Emitting a signal stronger than a cell phone’s or
              interfering with the signal rendering communication useless. Another technique
              involves tricking the phone into thinking a “no service” signal is coming from the
              nearest cell tower. Because such devices may affect communications in the
              surrounding public airspace beyond the examination area, unlicensed use may be
              illegal in some jurisdictions. [NIJ05]

4.3.3 Cellular Network Isolation Cards

      Some tools have the ability to create a Cellular Network Isolation Card (CNIC) [SWG13].
      CNICs provide cellular network isolation preventing network communication that may modify
      data contained on a mobile device (e.g., remote wiping, incoming text messages). A CNIC
      lacks specific data elements required to establish connectivity between the mobile device and
      its associated network. For example, CNIC’s do not contain a cipher key, thus preventing
      access with a cellular network. A CNIC may be required for mobile device data extraction, as
      some phones are unable to boot without a UICC present.

      Some tool manufacturers and vendors refer to this as a “SIM clone.” The creation of a CNIC
      is not a true clone of the source UICC, because the authentication key and other user data are
      not copied in the cloning process.

      A CNIC may be created either by the examiner using the original UICC as a source or by
      entering the data manually. Manual entry is helpful if the UICC associated with a specific
      mobile device is not present. CNICs are tool specific; they are not interchangeable between the
      tools of various manufacturers. CNICs vary in their effectiveness and support, based on
      specific mobile devices. For example, CNICs may not be used for data extraction from TDMA
      devices.

      Occasionally, a UICC may not be present with a mobile device, or may be intentionally
      damaged, but necessary for data acquisition. One of the most common mistakes forensic
      examiners make is to insert a foreign UICC into the mobile device to facilitate data acquisition.
      Some mobile devices are linked to a specific UICC. When this linkage exists, booting a mobile
      device with a foreign UICC causes data elements such as: call logs (missed, incoming and
                                                 32
