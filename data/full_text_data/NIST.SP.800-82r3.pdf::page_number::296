compensating controls, depending on the system being scanned. For example, vulnerability
examination may be performed using passive monitoring and manual visual inspection to
maintain an up-to-date inventory of assets. That inventory can be cross-referenced against a list
of known vulnerabilities (e.g., CISA advisories, NIST NVD). Production may need to be taken
offline before active scans can be conducted. Scans are scheduled to occur during planned OT
outages whenever possible. If vulnerability scanning tools are used on adjacent non-OT
networks, extra care is taken to ensure that they do not mistakenly scan the OT network.
Automated network scanning is not applicable to non-routable communications, such as serial
networks. Compensating controls include providing a replicated or simulated system for
conducting scans or host-based vulnerability applications.
Control Enhancement: (2) (5) No OT Discussion for this control.
Control Enhancement: (4) OT Discussion: Examples of discoverable information in OT could
include information about key personnel or technical information related to systems and
configurations. Locations that may need to be monitored or scanned include technical forums,
blogs, and vendor or contractor websites.
Control Enhancement: (11) OT Discussion: For federal organizations, CISA Binding Operational
Directive 20-01 requires individual federal civilian executive branch agencies to develop and
publish a vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP) for their internet-accessible systems and services
and maintain processes to support their VDP. A VDP may be implemented at the organization
level rather than for each individual system. Federal and non-federal organizations could achieve
this control by creating and monitoring an email address published on a public-facing website for
contacting the organization regarding disclosures.
