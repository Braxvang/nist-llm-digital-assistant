                                                                                       SECTION 5: RFID SECURITY CONTROLS



 Perimeter protection, including port and protocol restrictions for network traffic between the RF and
  enterprise subsystems and between the enterprise subsystem and a public network or extranet,
 Password management, particularly with respect to the generation, distribution, and storage of tagsâ€™
  access, lock, and kill passwords,
 Management system security for readers and middleware, including the use and protection of SNMP
  read and write community strings, 41
 RFID security training for system administrators and operators, and
 Management of associated cryptographic systems, including certification authorities and key
  management.
Applicability: All RFID implementations, particularly those with enterprise subsystems or inter-
enterprise subsystems.

Benefits: Well-crafted security policies govern the mitigation of business risks associated with the use of
RFID technologies. The policies provide requirements and guidelines for the individuals designing,
implementing, using, and maintaining RFID systems. For example, IT policies help the personnel
designing RFID systems or procuring system components to make appropriate decisions. Similarly, they
help system administrators correctly implement and configure software and related network components.

Weaknesses: The existence of a policy does not ensure compliance with the policy. A policy needs to be
coupled with the implementation and enforcement of appropriate operational and technical controls to be
effective.

5.1.3    Agreements with External Organizations

Control: When data associated with an RFID system needs to be shared across organizational
boundaries, formal agreements among the participating organizations can codify the roles and
responsibilities, and in some cases the legal liability, of each organization. These formal agreements are
usually documented as a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).
The MOU or MOA specifies the network connections and authentication mechanisms to be used, the data
to be shared, and the manner in which data should be protected both in transit and at rest. It may also
address controls on vendors, subcontractors, and other third parties to the extent they have access to the
system. 42

If the inter-enterprise application requires tag passwords to be shared across organizations, then the MOU
or MOA should specify how these passwords will be generated, stored, and shared. The memorandum
may specify IT security controls such as methods of authentication, access control, or encryption that
participating organizations shall implement to protect the passwords.

Applicability: Any RFID system involving more than one organization, which is most common in
supply chain applications.

     SNMP community strings are passwords that provide anyone with an SNMP management client and network access the
     ability to manage the associated systems. Knowledge of the read community string provides the holder the ability to view
     the system configuration and track system behavior. Knowledge of the write community string provides the holder the
     ability to reconfigure system components.
