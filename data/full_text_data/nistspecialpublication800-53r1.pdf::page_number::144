SI-9      INFORMATION INPUT RESTRICTIONS

          Control: The organization restricts the capability to input information to the information system to
          authorized personnel.
          Supplemental Guidance: Restrictions on personnel authorized to input information to the
          information system may extend beyond the typical access controls employed by the system and
          include limitations based on specific operational/project responsibilities.
          Control Enhancements: None.

SI-10     INFORMATION ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, VALIDITY, AND AUTHENTICITY

          Control: The information system checks information for accuracy, completeness, validity, and
          authenticity.
          Supplemental Guidance: Checks for accuracy, completeness, validity, and authenticity of
          information are accomplished as close to the point of origin as possible. Rules for checking the
          valid syntax of information system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, acceptable
          values) are in place to verify that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Inputs
          passed to interpreters are prescreened to prevent the content from being unintentionally interpreted
          as commands. The extent to which the information system is able to check the accuracy,
          completeness, validity, and authenticity of information is guided by organizational policy and
          operational requirements.
          Control Enhancements: None.

SI-11     ERROR HANDLING

          Control: The information system identifies and handles error conditions in an expeditious manner
          without providing information that could be exploited by adversaries.
          Supplemental Guidance: The structure and content of error messages are carefully considered by the
          organization. Error messages are revealed only to authorized personnel. Error messages
          generated by the information system provide timely and useful information without revealing
          potentially harmful information that could be used by adversaries. Sensitive information (e.g.,
          account numbers, social security numbers, and credit card numbers) are not listed in error logs or
          associated administrative messages. The extent to which the information system is able to identify
          and handle error conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements.
          Control Enhancements: None.
