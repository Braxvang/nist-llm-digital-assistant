                                                                 GUIDELINES ON ACTIVE CONTENT AND MOBILE CODE



5.2.1   Filters

Once forms of malicious content have been identified and understood, filtering can be used to detect and
eliminate or completely block malicious content from entry. Many enterprise firewalls can filter email
and Web pages for well-known file extensions and block them at the point of entry, following configured
screening rules. More sophisticated ingress gateway filters can block or disable malicious code conveyed
as active content. Desktop antivirus software has become increasingly capable of detecting active content
having a malicious code signature. Client applications such as browsers, email, and word processors can
also be configured to disable or ignore some forms of mobile code. Figure 5-1 gives a general overview
of filtering performed on incoming active content, under the producer-consumer model presented earlier.

Besides ingress filtering, egress filtering, which filters outgoing network traffic, is also useful in denying
unacceptable actions originating from internal hosts. Strange or unexpected, but not necessarily
unacceptable, transmissions from internal hosts may signal that they have been compromised in some
way. Intrusion detection systems provide an additional safeguard for screening network and host
behavior and provide notification when either inappropriate or unusual event sequences occur, or
signatures of known exploits are matched.

While firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection tools provide useful safeguards, they are not
foolproof. Constructing a program to detect with certainty the presence or absence of harmful code
within arbitrary programs or protocol is impossible. Moreover, a variety of techniques exists for
deception such as mutation, segmentation, and disguise via extended character set encoding. Thus,
filtering tools are faced with the prospect of diminishing returns â€“ greater investments are needed for
small increases in effectiveness. Despite services to refresh protection software with signatures of known
exploits, and cascaded defense-in-depth measures, apart from total isolation there is no guarantee that
something harmful cannot get through.
