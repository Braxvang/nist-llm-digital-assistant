    • Federal awarding agencies are allowed under OMB Circular A-110 to require that
      institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other non-proft organizations that
      receive federal grants provide the U.S. Government with “the right to (1) obtain,
      reproduce, publish or otherwise use the data frst produced under an award; and
      (2) authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use such data for
      Federal Purposes” [120, see §36 (c) (1) and (2)]. To realize this policy, awarding
      agencies can require that awardees establish data management plans for making re-
      search data publicly available. Such data are used for a variety of purposes, including
      transparency and reproducibility. In general, research data that contain personal in-
      formation should be de-identifed by the awardee prior to public release. Awarding
      agencies may establish de-identifcation standards to ensure the protection of per-
      sonal information and may consider audits to ensure that awardees have performed
      de-identifcation in an appropriate manner.
    • Federal research agencies may wish to make de-identifed data available to the pub-
      lic to further the objectives of research transparency and allow others to reproduce
      and build upon their results. These agencies are generally prohibited from publish-
      ing research data that contain personal information, thus requiring the use of de-
      identifcation.
    • All federal agencies that wish to make administrative or operational data available
      for transparency, accountability, or program oversight or to enable academic research
      may wish to employ de-identifcation to avoid sharing the sensitive personally iden-
      tifable information of employees, customers, or others. These agencies may wish to
      evaluate the effectiveness of simple feld suppression, de-identifcation that involves
      aggregation, and the creation and release of synthetic data as alternatives for realizing
      their commitment to open data.
Agencies may wish to seek legal guidance as to whether or not de-identifcation is permitted
and what laws, regulations, and policies – if any – would cover de-identifed data.

3.2.   Evaluating the Risks and Benefts That Arise from De-Identifed Data
       Releases
Once the purpose of the data release is understood, agencies should identify the risks that
might result from the data release and weigh them against the possible benefts.
Risk assessments should be based on objective scientifc factors and consider the best in-
terests of the individuals in the dataset, the responsibilities of the agency holding the data,
and the anticipated benefts to society. The goal of a risk evaluation is not to eliminate risk
but to identify risks that can be reduced while still meeting the objectives of the data re-
lease, and then deciding whether the residual risk is justifed by the data release goals. An
agency decision-making process may choose to accept or reject the risk that might result
from a release of de-identifed data, but participants in the risk assessment should not be
