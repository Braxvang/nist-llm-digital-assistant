Systems and Organizations, which defines minimum recommended management, operational, and
technical controls for information systems based on impact categories.

5.1     Initiation

The initiation phase involves many preparatory actions, such as identifying current and future needs, and
specifying requirements for performance, functionality, and security. A critical part of the initiation phase
is the development of a virtualization security policy. The section lists elements that a virtualization
security policy should contain and, where relevant, describes some of the factors that should be
considered when making the decisions behind each element. A virtualization security policy should define
which forms of virtualization the organization permits and which types of applications and data are
permitted to be used with each form of virtualization. It should also cover how the organization's
virtualization solutions are administered and how their policies are updated. Note that some virtualization
security policies will inherently prevent certain types of virtualization from being selected during the
initiation process.

In addition to the considerations described in this section for virtualization security policies, organizations
should also consider how other security policies may be affected by virtualization and adjust these
policies as needed to take virtualization into consideration.

Organizations should be aware of how their use of virtualization may affect the security categorization of
the physical system. The security categories associated with Federal information system based on three
security objectives: confidentiality, integrity and availability. These security categories are described in
NIST FIPS 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems.
The security categorization of a particular information system depends on the potential impact associated
with a loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability. If a system hosts guest OSs with different impact
levels, the system should be secured in accordance with the highest of those levels. The organization’s
virtualization security policy should define how combining multiple guest OSs on a single system affects
the system’s security requirements, both positively and negatively, and which combinations of guest OSs
are permitted or prohibited. Organizations may also choose to reduce risk by prohibiting combinations
that include resources accessing particular types of information, such as highly sensitive personally
identifiable information (PII). 3

Every year, there are many changes in virtualization capabilities, the security controls available to
organizations, the types of threats against different types of virtualization, and so on. Therefore,
organizations should periodically reassess their policies for virtualization. Organizations should also be
aware of the emergence of new types of virtualization solutions and of major changes to existing
virtualization technologies, and ensure that policies are updated accordingly as needed.

5.2     Planning and Design

Once the organization has established a virtualization security policy, identified virtualization needs, and
completed other preparatory activities, the next step is to determine which types of virtualization
technologies should be used and to design a solution to deploy. There are many considerations for
designing a solution, most of which are generally applicable to any IT technology. This section focuses on
the technical security considerations that are most important for designing virtualization solutions. Major
considerations include the following:
