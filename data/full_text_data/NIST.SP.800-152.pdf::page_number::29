SP 800-152                                                     A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


4.2    Information Security Policy

An organization’s Information Security Policy is created to support and enforce portions of
the organization’s Information Management Policy by specifying in more detail what
information is to be protected from anticipated threats and how that protection is to be
attained. A Federal organization may have different Information Security Policies covering
different applications or categories of information (e.g., the policies may be different for non-
personnel information than for personnel information).

The Information Security Policy should be used to create an FCKMS Security Policy (see
Section 4.3).

                 PL-1        A Federal CKMS using-organization shall create an
PR:4.2
                 RA-2        Information Security Policy that is consistent with the
                             organization’s Information Management Policy and
                             specifies:
                               a) The categories of information that are considered
                                  sensitive;
                               b) The impact-level associated with the sensitive
                                  information;
                               c) The current, anticipated, and potential threats to the
                                  information;
                               d) How the necessary protection is to be obtained; and
                               e) The rules for collecting, protecting and distributing the
                                  sensitive information.

4.3    CKMS and FCKMS Security Policies

This Profile is based on the assumption that a CKMS designer will either build a product that
supports the specific policies of its known potential customers or one that is comprehensive
and flexible enough to be configured to satisfy different security policies for a large number
of future customers.

A CKMS designer creates a CKMS Security Policy to protect the cryptographic keys and
metadata used by the CKMS and to enforce restrictions associated with their use. The
protections should cover the entire key lifecycle, including when they are operational, stored,
and transported. A CKMS Security Policy includes an identification of all cryptographic
mechanisms and cryptographic protocols that can be used by the CKMS.

The FCKMS Security Policy of a security domain should be derived from the Information
Management policies of all organizations comprising the security domain. All entities that
constitute a security domain are responsible for being aware of and following the FCKMS
Security Policy. All entities in the domain are responsible for protecting the keys and
associated metadata used to cryptographically protect data in accordance with the FCKMS
Security Policy.
