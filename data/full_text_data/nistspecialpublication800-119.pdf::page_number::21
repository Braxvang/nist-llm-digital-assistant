                                                               GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


 Develop a granular ICMPv6 filtering policy for the enterprise. Ensure that ICMPv6 messages that are
  essential to IPv6 operation are allowed, but others are blocked.
 Use IPsec to authenticate and provide confidentiality to assets that can be tied to a scalable trust
  model (an example is access to Human Resources assets by internal employees that make use of an
  organization’s Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to establish trust).
 Identify capabilities and weaknesses of network protection devices in an IPv6 environment.
 Enable controls that might not have been used in IPv4 due to a lower threat level during initial
  deployment (implementing default deny access control policies, implementing routing protocol
  security, etc).
 Pay close attention to the security aspects of transition mechanisms such as tunneling protocols.
 On networks that are IPv4-only, block all IPv6 traffic.

2.5   Motivations for Deploying IPv6

IP technologies were invented in the United States, and the early adoption of those technologies occurred
predominantly in the United States. As mentioned in Section 2.2, early address allocation policies were
relatively relaxed and large quantities of IPv4 addresses were assigned upon request, even when those
allocations were not thoroughly justified. This resulted in a high concentration of IPv4 address
allocations in the United States, with more than half of all routable IPv4 addresses assigned to U.S.-based
organizations. Some large U.S.-based Internet backbone service providers have more IPv4 addresses than
all of the nations that comprise the Asian region of the world.

These circumstances have left most of the world, especially Asia, with little choice other than to adopt the
IPv6 specification if they are to become pervasive participants in IP technologies or the global Internet at
large. Nations such as Japan have built IPv6-capable Internet infrastructures to support their growing
demand for Internet connectivity. Further, the advanced state of wireless telecommunications in Asia
produced an environment where globally unique IP addresses are required to enable the features of Third
Generation (3G) wireless technologies. In essence, every mobile 3G device becomes a mobile personal
computing platform, and each of those devices requires true end-to-end connectivity to realize its full
potential.

All organizations making use of IP networking should study and consider IPv6’s feature set when
designing and managing their networks. Even with no intent to replace IPv4, the IPv6 security controls
discussed later in this document should be planned and deployed to detect unauthorized use of IPv6.
Fundamental knowledge of IPv6—what it is, what its attributes are, and how it operates—is critical to
any organization.

As the IPv6 protocol becomes increasingly ubiquitous, all enterprise and Internet-connected networks
need to be prepared for specific threats and vulnerabilities that the new protocol will bring. For example,
an IPv4-only network segment may contain several newly installed hosts that are both IPv4 and IPv6-
capable, as well as hosts that have IPv6 enabled by default. This circumstance can come about simply as
a result of the normal systems life cycles. Additionally, IPv6 could be enabled on a host by an attacker to
circumvent security controls that may not be IPv6-aware; these hosts can then be leveraged to create
covert or backdoor channels. Taken further, IPv6 traffic could be encapsulated within IPv4 packets using
readily available tools and services and exchanged with malicious hosts via the Internet.

Interoperability of geographically dispersed Internet-connected nodes may become a profit motivation for
some organizations to deploy IPv6. For instance, content providers are making more multimedia features
