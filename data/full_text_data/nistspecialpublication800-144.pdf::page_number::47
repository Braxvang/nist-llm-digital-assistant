5.    Public Cloud Outsourcing
Although cloud computing is a new computing paradigm, outsourcing information technology
services is not. The steps that organizations take remain basically the same for public clouds as
with other, more traditional, information technology services, and existing guidelines for
outsourcing generally apply as well. What does change with public cloud computing, however,
is the potential for increased complexity and difficulty in providing adequate oversight to
maintain accountability and control over deployed applications and systems throughout their
lifecycle. This can be especially daunting if the terms of the service agreement do not fully meet
the needs of the organization, since responsibilities normally held by the organization are given
over to the cloud provider and, without sufficient provisions, the organization would have little
recourse to address problems and resolve to its satisfaction issues that may arise. That is, the
service agreement is the primary means for an organization to enforce control and maintain
accountability over the computing environment. If any needed requirements or sureties are
missing, accountability is threatened accordingly.

The record for traditional information technology outsourcing is mixed with respect to security
and privacy, and not consistently done well by federal agencies (e.g., [GAO06, GAO10]). As
discussed in the previous chapter, transitioning organizational data and functions into a public
cloud is accompanied by a host of security and privacy issues to be addressed, many of which
concern the adequacy of the cloud provider’s technical controls for an organization’s needs.
Service arrangements defined in the terms of service must also meet the privacy policy of the
organization and the prevailing laws and regulations for information protection, dissemination,
and disclosure to which the organization must comply. Each cloud provider and service
arrangement has distinct costs and risks associated with it. A decision based on any one issue
can have major implications for the organization in other areas [Gra03].

Considering the growing number of public cloud providers and the broad range of services
offered by them, organizations must exercise due diligence when selecting and moving functions
to a public cloud. Decision making about services and service arrangements entails striking a
balance between benefits in cost and productivity versus drawbacks in risk and liability. While
the sensitivity of data handled by government organizations and the current state of the art make
the likelihood of outsourcing all information technology services to a public cloud low, it should
be possible for most government organizations to deploy some of their information technology
services to a public cloud, provided that all requisite risk mitigations are taken.


         Cloud Transition Case Study: The City of Los Angeles’ initiative to move to cloud
         computing provides insight to the planning involved and the issues that can arise [CSC10].
         The effort involves switching the city’s electronic mail and calendaring system from an on-
         site solution to a public SaaS cloud that provides those services, and adding capabilities to
         improve productivity and collaboration [CSC10, DPW10, SECS09]. User training and
         electronic mail migration are also part of the contracted effort, which the City entered into
         on November 20, 2009.

         In its analysis of the proposed contract [CAO09], the Office of the City Administrative
         Officer gave a qualified recommendation to proceed, noting that “If the City decides to utilize
