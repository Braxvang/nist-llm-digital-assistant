      NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                 Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card
      December 2023                                                        and Derived PIV Credential Issuers

113   Note to Reviewers
114   NIST SP 800-79r3 ipd, Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card and Derived PIV
115   Credential Issuers, expands the set of issuer controls to include new and updated requirements
116   from FIPS 201-3, its supporting updated publications (e.g., SP 800-157r1, SP 800-76r2, etc.) and
117   newly-issued OMB Memoranda aimed at achieving compliance with federal requirements with
118   regard to identity proofing and the issuance of a common and reliable form of a primary and
119   derived identity credential.
120   NIST is specifically interested in comments on and recommendations for the following topics:
121       1. Are the new and updated controls for identity proofing and the issuance and maintenance
122          of PIV Cards and derived PIV credentials clear and practical to implement?
123       2. Is it easy to determine where the updated controls need to be implemented (i.e., at the
124          enterprise level, issuing facility level, or both)?
125       3. Are the new controls for derived PIV credentials sufficient to provide comparable
126          assurance for PIV Cards?
127   NIST requests that all comments be submitted by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on
128   January 29, 2024. Please submit comments to piv_comments@nist.gov. NIST will review all
129   comments and make them available on the NIST Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC)
130   website. Commenters are encouraged to use the comment template provided on the NIST CSRC
131   website.
