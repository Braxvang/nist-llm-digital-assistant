      NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                            Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                              Enrollment and Identity Proofing


548   4.3.3.1. Fair Evidence Requirements
549   In order to be considered FAIR, identity evidence SHALL meet all the following
550   requirements:
551     1. The issuing source of the evidence confirmed the claimed identity through an
552        identity proofing process.
553     2. It can be reasonably assumed that the evidence issuing process would result in the
554        delivery of the evidence to the person to whom it relates.
555     3. The evidence contains at least one reference number, a facial portrait, or sufficient
556        attributes to uniquely identify the person to whom it relates.
557     4. The evidence has not expired or it expired within the previous six (6) months, or it
558        was issued within the previous six (6) months if it does not contain an expiration
559        date.

560   4.3.3.2. Strong Evidence Requirements
561   In order to be considered STRONG, identity evidence SHALL meet all the following
562   requirements:
563     1. The issuing source of the evidence confirmed the claimed identity through written
564        procedures designed to enable it to form a reasonable belief that it knows the real-
565        life identity of the person. Such procedures are subject to recurring oversight
566        by regulatory or publicly-accountable institutions. For example, the Customer
567        Identification Program guidelines established in response to the USA PATRIOT
568        Act of 2001 or the [RedFlagsRule], under Sec. 114 of the Fair and Accurate Credit
569        Transaction Act of 2003 (FACT Act).
570     2. There is a high likelihood that the evidence issuing process would result in the
571        delivery of the evidence to the person to whom it relates.
572     3. The evidence contains a reference number or other attributes that uniquely identify
573        the person to whom it relates.
574     4. The evidence contains a facial portrait or other biometric characteristic of the
575        person to whom it relates.
576     5. The evidence includes physical security features that make it difficult to copy or
577        reproduce.
578     6. The evidence includes an expiration date and is unexpired.
