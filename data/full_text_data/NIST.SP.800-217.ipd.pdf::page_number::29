      NIST SP 800-217 ipd                       Guidelines for PIV Federation (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


745   4.2. Selecting FAL
746   Agencies SHALL select the FAL appropriate for a given RP using the digital identity
747   risk management process specified in [SP800-63]. Notwithstanding the results of that
748   process specifying a higher assurance level, agencies SHOULD use federation protocols,
749   architectures, and processes compliant with FAL2 or higher to maximize the assurance
750   provided by the management of the PIV identity accounts.
751   When not practical to deploy federation at FAL2 in low-impact use cases, agencies
752    MAY elect to use FAL1 technologies and processes, in accordance with their digital
753   identity risk management process. In such cases, the risk assessment SHALL consider
754   the potential impact of risks associated with the FAL1 mechanisms that will be used.
755   This could include assertion injection attacks associated with front-channel presentation
756   mechanisms or acceptance of outdated attributes associated with use of PIV IdPs that are
757   not the subjectsâ€™ home IdPs.
