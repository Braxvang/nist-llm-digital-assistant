GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



sound.) Daily log reviews should include those entries that have been deemed most likely to be
important, as well as some of the entries that are not yet fully understood. Because it can take
considerable effort to understand the significance of most log entries, the initial days, weeks, or even
months of performing the log analysis process are the most challenging and time-consuming. Over time,
as the baseline of normal activity is broadened and deepened, the daily log reviews should take less time
and be more focused on the most important log entries, thus leading to more valuable analysis results.

Another motivation for understanding the log entries is so that the analysis process can be automated as
much as possible. By determining which types of log entries are of interest and which are not,
administrators can configure automated filtering of the log entries.59 This allows events known to be
malicious to be recognized and responded to automatically (e.g., alerting administrators, reconfiguring
other security controls). Another purpose for filtering is to ensure that the manual analysis performed by
administrators is prioritized appropriately. The filtering should be configured so that it presents
administrators with a reasonable number of entries for manual analysis. One effective technique is to
have two reports: one for the entries thought to be most important, and another for entries that are not yet
fully understood. Both reports should be reviewed regularly, but the first report should be treated as a
higher priority than the second report. If the review of the second report is not performed frequently, the
logging baseline might not be expanded and refined sufficiently.

5.2.2     Prioritizing Log Entries

Prioritizing the analysis of log entries can be challenging. Although some log sources assign their own
priorities to each entry, these priorities often use inconsistent scales or ratings (e.g., high/medium/low, 1
to 5, 1 to 10), which makes it challenging to compare priority values. Also, the criteria used by different
products to prioritize entries are likely to be based on different sets of requirements, some or all of which
might be inconsistent with the organization’s requirements. Accordingly, organizations should consider
assigning their own priorities to log entries based on a combination of factors, including the following:

      Entry type (e.g., message code 103, message class CRITICAL)
      Newness of the entry type (i.e., has this type of entry appeared in the logs before?)
      Log source
      Source or destination IP address (e.g., source address on a blacklist, destination address of a
       critical system, previous events involving a particular IP address)
      Time of day or day of the week (e.g., an entry might be acceptable during certain times but not
       permitted during others)
      Frequency of the entry (e.g., x times in y seconds).
Prioritization might also include the use of correlation to provide context for log entries so that they can
be validated. For example, suppose that host-based intrusion detection software monitors an apparent file
modification attack on a system. If the host’s OS log contains an auditing entry that indicates the file was
modified successfully, and the data from the two log entries is correlated together, it would provide a
stronger assurance of a successful attack than either log source would alone, and it would also likely
contain more data on the attack than either individual source would have recorded. Another example of
using correlation as a factor for prioritization is using information on known vulnerabilities in the

     As described in Section 3.1, filtering does not alter the content of the original logs—it simply restricts which log entries are
     used for analysis. The filtered entries in the original log data might be needed for any number of reasons, including
     providing context for other entries and identifying long-term security problems through trend analysis.
