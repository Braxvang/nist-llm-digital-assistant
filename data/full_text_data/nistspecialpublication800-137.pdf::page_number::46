APPENDIX B
GLOSSARY
COMMON TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

This appendix provides definitions for security terminology used within Special Publication 800-
137. The terms in the glossary are consistent with the terms used in the suite of FISMA-related
security standards and guidelines developed by NIST. Unless otherwise stated, all terms used in
this publication are also consistent with the definitions contained in the CNSS Instruction 4009,
National Information Assurance Glossary.

 Activities                   An assessment object that includes specific protection-related
 [NISTIR 7298]                pursuits or actions supporting an information system that involve
                              people (e.g., conducting system backup operations, monitoring
                              network traffic).

 Adequate Security            Security commensurate with the risk and the magnitude of harm
 [OMB Circular A-130,         resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or
 Appendix III]                modification of information. This includes assuring that systems
                              and applications used by the agency operate effectively and
                              provide appropriate confidentiality, integrity, and availability,
                              through the use of cost-effective management, personnel,
                              operational, and technical controls.

 Advanced Persistent          An adversary with sophisticated levels of expertise and
 Threats                      significant resources, allowing it through the use of multiple
 [NIST SP 800-39]             different attack vectors (e.g., cyber, physical, and deception) to
                              generate opportunities to achieve its objectives, which are
                              typically to establish and extend footholds within the information
                              technology infrastructure of organizations for purposes of
                              continually exfiltrating information and/or to undermine or
                              impede critical aspects of a mission, program, or organization, or
                              place itself in a position to do so in the future; moreover, the
                              advanced persistent threat pursues its objectives repeatedly over
                              an extended period of time, adapting to a defenderâ€™s efforts to
                              resist it, and with determination to maintain the level of
                              interaction needed to execute its objectives.
