2807   3.15.2. System Security Plan
2808             REQUIREMENT: 03.15.02

2809             ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVE
2810             Determine if:
2811             A.03.15.02.a.01: a system security plan that defines the constituent system components is
2812             developed.
2813             A.03.15.02.a.02: a system security plan that describes the system operating environment is
2814             developed.
2815             A.03.15.02.a.03: a system security plan that describes any specific threats to the system that
2816             are of concern to the organization is developed.
2817             A.03.15.02.a.04: a system security plan that provides an overview of the security requirements
2818             for the system is developed.
2819             A.03.15.02.a.05: a system security plan that identifies connections to other systems is
2820             developed.
2821             A.03.15.02.a.06: a system security plan that identifies individuals who fulfill system roles and
2822             responsibilities is developed.
2823             A.03.15.02.a.07: a system security plan that includes other relevant information necessary for
2824             the protection of CUI is developed.
2825             A.03.15.02.b[01]: the system security plan is reviewed periodically.
2826             A.03.15.02.b[02]: the system security plan is updated periodically.
