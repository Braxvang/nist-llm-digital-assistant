4.      Log Management Planning

To establish and maintain successful log management infrastructures, an organization should perform
significant planning and other preparatory actions for performing log management. This is important for
creating consistent, reliable, and efficient log management practices that meet the organization’s needs
and requirements and also provide additional value for the organization. This section describes the
definition of log management roles and responsibilities, the creation of feasible logging policies, and the
design of log management infrastructures. Section 5 describes the operational aspects of log
management.

4.1     Define Roles and Responsibilities

As part of the log management planning process, an organization should define the roles and
responsibilities of individuals and teams who are expected to be involved in log management. Teams and
individual roles often involved in log management include the following:

       System and network administrators, who are usually responsible for configuring logging on
        individual systems and network devices, analyzing those logs periodically, reporting on the
        results of log management activities, and performing regular maintenance of the logs and logging
        software
       Security administrators, who are usually responsible for managing and monitoring the log
        management infrastructures, configuring logging on security devices (e.g., firewalls, network-
        based intrusion detection systems, antivirus servers), reporting on the results of log management
        activities, and assisting others with configuring logging and performing log analysis38
       Computer security incident response teams, who use log data when handling some incidents
       Application developers, who may need to design or customize applications so that they perform
        logging in accordance with the logging requirements and recommendations
       Information security officers, who may oversee the log management infrastructures
       Chief information officers (CIO), who oversee the IT resources that generate, transmit, and
        store the logs
       Auditors, who may use log data when performing audits
       Individuals involved in the procurement of software that should or can generate computer
        security log data.
Organizations need to give particular consideration to the assignment of operational log management
duties. Some organizations, especially those with highly managed environments, may choose to perform
all log management centrally instead of at the individual system level. However, in most organizations,
log management is not so centralized. Typically, system, network, and security administrators are
responsible for managing logging on their systems, performing regular analysis of their log data,
documenting and reporting the results of their log management activities, and ensuring that log data is
provided to the log management infrastructure in accordance with the organization’s policies.

      Because some log management duties, such as log analysis and maintenance, are considered boring and mundane by many
      system, network, and security administrators, organizations should consider rotating such duties among administrators to
      prevent burnout. The duties can also be made less mundane by providing tools and techniques that reduce the workload and
      allow administrators to focus on the more interesting aspects of log management.
