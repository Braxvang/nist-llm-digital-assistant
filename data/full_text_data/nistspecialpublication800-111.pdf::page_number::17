                                                     GUIDE TO STORAGE ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES FOR END USER DEVICES



A major difference between software and hardware-based FDE is that software-based FDE can be
centrally managed, but hardware-based FDE can usually only be managed locally. This makes key
management and recovery actions considerably more resource-intensive and cumbersome for hardware-
based FDE than software-based. Another major difference is that because hardware-based FDE does all
cryptographic processing within the hard drive’s hardware, it does not need to place its cryptographic
keys into the computer’s memory, which could potentially expose the keys to malware and other threats.
A third significant difference is that hardware-based FDE typically does not alter the MBR, so hardware-
based FDE does not cause conflicts with software that modifies the MBR (e.g., dual-boot configurations).

3.1.2    Virtual Disk Encryption and Volume Encryption

Virtual disk encryption is the process of encrypting a file called a container, which can hold many files
and folders, and permitting access to the data within the container only after proper authentication is
provided, at which point the container is typically mounted as a virtual disk. Virtual disk encryption is
used on all types of end user device storage. The container is a single file that resides within a logical
volume. Examples of volumes are boot, system, and data volumes on a personal computer, and a USB
flash drive formatted with a single filesystem. Volume encryption is the process of encrypting an entire
logical volume and permitting access to the data on the volume only after proper authentication is
provided. Volume encryption is most often performed on hard drive data volumes and volume-based
removable media, such as USB flash drives and external hard drives. Volume encryption of boot and
system volumes is essentially a special form of FDE, and it is not discussed in this section; see the FDE
material in Section 3.1.1 for additional information.

At a high level, volume and virtual disk encryption are performed similarly. Software running on the OS
used to access the volume or container handles all attempts to read to or write from the protected volume
or container. 22 Once the OS has been loaded, if the user needs to use the encrypted volume or container,
it will be mounted after the user has provided the required authentication. The software will then
automatically decrypt and encrypt the appropriate sectors as needed. This increases the time needed to
open or save files, but the delay generally should be noticeable for only particularly large files. There
may also be slight delays associated with mounting and unmounting an encrypted volume or container.

The key difference between volume and virtual disk encryption is that containers are portable and
volumes are not—a container can be copied from one medium to another, with encryption intact. This
allows containers to be burned to CDs and DVDs and to be used on other media that are not volume-
based. Virtual disk encryption also makes it trivial to back up sensitive data; the container is simply
copied to the backup server or media. Another advantage of virtual disk encryption over volume
encryption is that virtual disk encryption can be used in situations where volume-based removable media
needs to have both protected and unprotected storage; the volume can be left unprotected and a container
placed onto the volume for the sensitive information.

Some virtual disk encryption products further support mobility by offering features that can place
executables on the medium holding a container. The medium can then be moved to another computer and
the executables run, through methods such as installing drivers onto the computer or running an
authentication and decryption utility. 23 The protected contents of the medium can then be accessed by a
user after providing the requested authentication.

The responsibilities of the users of virtual disk and volume encryption solutions vary, primarily
depending on the devices’ access control. For example, if a laptop’s OS is configured so that a user can
22
     Some products install kernel mode drivers to perform volume and virtual disk encryption. Other products, especially those
     specifically designed for removable media, either contain their own resident OSs or provide software applications.
23
     This only speaks to the portability of the logical entity on the media—the media itself might be physically portable.
