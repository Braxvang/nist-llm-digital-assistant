ISPs find information about their regional registries at these Web sites. Organizations and end users get
their address allocations from their ISPs. Normally, a RIR allocates a /32 address to qualified ISPs,
which are called Local Internet Registries (LIR), and the ISP allocates /48 addresses to its customers16.

American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) is allowing some large government agencies to get
provider independent (PI) IPv6 address assignments, defined in ARIN’s Number Resource Policy Manual
(NRPM) Section 6.5.8, Direct Assignments from ARIN to end-user organizations17. To qualify for a
direct assignment, an organization must not be an IPv6 local Internet registry and must qualify for an
IPv4 assignment or allocation from ARIN under the IPv4 policy currently in effect. If these criteria are
met, an organization is eligible to receive a minimum assignment of /48, and with justification can request
additional subnets. These assignments will be made from a distinctly identified prefix with a reservation
of growth of at least /44.

From one point of view, the case for PI assignments can allow for a small number of large organizations
to avoid a significant expense due to address renumbering. In addition, organizations may not want to be
locked in to a specific Internet provider. On the other hand, the main concerns regarding PI assignment
include two major issues. The first is the possibility of a large increase in the size of the IPv6 default-free
routing table; these tables generally point only to top-level domains of aggregated routes. PI assignments
do not fit into the normal aggregation and will increase the size of these tables. Secondly, the fear is that
early adopters, similarly to IPv4, would have an unfair advantage vis à vis those who adopted later.

IPv6 address allocation is designed to allow routing prefix aggregation. IPv6 network addresses may be
aggregated in the same sense that IPv4 CIDR addresses are. IPv6 address allocation is based on the
hierarchy mentioned previously, and allocated blocks of addresses are widely dispersed with top-tier
allocations having network prefixes of 32 bits. This leaves 96 bits’ worth of addresses that can all be
aggregated through a single route advertisement on the Internet backbone.

Consider routing prefix aggregation for a large backbone service provider. The service provider,
hypothetically, receives a block of address space with a 32-bit network prefix. In turn, the provider
allocates this address space to customers. Those customers could be multiple regional network service
providers or large enterprises that receive blocks of addresses with 48-bit network prefixes from that
single large backbone service provider. Subnets within those enterprises and smaller regional service
providers may have address space with 64-bit network prefixes.

This arrangement may easily result in tens of millions of nodes attached to millions of subnets, all of
which are aggregated and reachable via the global Internet through one route on the Internet’s backbone
routers.

IPv6 address allocation is a work in progress. Organizations should familiarize themselves with
