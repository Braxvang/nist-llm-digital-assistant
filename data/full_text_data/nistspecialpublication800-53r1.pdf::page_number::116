FAMILY: PLANNING                                                                      CLASS: MANAGEMENT


PL-1      SECURITY PLANNING POLICY AND PROCEDURES

          Control: The organization develops, disseminates, and periodically reviews/updates: (i) a formal,
          documented, security planning policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,
          management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and (ii)
          formal, documented procedures to facilitate the implementation of the security planning policy
          and associated security planning controls.
          Supplemental Guidance: The security planning policy and procedures are consistent with applicable
          laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The security
          planning policy addresses the overall policy requirements for confidentiality, integrity, and
          availability and can be included as part of the general information security policy for the
          organization. Security planning procedures can be developed for the security program in general,
          and for a particular information system, when required. NIST Special Publication 800-18
          provides guidance on security planning. NIST Special Publication 800-12 provides guidance on
          security policies and procedures.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW PL-1                      MOD PL-1                  HIGH PL-1



PL-2      SYSTEM SECURITY PLAN

          Control: The organization develops and implements a security plan for the information system that
          provides an overview of the security requirements for the system and a description of the security
          controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements. Designated officials within the
          organization review and approve the plan.
          Supplemental Guidance: The security plan is aligned with the organizationâ€™s information system
          architecture and information security architecture. NIST Special Publication 800-18 provides
          guidance on security planning.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW PL-2                      MOD PL-2                  HIGH PL-2



PL-3      SYSTEM SECURITY PLAN UPDATE

          Control: The organization reviews the security plan for the information system [Assignment:
          organization-defined frequency, at least annually] and revises the plan to address
          system/organizational changes or problems identified during plan implementation or security
          control assessments.
          Supplemental Guidance: Significant changes are defined in advance by the organization and
          identified in the configuration management process. NIST Special Publication 800-18 provides
          guidance on security plan updates.
          Control Enhancements: None.


           LOW PL-3                      MOD PL-3                  HIGH PL-3
