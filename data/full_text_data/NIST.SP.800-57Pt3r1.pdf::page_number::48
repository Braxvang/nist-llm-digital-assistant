6.3 Procurement Guidance
The following recommendations are for any individual that makes a purchasing decision
for acquiring a Kerberos capability.

   1. Ensure that new procurements conform to version 5 ([RFC 4120], [RFC 6649]).
   2. Ensure that government procurements specify the inclusion of approved
      symmetric key encryption algorithms (e.g., the Advanced Encryption Standard
      (AES)) [RFC 3962].
   3. Ensure that an approved MAC computation (e.g., HMAC-SHA1 or HMAC-
      SHA256-128) is available for data integrity with encryption (see [RFC 3962] and
      the IETF Informational Draft, AES Encryption with HMAC-SHA2 for Kerberos 5,
      at: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-kitten-aes-cts-hmac-sha2-04).
   4. Kerberos version 5 permits the use of smart cards or tokens (e.g., FIPS 201
      Personal Identity Verification cards [FIPS 201]) to store a user's password. Ensure
      that passwords stored on tokens are randomly generated; therefore, when tokens
      are used, ensure that a means of generating random passwords and securely
      writing them on the token is available and the password generation function is a
      NIST-approved random number generation function [SP 800-90A]. When tokens
      are used, ensure that the manual entry of passwords is not permitted except to
      authenticate the user to the token.
   5. If passwords are used to form user symmetric keys, ensure that the password
      mechanism supports the use of strong passwords [SP 800-118], and an approved
      hash algorithm (e.g., SHA-1 or stronger) is used as the hash algorithm.
   6. If passwords are generated by users, ensure that the system software enforces a
      strong password policy in accordance with [SP 800-118].
   7. Kerberos with public key authentication and subsequent key establishment can
      provide stronger security than the use of password-based keys and should be
      available where PKI mechanisms are available. See [RFC 4556] and [RFC 5349]
      for further information. Ensure that the key-establishment methods (i.e., key-
      agreement or key-transport methods) used have at least 112 bits of security; see
      [SP 800-57 Part 1] and [SP 800-131A] for further information.
   8. TLS should be used when the system supports it.
   9. Procurement officials should consider whether inter-realm networking is
      necessary and include the capability in the software if itâ€™s needed.
   10. Ensure that cryptographic modules used by CAs, TSs and clients are validated at
       FIPS 140-2 Level 1 or higher [FIPS 140-2].


6.4 Recommendations for System Installers
The system installer is any individual(s) that installs a Kerberos capability and performs
the initial configuration of the system.
