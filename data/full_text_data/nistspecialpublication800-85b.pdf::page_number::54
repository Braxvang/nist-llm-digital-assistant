Precondition(s)           1.   A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                          2.   A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and the
                               contact reader.
                          3.   The test application is currently connected to the card application
                               which is accessible through card handle.
                          4.   A valid X.509 certificate for card authentication object is present on the
                               PIV card.
Test Scenario             1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                          2. Set OID := <<Card Authentication Certificate
                              (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.5.0)>>
                          3. Call pivGetData w/
                              • (IN) cardHandle
                               • (IN) OID
                               • (OUT) data
                          4. Read and parse the byte array in accordance with BER-TLV
                              format.
Expected Result(s)        1. The size of the byte array does not exceed 1905 bytes.
                          2. All mandatory tags in “X.509 Certificate for Card Authentication”
                             table are present.


8.10 “Security Object” Data Object
Purpose                   Confirms that the “Security Object” data object of the PIV card
