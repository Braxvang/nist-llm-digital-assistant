                               NIST Special Publication 800-38D


Tables 1 and 2 below quantify the recommendations in Item 4 above, for 32-bit and 64-bit tags,
respectively. Each row has two entries: 1) a maximum combined length for the ciphertext and
the AAD in a single packet, in bytes, and 2) a corresponding maximum number of invocations of
the authenticated decryption function, across all instances of the GCM with the given key.

For any implementation that supports 32-bit or 64-bit tags, one of the rows in Table 1 or Table 2,
respectively, shall be enforced. In particular, the supported lengths for the plaintext/ciphertext
and the AAD shall ensure that every valid packet satisfies the length restriction in the row, and
the controlling protocol/system shall ensure that the key is changed before the authenticated
decryption function is invoked more than the maximum that is given in the row. A smaller
maximum may also be enforced.
