1392      •   Conduct performance-based assessments to evaluate and validate capabilities
1393   These methods can also identify whether new training is needed for a role or roles or whether
1394   existing training needs to be updated or modified.

1395   3.1.2.5.       Identify Knowledge and Skill Gaps
1396   The result of the analysis thus far is a measure of the personnel’s existing knowledge and skills
1397   with an overview of each audience segment. The difference between that and the ideal state of
1398   knowledge for the learning goal is referred to as “the learning gap.” During the design phase, the
1399   Learning Manager will use information about each learning gap (per learning goal, learning
1400   audience, etc.) to design a program specific enough to address each need.

1401          Designing the CPLP
1402   At the beginning of the design phase, consider what knowledge and skills the audience needs to
1403   learn or develop and what gaps the learning material will close. This will drive the creation of the
1404   learning objectives and the process for achieving them. The design process should end with a
1405   systematic blueprint of the approach needed for the CPLP to address the identified knowledge
1406   and skills gaps of the personnel.

1407   3.2.1. The Steps of the Design Phase
1408   The Learning Program Manager begins a formal design phase for the CPLP or a new element in
1409   the ongoing CPLP by creating a Design Document that outlines the requirements. They will then
1410   determine whether they need to build or buy learning materials to satisfy those requirements. The
1411   Learning Program Manager moves into a highly detailed design phase that will lead to the
1412   development of revised or new program assets. The steps in design phase are:
1413      1. Create a Design Document.
1414      2. Conduct an environmental scan of available training, both internal and external.
1415      3. Identify learning objectives.
1416      4. Summarize learning requirements.

1417   3.2.2. Design Document
1418   The Design Document provides a blueprint for the development and implementation of the
1419   learning program elements. The Design Document is usually created by the Learning Program
1420   Manager and reviewed by key stakeholders (when necessary for funding and other approvals)
1421   before moving to the development phase.
1422   Typical elements of a Design Document include:
1423      •   Purpose, goals, and background
1424      •   Intended audience
1425      •   Learning objectives
