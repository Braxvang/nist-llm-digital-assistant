Appendix B—ebXML

Electronic Business using eXtensible Markup Language (ebXML) was developed in 1999 by United
Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT) and OASIS. Like Web
services, ebXML was designed to use existing standards to enable cross-platform and interoperable
business-to-business transactions. The goal of ebXML is to succeed the Electronic Data Interchange
(EDI), which is a proprietary standard used for many of the business-to-business transactions performed
today. ebXML provides an XML vocabulary for describing business processes, storing business
processes in a registry, discovering business processes, developing a collaboration protocol agreement,
and sending messages.

ebXML defines XML schema for defining business process and information models that can be stored in
an ebXML registry. Businesses can then search an ebXML registry and for another business’ details and
develop, configure, or purchase software to interface with that business’ ebXML interfaces and develop a
Collaboration Protocol Agreement. Once initialized, all ebXML transactions occur via the ebXML
Messaging Service.

The ebXML registry is comparable to a UDDI registry. Both allow businesses to discover one another to
dynamically initiate business-to-business transactions. The ebXML registry provides a more structured
environment, as it stores rigidly-defined business processes and related meta-data along with
Collaboration Protocol Profiles. The similarities between ebXML and UDDI are apparent when looking
at the design of the Java API for XML Registries (JAX-R), which abstracts UDDI and ebXML and
provides a single API for both types of XML registries.

The ebXML Messaging Service is an extension of SOAP, meaning that ebXML provides a highly
structured SOA. The ebXML Messaging Service extends SOAP to provide support for security,
improved error handling, and reliable messaging. With these extensions, the ebXML Messaging Service
can rely on a well-known and well-established protocol to perform sensitive and timely business
transactions.

The ebXML specifications also take into account security. Both the ebXML Registry Services
Specification and the ebXML Messaging Services Specification provide tools for ensuring the
confidentiality and integrity of data within the system. The ebXML Registry supports storing digitally
signed XML messages and uses authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only
appropriate entities access or update the registry. ebXML messaging supports encrypting and digitally
signing SOAP messages and also provides a reliable messaging service to ensure the availability of
messages.
