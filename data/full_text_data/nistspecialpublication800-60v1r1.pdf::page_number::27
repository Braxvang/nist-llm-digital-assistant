contained in the FEA BRM. A complete description of the General Information Type
information should be captured in the agencyâ€™s collection and documentation process.

4.2 Step 2: Select Provisional Impact Level
In Step 2, organizations should establish provisional impact levels 17 based on the identified
information types in Step 1. The provisional impact levels are the original impact levels
assigned to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability security objectives of an information
type from Volume II before any adjustments are made. Also in this step, the initial security
categorization for the information type is established and documented.
Volume II, Appendix C suggests provisional confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact
levels for management and support information types, and Volume II, Appendix D provides
examples of provisional impact level assignments for mission-based information types. Using
the impact assessment criteria identified in Section 3.2 for the security objectives and types of
potential losses identified in Section 3.1.2, the organizational entity responsible for impact
determination must assign impact levels and consequent security categorization for the mission-
based and management and support information types identified for each information system.

4.2.1    FIPS 199 Security Categorization Criteria

Where an information type processed by an information system is not categorized by this
guideline [based on information types identified in Volume II, Appendices C and D], an initial
impact determination will need to be made based on FIPS 199 categorization criteria (cited in
Table 7).
Agencies can assign security categories to information types and information systems by
selecting and adjusting appropriate Table 7 values for the potential impact of compromises of
confidentiality, integrity, and availability security objectives. Those responsible for impact level
selection and subsequent security categorization should apply the criteria provided in Table 7 to
each information type received by, processed in, stored in, and/or generated by each system for
which they are responsible. The security categorization will generally be determined based on
the most sensitive or critical information received by, processed in, stored in, and/or generated
by the system under review.

  Impact levels (plural), as used here, refers to low, moderate, high, or not applicable values assigned to each
security objective (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability) used in expressing the security category of an
information type or information systems. The value of not applicable only applies to information types and not
to information systems.
