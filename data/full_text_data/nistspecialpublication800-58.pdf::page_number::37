NIST SP 800-58                                              Voice Over IP Security
_____________________________________________________________________________



         Since this profile relies on a public key infrastructure rather than on pre-
         established shared secrets it scales for larger, global environments.

         This profile supports secure fast connect and H.245 tunneling and may be
         combined with the Voice Encryption Option described in section 4.2.1.3.
         Note: This profile provides high security without relying on pre-established
         shared secrets. Due to the key management using digital signatures it is scalable
         for “global” IP telephony. Moreover, it does not suffer from the same
         performance requirements as the Signature Security Profile described in section
         4.2.1.2.

 4.2.2    H.235v3

         Version 3 of H.235 supersedes H.235 version 2 featuring a procedure for
         encrypted DTMF (touch tone) signals, object identifiers for the AES encryption
         algorithm for media payload encryption, and the Enhanced Outer FeedBack
         (EOFB) stream-cipher encryption mode for encryption of media streams.
         Moreover, an authentication-only option in Annex D for smooth NAT/firewall
         traversal is introduced as well as better security support for direct-routed calls in a
