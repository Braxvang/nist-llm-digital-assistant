                                                                                                 Cyber resiliency techniques can interact in several ways. One technique can depend on another
                                                                                                 so that the first cannot be implemented without the second; for example, Adaptive Response
                                                                                                 depends on Analytic Monitoring or Contextual Awareness since a response requires a stimulus.
                                                                                                 One technique can support another, making the second more effective; for example, Diversity
                                                                                                 and Redundancy are mutually supportive. One technique can use another so that more design
                                                                                                 options are available than if the techniques were applied independently; for example, Analytic
                                                                                                 Monitoring can use Diversity in a design, which includes a diverse set of monitoring tools.

                                                                                                 However, one technique can also conflict with or complicate the use of another. For example,
                                                                                                 Diversity and Segmentation can each make Analytic Monitoring and Contextual Awareness more
                                                                                                 difficult. A design that incorporates Diversity requires monitoring tools that can handle the
                                                                                                 diverse set of system elements, while implementation of Segmentation can limit the visibility of
                                                                                                 such tools. By selecting techniques in accordance with the risk management strategy and design
