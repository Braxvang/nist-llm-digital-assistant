 5.2.1    Authentication of Signaling Data using HTTP Digest Authentication

         The Digest authentication scheme is based on a simple challenge-response
         paradigm. The digest authentication scheme challenges the remote end using a
         nonce value. SIP digest authentication is based on the digest authentication
         defined in RFC 2617. Here, a valid response contains a checksum (by default, the
         MD5 checksum) of the user name, the password, the given nonce value, the
         HTTP method, and the requested URI. In this way, the password is never sent in
         the clear. Because of its weak security, and to avoid attacks by downgrading the
         required security level of the authentication, HTTP Basic Authentication was not
         recommended in the current draft of RFC 3261.

 5.2.2    S/MIME Usage within SIP

         SIP messages carry MIME bodies. MIME itself defines mechanisms for the
         integrity protection and the encryption of the MIME contents. SIP may use
         S/MIME to enable mechanisms like public key distribution, authentication and
         integrity protection, or confidentiality of SIP signaling data. S/MIME may be
         considered as a replacement for PGP to provide means for integrity protection and
         encryption of SIP messages. To be able to protect SIP header fields as well,
         tunneling of SIP messages in MIME bodies is specified. Generally the proposed
         SIP tunneling for SIP header protection will create additional overhead. S/MIME
         requires certificates and private keys to be used, whereas the certificates may be
         issued by a trusted third party or may be self-generated. The latter case may not
         provide real user authentication but may be used to provide a limited form of
         message integrity protection. The following sections explain the usage of
         S/MIME more deeply.

         The current document, RFC 3261, recommends S/MIME to be used for UAs.
         Moreover, if S/MIME is used to tunnel messages (described below) it is
         recommend using a TCP connection because of the larger messages. This is to
         avoid problems that may arise by the fragmentation of UDP packets. The
         following services can be realized: (a) authentication and integrity protection of
         signaling data, and (b) confidentiality of signaling data


 5.2.3    Confidentiality of Media Data

         SIP itself does not consider the encryption of media data. Using the RTP
         encryption as defined in RFC 1889 may provide confidentiality for media data.
         Another option for media stream security is the use of SRTP [DSRTP]. For key
         management SDP (cf. RFC 2327) may be used. SDP can convey session keys for
         media streams. Note that using SDP for the key exchange provides no method to
         send an encrypted media stream key (cf. Appendix A2). Therefore, the signaling
         request should be encrypted, preferably by using End-to-End encryption.
