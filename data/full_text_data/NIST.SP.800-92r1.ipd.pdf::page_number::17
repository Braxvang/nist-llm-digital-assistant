      NIST SP 800-92r1 ipd                                                   Cybersecurity Log Management
      October 2023                                                                          Planning Guide

399      3. INV-4.3: Identify all requirements applicable to new log source types or new logging use
400         cases.
401   Examples of sources of requirements include:
402      •   General laws and regulations (e.g., GDPR)
403      •   Sector-specific laws and regulations (e.g., HIPAA, NERC)
404      •   Federal agency-specific requirements (e.g., OMB memoranda; FISMA/NIST Risk
405          Management Framework; EO 14028, Section 8 [EO14028])
406      •   Standards that the organization chooses to follow (e.g., ISO 27001)
407      •   The organization’s cybersecurity, privacy, and data retention policies
408      •   Requirements and policies of a parent organization/enterprise

409          INV-5, Update the Work Role Inventory
410   [Tasks] [Examples]                                                     [Previous Play] [Next Play]
411   Summary: Update the inventory of cybersecurity logging-related work roles that your personnel
412   or third parties perform. Each work role includes one or more tasks, and each task is associated
413   with one or more knowledge and skill statements, as defined in NIST SP 800-181 [SP800-
414   181r1]. There are two desired outcomes: to confirm that all necessary work roles and tasks are
415   assigned and to inform the organization’s training and process documentation planning.
416   Tasks to perform include the following (not necessarily in order):
417      1. INV-5.1: Confirm that all roles already in the inventory are still applicable.
418      2. INV-5.2: Identify any new roles, and add them to the inventory.
419      3. INV-5.3: Update which tasks are associated with each role.
420      4. INV-5.4: Update which knowledge and skill statements are associated with each task.
421      5. INV-5.5: Share the updated work role inventory with stakeholders, solicit their feedback,
422         and make revisions if needed.
423      6. INV-5.6: Disseminate the updated work role inventory information to affected parties.
424   Examples of parties within an organization who may have log management responsibilities
425   include the following. Note that many of these responsibilities may also be performed by third
426   parties, such as managed security service providers and cloud service providers, for some of the
427   organization’s assets.
428      •   System and network administrators who
429              o Configure logging and synchronize timestamps on individual systems and
430                network devices
431              o Configure systems and devices to forward log data to the appropriate logging
432                infrastructure systems for analysis, storage, or other processing
433              o Report on the results of log management activities
