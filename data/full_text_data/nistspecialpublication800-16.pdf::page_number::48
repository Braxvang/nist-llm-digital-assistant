Information Technology Security Training Requirements

         •       Relationships between threats, vulnerabilities, risks
     •   Threats from "authorized system users"
     •   Increased threats and vulnerabilities from connection to external systems and networks

         •       Acquisition/development/installation/implementation controls
                 Operational controls
                 Security awareness and training controls
         •       Technical controls
     •   How different categories of controls work together
     •   Examples of security controls for:

     •   "Adequate" and "appropriate" controls
         •       Unique protection requirements of IT systems and information

         •       Reduction of risk vs. elimination of risk
     •   Working together with other security disciplines
     •   Importance of internal and external audits, reviews, and evaluations in security decisions
