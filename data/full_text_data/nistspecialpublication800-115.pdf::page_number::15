similarly trained individuals should undertake this work to ensure that settings are not inadvertently
modified or deleted.

Testing involves hands-on work with systems and networks to identify security vulnerabilities, and can be
executed across an entire enterprise or on selected systems. The use of scanning and penetration
techniques can provide valuable information on potential vulnerabilities and predict the likelihood that an
adversary or intruder will be able to exploit them. Testing also allows organizations to measure levels of
compliance in areas such as patch management, password policy, and configuration management.

Although testing can provide a more accurate picture of an organization’s security posture than what is
gained through examinations, it is more intrusive and can impact systems or networks in the target
environment. The level of potential impact depends on the specific types of testing techniques used,
which can interact with the target systems and networks in various ways—such as sending normal
network packets to determine open and closed ports, or sending specially crafted packets to test for
vulnerabilities. Any time that a test or tester directly interacts with a system or network, the potential
exists for unexpected system halts and other denial of service conditions. Organizations should determine
their acceptable levels of intrusiveness when deciding which techniques to use. Excluding tests known to
create denial of service conditions and other disruptions can help reduce these negative impacts.

Testing does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the security posture of an organization, and often
has a narrow scope because of resource limitations—particularly in the area of time. Malicious attackers,
on the other hand, can take whatever time they need to exploit and penetrate a system or network. Also,
while organizations tend to avoid using testing techniques that impact systems or networks, attackers are
not bound by this constraint and use whatever techniques they feel necessary. As a result, testing is less
likely than examinations to identify weaknesses related to security policy and configuration. In many
cases, combining testing and examination techniques can provide a more accurate view of security.

2.4     Testing Viewpoints

Tests can be performed from a number of viewpoints—for example, how easily could an external attacker
or malicious insider successfully attack a system? Section 2.4.1 of this guide compares testing performed
from external and internal viewpoints. Section 2.4.2 discusses another aspect of viewpoints—namely, the
previous knowledge that assessors have of the target or target environment.

2.4.1    External and Internal

External security testing is conducted from outside the organization’s security perimeter. This offers the
ability to view the environment’s security posture as it appears outside the security perimeter—usually as
seen from the Internet—with the goal of revealing vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an external
attacker.

External testing often begins with reconnaissance techniques that search public registration data, Domain
Name System (DNS) server information, newsgroup postings, and other publicly available information to
collect information (e.g., system names, Internet Protocol [IP] addresses, operating systems, technical
points of contact) that may help the assessor to identify vulnerabilities. Next, enumeration begins by
using network discovery and scanning techniques to determine external hosts and listening services.
Since perimeter defenses such as firewalls, routers, and access control lists often limit the types of traffic
allowed into the internal network, assessors often use techniques that evade these defenses—just as
external attackers would. Depending on the protocols allowed through, initial attacks are generally
focused on commonly used and allowed application protocols such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP),
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and Post Office Protocol
