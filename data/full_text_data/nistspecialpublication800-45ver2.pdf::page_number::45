server application. Choose the “minimal installation” option, if available, to minimize the effort required
in removing unnecessary services. In addition, many uninstall scripts or programs are far from perfect in
completely removing all components of a service; therefore, it is always better not to install unnecessary
services. Some common types of services and applications that should usually be disabled if not required
include the following:

 File and printer sharing services (e.g., Windows Network Basic Input/Output System [NetBIOS] file
  and printer sharing, Network File System [NFS], File Transfer Protocol [FTP])
 Default Web servers
 Wireless networking services
 Remote control and remote access programs, particularly those that do not strongly encrypt their
  communications (e.g., Telnet) 31
 Directory services (e.g., Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [LDAP], Kerberos, Network
  Information System [NIS])
 Language compilers and libraries
 System development tools
 System and network management tools and utilities, including Simple Network Management Protocol
  (SNMP).
Removing unnecessary services and applications is preferable to simply disabling them through
configuration settings, because attacks that attempt to alter settings and activate a disabled service cannot
succeed when the functional components are completely removed. Disabled services could also be
enabled inadvertently through human error.

Eliminating or disabling unnecessary services enhances the security of a mail server in several ways
[Alle00]:

 Other services cannot be compromised and used to attack the host or impair the services of the mail
  server. Each service added to a host increases the risk of compromise for that host because each
  service is another possible avenue of access for an attacker. Less is more secure in this case.
 Other services might have flaws or might be incompatible with the mail server itself. Disabling or
  removing them prevents them from affecting the mail server, including its availability.
 The host can be configured to better suit the requirements of the particular service. Different services
  might require different hardware and software configurations, which could lead to unnecessary
  vulnerabilities or negatively affect performance.
 By reducing services, the number of logs and log entries is reduced; therefore, detecting unexpected
  behavior becomes easier (see Section 9).
Organizations should determine the services to be enabled on a mail server. Services in addition to the
mail server service that might be installed include directory protocols to access the organization’s user
directory and remote administration services. These services may be required in certain instances, but

     If a remote control or remote access program is absolutely required and it does not strongly encrypt its communications, it
     should be tunneled over a protocol that provides encryption, such as secure shell (SSH) or IP Security (IPsec).
