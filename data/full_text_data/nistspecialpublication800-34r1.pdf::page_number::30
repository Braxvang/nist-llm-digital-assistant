              quickly as possible. Examples of resources that should be identified include facilities, personnel,
              equipment, software, data files, system components, and vital records.
       3. Identify recovery priorities for system resources. Based upon the results from the previous
          activities, system resources can be linked more clearly to critical mission/business processes and
          functions. Priority levels can be established for sequencing recovery activities and resources.

 The sample BIA process and data collection activities, outlined in this section and illustrated in Figure
 3-2, consisting of a representative information system with multiple components (servers), are designed to
 help the ISCP Coordinator streamline and focus contingency plan development activities to achieve a
 more effective plan. 15 An example of the BIA process and a BIA template are provided in Appendix B.

 3.2.1            Determine Business Processes and Recovery Criticality

 An information system can be very complex and often supports multiple mission/business processes,
 resulting in different perspectives on the importance of system services or capabilities. To accomplish the
 BIA and better understand the impacts a system outage or disruption can have on the organization, the
 ISCP Coordinator should work with management and internal and external points of contact (POC) 16 to
 identify and validate mission/business processes and processes that depend on or support the information
 system. The identified processes’ impacts are then further analyzed in terms of availability, integrity,
 confidentiality, and the established FIPS 199 impact level for the information system.

 FIPS 199 requires organizations to categorize their information systems as low impact, moderate impact,
 or high impact for the security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (RMF Step 1). The
 FIPS 199 category for the availability security objective serves as a basis of the BIA. Further
 identification of additional mission/business processes and impacts captures the unique purpose of the

 15
    For completeness and to assist ISCP Coordinators who may be new to or unfamiliar with the information system, the sample
    BIA process presented includes basic steps. In many cases, the ISCP Coordinator will be very familiar with specific system
    components and the ways in which they support business processes and may modify the approach to fit the respective system
    and contingency needs.

    When identifying POCs, it is important to include organizations that provide or receive data from the system as well as POCs
    of any interconnected systems. Coordination should enable the system manager to characterize the full range of support
    provided by the system, including security, managerial, technical, and operational requirements.
