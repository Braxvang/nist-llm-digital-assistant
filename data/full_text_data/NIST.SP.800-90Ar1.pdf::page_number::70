NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                            Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                   Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


   Block_Encrypt: A basic encryption operation that uses the selected block cipher algorithm.
   The function call is:
                         output_block = Block_Encrypt (Key, input_block)
   For TDEA, the basic encryption operation is called the forward cipher operation (see [SP
   800-67]); for AES, the basic encryption operation is called the cipher operation (see [FIPS
   197]). The basic encryption operation is equivalent to an encryption operation on a single
   block of data using the ECB mode.
For the BCC function, let outlen be the length of the output block of the block cipher algorithm
to be used.
The following or an equivalent process shall be used to derive the requested number of bits.
BCC (Key, data):
   1. Key: The key to be used for the block cipher operation.
   2. data: The data to be operated upon. Note that the length of data must be a multiple of
      outlen. This is guaranteed by Block_Cipher_df process steps 4 and 8.1 in Section 10.3.2.
Output:
   1. output_block: The result to be returned from the BCC operation.
BCC Process:
   1. chaining_value = 0outlen.       Comment: Set the first chaining value to outlen zeros.
   2.   n = len (data)/outlen.
   3. Starting with the leftmost bits of data, split data into n blocks of outlen bits each, forming
      block1 to blockn.
   4. For i = 1 to n do
        4.1 input_block = chaining_value âŠ• blocki.
        4.2 chaining_value = Block_Encrypt (Key, input_block).
   5. output_block = chaining_value.
   6. Return (output_block).
