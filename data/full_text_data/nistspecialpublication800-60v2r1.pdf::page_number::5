                                                    Note

NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-60 may be used by organizations in conjunction with a
family of security-related publications including:
      •   FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and
          Information Systems;
      •   FIPS Publication 200, Minimum Security Controls for Federal Information Systems;
      •   NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems 1 ;
      •   NIST SP 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal
          Information Systems;
      •   NIST Draft SP 800-39, Managing Risk from Information Systems: An Organizational
          Perspective;
      •   NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems;
      •   NIST SP 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information
          Systems; and
      •   NIST SP 800-59, Guideline for Identifying an Information System as a National Security
          System.
This series of nine documents is intended to provide a structured, yet flexible framework for
selecting, specifying, employing, and evaluating the security controls in Federal information
systems—and thus, make a significant contribution toward satisfying the requirements of the
Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002. While the publications are
mutually reinforcing and have some dependencies, in most cases, they can be effectively used
independently of one another.
This is Volume II of two volumes. Volume I contains the basic guidelines for mapping types of
information and information systems to security categories. The appendices contained in
Volume II include security categorization recommendations and rationale for mission-based and
management and support information types.
The SP 800-60 information types and security impact levels are based on the OMB Federal
Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office’s October 2007 FEA Consolidated
Reference Model Document, Version 2.3 inputs from participants in NIST SP 800-60 workshops,
and FIPS 199. Rationale for the example security impact level recommendations provided in the
appendices have been derived from multiple sources, and as such, will require several iterations
of review, comment, and subsequent modification to achieve consistency in terminology,
structure, and content.
