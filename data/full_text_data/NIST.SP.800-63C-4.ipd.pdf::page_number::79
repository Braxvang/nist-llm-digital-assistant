2077   11.     Equity Considerations
2078   This section is informative.
2079   Equitable access to the functions of IdPs and RPs is an essential element of a federated
2080   identity system. The ability for all subscribers to authenticate reliably is required to
2081   provide equitable access to government services, even when using federation technology,
2082   as specified in Executive Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for
2083   Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government [EO13985]. In assessing
2084   equity risks, IdPs and RPs should consider the overall user population served by their
2085   federated identity service. Additionally, IdPs and RPs further identify groups of users
2086   within the population whose shared characteristics can cause them to be subject to
2087   inequitable access, treatment, or outcomes when using that service. The Usability
2088   Considerations provided in Sec. 10 should also be considered to help ensure the overall
2089   usability and equity for all persons using federated identity services.
2090   In its role as the verifier, the IdP needs to be aware of equity considerations related to
2091   identity proofing, attribute validation, and enrollment as enumerated in [SP800-63A] Sec.
2092   11 and equity considerations concerning authenticators as enumerated in [SP800-63B]
2093   Sec. 11. An RP offering FAL3 will also need to be aware of these same authenticator
2094   considerations when processing bound authenticators, whether the authenticators are
2095   managed at the IdP or RP.
2096   Since the federation process takes place over a network protocol between multiple active
2097   parties, the experience of authenticating using the federation system may present equity
2098   problems, such as the following examples:
2099         • Completing the entire federated transaction without timing out may be difficult for
2100           subscribers without a reliable network connection, such as those in rural areas.
2101         • It may be difficult to provide informed consent for a runtime decision regarding the
2102           release of attributes for subscribers with intellectual, developmental, learning, or
2103           neurocognitive difficulties.
2104         • Systems with sufficient processing power, network access, and other features
2105           required to interact with both the IdP and the RP simultaneously may be difficult to
2106           afford for some subscribers.
2107         • Subscribers that share devices may find allowlist-based systems difficult to manage
2108           securely, as other users of the device could silently gain unintended access to an RP
2109           through a session still active at the IdP.
2110         • It could be prohibitively difficult to re-establish an account at the RP for subscribers
2111           who lose access to their IdP for any of a variety of reasons.
2112   Normative requirements have been established requiring IdPs and RPs to mitigate
2113   the problems in this area that are expected to be most common. However, normative
