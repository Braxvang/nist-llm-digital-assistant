Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
taxation management information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the taxation management information.
Taxation management processes are generally tolerant of limited delays. In most cases,
disruption of access to taxation management information can be expected to have only a limited
adverse effect on overall agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. However, even
temporary loss of availability of taxation management information is likely to have an adverse
effect on public confidence in the agency and on Federal government cash flow.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: While most cases will result in only
limited consequences, repeated disruptions can have a serious adverse effect on public
confidence in the agency. This can significantly degrade the taxation management mission
capability. In such cases, the availability impact might be moderate. Loss of availability of
significant amounts of taxation management information over long periods of time can do
serious harm to Federal government operations. The economic ramifications would potentially
be severe.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
taxation management information is low.
C.2.8.7 Central Records and Statistics Management Information Type

Central Records and Statistics Management involves the operations surrounding the management
of official documents, statistics, and records for the entire Federal Government. This information
type is intended to include information and information systems associated with the management
of records and statistics for the Federal government as a whole, such as the records management
performed by NARA or the statistics and data collection performed by the Bureau of the Census.
Note: Many agencies perform records and statistics management for a particular business
function and as such should be mapped to the service support, management, or mission area
associated with that business function. The central records and statistics management
information type is intended for functions performed on behalf of the entire Federal government.
The recommended security categorization for the central records and statistics management
information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of central records and
statistics management information on the ability of responsible agencies to manage official
documents, statistics, and records for the entire Federal Government. Unauthorized disclosure of
raw data and other source information for central records and statistics management operations is
likely to violate the Privacy Act of 1974 and other regulations applicable to the dissemination of
personal and government information. (The provisional impact levels for personnel information
are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication, Income, Representative Payee, and
Entitlement Event information types.)
