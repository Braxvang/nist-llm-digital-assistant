A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS




Appendix E—Numerical Algorithm Issues

For each binary sequence, an individual statistical test must produce at least one P-value. P-values are
based on the evaluation of special functions, which must be as accurate as possible on the target platform.
The log files produced by each statistical test report P-values with six digits of precision, which should be
sufficient. However, if greater precision is desired, modify the printf statements in each statistical test
accordingly.

During the testing phase, NIST commonly evaluated sequences on the order 106; hence, results are based
on this assumption. If the user wishes to choose longer sequence lengths, then be aware that numerical
computations may be inaccurate due to machine or algorithmic limitations. For further information on
numerical analysis matters, see [6]14.

For the purposes of illustration, sample parameter values and corresponding special function values are
shown in Table E.1 and Table E.2. Table E.1 compares the results for the incomplete gamma function for
selected parameter values for a and x. The results are shown for Maple15, Matlab10, and the Numerical
Recipe16 routines. Recall that the definitions for the gamma function and the incomplete gamma function
are defined, respectively, as:
                                                    Γ( z ) = ∫0 t z −1e −t dt
                                                       ∞




                                                     Γ(a, x)    1 ∞ −t a−1
                                        Q(a, x) =            =         e t dt ,
                                                      Γ(a)     Γ(a) ∫x

                                            where Q(a,0) = 1 and Q(a,∞) = 0.

Since the algorithm used in the test suite implementation of the incomplete gamma function is based on
the numerical recipe codes, it is evident that the function is accurate to at least the seventh decimal place.
For large values of a, the precision will degrade, as will confidence in the result (unless a computer
algebra system is employed to ensure high precision computations).

Table E.2 compares the results for the complementary error function (see Section 5.3.3) for selected
parameter values for x. The results are shown for ANSI C, Maple, and Matlab. Recall that the definition
for the complementary error function is:
                                                               2     ∞
                                                                         −u 2
                                                 erfc(z) =        ∫e            du
                                                                     z
                                                                π
