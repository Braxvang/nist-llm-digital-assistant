                                                               Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics


4. Preservation

       Sections 4 through 7 describe the forensics process as it applies to mobile devices. Evidence
       preservation is the process of securely maintaining custody of property without altering or
       changing the contents of data that reside on devices and removable media. It is the first step in
       digital evidence recovery. The chapter begins with a generic introduction to preservation, and
       then provides more specific guidance about how to deal with mobile devices.

       Preservation involves the search, recognition, documentation, and collection of electronic-
       based evidence. In order to use evidence successfully, whether in a court of law or a less
       formal proceeding, it must be preserved. Failure to preserve evidence in its original state could
       jeopardize an entire investigation, potentially losing valuable case-related information.

       The remaining sections of this chapter provide supplemental information related to mobile
       devices, following the paradigm of Securing and Evaluating the Scene, Documenting the
       Scene, Isolation, Packaging, Transporting, and Storing Evidence, and Triage/On-Site
       Processing.

 4.1   Securing and Evaluating the Scene

       Incorrect procedures or improper handling of a mobile device during seizure may cause loss of
       digital data. Moreover, traditional forensic measures, such as fingerprints or DNA testing, may
       need to be applied to establish a link between a mobile device and its owner or user. If the
       device is not handled properly, physical evidence may be contaminated and rendered useless.

       Alertness to mobile device characteristics and issues (e.g., memory volatility) and familiarity
       with tangential equipment (e.g., media, cables, and power adapters) are essential. For mobile
       devices, sources of evidence include the device, UICC and associated media. Associated
       peripherals, cables, power adapters, and other accessories are also of interest. All areas of the
       scene should be searched thoroughly ensuring related evidence is not overlooked.

       Equipment associated with the mobile device, such as removable media, UICCs, or personal
       computers, may prove more valuable than the mobile device itself. Removable media varies in
       size and can be easily hidden and difficult to find. Most often, removable memory cards are
       identifiable by their distinctive shape and the presence of electrical contacts located on their
       bodies that are used to establish an interface with the device. Personal computers may be
       particularly useful in later accessing a locked mobile device, if the personal computer has
       established a trusted relationship with it. For example, Apple incorporates a pairing process
       whereby an existing pairing record file can be used by some tools [Zdz12] to access the mobile
       device while it is still locked.

       When interviewing the owner or user of a mobile device, consider requesting any security
       codes, passwords or gestures needed to gain access to its contents. For example, GSM devices
       may have authentication codes set for the internal memory and/or the UICC.

       While securing a mobile device, caution should be taken when an individual is allowed to
       handle the mobile device. Many mobile devices have master reset codes that clear the contents
       of the device to original factory conditions. Master resets may be performed remotely requiring
       proper precautions such as network isolation to ensure that evidence is not modified or
       destroyed.
