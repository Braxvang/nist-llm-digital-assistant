                                                             CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



Appendix A—Roles and Responsibilities

The partnership between providers and consumers in designing, building, deploying, and operating clouds
presents new challenges in providing adequate security and privacy protection. It becomes a collaborative
process between providers and consumers to share the responsibilities in implementing the necessary
controls.

Cloud business models determine the ownership of the computing resources offered within a cloud. In
the case of private clouds, where the provider is the same organizational entity as the consumer,
discussions on the separations of responsibilities can still be helpful to the owner of a system deployed in
a cloud. It can help that owner map out a comprehensive operational plan based on the collaboration
between the logical roles of providers and consumers.

Thus clarity as to how to divide the roles and responsibilities of implementing security controls is
important to help organizations: (1) define detailed security plans to address cloud security requirements,
(2) develop or procure appropriate security measures during development, (3) objectively compare and
evaluate providers, and (4) execute security protocols during the deployment and throughout operation. In
addition, collaboration between providers and consumers can help ensure that clouds meet specific
security conformance and regulatory requirements, especially for those supporting government agency
operations.

This brief appendix discusses these issues by outlining the main technical security controls from NIST’s
Special Publication 800-53, and then suggests a roadmap for applying them to clouds by considering the
patterns of different provider and consumer relationships for sharing security responsibilities.

The life cycle and life span of a system deployed in a cloud provides another perspective on how to
delineate roles and responsibilities. The system developer and integrator are responsible for implementing
security controls that need to be built into the system at development time. The system administrator and
operator are responsible for implementing security controls that are executed at operation time.

For SaaS clouds, a provider may be both the developer/integrator and administrator/operator, and if so
would normally assume most of the responsibility in implementing security controls. For IaaS clouds, a
consumer typically assumes more responsibilities, since the consumer is not only the developer/integrator,
but is also the administrator/operator. But a provider for IaaS clouds would still be responsible for
providing protections at infrastructure levels that a consumer does not have control of. For PaaS clouds, a
mixture of the two extremes occurs; while a consumer, as the developer/integrator, needs to build the
necessary application level security controls into the system, a provider is responsible for providing all the
system level protections. (A potential middle ground here involves third-party cloud security services. In
this situation, responsibilities for providing protection to the entire system should be negotiated by all
stakeholders.)

SP800-53 defines a comprehensive list of security controls for protecting IT systems. Each security
control is either a capability deployed in a system, or a set of procedures or activities an organization
carries out to implement security. SP800-53 also provides guidance on how to tailor the list of security
controls to meet an organization's specific needs or accommodate a system’s idiosyncrasies.

The security controls are organized into 17 families based on the domain areas of the security
requirements. Further, as a starting point for consideration in assigning logical areas of responsibility for
implementing security controls, the control families are grouped into three broad classes of management,
technical and operational controls. Table 6 is a listing of the 17 families and the classes they belong to:
