                       VIEWING SECURITY FROM THE PROPER PERSPECTIVE
      “For the first few decades as a burgeoning discipline, cybersecurity has been dominated by
      the development of widgets to address some aspect of the problem. Systems have become
      increasingly complex and interconnected, creating even more attack opportunities, which
      in turn creates even more opportunities to create defensive widgets that will bring some
      value in detecting or preventing an aspect of the attack space. Eventually, this becomes a
      game of whack-a-mole in which a simulated mole pops up from one of many holes and the
      objective is to whack the mole before it pops back in its hole. The moles represent new
      attacks, and the holes represent a huge array of potential vulnerabilities – both known and
      as-yet-undiscovered.
      Underlying [the discipline of] engineering is science. Sometimes engineering gets ahead of
      science, such as in bridge building, where the fundamentals of material science were not
      well understood. Many bridges were built; many fell down; some stayed up; designs of the
      ones that stayed up were copied. Eventually, for engineering to advance beyond some
      point, science must catch up with engineering. The science underlying cybersecurity [and
      more generally, security] engineering is complex and difficult. On the other hand, there is
      no time like the present to start, because it is both urgent and important to the future.…”
