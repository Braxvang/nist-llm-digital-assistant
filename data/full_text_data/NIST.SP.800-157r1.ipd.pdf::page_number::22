      NIST SP 800-157r1 ipd                            Derived PIV Credentials (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


593   For derived PIV authentication certificates issued under id-fpki-common-pivAuth-
594   derived-hardware (AAL3), the derived PIV authentication key pair SHALL be
595   generated within a hardware cryptographic module that meets the requirements of
596   [SP800-63B] Sec. 4.2.2, including being validated to [FIPS140] Level 2 or higher with
597   Level 3 physical security to protect the derived PIV authentication private key while in
598   storage and not permitting export of the private key.
599   For derived PIV authentication certificates issued under id-fpki-common-pivAuth-
600   derived (AAL2), the derived PIV authentication key pair SHALL be generated within a
601   cryptographic module that has been validated to [FIPS140] Level 1 or higher. If the key
602   pair is generated outside of the authenticator itself, the private key SHALL be transferred
603   via an authenticated protected channel as defined in [SP800-63B], and the authenticator
604    SHALL meet the requirements of [SP800-63B] Sec. 4.2.2, including being validated to
605   [FIPS140] Level 1 or higher.

606   3.1.3. Allowable Authenticator Types
607   Phishing-resistant multi-factor cryptographic authenticators SHALL be used for PKI-
608   based derived PIV authentication. A multi-factor cryptographic device authenticator as
609   specified in [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.1.9.1 SHALL be used for derived PIV authentication
610   at AAL3. Either a multi-factor cryptographic device authenticator or a multi-factor
611   cryptographic software authenticator as specified in [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.1.8.1 SHALL be
612   used for derived PIV authentication at AAL2.

613   3.1.4. Activation Data
614   Activation of the derived PIV authenticator using a memorized secret SHALL meet the
615   requirements of [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.2.11. Activation using a biometric characteristic
616    SHALL meet the requirements of [SP800-63B] Sec. 5.2.3. Unlocking the device that
617   houses a derived PIV authenticator (e.g., mobile phone) SHALL NOT be considered
618   activation of the authenticator. Separate entry of the activation secret or presentation
619   of a biometric factor SHALL be performed to use the authenticator. The same secret or
620   biometric factor used to unlock the device MAY be used to activate the authenticator.
621   If the memorized secret used for activation or the biometric activation factor needs to
622   be changed, entry of the current memorized secret SHALL be required to change the
623   value. If the activation secret has been forgotten or the permitted number of consecutive
624   wrong attempts has been reached, the home agency SHALL be required to input the PIN
625   unblocking key (PUK). If the PUK is not implemented by the authenticator or cannot
626   be provided, either the authenticator certificates SHALL be revoked or the associated
627   private keys SHALL be destroyed or zeroized. A new derived PIV credential MAY then
628   be obtained.
