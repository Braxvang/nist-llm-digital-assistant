604   4.   Digital Identity Model
605   This section is informative.

606   4.1. Overview
607   The SP 800-63 guidelines use digital identity models that reflect technologies and
608   architectures currently available in the market. These models have a variety of entities
609   and functions and vary in complexity. Simple models group functions, such as creating
610   subscriber accounts and providing attributes, under a single entity. More complex
611   models separate these functions among a larger number of entities. The entities and their
612   associated functions found in digital identity models include:
613   Subject (represented by one of three roles):
614        • Applicant — the subject to be identity proofed
615        • Subscriber — the subject that has successfully completed the identity proofing
616          process or has successfully completed authentication
617        • Claimant — the subject to be authenticated
618   Credential Service Provider (CSP): A trusted entity whose functions include identity
619   proofing applicants to the identity service and the registration of authenticators to
620   subscriber accounts. A subscriber account is the CSP’s established record of the
621   subscriber, the subscriber’s attributes, and associated authenticators. A CSP may be an
622   independent third party.
623   Relying Party (RP): An entity that relies upon the information in the subscriber account,
624   or an identity provider (IdP) assertion when using federation, typically to process a
625   transaction or grant access to information or a system.
626   Verifier: An entity whose function is to verify the claimant’s identity by verifying the
627   claimant’s possession and control of one or more authenticators using an authentication
628   protocol. To do this, the verifier needs to confirm the binding of the authenticators with
629   the subscriber account and check that the subscriber account is active.
630   Identity Provider (IdP): An entity in a federated model that performs both the CSP and
631   Verifier functions. The IdP is responsible for authenticating the subscriber and issuing
632   assertions to communicate with one or more RPs.
633   The entities and interactions that comprise the non-federated digital identity model are
634   illustrated in Figure 1. The federated digital identity model is illustrated in Figure 2.
635   Figure 1 shows an example of a common sequence of interactions in the non-federated
636   model. Other sequences could also achieve the same functional requirements. The usual
637   sequence of interactions for identity proofing and enrollment activities is as follows:
