A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS



As shown above, the only test applied was number 9, the Nonoverlapping templates test. A query for the
desired sample size is then made.

                                   How many bit streams should be generated? 10


Ten sequences will be parsed using the data.pi file. Since a file was selected as the data specification
mode, a subsequent query is made regarding the data representation. The user must specify whether the
file consists of bits stored in ASCII format or hexadecimal strings stored in binary format.

                        Input File Format:
                          [0] ASCII – A sequence of ASCII 0’s and 1’s
                          [1] Binary – Each byte in data file contains 8 bits of data
                        Select input mode: 0

Since the data consists of aSelect input mode:
                             long sequence     0
                                           of zeroes and ones, 0 was chosen. Given all necessary input
parameters the test suite proceeds to analyze the sequences.


                                             Statistical Testing In Progress.........


Once the testing process is complete, the empirical results can be found in the experiments/ subdirectory.


                                   Statistical Testing Complete!!!!!!!!!!!!


Upon completion, an in-depth analysis is performed to simplify the analysis of empirical results. Two
types of analyses are conducted. One type examines the proportion of sequences that pass a statistical
test. The other type examines the distribution of the P-values for each statistical test. More details are
supplied in the following section.

5.7       Interpretation of Results

An analytical routine has been included to facilitate interpretation of the results. A file
finalAnalysisReport is generated when statistical testing is complete. The report contains a summary of
empirical results as described in Section 4.2. The results are represented via a table with p rows and q
columns. The number of rows, p, corresponds to the number of statistical tests applied. The number of
columns, q = 13, are distributed as follows: columns 1-10 correspond to the frequency of P-values10,
column 11 is the P-value that arises via the application of a chi-square test11, column 12 is the proportion
of binary sequences that passed, and the 13th column is the corresponding statistical test. An example is
shown in Figure 5-1.




10
     The unit interval has been divided into ten discrete bins.
11
     Used to assess the uniformity of P-values in the ith statistical test. Value is undefined if less than 10 sequences are processed.
      As noted Section 4.2 at least 55 sequences must be processed to derive statistically meaningful results for the uniformity of
      p-values.
