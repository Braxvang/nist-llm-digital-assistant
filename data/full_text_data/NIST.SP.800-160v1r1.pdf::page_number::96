D.4.4. Situational Awareness
Situational awareness is a foundational security means objective. That is, to achieve other
security objectives, situational awareness is necessary and must be accounted for in design. For
example:

•    Mediating access requires situational awareness in cases where rules for granting access
     involve timing, sequence, state, and other conditions about the system and prior access.

•    Preventing and limiting loss are informed by comprehensive data and information about
     system states and conditions (Anomaly Detection).

Situational awareness requires the ability to accurately detect, capture, record, and analyze the
needed characteristics and details of the system’s behaviors and actions at a frequency and with
the granularity necessary to act and/or inform external entities for subsequent action to be
taken. 74 False positives and false negatives are to be avoided to the extent practicable.

Given the potential consequences of compromises of situational awareness capabilities and
wrongful attribution, the mechanisms used must meet the essential design criteria (Section D.4.2)
with the appropriate rigor. The system audit logs and other system records often need stringent
protection, such as using Distributed Privilege for access and storing the logs and records in a
separate subsystem (Domain Separation).

D.4.5. Trade Space Considerations
System design involves trade space decisions. Decision-making about protecting assets is guided
by a determination of valuation that informs asset criticality and priority (e.g., assessing the
positive effect in achieving objectives and the negative effect for any loss associated with an
asset). The criticality and priority based on valuation are used in investment decisions on the
type, rigor, and expected effectiveness of protection (Commensurate Protection). Decisions may
also be guided by the costs and benefits from different design options.

The costs associated with a trustworthy secure design approach include the cost to acquire,
develop, integrate, operate, and sustain the security features; the cost of the security features and
functions in terms of their system performance impact; the cost of security services used by the
system; the cost of developing and managing life cycle documentation and training; and the cost
of obtaining and maintaining the target level of assurance.

The cost of analysis to substantiate the trustworthiness claims of certain design choices is also an
important trade space factor. Given two equally effective design options, the more attractive of
the two options may be the one that has a lower relative cost to obtain the assurance needed to
demonstrate satisfaction of trustworthiness claims. In all cases, assess the cost of system security
at the system level; and consider trustworthiness objectives and the cost that is driven by the
assurance activities necessary to achieve the trustworthiness objectives. Trustworthiness design

   Common organizational actions include (1) responses to security-relevant anomalies, such as remedial training for users or replacing the right
system component responsible for undesired system behaviors, and (2) audits of system activities, including assessing for suspicious patterns of
access that indicate insider threats and to satisfy accountability regulations, such as those required of financial institutions.
