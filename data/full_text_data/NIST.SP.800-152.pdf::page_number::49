SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


               SI-7       A Federal CKMS shall apply integrity protection to all keys
PR:6.5
                          before transmission and/or storage, and verify the integrity of
                          all keys when received or before initial use.
               SI-10      A Federal CKMS shall obtain the following assurances (as
PR:6.6
                          appropriate) before the initial operational use of a key:
                              a) Domain parameter validity,
                              b) Key pair validity,
                              c) Private-key possession, and/or
                              d) Secret-key possession and validity.
                          A Federal CKMS shall obtain all key and domain parameter
PR:6.7
                          assurances using NIST-approved methods.
                          For Moderate and High impact-level systems, a Federal
PR:6.8
                          CKMS shall support assuring a receiver of a transported key
                          that it came from an authenticated and authorized source.

                          For Low impact-level systems, a Federal CKMS should
PA:6.2
                          support assuring a receiver of a transported key that it came
                          from an authenticated and authorized source.

6.2   Key Metadata

Key metadata is defined as information associated with a particular key that is managed by
the FCKMS.

The CKMS designer should select the metadata that is appropriate for a trusted association
with a key, based upon a number of factors, including the key type, the key lifecycle states,
and the CKMS Security Policy.

6.2.1 Metadata Elements
The following are metadata elements that are described in the Framework and may be
explicitly recorded. The descriptions in the Framework should be carefully reviewed when
making decisions with regard to their applicability. The metadata elements are:

   a) Key label,
   b) Key identifier,
   c) Owner identifier,
   d) Key lifecycle state,
   e) Key format specifier,
   f) Product used to create the key,
   g) Cryptographic algorithm using the key,
   h) Schemes or modes of operation,
   i) Parameters for the key,
   j) Length of the key,
   k) Security strength of the key/algorithm pair,
