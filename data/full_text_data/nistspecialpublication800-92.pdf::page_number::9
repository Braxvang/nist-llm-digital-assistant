Executive Summary

A log is a record of the events occurring within an organization’s systems and networks. Logs are
composed of log entries; each entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred
within a system or network. Many logs within an organization contain records related to computer
security. These computer security logs are generated by many sources, including security software, such
as antivirus software, firewalls, and intrusion detection and prevention systems; operating systems on
servers, workstations, and networking equipment; and applications.

The number, volume, and variety of computer security logs have increased greatly, which has created the
need for computer security log management—the process for generating, transmitting, storing, analyzing,
and disposing of computer security log data. Log management is essential to ensuring that computer
security records are stored in sufficient detail for an appropriate period of time. Routine log analysis is
beneficial for identifying security incidents, policy violations, fraudulent activity, and operational
problems. Logs are also useful when performing auditing and forensic analysis, supporting internal
investigations, establishing baselines, and identifying operational trends and long-term problems.
Organizations also may store and analyze certain logs to comply with Federal legislation and regulations,
including the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

A fundamental problem with log management that occurs in many organizations is effectively balancing a
limited quantity of log management resources with a continuous supply of log data. Log generation and
storage can be complicated by several factors, including a high number of log sources; inconsistent log
content, formats, and timestamps among sources; and increasingly large volumes of log data. Log
management also involves protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of logs. Another
problem with log management is ensuring that security, system, and network administrators regularly
perform effective analysis of log data. This publication provides guidance for meeting these log
management challenges.

Implementing the following recommendations should assist in facilitating more efficient and effective log
management for Federal departments and agencies.

Organizations should establish policies and procedures for log management.

To establish and maintain successful log management activities, an organization should develop standard
processes for performing log management. As part of the planning process, an organization should define
its logging requirements and goals. Based on those, an organization should then develop policies that
clearly define mandatory requirements and suggested recommendations for log management activities,
including log generation, transmission, storage, analysis, and disposal. An organization should also
ensure that related policies and procedures incorporate and support the log management requirements and
recommendations. The organization’s management should provide the necessary support for the efforts
involving log management planning, policy, and procedures development.

Requirements and recommendations for logging should be created in conjunction with a detailed analysis
of the technology and resources needed to implement and maintain them, their security implications and
value, and the regulations and laws to which the organization is subject (e.g., FISMA, HIPAA, SOX).
Generally, organizations should require logging and analyzing the data that is of greatest importance, and
also have non-mandatory recommendations for which other types and sources of data should be logged
and analyzed if time and resources permit. In some cases, organizations choose to have all or nearly all
log data generated and stored for at least a short period of time in case it is needed, which favors security
