       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022


1362   The overall impact level assessed by the organization leads to a preliminary selection of
1363   the FAL from which further tailoring may be done:
1364       • Low impact: FAL1
1365       • Moderate impact: FAL2
1366       • High impact: FAL3
1367   The preliminary selection assumes that higher potential impacts of failures in federated
1368   identity architectures should be mitigated by higher assurance processes. While this is
1369   often the case, organizations should consider the specific failures, impact categories,
1370   and impacted entities identified as part of the impact analysis to determine if additional
1371   tailoring is warranted.
1372   The result of this process, including any additional tailoring, is the initial assessment of
1373   the FAL, which will be as assessed against additional potential impacts as described in
1374   Sec. 5.3.

1375   5.3. Tailor and Document Assurance Levels
1376   Tailoring provides a process to modify an initially assessed assurance level or implement
1377   compensating controls based on ongoing detailed impact and risk assessments.
1378   Organizations SHOULD implement the assessed assurance level as defined in these
1379   guidelines. However, these guidelines provide flexibility to allow for organizations
1380   to meet specific mission needs and address unique risk appetites and considerations.
1381   Therefore, organizations SHALL establish and document an xAL tailoring process. At a
1382   minimum this process:
1383      1. SHALL include a structured governance approach to allow for decision-making
1384         and conflict resolution.
1385      2. SHALL document all decisions in the tailoring process, including the assessed
1386         xALs, modified xALs, and compensating controls in the Digital Identity
1387         Acceptance Statement (see Sec. 5.3.4).
1388      3. SHALL justify and document all risk-based decisions or modifications to
1389         the initially assessed xALs in the Digital Identity Acceptance Statement (see
1390         Sec. 5.3.4).
1391      4. SHOULD establish a cross-functional capability to support subject matter analysis
1392         of xAL selection impacts in the tailoring process.
1393      5. SHOULD be a continuous process that incorporates real world operational data to
1394         evaluate the impacts of selected xAL controls.
1395   The tailoring process promotes a structured means to balance risks and impacts in the
1396   furtherance of protecting systems, data, and services in a manner that enables mission
1397   success while supporting equity, privacy, and usability for individuals.
