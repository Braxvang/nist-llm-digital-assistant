6. Interconnecting Systems
     A system interconnection is defined as the direct connection of two or more
information systems for sharing data and other information resources. Organizations
choose to interconnect their information systems for a variety of reasons based on
their organizational needs. For example, they may interconnect information systems
to exchange data, collaborate on joint projects, or securely store data and backup
files.
   An interconnection is a direct connection between one organization’s system with
another system of the same or different organization through a mechanism by which
they are joined (the “pipe” through which data is made available, exchanged, or
passed one way only). The “pipe” may be a dedicated line that is owned by one of
the organizations or is leased from a third party (e.g., Integrated Services Digital
Network [ISDN], T1 or T3 line). Alternately, the systems may be connected over a
public network (e.g., Internet) using a virtual private network (VPN).
   Figure 6-1 depicts the concept of information system interconnection.




                    Figure 6-1. Information System Interconnection

   The following are examples of interconnections:
   • System A is connected to System B over a subscriber line leased by System A
     or System B.
   • System A is segmented such that System A1 is integrated with System A but is
     under different management control: Authorizing Official (AO).
   • System B provides data transport services between System A and System C.
     Here, System B is engaged in two interconnections with Systems A and C.
    Levels of system interconnection may vary. For example, some organizations
may choose to establish a limited interconnection, whereby users are restricted to a
single application or file location with rules governing access. Other organizations
may establish a broader interconnection, enabling users to access multiple
applications or databases. Still other organizations may establish an interconnection
that permits full transparency and access across their respective enterprises.
    Interconnecting information systems can expose the participating organizations
to risk. If the interconnection is not properly designed, security failures could
compromise the connected systems and their data. Similarly, if one of the connected
systems is compromised, the interconnection could be used as a conduit to
compromise the other system and its data.
   Federal policy requires that federal agencies establish interconnection security
agreements. Specifically, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130,
Appendix III, requires that agencies obtain written management authority before
connecting their information systems to other systems, based on a mutually
acceptable level of risk. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
