3.4     Summary

Wired and wireless LANs have the same security objectives: confidentiality, integrity, access control, and
availability. They also face the same high-level threats: denial of service, eavesdropping, man-in-the-
middle, masquerading, message modification, message replay, and traffic analysis. WLAN threats
typically involve an attacker with access to the radio link between two STAs or between a STA and an
AP. The most significant difference between protecting wireless and wired LANs is the relative ease of
intercepting and injecting network communications.

Pre-RSN IEEE 802.11 offers various features intended to provide security; unfortunately, these features
contain serious known vulnerabilities that can be exploited to impair access control and authentication,
encryption, data integrity checking, and availability. Examples include the following:

       Access Control and Authentication. Pre-RSN IEEE 802.11 performs access control through
        either open system or shared key authentication. Open system authentication does not verify any
        claimed credentials from the STA, so it is generally suitable only for providing public access to a
        WLAN. Shared key authentication uses a challenge-response scheme, but it has weaknesses that
        can permit man-in-the-middle attacks and other compromises. Also, neither open system nor
        shared key authentication allows a STA to verify the identity of an AP, so attackers can set up
        rogue APs and trick STAs into using them, potentially impacting confidentiality, integrity, and
        availability.
       Encryption. WEP suffers from a number of cryptographic weaknesses that enable attackers with
        readily available software tools to decipher captured data, sometimes with as little as a few
        minutes of recorded traffic. The weaknesses are a result of the way WEP employs the RC4
