SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


FR:4.16 The CKMS design shall specify the source and destination authentication policies
that it enforces when sharing a key and/or metadata with entities in differing security
domains.

FR:4.17 The CKMS design shall specify the confidentiality and integrity policies that it
enforces when sharing a key and/or metadata with entities in differing security domains.

FR:4.18 The CKMS design shall specify what assurances it requires when communicating
with entities from other security domains.

4.11.3 Equivalence and Compatibility of FCKMS Security Policies
When entities in different security domains need to share or mix data, their respective
security policies must be equivalent or compatible.

Two security domains have equivalent FCKMS Security Policies if the authority responsible
for each security domain agrees to accept the other domain’s FCKMS Security Policy as
being equivalent to its own FCKMS Security Policy in terms of the security protections,
including the levels of protection provided. If it is determined that the policies of two
FCKMSs are equivalent, then an entity in one security domain may share data with an entity
in another equivalent domain.

Two security domains are compatible if they can exchange a key and its metadata without
changing the protection provided to the key and metadata and without violating (or altering)
either domain’s FCKMS Security Policy. For example, suppose that domain 1 allows domain
1 entities to bind keys and metadata using RSA-2048, and domain 2 allows domain 2 entities
to receive and verify the binding on keys with RSA-2048, but domain 1 does not permit
using RSA-2048 for verifying the binding on keys, and domain 2 does not permit using RSA-
2048 for binding keys. Clearly, their security policies are different and not equivalent, yet a
key may be sent from a domain 1 entity to a domain 2 entity because the two domains are
compatible for a transaction that sends a key from domain 1 to domain 2.

FR:4.19 The CKMS design shall specify if and how it supports the review and verification
of another domain’s security before intra-domain communications are permitted.

FR:4.20 The CKMS design shall specify how it detects, prevents or warns an entity of the
possible security consequences of communicating with an entity in a security domain with
weaker policies.

                            A Federal CKMS could support the authorities from
PF:4.3
                            different security domains in reviewing each other’s FCKMS
                            Security Policies and verifying their equivalence or
                            compatibility.
              AC-4 (20)     A Federal CKMS could support key-management services
PF:4.4
                            for the sharing of sensitive data among two or more domains
                            whose FCKMS security policies have been verified as being
                            equivalent or compatible.
