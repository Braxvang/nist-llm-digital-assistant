Special Publication 800-73-4                                        Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification – Part 2:
                                                                    PIV Card Application Card Command Interface

Note 2: Cryptographic protocols using private/secret keys that require the “PIN” or “OCC” security
condition shall only be used on the contactless interface after a virtual contact interface (VCI) has been
established. The VCI 4 is established when the following security condition is met:

        (command is submitted over secure messaging) AND (the Discovery Object is present) AND (Bit 4
        of the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy is one) AND ((the security status indicator associated with
        the pairing code is TRUE) OR (Bit 3 of the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy is one)).

3.1     PIV Card Application Card Commands for Data Access

  3.1.1      SELECT Card Command

The SELECT card command sets the currently selected application. The PIV Card Application shall be
selected by providing its application identifier (see Part 1, Section 2.2) in the data field of the SELECT
command.

There shall be at most one PIV Card Application on any ICC. The PIV Card Application can also be
made the currently selected application by providing the right-truncated version (see Part 1, Section 2.2);
that is, without the two-byte version number in the data field of the SELECT command.

The complete AID, including the two-byte version, of the PIV Card Application that became the currently
selected card application upon successful execution of the SELECT command (using the full or right-
truncated PIV AID) shall be returned in the application property template.

If the currently selected application is the PIV Card Application when the SELECT command is given
and the AID in the data field of the SELECT command is either the AID of the PIV Card Application or
the right-truncated version thereof, then the PIV Card Application shall continue to be the currently
selected card application and the setting of all security status indicators in the PIV Card Application shall
be unchanged.

If the currently selected application is the PIV Card Application when the SELECT command is given
and the AID in the data field of the SELECT command is not the PIV Card Application (or the right-
truncated version thereof), but a valid AID supported by the ICC, then the PIV Card Application shall be
deselected and all the PIV Card Application security status indicators in the PIV Card Application shall
be set to FALSE.

If the currently selected application is the PIV Card Application when the SELECT command is given
and the AID in the data field of the SELECT command is an invalid AID not supported by the ICC, then
the PIV Card Application shall remain the currently selected application and all PIV Card Application
security status indicators shall remain unchanged.
