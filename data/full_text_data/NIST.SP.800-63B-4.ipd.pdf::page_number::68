NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
December 2022                                        Authentication and Lifecycle Management



 Duplication            Use authenticators from            4.2.2, 4.3.2, 5.1.7.1
                        which it is difficult to extract
                        and duplicate long-term
                        authentication secrets.
 Eavesdropping          Ensure the security of the         4.2.2
                        endpoint, especially with
                        respect to freedom from
                        malware such as key loggers,
                        prior to use.
                        Avoid use of unauthenticated       5.1.3.1
                        and unencrypted
                        communication channels to
                        send out-of-band authenticator
                        secrets.
                        Authenticate over                  4.1.2, 4.2.2, 4.3.2
                        authenticated protected
                        channels (e.g., observe lock
                        icon in browser window).
                        Use authentication protocols       5.2.8
                        that are resistant to replay
                        attacks such as pass-the-hash.
                        Use authentication endpoints       5.1.6.1, 5.1.8.1
                        that employ trusted input and
                        trusted display capabilities.
 Offline                Use an authenticator with a        5.1.2.1, 5.1.4.1, 5.1.5.1, 5.1.7.1,
 Cracking               high entropy authenticator         5.1.9.1
                        secret.
                        Store centrally verified           5.1.1.1.2, 5.2.7
                        memorized secrets in a salted,
                        hashed form, including a keyed
                        hash.
 Side Channel           Use authenticator algorithms       4.3.2
 Attack                 that are designed to maintain
                        constant power consumption
                        and timing regardless of secret
                        values.
 Phishing or            Use authenticators that provide    5.2.5
 Pharming               phishing resistance.
