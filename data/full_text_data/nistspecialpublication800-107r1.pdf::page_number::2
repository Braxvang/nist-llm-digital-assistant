                                       Abstract

Hash functions that compute a fixed-length message digest from arbitrary length
messages are widely used for many purposes in information security. This document
provides security guidelines for achieving the required or desired security strengths when
using cryptographic applications that employ the approved hash functions specified in
Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 180-4. These include functions such as
digital signatures, Keyed-hash Message Authentication Codes (HMACs) and Hash-based
Key Derivation Functions (Hash-based KDFs).


KEY WORDS: digital signatures, hash algorithm, hash function, hash-based key
derivation algorithms, hash value, HMAC, message digest, randomized hashing, random
number generation, SHA, truncated hash values.
