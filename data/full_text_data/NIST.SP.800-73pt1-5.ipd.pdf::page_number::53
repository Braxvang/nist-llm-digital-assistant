       NIST SP 800-73pt1-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification: Part 1
       September 2023                                 PIV Card Application Namespace, Data Model, and Representation

1170                   o Matching the live fingerprint, facial image, or iris image samples provided by the
1171                     cardholder with the biometric information embedded within the PIV Card
1172                   o Matching the visual characteristics of the cardholder with the photo on the PIV
1173                     Card 33

1174   B.1.      Authentication Mechanism Diagrams
1175   This section describes the activities and interactions involved in interoperable usage and
1176   authentication of the PIV Card. The authentication mechanisms represent how a relying party
1177   will authenticate the cardholder (regardless of which agency issued the card) in order to provide
1178   access to its systems or facilities. These activities and interactions are represented in functional
1179   authentication mechanism diagrams. These diagrams are not intended to provide syntactical
1180   commands or API function names.
1181   Each of the PIV authentication mechanisms described in this section can be broken into a
1182   sequence of one or more validation steps where Card, Credential, and Cardholder validation is
1183   performed. In the illustrations, the validation steps are marked as CardV, CredV, and HolderV to
1184   signify Card, Credential, and Cardholder validation, respectively.
1185   Depending on the assurance provided by the actual sequence of validation steps in a given PIV
1186   authentication mechanism, relying parties can make appropriate decisions for granting access to
1187   protected resources based on a risk analysis.

         Use of the photo on the PIV Card for visual authentication has been deprecated in FIPS 201-3 and may be removed from a future edition of the
       standard.
