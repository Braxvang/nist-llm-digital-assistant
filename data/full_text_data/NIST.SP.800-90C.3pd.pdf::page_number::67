       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                       Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

1867       Testing
1868   Two types of testing are specified in this Recommendation: health testing and implementation-
1869   validation testing. Health testing shall be performed on all RBGs that claim compliance with this
1870   Recommendation (see Section 7.1). Section 7.2 provides requirements for implementation
1871   validation.

1872           Health Testing
1873   Health testing is the testing of an implementation prior to and during normal operations to
1874   determine that the implementation continues to perform as expected and as validated. Health
1875   testing is performed by the RBG itself (i.e., the tests are designed into the RBG implementation).
1876   An RBG shall support the health tests specified in [SP800-90A] and [SP800-90B] as well as
1877   perform health tests on the components of SP 800-90C (see Section 7.1.1). [FIPS 140] specifies
1878   the testing to be performed within a cryptographic module.

1879   7.1.1. Testing RBG Components
1880   Whenever an RBG receives a request to start up or perform health testing, a request for health
1881   testing shall be issued to the RBG components (e.g., the DRBG and any entropy source).

1882   7.1.2. Handling Failures
1883   Failures may occur during the use of entropy sources and during the operation of other components
1884   of an RBG.
1885   Note that [SP800-90A] and [SP800-90B] discuss the error handling for DRBGs and entropy
1886   sources, respectively.

1887   7.1.2.1.        Entropy-Source Failures
1888   A failure of a validated entropy source may be reported to the Get_ES_Bitstring function (see
1889   item 3 of Section 3.1 and item 4 of Section 3.2) during entropy requests to the entropy sources or
1890   to the RBG when the entropy sources continue to function when entropy is not requested (see item
1891   5 of Section 3.2).

1892   7.1.2.2.        Failures by Non-Entropy-Source Components
1893   Failures by non-entropy-source components may be caused by either hardware or software
1894   failures. Some of these may be detected using the health testing within the RBG using known-
1895   answer tests. Failures could also be detected by the system in or on which the RBG resides.
1896   When such failures are detected that affect the RBG, RBG operation shall be terminated. The RBG
1897   must not be resumed until the reasons for the failure have been determined and the failures have
1898   been repaired and successfully tested for proper operation.
