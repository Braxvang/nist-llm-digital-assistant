                                                                               GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



 Consider performing automatic updates from the authoritative copy to the Web server periodically
  (e.g., every 15 minutes, hourly, or daily) because this will overwrite a Web site defacement
  automatically.

9.3     Recovering From a Security Compromise

Most organizations eventually face a successful compromise of one or more hosts on their network. The
first step in recovering from a compromise is to create and document the required policies and procedures
for responding to successful intrusions before an intrusion. 77 The response procedures should outline the
actions that are required to respond to a successful compromise of the Web server and the appropriate
sequence of these actions (sequence can be critical). Most organizations already have a dedicated
incident response team in place, which should be contacted immediately when there is suspicion or
confirmation of a compromise. In addition, the organization may wish to ensure that some of its staff are
knowledgeable in the fields of computer and network forensics. 78

A Web server administrator should follow the organization’s policies and procedures for incident
handling, and the incident response team should be contacted for guidance before the organization takes
any action after a suspected or confirmed security compromise. Examples of steps commonly performed
after discovering a successful compromise are as follows:

 Report the incident to the organization’s computer incident response capability.

 Isolate the compromised systems or take other steps to contain the attack so that additional
  information can be collected. 79

 Consult expeditiously, as appropriate, with management, legal counsel, and law enforcement.

 Investigate similar 80 hosts to determine if the attacker also has compromised other systems.

 Analyze the intrusion, including—

       The current state of the server, starting with the most ephemeral data (e.g., current network
          connections, memory dump, files time stamps, logged in users)

       Modifications made to the system’s software and configuration

       Modifications made to the data

       Tools or data left behind by the attacker

       System, intrusion detection, and firewall log files.

79
      Isolating the system must be accomplished with great care if the organization wishes to collect evidence. Many attackers
      configure compromised systems to erase evidence if a compromised system is disconnected from the network or rebooted.
      One method to isolate a system would be to reconfigure the nearest upstream switch or router.

      Similar hosts would include hosts that are in the same IP address range, have the same or similar passwords, share a trust
      relationship, and/or have the same OS and/or applications.
