                                                                            GUIDELINES ON ACTIVE CONTENT AND MOBILE CODE



5.1.5    Application Settings

The desktop applications that handle active content documents typically have built-in controls that can be
used to control or prevent access. For example, Apple’s Safari, Mozilla’s Firefox, and Microsoft’s
Internet Explorer Web browsers have options or preferences menus that can be used to select appropriate
security settings regarding downloadable active content and mitigate risk [CERT06]. Most Web browsers
provide pop-up blockers, which prevent Web sites from performing denial of service (DoS) attacks on a
browser by overloading it with too many open windows. As of mid-2007, the major Web browsers
incorporated phishing protection, which compares each Web site to a blacklist of known phishing Web
sites before accessing it. Extensions are available to the Mozilla Firefox browser that strictly limit the use
of JavaScript, Flash, and other active content technologies to trusted sites. Other browser-level security
controls include providing safety ratings for all sites and links visited on the Web as well as supporting
extended validation certificates that follow stricter issuing criteria.

The Security Configuration Checklists Program for IT Products hosted by NIST offers checklists that
outline steps to lower the risks associated with Web browsers through tightly controlled configurations. 9
Email, spreadsheet, word processor, database, and presentation graphic desktop software applications
have control settings similar to those of a browser and demand scrutiny in light of past exploits. For
example, the ability of many email applications to render HTML-formatted content can be configured to
disallow or disable any executable content, such as JavaScript. Tight functional binding among desktop
applications is a concern, particularly where automatic rendering of multi-part or composite documents is
enabled. Even today, products are often delivered with insecure default settings. Organizations
deploying such applications must be familiar with the security options available to ensure they are used in
accordance with organizational security policy.

5.1.6    Version Control and Patch Management

Administrators of systems can improve security by routinely applying security patches when they become
available. Users and administrators can also take advantage of security enhancements to applications that
they manage by upgrading to newer versions when appropriate. A comprehensive approach to patch
management that addresses all applications involved with active content is essential, since unpatched
flaws in ancillary products, including installed browser plug-ins, extensions, and helper applications,
often leave systems open to attack.

Updating software products automatically over the Web is becoming increasingly popular, as the benefits
are considerable. For example, users of recent versions of Windows can use built-in update features to
find bug fixes and product updates and download them automatically. Using this feature requires the
downloading of an ActiveX control that scans the computer for any needed updates particular to
Microsoft software already installed. Other manufacturers have followed suit and provide update
mechanisms for their own software. Many Web browsers, plug-ins, and extensions periodically check for
new updates and notify the user. With the user’s permission, updates can be installed automatically. As
this practice becomes more commonplace, organizations should be aware of their implicit decision to
allow a manufacturer to update software on their machines and act accordingly, following prescribed
policy. NIST SP 800-40 Version 2.0, Creating a Patch and Vulnerability Management Program
[NIST05] provides organizations with an overview of processes involved to efficiently patch systems
across the enterprise.
