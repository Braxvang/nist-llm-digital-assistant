or review by another organization. If so, they should determine if that oversight authority requires IDPSs
or other specific system security resources. Resource constraints should also be taken into consideration
by evaluators. Evaluators also need to define specialized sets of requirements for the following:

 Security capabilities, including information gathering, logging, detection, and prevention
 Performance, including maximum capacity and performance features
 Management, including design and implementation (e.g., reliability, interoperability, scalability,
  product security), operation and maintenance (including software updates), and training,
  documentation, and technical support
 Life cycle costs, both initial and maintenance costs.
When evaluating IDPS products, organizations should consider using a combination of several
sources of data on the productsâ€™ characteristics and capabilities.

Common product data sources include test lab or real-world product testing, vendor-provided
information, third-party product reviews, and previous IDPS experience from individuals within the
organization and trusted individuals at other organizations. When using data from other parties,
organizations should consider the fidelity of the data because it is often presented without an explanation
of how it was generated. There are several major challenges in performing in-depth hands-on IDPS
testing, such as the considerable resources needed and the lack of a standard test methodology and test
suites, which often make it infeasible. However, limited IDPS testing is helpful for evaluating security
requirements, performance, and operation and maintenance capabilities.
