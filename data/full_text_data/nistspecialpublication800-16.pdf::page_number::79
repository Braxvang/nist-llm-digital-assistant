        A- 130, while a project management system may only be subject to OMB Circular A- 130).

  2.    Intermediate   — Use   laws, regulations, and agency guidance to develop a comparative FT
        security requirements baseline appropriate to evaluate the existing security environment.


 3.     Advanced    — Evaluate     in-place controls and countermeasures against the comparative
        baseline to determine if the controls provide a security environment equal to or better than
        the baseline environment.
