communications can jeopardize investigations, prosecutions, the lives of witnesses, and the
safety of enforcement officers. In some cases, unauthorized modification or destruction of
information can result in loss of human life. In such cased, the integrity impact level is high.

Other factors affecting integrity impacts associated with substance control information are
discussed under Section D.16.1 (Criminal Apprehension) and Section D.16.2 (Criminal
Investigation and Surveillance).

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: Because the consequences of unauthorized modification or
destruction of information can be serious if the information is critical to tactical operations (i.e.,
is time-critical), the provisional integrity impact level recommended for substance control
information is moderate.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to substance control information. Most
substance control processes are usually tolerant of reasonable delays.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: The consequences of unavailability of
information can be serious if the information is critical to tactical operations i.e., is time-critical.
Failure of some processes during tactical operations can result in both threats to human life and
severe harm to public confidence in the agency. The impact level assigned to information and
information systems associated with these tactical processes is high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
most substance control information is moderate.

D.16.7 Crime Prevention Information Type

Crime prevention entails all efforts designed to create safer communities through the control and
reduction of crime by addressing the causes of crime and reducing the opportunities of crime.
The recommended provisional security categorization for the crime prevention information type
is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of crime prevention
information on the ability of responsible agencies to create safer communities through the
control and reduction of crime by addressing the causes of crime and reducing the opportunities
of crime. Generally, the unauthorized disclosure of crime prevention information will have only
a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In a few cases, details of crime
prevention programs are sensitive (e.g., location of actively monitored surveillance cameras
where only a fraction of camera feeds are monitored). In such cases, unauthorized disclosure of
