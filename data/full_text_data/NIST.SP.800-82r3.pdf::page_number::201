NIST SP 800-82r3                                                                    Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

C.3.3. Environmental Events
     •     [N][I] Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. 28 The Great East Japan Earthquake on
           March 11, 2011, struck off the coast of Japan and sent a massive tsunami inland toward
           the nuclear plant. The tsunami compromised the plant’s seawall, flooding much of the
           plant, including the location housing the emergency generators. This emergency power
           was critical for operating the control rooms and providing coolant water for the reactors.
           The loss of coolant caused the reactor cores to overheat to the point where the fuel’s
           zirconium cladding reacted with water, releasing hydrogen gas and fueling large
           explosions in three of the four reactor buildings. This resulted in large-scale radiation
           leakage that has impacted plant employees, nearby citizens, and the local environment.
           Post-event analysis found that the plant’s emergency response center had insufficient
           secure communication lines to provide other areas of the plant with information on key
           safety-related instrumentation.

C.3.4. Accidental Events
     •     [N][D] Vulnerability scanner incidents. 29 While a ping sweep was being performed on
           an active SCADA network that controlled 9-foot robotic arms, one arm became active
           and swung around 180 degrees. The controller for the arm was in standby mode before
           the ping sweep was initiated. In a separate incident, a ping sweep was being performed
           on an ICS network to identify the hosts that were attached to the network for inventory
           purposes, and it caused a system that controlled the creation of integrated circuits in the
           fabrication plant to hang. This test resulted in the destruction of $50,000 worth of wafers.
     •     [N][D] Penetration testing incident.30 A natural gas utility hired an IT security
           consulting organization to conduct penetration testing on its corporate IT network. The
           consulting organization carelessly ventured into a part of the network that was directly
           connected to the SCADA system. The penetration test locked up the SCADA system, and
           the utility was not able to send gas through its pipelines for four hours.
     •     [N][I] NERC Enforcement Action. 31 In 2019, a U.S. energy company was fined $10
           million by NERC for cybersecurity violations that took place between 2015 and 2018.
           The inability to comply with U.S. standards for cybersecurity was seen as a risk to the
           security and reliability of the overall power system.
     •     [N][D] NASA fire. 32 A security patch was applied to an OT component that controlled a
           large engineering oven. The patch and associated reboot caused the oven to stop running,
           which led to a fire that destroyed the spacecraft hardware. The reboot also impeded alarm
           activation, which allowed the fire to go undetected for 3.5 hours before discovery.
