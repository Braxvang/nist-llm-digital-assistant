      NIST SP 800-157r1 ipd                            Derived PIV Credentials (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


483   2.3. Maintenance
484   The maintenance activities required for derived PIV credentials depend on the type of
485   derived PIV credential (PKI-based or non-PKI-based) being used. Maintenance activities
486   include rekeying, modification of certificates, and replacement of an activation factor
487   (biometric or memorized secret) as appropriate.
488   Derived PIV credentials are unaffected when the subscriber replaces their PIV Card with
489   a new one (reissuance) or when the PIV Card is lost, stolen, or damaged. The ability for
490   the subscriber to use a derived PIV credential is especially useful while waiting for a
491   new PIV Card to be issued. In such circumstances, the subscriber continues to be able
492   to use the derived PIV credential to gain logical access to remote federally controlled
493   information systems from their endpoint.
494   Updating the activation data (biometric or memorized secret, such as a PIN) or resetting
495   the activation retry count for a derived PIV credential SHALL be performed in
496   accordance with Sec. 3.1.4 for PKI-based derived PIV credentials or Sec. 3.2.3 for non-
497   PKI-based derived PIV credentials.

498   2.3.1. PKI-based Derived PIV Credential Maintenance
499   PKI-based derived PIV credentials require typical maintenance activities applicable
500   to asymmetric cryptographic credentials, including rekeying and modification. These
501   activities MAY be performed either remotely or in person and SHALL be performed
502   in accordance with the certificate policy under which the derived PIV authentication
503   certificate is issued. When certificate rekeying or modification is performed remotely
504   for a derived PIV credential, communication between the issuer and the cryptographic
505   module in which the derived PIV authentication private key is stored SHALL only occur
506   over mutually authenticated secure sessions between tested and validated cryptographic
507   modules.
508   Some maintenance activities for the subscriber’s PIV Card may trigger corresponding
509   maintenance activities for the derived PIV credential since the derived PIV credential will
510   need to be reissued if any information about the subscriber that appears in the credential
511   changes. For example, if the subscriber’s PIV Card is reissued as a result of a change in
512   the subscriber’s name and the subscriber’s name appears in the derived PIV authentication
513   certificate, a new derived PIV authentication certificate with the new name SHALL be
514   issued and the previous certificate invalidated.

515   2.3.2. Non-PKI-based Derived PIV Credential Maintenance
516   The maintenance activities for non-PKI-based derived PIV credentials are somewhat
517   simpler than for PKI-based derived PIV credentials since the former do not contain
518   information about the cardholder and do not carry a specific expiration date. Identity
519   information SHALL be maintained in the PIV identity account and SHALL be updated
520   when needed.
