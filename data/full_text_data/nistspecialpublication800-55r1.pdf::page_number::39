   â€¢    Measures processes that already exist and are established. Measuring inconsistent
        processes will not provide meaningful data about information security performance and
        will not be useful for targeting specific aspects of performance. However, attempting
        such measurement may still be useful to attain a baseline to be closely monitored through
        continuous assessment and further measurement to improve the information security
        posture.

Organizations may decide to use a weighting scale to differentiate the importance of selected
measures and ensure that results accurately reflect existing information security program
priorities. This would involve assigning values to each measure based on its importance in the
context of the overall information security program. Weight should be based on the overall risk
mitigation goals and would likely reflect higher criticality of enterprise-level initiatives versus
smaller-scale initiatives. This scale is a useful tool that facilitates the integration of information
security measures into the departmental capital planning process.

5.5.3   Establishing Performance Targets

Establishing performance targets is an important component of defining information security
measures. Performance targets establish a benchmark by which success is measured. The
degree of success is based on the proximity of the measure result to the stated performance
target. The mechanics of establishing performance targets differ for implementation measures
and the other two types of measures (effectiveness/efficiency and impact). For implementation
measures, targets are set to 100 percent completion of specific tasks.

Setting performance targets for effectiveness/efficiency and impact measures is complex because
management will need to apply qualitative and subjective reasoning to determine appropriate
levels of security effectiveness and efficiency, and use these levels as targets of performance for
applicable measures. Although every organization desires effective implementation of security
controls, efficient delivery of security services, and minimal impact of security events on its
mission, the associated measurements will be different for different systems. An organization
can attempt to establish performance targets for these measures and should be ready to adjust
these targets, based on actual measurements, once they are obtained. The organization may also
decide not to set targets for these measures until the first measurement is collected that can be
used as a performance baseline. Once the baseline is obtained and corrective actions identified,
appropriate measurement targets and implementation milestones that are realistic for a specific
system environment can be defined. If performance targets cannot be established after the
baseline has been obtained, management should evaluate whether the measured activities and
corresponding measures are providing the expected value for the organization.
