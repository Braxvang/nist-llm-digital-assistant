1 Purpose
This publication is the sixth part in a series of Recommendations regarding the modes of
operation of block ciphers. The purpose of this part is to provide approved methods for key
wrapping, i.e., the protection of cryptographic keys.

2 Authority
This publication has been developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security
Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements
for federal information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national
security systems.

This recommendation has been prepared for use by Federal agencies. It may be used by
nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright. (Attribution
would be appreciated by NIST.)

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards and guidelines made
mandatory and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory
authority. Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing
authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.

Conformance testing for implementations of this Recommendation will be conducted within the
framework of the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP) and the Cryptographic
Module Validation Program (CMVP). The requirements of this Recommendation are indicated
by the word “shall.” Some of these requirements may be out-of-scope for CMVP or CAVP
validation testing, and thus are the responsibility of entities using, implementing, installing, or
configuring applications that incorporate this Recommendation.

3 Introduction

3.1   Overview
This Recommendation specifies a deterministic authenticated-encryption mode of operation of
the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) block cipher [3]. The mode is called AES Key Wrap,
abbreviated as KW in this Recommendation. Although KW can be used in conjunction with any
reversible padding scheme, a variant of KW with an internal padding scheme is also specified to
promote interoperability. This variant is called AES Key Wrap With Padding, abbreviated as
KWP. The analogue of KW with the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA) [5] as the
underlying block cipher is also specified, to support legacy applications. This analogue is called
Triple DEA Key Wrap, abbreviated as TKW.
