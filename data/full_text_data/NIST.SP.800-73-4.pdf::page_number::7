Special Publication 800-73-4         Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification â€“ Part 1: PIV
                                  Card Application Namespace, Data Model and Representation


II.       Configuration Management

When a Federal agency adds one or several optional features listed in the previous section (Revision
History) to its PIV Cards, it is necessary for client applications to upgrade the PIV Middleware
accordingly. This will enable the PIV Middleware to recognize and process the new data objects and/or
features.

Where maximum interoperability is required, it is necessary to upgrade to SP 800-73-4 based PIV
Middleware as they become available. Only SP 800-73-4 based PIV Middleware fully support all
capabilities outlined in the Revision History. 1 Previous versions of the PIV Middleware (based on
SP800-73-3, SP 800-73-2, or SP 800-73-1) are unaware of new SP 800-73-4 features and thus have the
following limitations:

      +   SP 800-73-3 based PIV Middleware:
               o    Do not support On-card Biometric Comparison

               o    Do not support Secure Messaging.

               Recommendation: SP 800-73-3 based PIV Middleware should be restricted to applications
               that do not use the above features.

      +   In addition to the limitations listed above, SP 800-73-2 based PIV Middleware:
               o    Do not support the Key History feature.

               o    Do not support the iris images data object.

              Recommendation: SP 800-73-2 based PIV Middleware should be restricted to applications
              that do not use the new features supported by SP 800-73-3 and SP 800-73-4 based
              middleware.

      +   In addition to the limitations listed above, SP 800-73-1 based PIV Middleware:
              o     Do not recognize the PIV Discovery Object and thus are unable to recognize or prompt
                    for the Global PIN for PIV Cards with Global PIN enabled.

              o     Do not support the PIV Middleware version API function.

              Recommendation: SP 800-73-1 based PIV Middleware should be restricted to applications
              that do not use the new features supported by SP 800-73-2, SP 800-73-3, and SP 800-73-4
              based middleware.




1 Implementation of secure messaging and virtual contact interface are optional.
