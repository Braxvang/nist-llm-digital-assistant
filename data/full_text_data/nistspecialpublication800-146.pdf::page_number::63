                                                            CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



 What is the consumer allowed to see in an audit log, e.g., is information related to other cloud
  consumers protected?
 What is the responsibility of a consumer to report an incident in a PaaS model?
 Can a provider legally intervene in stopping an attack on an application in its cloud if it is only an
  indirect contractual relationship (e.g., three tiers of customers)?
Forensic analysis in a SaaS model may be the sole responsibility of a provider while forensic analysis in
an IaaS model may be the primary responsibility of the consumer (with some collaboration with the
provider). The PaaS model appears to split responsibilities between consumers and providers.

8.5   Information Security

Information security pertains to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of data and ensuring data
availability. An organization that owns and runs its IT operations will normally take the following types
of measures for its data security:

 Organizational/Administrative controls specifying who can perform data related operations such as
  creation, access, disclosure, transport, and destruction.
 Physical Controls relating to protecting storage media and the facilities housing storage devices.
 Technical Controls for Identity and Access Management (IAM), encryption of data at rest and in
  transit, and other data audit-handling requirements for complying with regulatory requirements.
When an organization subscribes to a cloud, all the data generated and processed will physically reside in
premises owned and operated by a provider. In this context, the fundamental issue is whether a consumer
can obtain an assurance that a provider is implementing the same or equivalent controls as to what the
consumer would have implemented. The following issues arise when a consumer is trying to ensure
coverage for these controls:

 Regulatory compliance requirements, with regard to data that a consumer is intending to move to a
  cloud, may call for specific levels and granularities of audit logging, generation of alerts, activity
  reporting, and data retention. Since these may not be a part of standard service agreements offered by
  providers, the issue becomes whether consumers are willing to: (1) include these procedures as part of
  their contractual data protection responsibilities, and (2) enforce them as part of their standard
  operating procedures.
 Even in cases where a provider meets the consumer's data protection requirements through
  contractual obligations and operational configurations, the provider should offer methods that the
  consumer can use to assess whether or not the requirements continue to be met.
 For encryption of data at rest, the strength of the encryption algorithm suite, the key management
  schemes a provider supports, and the number of keys for each data owner (individual or shared keys)
  should be known by the data owners.
Data processed in a public cloud and applications running in a public cloud may experience different
security exposures than would be the case in an onsite-hosted environment. A number of considerations
affect security of data and processing conducted in a cloud. For example, the quality of a cloud's
implementation, the attack surface of a cloud, the likely pool of attackers, system complexity, and the
expertise level of cloud administrators are a few considerations that affect cloud system security.
