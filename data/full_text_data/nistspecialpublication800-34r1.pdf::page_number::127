                                                 CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



Appendix D—Personnel Considerations in Continuity and Contingency Planning

Information system contingency plans are rarely developed or executed on their own. When an incident
occurs that impacts information system operations, it often impacts the organization’s personnel. Proper
considerations for the safety, security, and well-being of personnel should be planned for in anticipation
of a disruptive event. Evacuation procedures and regaining access to the facility should be coordinated
and jointly exercised with local response organizations and federal authorities. Organizations should also
have in place methods and standards for interfacing with media inquiries and for sending out responsive
messages to personnel. Planning for these factors typically falls within the scope of an occupant
emergency plan (OEP), business continuity plan (BCP), or crisis communications plan, which are all
plans coordinated with the ISCP. In light of heightened awareness of these issues due to the terrorist
attacks in 2001, the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the threat of pandemic influenza, and general
increased security throughout our society, “personnel considerations” warrant further discussion in all
related planning areas.

Personnel Safety and Evacuation
Personnel safety and evacuation during and after a disruption are typically addressed in an OEP.
Personnel should be aware of their physical security and exit procedures and should practice these
procedures during regular fire drill exercises. OEPs and ISCPs may include instructions for securing
office spaces, personal workstations, and laptop computers to prevent access to information and to reduce
the likelihood of vandalism or theft. Plans may also include reminders to collect identification, car keys,
and other important belongings if the nature of the incident and time allows. In addition, procedures may
need to address how to regain access. Instructions for the most appropriate ways to exit the facility are
based on specific site requirements and local fire code regulations. A “floor warden” methodology may
be incorporated into the plan and instituted as a normal practice. This methodology involves designating
and training one or two specific people from each floor to be responsible for the evacuation of all
personnel. This responsibility usually rotates so that the same people are not responsible for overseeing
evacuations all year.

The OEP should also include procedures and multiple contact methods for collecting a personnel head
count after the disaster. It is important for senior management to know who was in the building prior to
the event and who has been accounted for (both onsite and offsite personnel) so that civil authorities (fire,
police, and rescue) and families can be properly informed of the situation. Procedures should be
developed to instruct personnel to meet and be accounted for at a specific preplanned site, away from the
building. Personnel should be provided alternate procedures to contact the organization and provide
information on their whereabouts in the event the preplanned location is not safe. A centralized reporting
methodology to one person or to a team will reduce possible confusion and conflicting information.
During the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, many organizations were successful using television and
radio announcements or Internet Web sites as a means to communicate accounting procedures to staff.
Contact methods may be developed to be sent out and/or received by telephone, answering service,
electronic mail (email), instant messenger (IM), Web site, meeting at a physical location, or by a
combination of methods. As the use of social networking within the federal government increases,
approved and verifiable means for crisis communications may be another option. Automated notification
services are applications that use a combination of methods that are designed to contact large groups or
multiple types of groups within the organization in a very short time period. Emergency contact
information can be printed on small cards, along with contact information of coworkers, and issued to
personnel to be stored with their identification badges as a normal practice. It is important to remember
that personnel contact information is considered privacy information, and it must be appropriately
protected.
