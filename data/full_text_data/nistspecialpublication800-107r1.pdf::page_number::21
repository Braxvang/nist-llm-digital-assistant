derivation key. HMAC can be used with an approved hash function to derive keying
material.
The security strength of a derived key depends on the security strength provided by the
key-derivation key, the hash function used in the HMAC construction and the length of
the derived key. If a derived key is intended to provide s bits of security strength, then
each of the following shall be equal to or greater than s:
      •   The security strength provided by the key-derivation key,
      •   The preimage strength of the hash function used in the HMAC construction, and
      •   The length of the derived key in bits.

5.5       Random Number (Bit) Generation
A random bit generator (RBG) is used to produce random bits. These bits may be used
directly or may be converted to a random number (integer). Approved RBGs that use
deterministic algorithms 5, along with methods for converting a bit string to an integer can
be found in SP 800-90A. Other approved random number generators were either
specified or approved by reference in FIPS 186-2 [FIPS 186-2]; however, their use is
limited (see SP 800-131A [SP 800-131A]).
RBGs may be constructed using hash functions. The hash function used by the RBG
shall be selected so that the RBG can provide a security strength that meets or exceeds
the minimum security strength required for the random bits that it generates. See SP 800-
57, Part 1, for the security strength that can be provided for each approved hash function
for random number generation.
