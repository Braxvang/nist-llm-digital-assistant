                                                            IMPERATIVE 8 – Securing Emerging Technologies



     •    National Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN). Federal statute directs
          NIST to conduct research and development that supports the acceleration and
          advancement of a nationwide broadband network that will help police, firefighters,
          emergency medical service professionals and other public safety officials stay safe
          and do their jobs. In FY18, supported by the joint National Telecommunications
          and Information Administration (NTIA) and NIST Public Safety Communications
          Research (PSCR)82 program, NIST expanded its support to provision mobile
          application vetting tools for public safety mobile application security and
          continued its research into identity management, data and application isolation
          technologies, wearable devices, and broadband standards. In FY19, NIST will
          continue to strengthen its relationship with public safety and commercial
          telecommunications stakeholders. Work concerning mobile application vetting and
          cybersecurity will continue to evolve as NIST refines methods for evaluating tools
          as well as the test cases used in those evaluations. The PSCR program also plans
          fund grants and prize challenges to solve current problems and fill future gaps in
          public safety broadband technology.
     •    Fog Computing. New concepts and technologies are needed to manage
          a growing fleet of IoT devices to ensure minimal latency (delay) across a
          distributed and decentralized model. Fog computing is the next new technology
          that offers a distributed and federated compute model, which provides low-
          latency computational resources, elastic capabilities, and data analytics and
          management. In 2018, NIST facilitated an effort to document the fog computing
          conceptual model to help foster productive conversations among practitioners
          and researchers and to guide the advancement of technologies that support this
          model. The publication83 also introduces fog computing’s subsidiary concept, mist
          computing, and identifies these concepts in relation to cloud computing, cloudlets,
          and edge computing.
