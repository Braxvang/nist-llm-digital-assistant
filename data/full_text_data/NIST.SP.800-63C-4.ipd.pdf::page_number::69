1751   tracking and profiling [NISTIR8062]. Technical measures, such as those outlined in
1752   Sec. 5.1.3 for proxied federation and Sec. 6.2.5 for pairwise pseudonymous identifiers,
1753   can increase the effectiveness of policies by making it more difficult to track or profile
1754   subscribers beyond operational requirements.

1755   9.2. Notice and Consent
1756   To build subscriber trust in federation, subscribers need to be able to develop reliable
1757   assumptions about how their information is being processed. For instance, it can be
1758   helpful for subscribers to understand what information will be transmitted, which
1759   attributes for the transaction are required versus optional, and to have the ability to decide
1760   whether to transmit optional attributes to the RP. Accordingly, Sec. 5.1 requires that
1761   positive confirmation be obtained from the authorized party before any attributes about
1762   the subscriber are transmitted to any RP. In determining when a set of RPs should share
1763   a common pairwise pseudonymous identifier as in Sec. 6.2.5.2, the IdP considers the
1764   subscriber’s understanding of such a grouping of RPs and the role of notice in assisting
1765   such understanding. An effective notice will take into account user experience design
1766   standards and research, as well as an assessment of privacy risks that may arise from
1767   the information processing. There are various factors to be considered, including the
1768   reliability of the assumptions subscribers may have about the processing and the role of
1769   different entities involved in federation. However, a link to a complex, legalistic privacy
1770   policy or general terms and conditions that a substantial number of subscribers do not
1771   read or understand is never an effective notice.
1772   Sec. 5.1 does not specify which party should provide the notice. In some cases, a party
1773   in a federation may not have a direct connection to the subscriber in order to provide
1774   notice and obtain consent. Although multiple parties may elect to provide notice, it is
1775   permissible for parties to determine in advance, either contractually or through trust
1776   framework policies, which party will provide the notice and obtain confirmation, as long
1777   as the determination is being based upon factors that center on enabling the subscriber to
1778   pay attention to the notice and make an informed choice.
1779   If an IdP is using an allowlist of RPs as described in Sec. 5.3, any RPs on that list are
1780   not presented to the subscriber during an authentication transaction. Since the IdP does
1781   not provide notice to the subscriber at runtime, the IdP makes its list of allowlisted RPs
1782   available to the subscriber so that the subscriber can see which RPs on the allowlist have
1783   access to which of the subscriber’s attributes in an authentication transaction. Since IdPs
1784   can not share a subscriber’s authentication information or attributes with an allowlisted
1785   RP outside of an authentication transaction involving the subscriber (see Sec. 5.5), the
1786   existence of an RP on a list of IdPs does not indicate that the subscriber’s information will
1787   be shared. However, if the subscriber logs into any of the allowlisted RPs using the IdP,
1788   the attributes indicated will be shared as part of the authentication transaction.
1789   If a subscriber’s runtime decisions at the IdP were stored in the subscriber account by
1790   the IdP to facilitate future transactions, the IdP also needs to allow the subscriber to view
