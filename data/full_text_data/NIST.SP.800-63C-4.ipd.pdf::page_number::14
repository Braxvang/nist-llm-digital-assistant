      NIST SP 800-63C-4 ipd                                             Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                                     Federation and Assertions


325   1.   Purpose
326   This section is informative.
327   This publication and its companion volumes, [SP800-63], [SP800-63A], and
328   [SP800-63B], provide technical guidelines to organizations for the implementation of
329   digital identity services.
330   This document, SP 800-63C, provides requirements to identity providers (IdPs) and
331   relying parties (RPs) of federated identity systems. Federation allows a given IdP to
332   provide authentication attributes and (optionally) subscriber attributes to a number of
333   separately-administered RPs through the use of federation protocols and assertions.
334   Similarly, RPs can use more than one IdP as sources of identities.
