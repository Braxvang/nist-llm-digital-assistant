NIST SP 800-124r2                                                  Guidelines for Managing the Security

through a mobile app vetting service before the apps are provisioned to the device or allowed to
be downloaded from the managed enterprise app store [2]. Access to the official public app
stores or unofficial app stores is restricted in this deployment model.

5.1.3.2.       Corporate-Owned Personally Enabled (COPE)
COPE devices are issued by the enterprise to employees. The COPE model is less restrictive on
employee personal use. While the enterprise owns (or leases) the device and enforces usage
restrictions, these restrictions are more lenient, allowing employees some personal use of the
device. For example, an employee may be permitted to download certain apps or receive
personal text messages on the COPE device. Although a COPE device is personally enabled, the
device and the information on the device belong to the enterprise. Employees should be informed
about enterprise restrictions and have appropriate expectations of software and device
configurations that affect functionality and privacy.
An example of the COPE deployment model is a managed GFE device. This may include a fully
supervised device or a separate enrollment to manage the device by downloading an EMM
application from the official app store. MTD is used for endpoint protection and a blocklisting
approach is implemented for many COPE deployments. For COPE, personal applications are
allowed on the GFE device, and the end user is able to access the official public app stores, but
app usage may be restricted by the enterprise blocklist. All mobile apps on the device should go
through a mobile app vetting service; apps downloaded to the device are vetted during or after
installation by the app vetting service and checked and maintained against an application
blocklist.

5.1.3.3.       BYOD and Choose Your Own Device (CYOD)
The BYOD deployment model allows employees to use their personally owned mobile devices
to access enterprise data and services. The employee may, for example, access both personal
email and sensitive enterprise email via the same application. The BYOD model raises concerns
regarding leakage of sensitive enterprise information via the device to untrustworthy third-party
backend systems that communicate with various apps on the device. To protect the
confidentiality and integrity of enterprise data and systems as well as the privacy of the device
user/owner, IT staff may use a tool such as an EMM to enforce DLP by applying restrictions
such as disabling the copy/paste feature when in enterprise applications. An enterprise should
also use MTD technology to ensure that the device is protected from mobile threats and attempts
to compromise the device.
A choose your own device (CYOD) device is purchased by an employee for personal use but
selected from a list of devices provided by the enterprise for interacting with the enterprise’s
networks and software. If the employee’s personal device is on the approved list and the
employee installs software required by the enterprise, then the employee may use that device to
access the enterprise’s data and services. Employees with personal devices that are not on the
approved list must often carry a second (enterprise-enabled) device for work-related activities, so
choosing from the approved list allows a user to avoid carrying an additional device.
