Appendix A—RFID Standards and Security Mechanisms

RFID readers and tags must conform to the same standards and designs to be interoperable. These
standards and designs also can be used to coordinate the use of certain tags across multiple enterprises
and in the supply chain. Common standards and designs may facilitate training, future equipment
procurement, and equipment upgrades. Some readers and some tags can operate using multiple standards.
This appendix describes international and industrial standards for RFID systems, as well as security
mechanisms used in those standards. It also discusses regulations for frequencies used by various RFID
standards and non-standard implementations. For the updates on the status of any particular standard,
readers should refer to the standard body’s official Web site.

A.1     International Standards

RFID standards have been developed by national and international standards groups such as the ISO and
the IEC. There are separate standards for contactless smart cards and for item management.

ISO/IEC 14443 and ISO/IEC 15693 are the most popular smart card standards.

 ISO/IEC 14443 describes proximity smart cards which have an intermediate range up to 10 cm and
  operate at 13.56 MHz. The standard contains four parts: (1) physical characteristics, (2) radio
  frequency power and signaling, (3) initialization and anti-collision, and (4) transmission protocols.
  ISO/IEC 14443 has two variants known as ISO/IEC 14443A and ISO/IEC 14443B which have
  different communications interfaces. Readers that are ISO/IEC 14443 compliant must be able to
  communicate using ISO/IEC 14443A and ISO/IEC 14443B. ISO/IEC 14443A parts 1 through 4 are
  used in the DoD Common Access Card (CAC), which serves as an identification card. The CAC has
  a FIPS-approved algorithm.
 ISO/IEC 15693 operates at 13.56 MHz and describes vicinity smart cards which can be read from a
  farther distance than proximity cards. Such cards have a range of up to approximately 1 meter.
ISO/IEC 18000 is an RFID standard for item management and describes the air interface for various
frequencies. Each standard within the ISO/IEC 18000 family defines communications parameters and
applies to a specific electromagnetic frequency. ISO/IEC 18000-1 covers general parameters, and
ISO/IEC 18000-2 through 18000-7 cover specifics for particular frequency ranges.

 ISO/IEC 18000-2 covers frequencies below 135 kHz. It has two types, A (Full Duplex) and B (Half
  Duplex). These types are different on the physical layer. A full duplex tag can communicate with a
  reader while the reader is simultaneously communicating with the tag. A half duplex tag supports bi-
  directional communication with a reader but only one device, the tag or the reader, can communicate
  at the same time.
 ISO/IEC 18000-3 covers frequencies operating at 13.56 MHz and describes two non-interfering and
  not interoperable modes of operation. Users are recommended to use just one mode for any single
  application. Both modes use a 64-bit identifier.

        –   Mode 1 has a locking feature that is not protected by a password. If the tag receives the lock
            command, it locks the corresponding area of memory permanently. Lock can be applied
            selectively to different blocks of memory.

        –   Mode 2 has a 48-bit password used to protect memory access. The tag can be configured to
            require or not require this password. If required, then read and write commands will require
            the reader to issue the correct 48-bit password. The lock command can be used to
