5. Roles and Responsibilities
A CKMS may need to interface with humans that are performing specific management,
user, and/or operational roles. Each role should have specific authorizations defined for
it, and the persons performing that role should be provided access to a set of key and
metadata management functions that are necessary for carrying out the responsibilities of
the role. Examples of possible CKMS roles include, but are not limited to, the following:

   a) System Authority: A system authority is responsible to executive-level
      management (e.g., the Chief Information Officer) for the overall operation and
      security of a CKMS. A system authority manages all operational CKMS roles. An
      operational role is a role that directly operates the CKMS.

   b) System Administrator: System administrators are responsible for the personnel,
      daily operation, training, maintenance, and related management of a CKMS other
      than its keys. The system administrator is responsible for initially verifying
      individual identities and then establishing appropriate identifiers for all personnel
      involved in the operation and use of a CKMS. These include users, security
      auditors, cryptographic officers, key custodians, operators, maintenance workers,
      and agents required to vet the credentials of people seeking access to data in the
      system or use of the CKMS.

   c) Cryptographic Officer: A cryptographic officer is authorized to perform
      cryptographic initialization and management functions on a CKMS and its
      cryptographic modules.

   d) Domain Authority: A domain authority is responsible for defining and accepting
      a Domain Security Policy, for subsequently deciding the conditions necessary for
      communicating with other security domains, and then for assuring that the
      conditions are met.

   e) Key Custodian: A key custodian is designated to distribute and/or load keys or
      key splits into a cryptographic module. Key custodians may be used to implement
      multi-party control and key splitting (See Section 6.7.4 and Section 6.7.5).

   f) Key Owner: A key owner is an entity (e.g., person, group, organization, device,
      or cryptographic module) authorized to use a cryptographic key or key pair and
      whose identifier is associated with a cryptographic key or key pair. For public-
      private key pairs, the association is typically established through a registration
      process. A symmetric key may have a single specific owner, or multiple owners
      may share the key.

   g) CKMS User: CKMS users utilize the CKMS when key management functions
      are required to support an application. CKMS users may be, and often are, key
      owners.
