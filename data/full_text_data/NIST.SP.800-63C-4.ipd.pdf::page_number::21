      NIST SP 800-63C-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                                       Federation and Assertions


511   protocol, but can include presentation of software attestations and proof of control over
512   URLs at trusted domains.
513   Government-operated IdPs asserting authentication at FAL2 SHALL protect keys used
514   for signing or encrypting those assertions with mechanisms validated at [FIPS140] Level
515   1 or higher.

516   4.3. Federation Assurance Level 3 (FAL3)
517   All the requirements at FAL1 and FAL2 apply at FAL3 except where overridden by more
518   specific or stringent requirements here.
519   At FAL3, the subscriber SHALL authenticate to the RP by presenting an authenticator
520   directly to the RP in addition to presenting an assertion. The authenticator presented is
521   known as a bound authenticator, described in Sec. 6.1.2. For example, the subscriber
522   goes through a federated login process at the IdP and RP, and the RP then prompts the
523   subscriber for a bound authenticator that is associated with that RP subscriber account.
524   The bound authenticator presented at FAL3 need not be the same authenticator used by
525   the subscriber to authenticate to the IdP. The assertion is used to identify the subscriber to
526   the RP while the bound authenticator gives very high assurance that the party attempting
527   to log in is the subscriber identified in the assertion. FAL3 is not reached at the RP until
528   the subscriber authenticates with the bound authenticator and the RP verifies that the
529   authenticator presented is correctly bound to the RP subscriber account identified by the
530   assertion.
531   At FAL3, the trust agreement and registration between the IdP and RP SHALL be
532   established statically. All identifying key material and federation parameters for all parties
533   (including the list of attributes sent to the RP) SHALL be fixed ahead of time, before
534   the federated authentication process can take place. Runtime decisions MAY be used to
535   further limit what is sent between parties in the federated authentication process (e.g., a
536   runtime decision could opt to not disclose an email address even though this attribute was
537   included in the parameters of the trust agreement).
538   IdPs asserting authentication at FAL3 SHALL protect keys used for signing or encrypting
539   those assertions with mechanisms validated at [FIPS140] Level 1 or higher.

540   4.4. Requesting and Processing xALs
541   Since an IdP is capable of asserting the identities of many different subscribers with a
542   variety of authenticators using a variety of federation parameters, the IAL, AAL, and FAL
543   could vary across different federated logins, even to the same RP.
544   The RP SHALL be informed of the following information for each federated transaction:
545       â€¢ The IAL of the subscriber account being presented to the RP, or an indication that
546         no IAL claim is being made

                                                    9
