                                                                                                   •   The reader obtains information from the PIV Card that allows it to determine an identifier
                                                                                                       for the card and to determine the card’s Card Authentication certificate.

                                                                                                   •   The reader sends a challenge string to the PIV Card and requests an asymmetric operation
                                                                                                       in response.

                                                                                                   •   The card responds to the previously issued challenge by signing it using the Card
                                                                                                       Authentication private key.

                                                                                                   •   The relying system (reader or controller) uses the public key from the Card
                                                                                                       Authentication certificate to verify the response from the card.

                                                                                                   •   The relying system verifies that the Card Authentication certificate is valid.

                                                                                                   •   The relying system uses the identifier from the card to make an access control decision.

                                                                                               Each of the steps above presents an opportunity for optimization.

                                                                                               As a starting point, PCIs should consider performance when purchasing card stock, as the card is

                                                                                               allows the Card Authentication key to be either a 2048-bit RSA key or an elliptic curve

                                                                                                       Card Authentication keys rather than RSA.
