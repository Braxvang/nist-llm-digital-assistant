                                               CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



This appendix includes the detailed recovery procedures for the system, which may include items such as:
         Keystroke-level recovery steps;
         System installation instructions from tape, CD, or other media;
         Required configuration settings or changes;
         Recovery of data from tape and audit logs; and
         Other system recovery procedures, as appropriate.

If the system relies totally on another group or system for its recovery and reconstitution (such as a
mainframe system), information provided should include contact information and locations of detailed
recovery procedures for that supporting system.

APPENDIX D ALTERNATE PROCESSING PROCEDURES

This section should identify any alternate manual or technical processing procedures available that allow
the business unit to continue some processing of information that would normally be done by the affected
system. Examples of alternate processes include manual forms processing, input into workstations to
store data until it can be uploaded and processed, or queuing of data input.

APPENDIX E SYSTEM VALIDATION TEST PLAN

This appendix includes system acceptance procedures that are performed after the system has been
recovered and prior to putting the system into full operation and returned to users. The system validation
test plan may include data testing and the regression or functionality testing conducted prior to
implementation of a system upgrade or change.

An example of a system validation test plan:

Once the system has been recovered, the following steps will be performed to validate system data and
functionality:
