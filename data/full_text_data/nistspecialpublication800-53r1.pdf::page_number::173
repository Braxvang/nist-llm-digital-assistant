APPENDIX I

INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS
INTERIM GUIDANCE ON THE APPLICATION OF SECURITY CONTROLS

    ndustrial control systems 56 are information systems that differ significantly from traditional

I   administrative, mission support, and scientific data processing information systems.
    Industrial control systems have many unique characteristics—including a need for real-time
response and extremely high availability, predictability, and reliability. These types of
specialized systems are pervasive throughout the critical infrastructure, often being required to
meet several and often conflicting safety, operational, performance, reliability, and security
requirements such as: (i) minimizing risk to the health and safety of human beings; (ii) preventing
serious damage to the environment; (iii) preventing serious production stoppages or slowdowns
that result in negative impact to the nation’s economy and ability to carry out critical functions;
(iv) protecting the critical infrastructure from cyber attacks and common human error; and (v)
safeguarding against the compromise of proprietary information. 57

Until recently, industrial control systems had little resemblance to traditional information systems
in that they were isolated systems running proprietary software and control protocols. However,
as these systems have been increasingly integrated more closely into mainstream organizational
information systems to promote connectivity, efficiency, and remote access capabilities, they
have started to resemble the more traditional information systems. In many cases, industrial
control systems are using the same commercially available hardware and software components as
are used in the organization’s traditional information systems. While the change in industrial
control system architecture supports new information system capabilities, it also provides
significantly less isolation for these systems from the outside world and introduces many of the
same vulnerabilities that exist in current networked information systems. The result is a greater
need to secure industrial control systems.

FIPS 200, in combination with NIST Special Publication 800-53, requires that federal agencies
implement minimum security controls for their organizational information systems based on the
FIPS 199 security categorization of those systems. This includes implementing the minimum
baselines described in Special Publication 800-53 in industrial control systems that are operated
by or on behalf of federal agencies. This appendix discusses the problems that agencies may
encounter in applying the security controls in Special Publication 800-53 to industrial control
systems and provides some observations and recommendations on how to meet the intent of the
requirements until NIST develops additional guidance specific to those types of systems. The
specific guidance for industrial control systems may include modifications of the current security
controls and control enhancements and/or interpretations of selected security controls for the
specialized environments in which the controls are applied.

   An industrial control system is an information system used to control industrial processes such as manufacturing,
product handling, production, and distribution. Industrial control systems include supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) systems used to control geographically dispersed assets, as well as distributed control systems
(DCS) and smaller control systems using programmable logic controllers to control localized processes. Industrial
control systems are typically found in the electric, water, oil and gas, chemical, pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, food
and beverage, and discrete manufacturing (automotive, aerospace, and durable goods) industries as well as in air and
rail transportation control systems.
