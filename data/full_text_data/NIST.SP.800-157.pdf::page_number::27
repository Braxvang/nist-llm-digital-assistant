Special Publication 800-157                                            Guidelines for Derived PIV Credentials


B.2.1     Authentication of an Individual

Knowledge of a password is the means by which an individual can be authenticated to the Derived PIV
Application.

The Derived PIV Application Password shall be between 6 and 8 bytes in length. If the actual length of
Derived PIV Application Password is less than 8 bytes it shall be padded to 8 bytes with 'FF' when
presented to the token command interface. The 'FF' padding bytes shall be appended to the actual value of
the password. The bytes comprising the Derived PIV Application Password shall be limited to values
0x30 – 0x39, 0x41 – 0x5A, and 0x61 – 0x7A, the ASCII values for the decimal digits '0' – '9', upper case
characters 'A' – 'Z', and lower case characters 'a' – 'z'. For example,

    +   Actual Derived PIV Application Password: “Pass12” or '50 61 73 73 31 32'
    +   Padded Derived PIV Application Password presented to the card command interface: '50 61 73
        73 31 32 FF FF'
The Derived PIV Application shall enforce the minimum length requirement of six bytes for the Derived
PIV Application Password (i.e., shall verify that at least the first six bytes of the value presented to the
card command interface are in the range [0x30 – 0x39, 0x41 – 0x5A, 0x61 – 0x7A]) as well as the other
formatting requirements specified in this section.
