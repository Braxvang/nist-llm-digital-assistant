the National Cybersecurity Online Informative References (OLIR) Program to facilitate
subject matter experts in defining online informative references (OLIRs) between
the cybersecurity elements of their documents and the cybersecurity elements of
other documents, like the Cybersecurity Framework. The OLIR Program provides a
standardized format for expressing OLIRs and a centralized location for accessing and
comparing them. NISTIR 8278, National Cybersecurity OLIR Program: Guidelines for OLIR
Users and Developers, describes the OLIR Program, explains what OLIRs are, how they
can be beneficial, and how subject matter experts can contribute OLIRs [8].
The Informative Reference catalog implements a federated model, where submitting
parties develop and host their respective Informative References. NIST released NISTIR
8204, Cybersecurity Framework OLIR Submissions: Specification for Completing
the OLIR Template, which provides guidance to Informative Reference developers
for completing and submitting OLIRs [9]. NIST analyzes the submitted OLIRs for
correctness, works with submitters regarding any corrections, and hosts links to the
public draft and final versions of the OLIRs.
The OLIR Program integrates ongoing NIST projects that respond to administrative and
legislative requirements. The OLIR Program can incorporate any authoritative documents,
from national and international standards, guidelines, frameworks, and regulations to
policies for individual organizations, sectors, or jurisdictions. By following this approach,
cybersecurity document owners can use the OLIR Program as a mechanism for
communicating with owners and users of other cybersecurity documents.

Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)
Other risk management-focused NIST cybersecurity accomplishments in FY 2019
included continued outreach and updates regarding recommendations for protecting
the confidentiality of controlled, unclassified information (CUI) in nonfederal systems
and organizations. A significant amount of federal CUI is entrusted to external entities.
Safeguarding that CUI is of paramount importance and can directly affect the ability of
federal agencies to successfully protect their information.
In FY 2019, NIST partnered with the National Archives and Records Administration
(NARA)—designated as the CUI Executive Agent by Executive Order 13556, Controlled
Unclassified Information—on several publications:
  •   Draft SP 800-171, Revision 2, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
      in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations, provides updates to Chapter One
      (Introduction), Chapter Two (The Fundamentals), Glossary, Acronyms, and
      References appendices [10].
  •   Draft SP 800-171A, Assessing Security Requirements for Controlled Unclassified
      Information, which provides federal and nonfederal organizations with assessment
      procedures and a methodology that can be employed to conduct assessments of
      the CUI security requirements in SP 800-171, Revision 1 [11].                             9
