      NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                    Cloud Computing Forensic
      February 2023                                                                    Reference Architecture

259   adapted. The number of scenarios that may require the application of digital forensic techniques
260   have increased along with the complexity of the underlying architectures .
261   One common scenario involves the detailed investigation of criminal activities. As computers
262   become widely available and develop greater capabilities, criminal elements worldwide have
263   adopted them as tools to manage their endeavors. These include both “traditional” forms of
264   crime (e.g., violent crime, property crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking, white-collar
265   crime) and crimes that occur in cyberspace (e.g., ransomware attacks, data breaches, identity
266   theft, cyber-terrorism, distributed denial of service, illicit cryptocurrency mining, child
267   pornography, and attacks against governments, key corporations, or power grids). Forensic
268   procedures involve locating and analyzing digital traces that can help solve the crime and/or
269   allow for incident response.
270   Forensic procedures are also used to investigate civil actions, such as divorce proceedings, asset
271   discovery, insurance claims, lawsuits, and similar cases that often require forensic methods to
272   determine the presence, absence, and movement of data and funds.
273   An example of how forensic techniques are used involves the collection of a laptop computer
274   while apprehending a presumed perpetrator of an illegal act. The suspected act could involve –
275   for instance –financial exploitation of stolen identities, hacking into a hospital’s records
276   management system to implant ransomware, electronic entry of a corporate system in attempted
277   commercial espionage, or penetrating a government or military computer. Similarly, civil actions
278   can require forensic examination, such as discovering financial assets for a divorce proceeding.
279   In each of these cases, forensics plays an essential role in determining facts; assisting in the
280   analysis, validation, and authentication of data; and enabling documentation of findings to
281   present to a court and attorneys.
282   The application of forensic methods may also be required for normal business operations. For
283   example, forensic methods may be employed to recover data that, at first, appears to be lost or
284   destroyed on computer drives. During incident response, additional goals of using forensic
285   methods may include mitigating future cyberattacks, preventing system failure, or minimizing
286   data loss.
287   In the commercial context, the use of forensics in incident response can help determine the root
288   cause of an outage event, such as a component failure, corrupted software, or intentional
289   sabotage. Other scenarios may involve close examination of system configurations, potentially
290   questionable employee data storage and activities, and operational aspects related to compliance
291   matters. In any of these cases, forensic methods may supply insights that are not available
292   through any other means.
293   For decades, information processing systems have enabled the storage, processing, and
294   transmission of information for public and private organizations and individuals. The
295   maintenance, operations, and protection of these information systems have become paramount
296   concerns since a disruption of sufficient magnitude or specific type could threaten business
297   activities. In addition, the use of these systems in support of criminal activities has been of major
298   concern.
299   Industry and government have an array of authoritative sources that guide the design,
300   engineering, and operations of information systems. Each of the frameworks listed below can
