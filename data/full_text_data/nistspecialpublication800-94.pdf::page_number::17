                                                      GUIDE TO INTRUSION DETECTION AND PREVENTION SYSTEMS (IDPS)



      –    Terminate the network connection or user session that is being used for the attack

      –    Block access to the target (or possibly other likely targets) from the offending user account, IP
           address, or other attacker attribute

      –    Block all access to the targeted host, service, application, or other resource.
 The IPS changes the security environment. The IPS could change the configuration of other
  security controls to disrupt an attack. Common examples are reconfiguring a network device (e.g.,
  firewall, router, switch) to block access from the attacker or to the target, and altering a host-based
  firewall on a target to block incoming attacks. Some IPSs can even cause patches to be applied to a
  host if the IPS detects that the host has vulnerabilities.
 The IPS changes the attack’s content. Some IPS technologies can remove or replace malicious
  portions of an attack to make it benign. A simple example is an IPS removing an infected file
  attachment from an e-mail and then permitting the cleaned email to reach its recipient. A more
  complex example is an IPS that acts as a proxy and normalizes incoming requests, which means that
  the proxy repackages the payloads of the requests, discarding header information. This might cause
  certain attacks to be discarded as part of the normalization process.
Another common attribute of IDPS technologies is that they cannot provide completely accurate
detection. When an IDPS incorrectly identifies benign activity as being malicious, a false positive has
occurred. When an IDPS fails to identify malicious activity, a false negative has occurred. It is not
possible to eliminate all false positives and negatives; in most cases, reducing the occurrences of one
increases the occurrences of the other. Many organizations choose to decrease false negatives at the cost
of increasing false positives, which means that more malicious events are detected but more analysis
resources are needed to differentiate false positives from true malicious events. Altering the
configuration of an IDPS to improve its detection accuracy is known as tuning.

Most IDPS technologies also offer features that compensate for the use of common evasion techniques.
Evasion is modifying the format or timing of malicious activity so that its appearance changes but its
effect is the same. Attackers use evasion techniques to try to prevent IDPS technologies from detecting
their attacks. For example, an attacker could encode text characters in a particular way, knowing that the
target understands the encoding and hoping that any monitoring IDPSs do not. Most IDPS technologies
can overcome common evasion techniques by duplicating special processing performed by the targets. If
the IDPS can “see” the activity in the same way that the target would, then evasion techniques will
generally be unsuccessful at hiding attacks.

2.3       Common Detection Methodologies

IDPS technologies use many methodologies to detect incidents. Sections 2.3.1 through 2.3.3 discuss the
primary classes of detection methodologies: signature-based, anomaly-based, and stateful protocol
analysis, respectively. Most IDPS technologies use multiple detection methodologies, either separately or
integrated, to provide more broad and accurate detection.
