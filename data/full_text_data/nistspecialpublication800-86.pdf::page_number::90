GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



In some cases, analysts bring together pertinent application data from several varied application data
sources; this is largely a manual process. Detailed analysis of application-related events and event
reconstruction usually require a skilled and knowledgeable analyst who understands the information
presented by all the sources. The analyst can review the results of the examination and analysis of
individual application data sources and see how the information fits together. Tools that may be helpful
to analysts include security event management software (described in Section 6.2.5), which can correlate
some application-related events among multiple data sources, and log analysis software (including some
types of host-based intrusion detection software), which can be run against certain types of logs to
identify suspicious activity. Section 8 shows how data from multiple types of sources can be correlated
through analysis to reach a more accurate and comprehensive view of what occurred.

7.5     Recommendations

The key recommendations presented in this section for using data from applications are as follows:

      ! Analysts should consider all possible application data sources. Application events might be
        recorded by many different data sources. In addition, applications might be used through
        multiple mechanisms, such as multiple client programs installed on a system and Web-based
        client interfaces. In such situations, analysts should identify all application components, decide
        which are most likely to be of interest, find the location of each component of interest, and collect
        the data.
      ! Analysts should bring together application data from various sources. The analyst should
        review the results of the examination and analysis of individual application data sources and
        determine how the information fits together, to perform a detailed analysis of application-related
        events and event reconstruction.
