Special Publication 800-79-2                                             Guidelines for the Authorization of PIV Card Issuers
                                                                                          and Derived PIV Credential Issuers



Table G.2: Controls and Assessment Procedures for Derived PIV Credential Issuers
(DPCIs)

This table specifies the controls and assessment procedures for the Derived PIV Credential and
its related token. The controls in this section are mapped to the PCI controls in G.1 to assist
issuers that intend to issue both types of credentials. Unlike for a PIV Card Issuer, not all issuer
controls are applicable to a Derived PIV Credential Issuer. Certain issuer controls are applicable
to only LOA-3 or to only LOA-4 Derived PIV Credentials and therefore must be implemented
by the issuer only if they are issuing that level of a Derived PIV Credential. This is represented
via the “applicability” column within this table. Controls with an applicability column marked
with DPCI (e.g., without LOA-4 or 3 postfix) apply to both LOA-3 and LOA-4 Derived PIV
Credential.
