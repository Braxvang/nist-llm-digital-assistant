NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                  HASH_DRBG                  Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                    Generation Using Deterministic RBGs


   The following process or its equivalent shall be used as the instantiate algorithm for this
   DRBG mechanism (see step 9 of the instantiate process in Section 9.1).
   Hash_DRBG_Instantiate_algorithm (entropy_input, nonce, personalization_string,
              security_strength):
       1. entropy_input: The string of bits obtained from the randomness source.
       2. nonce: A string of bits as specified in Section 8.6.7.
       3. personalization_string: The personalization string received from the consuming
          application. Note that the length of the personalization_string may be zero.
       4. security_strength: The security strength for the instantiation. This parameter is
          optional for Hash_DRBG, since it is not used.
   Output:
       1. initial_working_state: The initial values for V, C, and reseed_counter (see Section
          10.1.1.1).
   Hash_DRBG Instantiate Process:
       1. seed_material = entropy_input || nonce || personalization_string.
       2. seed = Hash_df (seed_material, seedlen).

       3. V = seed.
       4. C = Hash_df ((0x00 || V), seedlen).        Comment: Precede V with a byte of zeros.
       5. reseed_counter = 1.
       6. Return (V, C, reseed_counter).

10.1.1.3     Reseeding a Hash_DRBG Instantiation

Notes for the reseed function specified in Section 9.2:
   The reseeding of a Hash_DRBG instantiation requires a call to the Reseed_function
   specified in Section 9.2. Process step 6 of that function calls the reseed algorithm specified in
   this section. The values for min_length are provided in Table 2 of Section 10.1.
The reseed algorithm:
   Let Hash_df be the hash derivation function specified in Section 10.3.1 using the selected
   hash function. The value for seedlen is provided in Table 2 of Section 10.1.
   The following process or its equivalent shall be used as the reseed algorithm for this DRBG
   mechanism (see step 6 of the reseed process in Section 9.2):
   Hash_DRBG_Reseed_algorithm (working_state, entropy_input, additional_input):
       1. working_state: The current values for V, C, and reseed_counter (see Section
          10.1.1.1).
       2. entropy_input: The string of bits obtained from the randomness source.
