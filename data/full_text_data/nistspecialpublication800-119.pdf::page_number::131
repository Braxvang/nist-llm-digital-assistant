                                                              GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURE DEPLOYMENT OF IPV6


long as systems require interoperability between IPv4 and IPv6, transition mechanisms are needed. In the
transition environment, three different types of hosts exist: IPv4 only, IPv6 only, and dual stack
IPv4/IPv6. While dual stack is the recommended approach, there may be circumstances that require an
organization to operate and communicate with single-stack systems.

Transition mechanisms support interoperability between IPv4 and IPv6 hosts. Multiple transition
mechanisms may be deployed with any IPv6 transition. Client capabilities, the particular transition
strategy chosen, time frame, and the transition stage all impact which transition mechanisms make the
most sense. Transition mechanisms fall into three categories:

        Dual stack
        Tunneling
        Translation.
A typical transition will transform an organization’s network from an all IPv4 environment to one where
there are isolated IPv6 hosts or small islands of IPv6 hosts. The term island often appears in RFCs and
refers to a small collection of like protocol hosts (either IPv4 or IPv6).

This example demonstrates how an organization could use the different transition mechanisms during this
process:

        Early in a transition, IPv4 tunnels will connect IPv6 islands. Translation and dual stack
         mechanisms will allow IPv6 hosts to use IPv4 resources. Wherever possible, the use of
         translation mechanisms should be avoided, because of the complexities and incompatibilities
         associated with the translation of multiple protocols.
        As the transition progresses from IPv4 dominant to IPv6 dominant, the organization will
         configure the network core to either IPv6 or a dual stack. This will allow the organization to
         dispense with some of the tunnel mechanisms installed in the earlier stage of IPv6 transition.
         Translation mechanisms will be required to allow IPv4 hosts to use new IPv6 services.
        In the last phase of the migration, most equipment and services will support IPv6. Only
         isolated islands of IPv4 legacy services will remain. IPv4 traffic will tunnel over IPv6 and
         translation services will allow IPv6 clients to access legacy services.
6.4   Dual Stack IPv4/IPv6 Environments

In the dual stack method of IPv4 to IPv6 transition, each host is both IPv4 and IPv6 aware. Dual stack
hosts run both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols and allocate addresses for both protocols. RFC 4213, Basic IPv6
Transition Mechanisms, further explains the dual stack method. In most cases, IPv4/IPv6 dual stack
deployments rely on tunneling and translation mechanisms for interoperability for parts of the network
that are not dual stack.

The purpose of a dual stack method is to minimize the number of tunnels used in a transition.
Organizations use dual stack when the majority of an organization’s equipment is dual stack capable and
they want a rapid deployment. In the following sections, we cover deployment, addressing, and security
issues for a dual stack environment.

  6.4.1   Deployment of a Dual Stack Environment

When considering a deployment of a dual stack environment, one must consider the following issues:
