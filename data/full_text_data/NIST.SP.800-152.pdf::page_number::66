SP 800-152                                                 A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


authorized entity (e.g., its owner or a key-recovery agent) following the rules for recovery
stated in the FCKMS Security Policy and in accordance with Section 6.1.2 and Section 6.2.1.

FR:6.53 The CKMS design shall specify the CKMS recovery policy for keys and/or
metadata.

FR:6.54 The CKMS design shall specify the mechanisms used to implement and enforce the
recovery policy for keys and/or metadata.

FR:6.55 The CKMS design shall specify how, and the circumstances under which, keys
and/or metadata are recovered from each key database or metadata storage facility.

FR:6.56 The CKMS design shall specify how keys and/or metadata are protected during
recovery.

                          A Federal CKMS shall support recovering keys and/or
PR:6.49
                          metadata that have been backed up or archived, following the
                          FCKMS rules for recovery.

6.4.18 Establish a Key
Key establishment is the process by which a key is securely shared between two or more
entities. The key may be transported from one entity to another (key transport), or the key
may be derived from a shared secret generated by the entities (key agreement). The method
of transporting or sharing keys may be either manual (e.g., sent by a courier) or automated
(e.g., sent over the Internet).

FR:6.57 The CKMS design shall specify how, and the circumstances under which, keys and
their metadata are established.

6.4.19 Enter a Key and Associated Metadata into a Cryptographic Module
The key-entry function of a cryptographic module is used to enter one or more keys and
associated metadata into the module in preparation for use by the module. Section 2.10 above
requires the use of FIPS-140-validated cryptographic modules and relates the impact-levels
of data requiring protection to the [FIPS 140] security levels.

FR:6.58 The CKMS design shall specify how, and the circumstances under which, keys and
metadata are entered into a cryptographic module, the form in which they are entered, and
the method used for entry.

FR:6.59 The CKMS design shall specify how the integrity and confidentiality (if necessary)
of the entered keys and metadata are protected and verified upon entry.

                          A Federal CKMS shall enter keys into cryptographic modules
PR:6.50
                          in accordance with the requirements in [FIPS 140] and the
                          impact-levels associated with the keys.
