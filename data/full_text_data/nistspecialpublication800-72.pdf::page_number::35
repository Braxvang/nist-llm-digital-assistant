                                                       Guidelines on PDA Forensics


Collecting Evidence

   Handle computer evidence, whether physical or digital, in a manner that preserves
   its evidentiary value.

   Recover non-electronic evidence (e.g., written passwords, handwritten notes,
   blank pads of paper with indented writing, hardware and software manuals,
   calendars, literature, text or graphical computer printouts, and photographs).

Packaging, Transporting, and Storing Evidence

   Take no actions to add, modify, or destroy data stored on a computer or other
   media.

   Avoid high temperatures and humidity, physical shock, static electricity, and
   magnetic sources.

   Maintain chain of custody of electronic evidence, documenting its packaging,
   transportation and storage.

       Packaging Procedure

           Properly document, label, and inventory evidence before packaging.

           Pack magnetic media in antistatic packaging (paper or antistatic plastic
           bags).

           Avoid folding, bending, or scratching computer media such as diskettes,
           CD-ROMs, removable media, etc.

           Properly label evidence containers.

       Transportation Procedure

           Avoid magnetic sources (e.g., radio transmitters, speaker magnets).

           Avoid conditions of excessive heat, cold, or humidity while in transit.

           Avoid shock and excessive vibrations.

       Storage Procedures

           Ensure evidence is inventoried in accordance with authoritative policies.

           Store evidence material in a secure area away from temperature and
           humidity extremes.

           Protect evidence material from magnetic sources, moisture, dust, and
           other harmful particles or contaminants.
