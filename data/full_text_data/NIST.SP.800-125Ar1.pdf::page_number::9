NIST SP 800-125A REV. 1                                                    SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
                                                                       SERVER-BASED HYPERVISOR PLATFORMS

(VMM). When VMMs are combined with the modules that provide OS-level services, such as the scheduling
of VMs in the CPU, they are called the hypervisor. These hypervisor baseline features or functions are:
• HY-BF1: VM Process Isolation – Provides scheduling of VMs for execution, Management of the
    application processes running in VMs such as CPU and Memory Management, and context switching
    between various processor states during the running of applications in VMs. In order to ensure VM
    process isolation, memory access from Direct Memory Access (DMA) capable devices needs to be under
    hypervisor control as well (e.g., via Input Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU)). However, this
    function is considered under HY-BF2 since it pertains to devices mediation.
• HY-BF2: Devices Mediation and Access Control – Makes devices available to VMs (e.g., via
    emulation, para-virtualization, passthrough or self-virtualizing hardware devices) and controlling
    which VMs are allowed to access which devices (e.g., Network Interface Card (NIC), storage device
    such as IDE drive, etc.).
• HY-BF3: Direct Execution of commands from Guest VMs – Certain commands from Guest OSs are
    executed directly by the hypervisor instead of being triggered through interrupts and context
    switching. This function applies to hypervisors that have implemented para-virtualization instead of full
    virtualization
• HY-BF4: VM Lifecycle Management – All functions including creation and management of VM images,
    control of VM states (Start, Pause, Stop), VM migration, making snapshots, VM monitoring, and policy
    enforcement
• HY-BF5: Management of hypervisor platform – Defining artifacts and setting values for various
    configuration parameters in hypervisor software modules including those for configuration of a Virtual
    Network inside the hypervisor and updates and patching to those modules.

The brief description of the five baseline functions is sufficient to guide discussion in the rest of the
document. Detailed descriptions of the functions are provided in Appendix A.

The above functions are carried out by different hypervisor components or software modules. There are some
minor differences among hypervisor products in the way functions are distributed. The mapping of these
functions to hypervisor components and the location of these components in overall hypervisor architecture
are given in Table 1 below:
