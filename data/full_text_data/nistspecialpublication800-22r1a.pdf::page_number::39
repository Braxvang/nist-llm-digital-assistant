A STATISTICAL TEST SUITE FOR RANDOM AND PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPLICATIONS




(processing)       χ2(obs) = 5.999377

(output)           P-value = 0.647302

(conclusion)       Since the P-value ≥ 0.01, accept the sequence as random.


2.8     Overlapping Template Matching Test

2.8.1 Test Purpose
The focus of the Overlapping Template Matching test is the number of occurrences of pre-specified target
strings. Both this test and the Non-overlapping Template Matching test of Section 2.7 use an m-bit
window to search for a specific m-bit pattern. As with the test in Section 2.7, if the pattern is not found,
the window slides one bit position. The difference between this test and the test in Section 2.7 is that
when the pattern is found, the window slides only one bit before resuming the search.

2.8.2 Function Call
OverlappingTemplateMatching(m,n)

           m       The length in bits of the template – in this case, the length of the run of ones.

           n       The length of the bit string.

Additional input used by the function, but supplied by the testing code:

           ε       The sequence of bits as generated by the RNG or PRNG being tested; this exists as a
                   global structure at the time of the function call; ε = ε1, ε2, … , εn.

           B       The m-bit template to be matched.

           K       The number of degrees of freedom. K has been fixed at 5 in the test code.

           M       The length in bits of a substring of ε to be tested. M has been set to 1032 in the test code.

           N       The number of independent blocks of n. N has been set to 968 in the test code.

2.8.3 Test Statistic and Reference Distribution
χ2(obs):     A measure of how well the observed number of template “hits” matches the expected
             number of template “hits” (under an assumption of randomness).

The reference distribution for the test statistic is the χ2 distribution.

2.8.4      Test Description
(1)        Partition the sequence into N independent blocks of length M.

           For example, if ε = 10111011110010110100011100101110111110000101101001, then n = 50.
           If K = 2, M = 10 and N = 5, then the five blocks are 1011101111, 0010110100, 0111001011,
           1011111000, and 0101101001 .
