                                      GUIDE TO MALWARE INCIDENT PREVENTION AND HANDLING FOR DESKTOPS AND LAPTOPS


4.3.1    Containment Through User Participation

At one time, user participation was a valuable part of containment efforts, particularly during large-scale
incidents in non-managed environments. Users were provided with instructions on how to identify
infections and what measures to take if a host was infected, such as calling the help desk, disconnecting
the host from the network, or powering off the host. The instructions might also cover malware
eradication, such as updating antivirus signatures and performing a host scan, or obtaining and running a
specialized malware eradication utility. As hosts have increasingly become managed, user participation in
containment has sharply decreased. However, having users perform containment actions is still helpful in
non-managed environments and other situations in which use of fully automated containment methods
(such as those described in Sections 4.3.2 through 4.3.4) is not feasible.

Effectively communicating helpful information to users in a timely manner is challenging. Although
email is typically the most efficient communication mechanism, it might be unavailable during certain
incidents, or users might not read the email until it is too late. Therefore, organizations should have
several alternate mechanisms in place for distributing information to users, such as sending messages to
all voice mailboxes within the organization, posting signs in work areas, and handing out instructions at
building and office entrances. Organizations with significant numbers of users in alternate locations, such
as home offices and small branch offices, should ensure that the communication mechanisms reach these
users. Another important consideration is that users might need to be provided with software, such as
cleanup utilities, and software updates, such as patches and updated antivirus signatures. Organizations
should identify and implement multiple methods for delivering software utilities and updates to users who
are expected to assist with containment.

Although user participation can be very helpful for containment, organizations should not rely on this
means for containing malware incidents unless absolutely necessary. No matter how containment
guidance is communicated, it is unlikely that all users will receive it and realize that it might pertain to
them. In addition, some users who receive containment instructions are unlikely to follow the directions
successfully because of a lack of understanding, a mistake in following the directions, or host-specific
characteristics or variations in the malware that make the directions incorrect for that host. Some users
also might be focused on performing their regular tasks and be unconcerned about the possible effects of
malware on their hosts. Nevertheless, for large-scale incidents involving a sizable percentage of the
organization’s hosts in non-managed environments, user involvement in containment can significantly
reduce the burden on incident handlers and technical support staff in responding to the incident.

4.3.2    Containment Through Automated Detection

Many malware incidents can be contained primarily through the use of the automated technologies
described in Section 3.4 for preventing and detecting infections. These technologies include antivirus
software, content filtering, and intrusion prevention software. Because antivirus software on hosts can
detect and remove infections, it is often the preferred automated detection method for assisting in
containment. However, as previously discussed, many of today’s malware threats are novel, so antivirus
software and other technologies often fail to recognize them as being malicious. Also, malware that
compromises the OS may disable security controls such as antivirus software, particularly in unmanaged
environments where users have greater control over their hosts. Containment through antivirus software is
not as robust and effective as it used to be.

Organizations should be prepared to use other security tools to contain the malware until the antivirus
signatures can perform the containment effectively, if antivirus signatures become available at all. 18 After
