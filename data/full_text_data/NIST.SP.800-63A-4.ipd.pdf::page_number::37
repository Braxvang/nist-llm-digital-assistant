      NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                                 Enrollment and Identity Proofing


959   5.1.9. Trusted Referees and Applicant References
960   To increase accessibility and promote equal access to online government services, CSPs
961   provide trusted referees. Trusted referees are used to facilitate the identity proofing
962   and enrollment of individuals who are otherwise unable to meet the requirements for
963   identity proofing to a specific IAL. Examples of such individuals and demographic
964   groups include: individuals who do not possess and cannot obtain the required identity
965   evidence; persons with disabilities; older individuals; persons experiencing homelessness;
966   individuals with little or no access to online services or computing devices; persons
967   without a bank account or with limited credit history; victims of identity theft; individuals
968   displaced or affected by natural disasters; and children under 18.
969   Trusted referees are agents of the CSP or its partners who are trained and authorized to
970   make risk-based decisions to facilitate the identity proofing and enrollment of individuals
971   who are unable to complete the identity proofing process on their own or meet the
972   specified requirements for a given IAL.
973   Additionally, there may be circumstances that encumber or preclude the active
974   participation of an applicant in the identity proofing process. Such circumstances may
975   be due to physical or mental limitations, disabilities, hospitalization, or other temporary or
976   permanent conditions that make active participation in the identity proofing difficult. An
977   applicant reference may vouch for an applicant’s particular circumstances and may also
978   actively assist the applicant in the identity proofing process.
979   Applicant references are individuals who participate in the identity proofing of an
980   applicant in order to assist the applicant in meeting the identity proofing requirements.
981   Such assistance may include vouching for the applicant’s circumstances and actively
982   assisting the applicant in completing the identity proofing process. Applicant references
983   are not agents of the CSP but they would typically work in conjunction with a trusted
984   referee to facilitate the identity proofing and enrollment of an applicant. Since
985   information provided by the applicant reference may be used and relied upon in the
986   identity proofing of the applicant, the applicant reference is identity proofed to the same
987   or higher IAL as the applicant. The role of applicant reference is limited to facilitating
988   the identity proofing process and applicant references are not authorized to represent
989   subscribers in transactions with RPs. Persons who simply provide physical, technical,
990   language translation or other similar assistance to an applicant who is otherwise able to
991   meet the requirements for identity proofing to the specified IAL are not considered to be
992   applicant references and do not require identity proofing.

993   5.1.9.1. Requirements for Trusted Referees
994   CSPs SHALL provide the option for the use of trusted referees for remote identity
995   proofing at IALs 1 and 2.
996   Where trusted referees are offered, the following requirements apply to their use:


                                                   24
