                                            IMPERATIVE 9 – Advancing Security Test and Measurement Tools



     •    Automated Combinatorial Testing. Engineers often encounter security failures that
          result from unexpected interactions between components. If all faults in a system
          can be triggered by a combination of a known number of parameters, then testing
          all possible combinations of those parameters with a practical number of tests
          can provide strong fault detection efficiency. These methods96 are being applied
          to software and hardware testing for reliability, safety, and security. NIST’s focus
          is on empirical test results and their impact on real-world problems. Advances
          for 2018 included the development of parallel processor code for measuring the
          combinatorial coverage of very large (>1,000 variables) test arrays. This tool is being
          applied by industry in evaluating the quality of their test suites for commercial
          products. In FY19, these methods will be applied to verification and testing for the
          Internet of Things in industrial control and home automation applications.
     •    Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring. IT environments are under
          constant threat of attack and are frequently undergoing change with new and
          updated software being deployed along with updated configurations. The wide
          variety of computing products, dynamic nature of software, speed of configuration
          change, and diversity of threats challenges organizations to maintain situational
          awareness over their IT assets and utilize this information to make informed risk-
          based decisions. Security automation employs standardized data formats and
          transport protocols to enable data to be exchanged between business, operational,
          and security systems that support security processes. This is done by identifying
          IT assets, providing awareness over the operational state of computing devices,
          enabling security reference data to be collected from internal and external sources,
          and supporting analysis processes that measure the effectiveness of security
          controls and provide visibility into security risks, thereby enabling risk-based
          decision making. In FY18, NIST continued to create reference data, offer guidance,
          and participate in international engagement for the development of flexible,
          open standards. These efforts will be continued in FY19 as NIST seeks to improve
          the interoperability, broad acceptance, and adoption of security automation
          solutions to address current and future security challenges. In turn, this will create
          opportunities for innovation.
