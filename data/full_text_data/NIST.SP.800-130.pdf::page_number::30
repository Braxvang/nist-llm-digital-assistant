SP 800-130                                                              August 2013



4.5 Interrelationships among Policies
A CKMS designer should be aware of the various policies of organizations that may
procure and use CKMS products or services. The designer could design a simple CKMS
that enforces a simple key-management policy for a single organization or a complex
CKMS product that can support a variety of security policies.

FR:4.5 The CKMS design shall specify the policies that are supported by the CKMS
design and a summary of how they are supported by the design.

4.6 Personal Accountability
A policy of personal accountability requires that every person who accesses sensitive
information be held accountable for his or her actions. Personal accountability may be a
requirement in an Information Management Policy that results in specific features in the
CKMS. A CKMS designer should determine if the CKMS is intended to support
personal accountability. If it is, then mechanisms should be provided within the CKMS
to support accountability for the management of keys and metadata.

FR:4.6 The CKMS design shall specify if and how personal accountability is supported
by the CKMS.

4.7 Anonymity, Unlinkability, and Unobservability
An Information Management Policy may state that users of the secure information-
processing system can be assured of anonymity, unlinkability, and unobservability.
Anonymity assures that public data cannot be related to the owner. Unlinkability assures
that two or more related events in an information-processing system cannot be related to
each other. Finally, unobservability assures that an observer is unable to identify or infer
the identities of the parties involved in a transaction.

FR:4.7 The CKMS design shall specify the anonymity, unlinkability, and
unobservability policies that can be supported by the CKMS.

4.7.1 Anonymity
In order to provide privacy to entities, to adhere to applicable privacy laws, or to enhance
security, a CKMS may require anonymity of CKMS transactions in terms of the entities
that participate in the transaction. For privacy reasons, a CKMS may also require
anonymity when associating keys and/or metadata with entities.

FR:4.8 The CKMS design shall specify which CKMS transactions have or can be
provided with anonymity protection.

FR: 4.9 The CKMS design shall specify how CKMS transaction anonymity is achieved
when anonymity assurance is provided.
