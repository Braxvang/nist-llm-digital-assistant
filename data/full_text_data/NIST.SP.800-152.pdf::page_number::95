SP 800-152                                                   A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


8.2.2 Individual FCKMS Device Security
An FCKMS may include a variety of devices. An FCKMS should be designed to protect
itself from FCKMS device users and other FCKMS devices, to provide separate sessions for
users and user processes, to provide fine-grained access controls on FCKMS device-level
objects, to provide device-level security-event logging, and to provide entity account
management.

A verification that an FCKMS device is operating correctly and securely should be
established at device startup and verified periodically. The security controls incorporated
into an FCKMS device could be configurable to support differences in FCKMS service-using
organizations, security policies, and environments. Specific security-relevant events (such as
a physical security alarm, electric power failure, unrecoverable communication errors, and
human-initiated alarms) could result in different responses, depending on these differences.

FR:8.6 The CKMS design shall specify the security controls required for each CKMS
device.

FR:8.7 The CKMS design shall specify the device/CKMS secure configuration requirements
and guidelines that the hardening is based upon.

                 SI-6       The correct operation of each Federal CKMS device shall be
PR:8.8
                            verified during device start-up.


                            A Federal CKMS device could be manually or automatically
PF:8.2
                            configurable to support, comply with, and enforce new
                            FCKMS Security Policies.

8.2.3 Malware Protection
When an FCKMS receives operating-system software, software updates and software support
over electronic communication networks or via manual software distribution services, the
scanning of these data items for malware may be required before installation. Scanning must
be performed when the data items are untrusted, (i.e., they are received from an
unauthenticated or untrustworthy source, or the data does not have sufficient cryptographic
protection against undetected alteration, as determined by the impact-level of the data in the
system).

Malware protection falls into the following three general categories:

   a) Anti-virus software that protects an FCKMS from unwittingly installing and
      executing programs that perform unintended actions and may cause a security
      compromise,
   b) Anti-spyware software that protects an FCKMS from unauthorized parties obtaining
      system administrator status or authorized user status, and prevents the spyware from
      taking on authorized device behavior, and
   c) Rootkit detection and prevention software that protects FCKMS devices from rootkit
      malware that changes the configuration setting of the operating system in order to
