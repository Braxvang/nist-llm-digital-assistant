     Securing Cellular and Mobile Technologies
     Some of the most exciting advances in technology are those involving mobile
     networking and communications. Cellular technologies are increasing in bandwidth
     capabilities as they evolve from 3rd generation (3G) to 4th generation (4G), Long Term
     Evolution (LTE) and, 5th generation (5G) technologies. The mobile technologies that
     leverage this infrastructure are becoming more powerful and offering more services
     to consumers. NIST is working to ensure that these technologies have the necessary
     security and privacy capabilities to be reliable and trustworthy.
     In FY 2019, NIST continued its participation in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project
     (3GPP) that unites telecommunications standard development organizations in
     maintaining and advancing cellular telecommunications technologies (including radio
     access and core network and service capabilities) to enable and improve mobile
     telecommunications. 3GPP specifications and studies are contribution-driven by member
     companies in Working Groups and at the Technical Specification Group level. NIST
     participation in 3GPP activities helps to ensure compatibility for legacy technology
     and helps in the development of standards for the next generation (e.g., 5G) cellular
28   technologies.
