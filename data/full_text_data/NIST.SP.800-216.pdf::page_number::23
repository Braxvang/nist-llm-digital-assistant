NIST SP 800-216                                                                                                          Federal Vulnerability
May 2023                                                                                                                 Disclosure Guidelines

        2. Alerts – provides timely information about current security issues, vulnerabilities, and
           exploits
        3. Bulletins – provides a weekly summary of the newest vulnerabilities
        4. Analysis Reports – provides in-depth analysis on new or evolving cyber threats
        5. Industrial Control System (ICS) – provides timely information about current security
           issues, vulnerabilities, and exploits

2.7.3.2.                 National Vulnerability Database
NIST maintains the National Vulnerability Database [NVD], which is the U.S. Government
repository of standards-based vulnerability management data. It contains a database of almost all
publicly disclosed vulnerabilities – more specifically, all vulnerabilities included within the
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) dictionary [CVE]. NVD staff members analyze
vulnerability descriptions to provide succinct and machine-readable information, such as
vulnerable software versions, informational references, vulnerability attributes, underlying
software flaw types, and technical severity scores.

             Stakeholders in Federal Vulnerability Disclosure Coordination
Every government agency is a stakeholder in federal vulnerability disclosure coordination, and
each should have at least one VDPO or be supported by a VDPO through an agreement with
their parent agency. Orchestrating coordination among VDPOs is a primary role of the FCB.
FCB membership may change and expand over time.

             Technical Approaches and Resources
The FCB should leverage an existing technical infrastructure for vulnerability disclosure to the
extent possible during the vulnerability management coordination process. This section
recommends the use of certain technologies to enhance vulnerability coordination activities. As
the reporting of vulnerabilities matures, the FCB may recommend alternative technologies that
supersede the guidance in this section.
The CVE naming scheme should be used when referencing publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.
The CVE website is focused on providing unique identification for each vulnerability to maintain
the CVE list. It is not intended to act as an advisory service. When referencing a CVE
vulnerability, the NVD link should be used since it provides an analysis of each CVE and any
referenced information. FCB members should also be prepared to submit CVEs by becoming
CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs) or Authorized Data Providers (ADPs).
The technical severity of all vulnerabilities could be rated using the Common Vulnerability
Scoring System’s (CVSS) base score equations. 8 Its scores reflect an estimated technical
severity 9 for the vulnerability in relation to the worldwide information technology infrastructure.

    A calculator for such scores is available at https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1.
9
    While useful, the severity may be higher or lower for any instance of a vulnerability in a particular environment.
