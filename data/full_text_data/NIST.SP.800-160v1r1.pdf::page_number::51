•    Producing evidence for the security aspects of the solution

The security aspects of the solution include the development of a system protection strategy;
allocated, decomposed, and derived security requirements; security architecture views and
viewpoints; security design; security aspects, capabilities, and limitations in the system life cycle
procedures; and security performance verification measures. The security aspects of the solution
are realized during the implementation of the system design in accordance with the system
architecture and in satisfaction of the security requirements. The evidence associated with the
security aspects of the solution is obtained with a fidelity and rigor influenced by the level of
assurance 55 targeted by the security objectives. Assurance evidence is obtained from standard
systems engineering verification methods (e.g., analysis, demonstration, inspection, testing, and
evaluation) and complementary validation methods applied against the stakeholder requirements.
Application of the solution context may be interpreted to provide a part of the solution,
constraining the next iteration of the problem context.

           The Trustworthiness Context
The trustworthiness context is a decision-making context that provides an evidence-based
demonstration – through reasoning – that the system of interest is deemed trustworthy (or not)
based on a set of claims derived from security objectives. This context consists of:
•    Developing and maintaining the assurance case
•    Demonstrating that the assurance case is satisfied

The trustworthiness context is grounded in the concept of an assurance case. An assurance case
is a well-defined and structured set of arguments and a body of evidence showing that a system
satisfies specific claims. 56 Assurance cases provide reasoned, auditable artifacts that support the
contention that a top-level claim or set of claims is satisfied, including systematic argumentation
and underlying evidence and explicit assumptions that support the claims [30]. The claims may
build from subclaims. For a given system life cycle stage, an outcome may sufficiently satisfy a
subclaim or set of subclaims, such as a subclaim that stakeholder requirements are sufficiently
comprehensive to support a claim that the realized system is adequately secure.

Assurance cases are used to demonstrate that a system exhibits some complex emergent
property, such as safety, security, resilience, reliability, or survivability. An effective security
assurance case contains foundational security claims derived from security objectives, credible
and relevant evidence that substantiates the claims, and valid arguments that relate the various
evidence to the supported security claims. The result provides a compelling statement that
adequate security has been achieved and driven by stakeholder needs and expectations.

Assurance cases typically include supporting information, such as assumptions, constraints, and
inferences that affect the reasoning process. As part of assurance case development, subject-
matter expert analyses determine that all security claims are substantiated by the evidence and

   Assurance is the measure of confidence associated with a given requirement. As the level of assurance increases, so does the scope, depth, and
rigor associated with the methods and analyses conducted (Appendix F).
