NIST SP 800-219r1                                                     Automated Secure Configuration
July 2023                                                                  Guidance from the mSCP

   •   Develop a methodology to foster collaboration between baseline authors, reducing
       overhead and redundancy
   •   Establish a unified approach for the configuration and assessment of controls across
       multiple sources and tools
   •   Enable the customization of existing content and the creation of new content, including
       creating custom baselines in order to meet organization-specific security requirements
   •   Provide device management and security tool vendors, auditors, and Apple insight into
       customer security configuration needs

       mSCP Content Use
mSCP content can be used by any organization to assist in setting and assessing the security
configuration of macOS systems. Security baselines can map to existing guidance or controls,
such as those in NIST SP 800-53, Revision 5 [4], or they can be customized to meet an
organization’s specific needs. In mSCP terminology, a security baseline is represented as a
baseline file that designates the rules for meeting a specific set of requirements. The mSCP
provides a library of rules that are macOS settings. Each rule is mapped to a requirement within
a security standard or framework. Baseline files and rules comprise much of the mSCP’s content.
The mSCP offers several example baselines with descriptions adapted from Federal Information
Processing Standards Publication (FIPS) 199 [9], such as:
   •   The SP 800-53, Revision 5 low baseline is a defined map of controls to secure a system
       defined as a low-impact information system. The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or
       availability could be expected to have a limited adverse effect on organizational
       operations, organizational assets, or individuals.
   •   The SP 800-53, Revision 5 moderate baseline is a defined map of controls to secure a
       system defined as a moderate-impact information system. The loss of confidentiality,
       integrity, or availability could be expected to have a serious adverse effect on
       organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.
   •   The SP 800-53, Revision 5 high baseline is a defined map of controls to secure a system
       defined as a high-impact information system. The loss of confidentiality, integrity, or
       availability could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on
       organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.
Organizations using any baseline example should take a risk-based approach for selecting the
appropriate settings and organizationally defined values depending on the context under which
the baseline will be applied. Organizations can tailor any of the baselines to include controls
specific to their needs and to produce evidence of control enforcement. Additional information
on baseline customization can be found in SP 800-70 [2], which discusses the importance of
customizing and testing baselines before applying them to a production system.
The mSCP provides scripts that can be used with baselines for several purposes, including the
following:
   •   Creating scripts and profiles for configuring macOS
