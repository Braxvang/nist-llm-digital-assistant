GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



    2. What other organization(s) should be contacted to mitigate potential cases of identity theft?

Scenario 8: Encrypted Files

An employee leaves an organization unexpectedly, and the employee’s manager is granted access to the
former employee’s desktop computer to retrieve important project information that should be stored on it.
The manager finds some filenames that appear to be related to the project, but the manager cannot access
the contents of the files. A system administrator looks at the system and concludes that the former
employee probably encrypted the files.

The following are additional questions for this scenario:

    1. Who should determine how much effort should be put into attempting to recover the encrypted
       data? How would this be determined?

    2. What changes could be made to the organization’s policies, guidelines, and procedures to reduce
       the impact of similar future incidents?
