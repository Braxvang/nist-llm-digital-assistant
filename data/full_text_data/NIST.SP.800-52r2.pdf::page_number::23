NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                                               GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


3.3     Cryptographic Support

Cryptographic support in TLS is provided through the use of various cipher suites. A cipher suite
specifies a collection of algorithms for key exchange (in TLS 1.2 and earlier only) 17 and for
providing confidentiality and integrity services to application data. The cipher suite negotiation
occurs during the TLS handshake protocol. The client presents cipher suites that it supports to
the server, and the server selects one of them to secure the session data.

In addition to the selection of appropriate cipher suites, system administrators may also have
additional considerations specific to the implementation of the cryptographic algorithms, as well
as cryptographic module validation requirements. Acceptable cipher suites are listed in Section
3.3.1, grouped by certificate type and protocol version. Cipher suite implementation
considerations are discussed in Section 3.3.2, and recommendations regarding cryptographic
module validation are described in Section 3.3.3.

3.3.1     Cipher Suites

Cipher suites specify the cryptographic algorithms that will be used for a session. Cipher suites
in TLS 1.0 through TLS 1.2 have the form:

          TLS_KeyExchangeAlg_WITH_EncryptionAlg_MessageAuthenticationAlg

For example, the cipher suite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA uses ephemeral
ECDH key establishment with parameters signed using RSA, confidentiality provided by AES-
128 (Advanced Encryption Standard with 128-bit key) in cipher block chaining mode, and
message authentication performed using HMAC_SHA. 18 For further information on cipher suite
interpretation, see Appendix B.

Cipher suites are defined differently in TLS 1.3. These cipher suites do not specify the key
exchange algorithm and have the form:

          TLS_AEAD_HASH

For example, the cipher suite TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 uses AES-128 in Galois Counter
Mode for confidentiality and message authentication and uses SHA-256 for the PRF. TLS 1.3
cipher suites cannot be negotiated for TLS 1.2 connections, and TLS 1.2 cipher suites cannot be
negotiated with TLS 1.3.

When negotiating a cipher suite, the client sends a handshake message with a list of cipher suites
it will accept. The server chooses from the list and sends a handshake message back indicating
which cipher suite it will accept. Although the client may order the list with what it considers to
be the strongest cipher suites listed first, the server may ignore the preference order and choose
any of the cipher suites proposed by the client. The server may have its own cipher suite


17 In TLS 1.3, the key exchange algorithm is specified solely in extensions (see Sections 3.4.2.3 and 3.4.2.10).


18 SHA indicates the use of the SHA-1 hash algorithm.
