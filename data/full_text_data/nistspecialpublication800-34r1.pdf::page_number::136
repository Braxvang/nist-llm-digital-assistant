        (a) Develops primary and alternate telecommunications service agreements that contain
        priority-of-service provisions in accordance with the organizationâ€™s availability
        requirements; and

        (b) Requests Telecommunications Service Priority for all telecommunications services used
        for national security emergency preparedness in the event that the primary and/or alternate
        telecommunications services are provided by a common carrier.

(2) The organization obtains alternate telecommunications services with consideration for reducing
the likelihood of sharing a single point of failure with primary telecommunications services.

(3) The organization obtains alternate telecommunications service providers that are separated
from primary service providers so as not to be susceptible to the same hazards.

(4) The organization requires primary and alternate telecommunications service providers to have
contingency plans.

CP-9 INFORMATION SYSTEM BACKUP

Control: The organization:

    a. Conducts backups of user-level information contained in the information system [Assignment:
       organization-defined frequency consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives];
    b. Conducts backups of system-level information (including system-state information) contained in
       the information system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency consistent with recovery
       time and recovery point objectives];
    c. Conducts backups of information system documentation including security-related documentation
       [Assignment: organization-defined frequency consistent with recovery time and recovery point
       objectives]; and
    d. Protects the confidentiality and integrity of backup information at the storage location.

Supplemental Guidance: System-level information includes, for example, system-state information,
operating system and application software, and licenses. Digital signatures and cryptographic hashes are
examples of mechanisms that can be employed by organizations to protect the integrity of information
system backups. An organizational assessment of risk guides the use of encryption for protecting backup
information. The protection of system backup information while in transit is beyond the scope of this
control. Related controls: CP-6, MP-4.

Control Enhancements:

(1) The organization tests backup information [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to
verify media reliability and information integrity.

(2) The organization uses a sample of backup information in the restoration of selected information
system functions as part of contingency plan testing.

(3) The organization stores backup copies of the operating system and other critical information
system software, as well as copies of the information system inventory (including hardware,
