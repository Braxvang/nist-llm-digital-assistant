D.3 CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER
The chief information officer69 is an organizational official responsible for: (i) designating a
senior information security officer; (ii) developing and maintaining information security policies,
procedures, and control techniques to address all applicable requirements; (iii) overseeing
personnel with significant responsibilities for information security and ensuring that the personnel
are adequately trained; (iv) assisting senior organizational officials concerning their security
responsibilities; and (v) in coordination with other senior officials, reporting annually to the head
of the federal agency on the overall effectiveness of the organization’s information security
program, including progress of remedial actions. The chief information officer, with the support
of the risk executive (function) and the senior information security officer, works closely with
authorizing officials and their designated representatives to help ensure that:
•    An organization-wide information security program is effectively implemented resulting in
     adequate security for all organizational information systems and environments of operation
     for those systems;
•    Information security considerations are integrated into programming/planning/budgeting
     cycles, enterprise architectures, and acquisition/system development life cycles;
•    Information systems are covered by approved security plans and are authorized to operate;
•    Information security-related activities required across the organization are accomplished in an
     efficient, cost-effective, and timely manner; and
•    There is centralized reporting of appropriate information security-related activities.

The chief information officer and authorizing officials also determine, based on organizational
priorities, the appropriate allocation of resources dedicated to the protection of the information
systems supporting the organization's missions and business functions. For selected information
systems, the chief information officer may be designated as an authorizing official or a co-
authorizing official with other senior organizational officials. The role of chief information
officer has inherent U.S. Government authority and is assigned to government personnel only.

D.4 INFORMATION OWNER/STEWARD
The information owner/steward is an organizational official with statutory, management, or
operational authority for specified information and the responsibility for establishing the policies
and procedures governing its generation, collection, processing, dissemination, and disposal.70 In
information-sharing environments, the information owner/steward is responsible for establishing
the rules for appropriate use and protection of the subject information (e.g., rules of behavior) and
retains that responsibility when the information is shared with or provided to other organizations.

  When an organization has not designated a formal chief information officer position, FISMA requires the associated
responsibilities to be handled by a comparable organizational official.

  Federal information is an asset of the Nation, not of a particular federal agency or its subordinate organizations. In
that spirit, many federal agencies are developing policies, procedures, processes, and training needed to end the practice
of information ownership and implement the practice of information stewardship. Information stewardship is the
careful and responsible management of federal information belonging to the Nation as a whole, regardless of the entity
or source that may have originated, created, or compiled the information. Information stewards provide maximum
access to federal information to elements of the federal government and its customers, balanced by the obligation to
protect the information in accordance with the provisions of FISMA and any associated security-related federal
policies, directives, regulations, standards, and guidance.
