C.3      Sample Comprehensive Test Documentation

An example of a comprehensive test is the testing of all the systems and components comprising an
organization’s business continuity plan. During such a test, all the equipment, processes, and procedures
for each system and associated components are tested as a comprehensive unit.

SAMPLE COMPREHENSIVE TEST PLAN OVERVIEW

Because a comprehensive test plan is specifically designed around an organization’s security, business
continuity, or other plans, it is not practical to provide a full sample of the test documents. However, this
section provides a plan overview that outlines the systems and component tests as part of the
comprehensive plan. The forms in Appendices C.1 and C.2 for component and system testing can be
used to form individual parts of the comprehensive test.

SAMPLE COMPREHENSIVE TEST STRUCTURE

Comprehensive Tests are comprised of several System Tests which in turn are comprised of several
Component Tests. The following is an example of the structure of one branch of a comprehensive test.
