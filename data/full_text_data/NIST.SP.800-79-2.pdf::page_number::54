                               (and its token) once they are issued. It includes re-issuance, post
                               issuance updates, and termination.
Mobile Device                  A mobile device, for the purpose of this document is a portable
                               computing device that: (i) has a small form factor such that it can
                               easily be carried by a single individual; (ii) is designed to operate
                               without a physical connection (e.g., wirelessly transmit or receive
                               information); (iii) possesses local, non-removable or removable data
                               storage; and (iv) includes a self-contained power source. Mobile
                               devices may also include voice communication capabilities, on-
                               board sensors that allow the devices to capture information, and/or
                               built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations.
                               Examples include smart phones, tablets, and e-readers.

                               responsible for overseeing the operations of an issuer in accordance
                               with [FIPS 201-2] and for performing the responsibilities specified

Information System             A computer-based system used by an issuer to perform the
                               functions necessary for PIV Card or Derived PIV Credential
                               issuance as per [FIPS 201-2].
PII                            Personally Identifiable Information; Any representation of
                               information that permits the identity of an individual to whom the
                               information applies to be reasonably inferred by either direct or
                               indirect means. [E-Gov]
PIV                            Personal Identity Verification as specified in [FIPS 201-2].
PIV Card                       The physical artifact (e.g., identity card, “smart” card) issued to an
                               applicant by an issuer that contains stored identity markers or
                               credentials (e.g., a photograph, cryptographic keys, digitized
                               fingerprint representations) so that the claimed identity of the
                               cardholder can be verified against the stored credentials by another
                               person (human readable and verifiable) or an automated process
                               (computer readable and verifiable).
PIV Credential                 Evidence attesting to one’s right to credit or authority; in [FIPS
                               201-2]. It is the PIV Card or Derived PIV Credential token and data
                               elements associated with an individual that authoritatively binds an
                               identity (and, optionally, additional attributes) to that individual.
Risk                           The level of potential impact on an organization operations
