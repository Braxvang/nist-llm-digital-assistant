                                                Security Awareness
        2.2.1   Awareness

        Awareness is not training. The purpose of awareness presentations is simply to focus
        attention on security. Awareness presentations are intended to allow individuals to
        recognize IT security concerns and respond accordingly. In awareness activities the
        learner is a recipient of information, whereas the learner in a training environment has a
        more active role. Awareness relies on reaching broad audiences with attractive
        packaging techniques. Training is more formal, having a goal of building knowledge and
        skills to facilitate job performance.



A few examples of IT security awareness materials/activities include:
    •   Promotional/speciality trinkets with motivational slogans,
    •   A security reminder banner on computer screens, which comes up when a user logs on,
    •   Security awareness video tapes, and
    •   Posters or flyers.



Effective FT security awareness presentations must be designed with the recognition that people
tend to practice a tuning-out process called acclimation.   If a stimulus, originally an attention-

getter, is used repeatedly, the learner will selectively ignore the stimulus.   Thus, awareness
presentations must be on-going, creative, and motivational, with the objective of focusing the
learner's attention so that the learning will be incorporated into conscious decision-making. This
is called assimilation, a process whereby an individual incorporates    new experiences into an
existing behavior pattern.


Learning achieved through a single awareness activity tends to be short-term, immediate, and
specific. Training takes longer and involves higher-level concepts and skills.      For example, if a
learning objective is "to facilitate the increased use of effective password protection among
employees," an awareness activity might be the use of reminder stickers for computer keyboards.
A training activity might involve computer-based instruction in the use of passwords, parameters,
and how to change the passwords for organization systems.

Detailed guidance on IT security awareness is outside the scope of this document. Awareness, as
originally defined in 1989 in NIST SP 500-172, "creates the [employee's] sensitivity to the
threats and vulnerabilities of computer systems and the recognition of the need to protect data,
information, and the means of processing them."      The fundamental value of IT security
awareness programs is that they set the stage for training by bringing about a change in attitudes
which change the organizational culture. The cultural change is the realization that FT security is
critical because a security failure has potentially adverse consequences for everyone.     Therefore,
IT security is everyone 's job.
