                                                             Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics


Executive Summary

    The digital forensic community faces a constant challenge to stay abreast of the latest
    technologies that may be used to expose relevant clues in an investigation. Mobile devices are
    commonplace in todayâ€™s society, used by many individuals for both personal and professional
    purposes. Mobile devices vary in design and are continually undergoing change as existing
    technologies improve and new technologies are introduced. When a mobile device is
    encountered during an investigation, many questions arise: What is the best method to
    preserve the evidence? How should the device be handled? How should valuable or
    potentially relevant data contained on the device be extracted? The key to answering these
    questions begins with a firm understanding of the hardware and software characteristics of
    mobile devices. This guide discusses procedures for the preservation, acquisition, examination,
    analysis, and reporting of digital evidence. The issue of ever increasing backlogs for most
    digital forensics labs is addressed and guidance is provided on handling on-site triage
    casework.

    The objective of the guide is twofold: to help organizations evolve appropriate policies and
    procedures for dealing with mobile devices and to prepare forensic specialists to conduct
    forensically sound examinations involving mobile devices. This guide is not all-inclusive nor
    is it prescribing how law enforcement and incident response communities should handle
    mobile devices during their investigations or incidents. Specific vendors and mobile forensic
    acquisition guidance is not specified. However, from the principles outlined and other
    information provided, organizations should find this guide helpful in establishing their policies
    and procedures. This publication should not be construed as legal advice. Organizations should
    use this guide as a starting point for developing a forensic capability in conjunction with proper
    technical training and extensive guidance provided by legal advisors, officials, and
    management. This guide is the first revision to NIST SP800-101. While much of the
    information provided herein has been carried over from the original guide, the material has
    been updated and augmented to reflect the current state of the discipline.
