                                                                                             example, an RP may need to know whether the subscriber is over 13 years old, but has no need
                                                                                             for the full date of birth. To minimize collection of potentially sensitive PII, the RP may request
                                                                                             an attribute reference (e.g., Question: Is the subscriber over 13 years old? Response: Y/N or
