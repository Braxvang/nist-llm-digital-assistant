SCADA systems and DCS are often networked together. This is the case for electric power
control centers and generation facilities. Although electric power generation facility operation is
controlled by a DCS, the DCS must communicate with the SCADA system to coordinate
production output with transmission and distribution demands.
Electric power is often thought to be one of the most prevalent sources of disruptions of
interdependent critical infrastructures. For example, a cascading failure can be initiated by a
disruption of the microwave communications network used for an electric power transmission
SCADA system. The lack of monitoring and control capabilities could cause a large generating
unit to be taken offline and lead to the loss of power at a transmission substation. This loss could
cause a major imbalance, triggering a cascading failure across the power grid and resulting in
large area blackouts that potentially affect oil and natural gas production, refinery operations,
water treatment systems, wastewater collection systems, and pipeline transport systems that rely
on the grid for electric power.

       OT System Operation, Architectures, and Components
As Fig. 1 depicts, a typical OT system contains numerous control loops, human-machine
interfaces, and remote diagnostics and maintenance tools. The system is built using an array of
network protocols on layered network architectures. Some critical processes may also include
safety systems.
A control loop utilizes sensors, actuators, and controllers to manipulate some controlled process.
A sensor is a device that produces a measurement of some physical property and then sends this
information as controlled variables to the controller. The controller interprets the measurements
and generates corresponding manipulated variables based on a control algorithm and target set
points, which it transmits to the actuators. Actuators – such as control valves, breakers, switches,
and motors – are used to directly manipulate the controlled process based on commands from the
controller.
In a typical monitoring system, there are generally no direct connections between the sensors and
any actuators. Sensor values are transmitted to a monitoring station to be analyzed by a human.
However, these types of systems can still be considered OT systems (albeit with a human in the
loop) because the objective of the monitoring system is likely to identify and ultimately mitigate
an event or condition (e.g., a door alerting that it has been forced open, resulting in security
personnel being sent to investigate; an environmental sensor that detects high temperatures in a
server room, resulting in control center personnel activating an auxiliary air conditioning unit).
Operators and engineers use human-machine interfaces (HMIs) to monitor and configure set
points, control algorithms, and adjust and establish parameters in the controller. The HMI also
displays process status information and historical information. Diagnostics and maintenance
utilities are used to prevent, identify, and recover from abnormal operation or failures.
Sometimes, control loops are nested and/or cascading, whereby the set point for one loop is
based on the process variable determined by another loop. Supervisory-level loops and lower-
level loops operate continuously over the duration of a process with cycle times ranging in the
order of milliseconds to minutes.
