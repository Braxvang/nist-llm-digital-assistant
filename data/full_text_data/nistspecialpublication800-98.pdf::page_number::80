GUIDELINES FOR SECURING RFID SYSTEMS



 Cryptographic functions require additional power to complete, which could impact applications that
  use passive tags.
 Tags that support onboard encryption currently are more costly than those that do not. One reason for
  the increased cost is that onboard encryption requires additional logic gates to perform the necessary
  computations. Most low-cost passive tags do not have enough logic gates to perform complex
  encryption algorithms. 59
5.3.2.3 Electromagnetic Shielding

Control: RF shielding encloses an area with a conducting material that limits the propagation of RF
signals outside of the shielded area. Shielding can vary in size and form depending on the application.

For example, some RFID-enabled travel documents are protected by a metallic anti-skimming material.
This material helps to prevent adversaries from reading the embedded tag when the passport cover is
closed. Shipping containers are sometimes shielded to prevent the reading of tags during transit.
Shielding is also placed in walls, partitions, or stalls to prevent RF emissions from leaving a confined
area. When readers are placed in tunnels on industrial production conveyor belts, the tunnels may be
shielded to reduce radio interference. Wrapping a tag in aluminum foil is also an effective means of
shielding.

Figure 5-3 shows how shielded partitions can separate collocated readers to prevent interference. The
readers near forklift A can operate without inadvertently reading tags on boxes on forklift B due to the
shielding in the partition that separates the portals. Shielding may be necessary when middleware is
unable to correctly filter duplicate read events from the two portals.

     Low cost tags currently have about 10,000 logic gates. The most efficient implementations of AES require 3,400 gates,
     which suggests that cryptographic support on low cost tags may be more feasible in the future. Source: M. Feldhofer, J.
