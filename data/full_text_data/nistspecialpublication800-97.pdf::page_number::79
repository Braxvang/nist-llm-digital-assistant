                                             ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



Some EAP methods have security features that other methods do not. To help people understand the level
of security that an EAP method provides, RFC 3748 includes a list of security claims, which are
essentially security protection goals that an EAP method might meet. Since the publication of RFC 3748
in June 2004, EAP methods entering the IETF RFC process must include a statement of which RFC 3748
security claims apply to the method and which do not. In addition, the specification for the EAP method
should include a justification for the claims that it makes, perhaps through a formal proof, so that users of
the EAP method can assess the level of assurance behind the claim. RFC 4017 identifies the security
claims that are mandatory, recommended, and optional for WLANs. Table 6-1 summarizes the result of
that effort.

                       Table 6-1. Security Claims for EAP Methods Used in WLANs (Part 1 of 2)

                         Requirement
     Security Claim                                                        Explanation of Claim
                            Level
                                            Key derivation is the ability of the EAP method to derive the exportable key
 Key derivation         Mandatory
                                            material that will be used for IEEE 802.11 RSN cryptographic protections. 62
                                            Key strength is a measure of the strength of the key derivation claim,
 Key strength           Mandatory
                                            expressed in a number of bits. 63
                                            Mutual authentication occurs when the STA authenticates the AS and the AS
 Mutual                                     authenticates the STA in the same EAP exchange using a particular EAP
                        Mandatory
 authentication                             method. Two independent one-way methods do not necessarily constitute
                                            mutual authentication.
                                            Shared state equivalence means that the EAP peer and server must share
                                            state attributes associated with the EAP method, including the method
 Shared state
             64         Mandatory           version number, the credentials provided and accepted, and any other
 equivalence
                                            negotiated method-specific state attributes. Both parties must be able to
                                            distinguish one instance of the method from another.
 Dictionary                                 A password-based EAP method provides resistance against dictionary
 attack                 Mandatory           attacks if it does not allow an attacker to capture EAP traffic and then use a
 resistance                                 dictionary of common passwords to guess the password.
                                            An EAP method provides man-in-the-middle attack resistance if an attacker
 Man-in-the-                                cannot use a WLAN device to proxy communication successfully between a
 middle attack          Mandatory           STA and AP in an unauthorized manner. In man-in-the-middle attacks, the
 resistance 65                              adversaryâ€™s device impersonates the STA when communicating with the AP
                                            and impersonates the AP when communicating with the STA.



62
       IEEE 802.11i-compliant WLAN equipment will not be able to function with EAP methods that cannot satisfy the key
       derivation claim because the WLAN software on the WLAN equipment needs the key material to perform subsequent
       transactions. This distinguishes the key derivation claim from other security claims; methods that cannot make the other
       security claims will provide inadequate protection, but will not cause system failure.
63
       Per RFC 4017, an EAP method suitable for use in an IEEE 802.11 RSN must generate key material with at least 128 bits of
       effective key strength (as defined in Section 7.2.1 of RFC 3748) and must export a Master Session Key (MSK) and an
       Extended Master Session Key (EMSK) of at least 512 bits each (as noted in RFC 3748, Section 7.10).
64
       This claim is not defined in RFC 3748, Section 7.2.1, but appears as a mandatory requirement in RFC 4017.
65
       Man-in-the-middle attack resistance corresponds to the cryptographic binding, integrity protection, replay protection, and
       session independence security claims defined in RFC 3748, Section 7.2.1. These claims are combined into a single
       requirement in RFC 4017. Protection against man-in-the-middle attacks can be provided through several means, including
       cryptographic binding, session independence, replay protection, or integrity protection. In cryptographic binding, a unique
       identifier from each entity is included in the key generation process in such a way as to guarantee that the parties to a
       communication did not change during the communication session. Session independence, often referred to as forward and
       reverse secrecy, is realized when an attacker cannot compromise the key material from subsequent or prior sessions from a
       compromise of any given session. Replay protection is achieved when a unique element such as a counter value is used in
       key generation. The result is that unique keys are used for each transaction, which prevents an attacker from capturing one
       session and replaying it at a later time. Integrity protection refers to the use of cryptography to provide data origin
       authentication and protection against unauthorized modification of EAP packets.
