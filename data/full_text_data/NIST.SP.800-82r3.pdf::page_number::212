D.1.9. North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)
The mission of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) is to improve the
reliability and security of the bulk power system in North America. To achieve that, NERC
develops and enforces reliability standards; monitors the bulk power system; assesses future
adequacy; audits owners, operators, and users for preparedness; and educates and trains industry
personnel. NERC is a self-regulatory organization that relies on the diverse and collective
expertise of industry participants. As the Electric Reliability Organization, NERC is subject to
audit by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and governmental authorities in
Canada.

D.1.9.4.       NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Standards
NERC has issued a set of cybersecurity standards to reduce the risk of compromise to electrical
generation resources and high-voltage transmission systems above 100 kV, also referred to as
bulk electric systems. Bulk electric systems include balancing authorities, reliability
coordinators, interchange authorities, transmission providers, transmission owners, transmission
operators, generation owners, generation operators, and load serving entities. The cybersecurity
standards include audit measures and levels of non-compliance that can be tied to penalties.
NERC currently maintains 12 Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards subject to
enforcement with two additional standards that are filed and pending regulatory approval.
