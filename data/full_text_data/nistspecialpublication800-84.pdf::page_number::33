are often simulated during the course of the exercise. Functional exercises are designed to exercise
specific team members, procedures, and assets involved in one or more functional aspects of an IT plan.
Functional exercises vary in complexity and scope, from validating specific aspects of a plan to full-scale
exercises that address all plan elements.

One commonly used methodology for planning and performing functional exercises has the following
phases:

     Design. The TT&E program coordinator works with a functional exercise design team to design
      the event. The design phase is usually started three to six months in advance of the event. The
      major steps in the event design process are as follows:

        –   Determine the exercise topic based on the overarching objectives for exercising the IT plan

        –   Determine the exercise scope based on which portions of the IT plan should be exercised

        –   Identify the objectives of the exercise

        –   Identify the individuals that should participate in the exercise and invite them to the event

        –   Identify the staff for the exercise, including an exercise director and one or more controllers,
            data collectors, and simulators

        –   Coordinate the logistics for the exercise event.
     Development. The design team creates the documentation to be used before, during, and after
      the exercise event. Typical documentation includes briefings for participants and exercise staff; a
      scenario; a master scenario events list (MSEL); message injects and a message inject tracking
      form; an after action report; and controller, data collector, and simulator books.
     Conduct. Functional exercises are typically conducted in real or near-real time and prompt
      participants to carry out their roles and responsibilities as realistically as possible. A functional
      exercise is often initiated by a telephone call or other appropriate means, alerting selected
      personnel of the implementation or activation of a specific IT plan. Participants are expected to
      carry out operational or decision-making activities documented in the plan. The exercise
      controllers administer the exercise, including introducing the scenario and message injects to
      participants. Data collectors directly observe player actions during the exercise. Simulators
      assume the roles of entities that are not participating in the event, such as external organizations
      or private citizens. The exercise director announces the conclusion of the exercise. Immediately
      following the exercise play, the exercise director, controllers, and data collectors conduct an
      exercise debrief with the participants, requesting feedback from everyone present.
     Evaluation. The comments from the debrief, along with lessons learned during the exercise,
      should be captured in an after action report. The report should include background information
      about the exercise, documented observations made by the exercise staff, and recommendations
      for enhancing the IT plan that was exercised. Outcomes of the evaluation could include updating
      the IT plan or other security-related documents, briefing managers on the results, and performing
      other actions.
