                                                                                     Guidelines on PDA Forensics


       two dominant operating systems are Pocket PC and Palm OS, PDAs manufactured to run one
       operating system can frequently run an alternative operating system. For example,
       distributions of Linux available from handhelds.org can be loaded and run on a variety of
       Pocket PC devices.24 Similarly, versions of Linux, such as Linux DA, exist for Palm OS
       devices.25

       Each operating system has particular applications intertwined within the main graphical user
       interface (i.e., icons such as Word, Explorer, Memo Pad, Terminal, etc.). Other clues that
       allow identification of a device are the following: the cradle interface, manufacturer serial
       number, the cradle type, power supply, etc. Any synchronization software discovered on an
       associated PC also helps to differentiate among operating system families.

5.3   Documentation

       Evidence must be accurately accounted for and identified. The labeling process should
       document the case number, a brief description, signature, and the date and time the evidence
       was collected. Additionally, the crime scene should be photographed alongside a report
       documenting the state of each digital device/personal computer (personal computers may
       contain useful data that has not been synchronized with the owner’s PDA). This is helpful if
       questioned about the environment later [Kru01].

       A record of all visible data should be created. All digital devices (PDAs) that may possibly
       store data should be photographed with all peripherals cables, cradles, power connectors,
       removable media, and connections. If the device is in an active or semi-active state, the
       screen’s contents should be photographed and, if necessary, recorded manually. Other
       characteristics such as any LED activity (e.g., blinking) or physical connectivity should also be
       noted. Having an individual in charge to perform evidence custodian duties at the scene,
       alongside a partner responsible for documentation of evidence, is desirable during the
       collection phase [Kru01].

       Actions taken on the system to view and record other volatile data not displayed at the time
       affect the remaining evidence. For example, running an application to view memory
       allocation or running processes will overwrite parts of memory. Moreover, it risks activating
       Trojan horse code hidden within the application.

       The chain of custody procedure is a simple yet effective process of documenting the complete
       journey of evidence through the lifecycle of the case. Carefully maintaining the chain of
       custody not only protects the integrity of evidence, but also makes if difficult for someone to
       argue that the evidence was tampered with [Kru01]. The documentation should answer the
       following questions:

                   Who collected it? (i.e., devices, media, associated peripherals, etc.)

                   How and where? (i.e., how was the evidence collected and where it was located)
