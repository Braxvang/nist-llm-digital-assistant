NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                               Guidelines for Media Sanitization


                 technologies/methods/tools. The Clear pattern should be at least two passes, to include a
                 pattern in the first pass and its complement in the second pass. Additional passes may be used.

   Purge:        Most USB removable media does not support sanitize commands, or if supported, the interfaces
                 are not supported in a standardized way across these devices. Refer to the manufacturer for
                 details about the availability and functionality of any available sanitization features and
                 commands.

   Destroy:      Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:        For most cases where Purging is desired, USB removable media should be Destroyed.

   Memory Cards This includes SD, SDHC, MMC, Compact Flash Memory, Microdrive, MemoryStick,
   etc.

   Clear:        Overwrite media by using organizationally approved and tested overwriting
                 technologies/methods/tools. The Clear pattern should be at least two passes, to include a
                 pattern in the first pass and its complement in the second pass. Additional passes may be used.

   Purge:        N/A

   Destroy:      Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:        None.

   Embedded Flash Memory on Boards and Devices This includes motherboards and peripheral
   cards such as network adapters or any other adapter containing non-volatile flash memory.

   Clear:        If supported by the device, reset the state to original factory settings.

   Purge:        N/A If the flash memory can be easily identified and removed from the board, the flash memory
                 may be Destroyed independently from the disposal of the board that contained the flash memory.
                 Otherwise, the whole board should be Destroyed.

   Destroy:      Shred, Disintegrate, Pulverize, or Incinerate by burning the device in a licensed incinerator.


   Notes:        While Embedded flash memory has traditionally not been specifically addressed in media
                 sanitization guidelines, the increasing complexity of systems and associated use of flash memory
                 has complementarily increased the likelihood that sensitive data may be present. For example,
                 remote management capabilities integrated into a modern motherboard may necessitate storing
                 IP addresses, hostnames, usernames and passwords, certificates, or other data that may be
                 considered sensitive. As a result, for Clearing, it may be necessary to interact with multiple
                 interfaces to fully reset the device state. When this concept is applied to the example, this might
                 include the BIOS/UEFI interface as well as the remote management interface.
                 As with other types of media, the choice of sanitization technique is based on environment-
                 specific considerations. While the choice might be made to neither Clear nor Purge embedded
                 flash memory, it is important to recognize and accept the potential risk and continue to reevaluate
                 the risk as the environment changes.
