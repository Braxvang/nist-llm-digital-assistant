Appendix C—Pre-shared Keys

Pre-shared keys (PSK) are symmetric keys that are already in place prior to the initiation of a
TLS session (e.g., as the result of a manual distribution). The use of PSKs in TLS versions prior
to TLS 1.3 is described in RFC 4279 [30], RFC 5487 [3], and RFC 5489 [4]. Pre-shared keys are
used for session resumption in TLS 1.3. In general, pre-shared keys should not be used in TLS
versions prior to TLS 1.3 or for initial session establishment in TLS 1.3. However, the use of
pre-shared keys may be appropriate for some closed environments that have adequate key
management support. For example, they might be appropriate for constrained environments with
limited processing, memory, or power. If PSKs are appropriate and supported, then the following
additional guidelines shall be followed.

Recommended pre-shared key (PSK) cipher suites for TLS 1.2 are listed below. Cipher suites for
TLS 1.3 (see Section 3.3.1.2) can all be used with pre-shared keys. Pre-shared keys shall be
distributed in a secure manner, such as a secure manual distribution or using a key-establishment
certificate. These cipher suites employ a pre-shared key for entity authentication (for both the
server and the client) and may also use ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or ephemeral Elliptic
Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) algorithms for key establishment. For example, when DHE is
used, the result of the Diffie-Hellman computation is combined with the pre-shared key and
other input to determine the premaster secret.

The pre-shared key shall have a minimum security strength of 112 bits. Because these cipher
suites require pre-shared keys, these suites are not generally applicable to common secure
website applications and are not expected to be widely supported in TLS clients or TLS servers.
NIST suggests that pre-shared key cipher suites be considered for infrastructure applications,
particularly if frequent authentication of the network entities is required.

Pre-shared key cipher suites may only be used in networks where both the client and server
belong to the same organization. Cipher suites using pre-shared keys shall not be used with TLS
1.0 or 1.1 and shall not be used with TLS 1.2 when a government client or server communicates
with non-government systems.

TLS 1.2 servers and clients using pre-shared keys may support the following cipher suites:

   • TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0x00, 0xAA)
   • TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0x00, 0xAB)
   • TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 (0xC0, 0x37)
   • TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384 (0xC0, 0x38)
   • TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM (0xC0, 0xA6)
   • TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CCM (0xC0, 0xA7)
   • TLS_PSK_DHE_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8 (0xC0, 0xAA)
   • TLS_PSK_DHE_WITH_AES_256_CCM_8 (0xC0, 0xAB)
   • TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 (0x00, 0xB2)
   • TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384 (0x00, 0xB3)
   • TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0x00, 0xA8)
   • TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0x00, 0xA9)
