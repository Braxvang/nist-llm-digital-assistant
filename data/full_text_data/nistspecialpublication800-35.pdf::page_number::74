                                                                                             NIST Special Publication 800-35



D.3.4         Certification and Accreditation

D.3.4.1                Determine Security Requirements

The Contractor shall study the system to gain an overall understanding of the system, its users, functional
requirements, and security requirements.

D.3.4.2                Prepare and Review Systems Security Requirements

The Contractor shall prepare a list of system security requirements. The Contractor shall deliver the list
of system security requirements to the COTR.

D.3.4.3                Perform Security Test and Evaluation 16 of System

The Contractor shall perform a security test and evaluation to demonstrate through appropriate
verification techniques, verification procedures, and procedure refinements, that the management,
operational, and technical security controls for the IT system are implemented correctly and are effective
in their application.

The Contractor shall prepare a final ST&E report based on the results of the ST&E activities and deliver it
to the COTR.

D.3.4.4                Prepare Security Certification Report

The Contractor shall prepare a security certification report summarizing the results of the certification
efforts. The statement shall address the adequacy of the security and controls implemented or under
development. The Contractor shall deliver the Security Certification Report and Statement to the COTR.

D.3.5         IT Security Product Selection and Evaluation

NIST SP 800-23, Guidelines to Federal Organizations on Security Assurance and Acquisition/Use of
Tested/Evaluated Products, provides guidance to federal organizations on the acquisition and use of
security-related IT products. NIST SP 800-23 also provides an introduction to the National Information
Assurance Partnership’s Common Criteria (CC) Evaluation and Validation Program and NISTs
Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP). The following SOW paragraphs are provided if an
organization chooses to select a product outside the scope of the CC or CMVP programs. Note however,
that for federal agencies that have determined that they need to use cryptography to protect sensitive
information they must use FIPS approved cryptography that meets the relevant FIPS standards tested in
NIST approved laboratories.

D.3.5.1                Evaluate the Product to Determine Security Features

The Contractor shall determine the security features of the <product name> and/or its interfaces with
other security products on the system. When appropriate, this may require direct contact with <product
name> vendor's representative. Although purchase of the product may be necessary, obtaining an
evaluation copy on a trial basis may be preferable. The Contractor shall draft a report on the security
features of the product.

16
     NIST SP 800-37 (Draft) distinguishes between a developmental and an operational ST&E. The type of ST&E depends on
       whether the system is new, undergoing major modification, or has already been delivered and installed. This SOW
       paragraph is presented generically and does not differentiate between developmental or operational ST&E.
