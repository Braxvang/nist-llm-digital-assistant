GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



servers), as well as knowledge of the information supporting the applications and OSs used by the
organization. If analysts understand the organization’s normal computing baseline, such as typical
patterns of usage on systems and networks across the enterprise, they should be able to perform their
work easier and faster. Analysts should also have a firm understanding of each of the network traffic data
sources, as well as access to supporting materials, such as intrusion detection signature documentation.
Analysts should understand the characteristics and relative value of each data source so that they can
locate the relevant data quickly.

Given the potential complexities of the analysis process and the extensive knowledge of networking and
information security required for analyzing network traffic data effectively, a full description of
techniques needed for analyzing data and drawing conclusions in complex situations is beyond the scope
of this document. Instead, the section focuses on the basic steps of the examination and analysis
processes and highlights some significant technical issues that analysts should consider.

6.4.1   Identify an Event of Interest

The first step in the examination process is the identification of an event of interest. Typically, this
identification is made through one of two methods:

    ! Someone within the organization (e.g., help desk agent, system administrator, security
      administrator) receives an indication, such as an automated alert or a user complaint, that there is
      a security or operational-related issue. The analyst is asked to research the corresponding
      activity.
    ! During a review of security event data (e.g., IDS monitoring, network monitoring, firewall log
      review), which is part of the analyst’s regular duties, the analyst identifies an event of interest and
      determines that it should be researched further.
When an event of interest has been identified, the analyst needs to know some basic information about the
event as a basis for research. In most cases, the event will have been detected through a network traffic
data source, such as an IDS sensor or a firewall, so the analyst can simply be pointed to that data source
for more information. However, in some cases, such as a user complaint, it might not be apparent which
data sources (if any) contain relevant information or which hosts or networks might be involved.
Therefore, analysts might need to rely on more general information—for example, reports that several
systems on the fourth floor have been rebooting themselves. Although data examination is easier if the
event information is specific (e.g., IP addresses of affected systems), even general information provides
the analyst with a starting point for finding the relevant data sources.

6.4.2   Examine Data Sources

As described in Section 6.2, organizations may have many sources of network traffic-related data. A
single event of interest could be noted by many of these data sources, but it may be inefficient or
impractical to check each source individually. For initial event data examination, analysts typically rely
on a few primary data sources, such as an IDS console that displays alerts from all IDS sensors, or SEM
or NFAT software that consolidates many other data sources and organizes the data. Not only is this an
efficient solution, but also in most cases the event of interest will be identified by an alert from one of
these primary data sources.

For each data source examined, analysts should consider its fidelity. In general, analysts should have
more confidence in original data sources than in data sources that receive normalized (modified) data
from other sources. In addition, analysts should validate data that is based on interpretation, such as IDS
and SEM alerts. No tool for identifying malicious activity is completely accurate; they produce both false
