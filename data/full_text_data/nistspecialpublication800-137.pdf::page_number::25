maximizes efficiencies and leveragability of security-related data. As changes occur, the ISCM
strategy is reviewed for relevance, accuracy in reflecting organizational risk tolerances,
correctness of measurements, and applicability of metrics. An inherent part of any ISCM strategy
is the inclusion of criteria describing the conditions that trigger a review or update of the strategy,
in addition to the preestablished frequency audit. Likewise, the organization defines criteria and
procedures for updating the ISCM program based on the revised ISCM strategy.

3.1.1 ORGANIZATION (TIER 1) AND MISSION/BUSINESS PROCESSES (TIER 2) ISCM STRATEGY
The risk executive (function) determines the overall organizational risk tolerance and risk
mitigation strategy at the organization tier.24 The ISCM strategy is developed and implemented to
support risk management in accordance with organizational risk tolerance. While ISCM strategy,
policy, and procedures may be developed at any tier, typically, the organization-wide ISCM
strategy and associated policy are developed at the organization tier with general procedures for
implementation developed at the mission/business processes tier. If the organization-wide
strategy is developed at the mission/business processes tier, Tier 1officials review and approve
the strategy to ensure that organizational risk tolerance across all missions and business processes
has been appropriately considered. This information is communicated to staff at the
mission/business processes and information systems tiers and reflected in mission/business
processes and information systems tier strategy, policy, and procedures.

When developed at Tiers 1 and/or 2, the following policies, procedures, and templates facilitate
organization-wide, standardized processes in support of the ISCM strategy:

•    Policy that defines key metrics;
•    Policy for modifications to and maintenance of the monitoring strategy;

•    Policy and procedures for the assessment of security control effectiveness (common, hybrid,
     and system-level controls);
•    Policy and procedures for security status monitoring;
•    Policy and procedures for security status reporting (on control effectiveness and status
     monitoring);

•    Policy and procedures for assessing risks and gaining threat information and insights;
•    Policy and procedures for configuration management and security impact analysis; 25
•    Policy and procedures for implementation and use of organization-wide tools;
•    Policy and procedures for establishment of monitoring frequencies;

•    Policy and procedures for determining sample sizes and populations and for managing object
     sampling;

•    Procedures for determining security metrics and data sources;
