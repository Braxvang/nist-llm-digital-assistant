ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



At a high level, RSN includes IEEE 802.1X port-based access control, key management techniques, and
the TKIP and CCMP data confidentiality and integrity protocols. Described in Section 4.3, these
protocols allow for the creation of several diverse types of security networks because of the numerous
configuration options. RSN security is at the link level only, 24 providing protection for traffic between a
wireless STA and its associated AP, or between one wireless STA and another wireless STA. It does not
provide end-to-end application-level security, such as between a STA and an e-mail or Web server on the
DS, because communication between these entities requires more than just one link. To provide end-to-
end security, organizations can implement network level security mechanisms such as Transport Layer
Security (TLS) or IPsec. Also, RSNâ€™s security features apply only to the wireless portion of the overall
network, not to communications on wired networks. As shown in Figure 4-2, the security provided in an
RSN can apply to both IEEE 802.11 modes of operation, BSS (infrastructure mode) and IBSS (ad hoc
mode). 25 For infrastructure mode, additional measures need to be taken to provide end-to-end security.

The IEEE 802.11i amendment defines an RSN as a wireless network that allows the creation of RSN
Associations (RSNA) only. An RSNA is a security relationship established by the IEEE 802.11i 4-Way
Handshake, which is described in Section 5.5. The 4-Way Handshake validates that the parties to the
protocol instance both possess a pairwise master key (PMK), synchronizes the installation of temporal
keys, and confirms the selection of cipher suites. The PMK is the cornerstone for a number of security
features absent from WEP. Complete robust security is considered to be possible only when all devices in
the network use RSNAs. In practice, some networks have a mix of RSNAs and non-RSNA connections.
A network that allows the creation of both pre-RSN associations (pre-RSNA) and RSNAs is referred to as
a Transition Security Network (TSN). A TSN is intended to be an interim means to provide connectivity
while an organization migrates to networks based exclusively on RSNAs.

     A link layer protocol describes the rules for communication between two entities over a particular communications medium,
     such as air (wireless networking) or various cable types (wired networking). It defines how these entities are uniquely
     addressed, how the medium will be shared when more than two entities use it simultaneously, and how to correct for errors
     in transmission. Link layer protocols are distinguished from network layer protocols, which focus primarily on routing data
     packets over multiple links, and perhaps over multiple media types. For example, the packets of a network layer protocol
     such as IP might travel over a number of links from source to destination. Different link layer protocols (e.g., Point-to-Point
     Protocol [PPP], IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.16) might govern the transmission of the IP packets over each of the links.

     Although RSNs may be created for both BSS and IBSS WLANs, this guide only describes the security algorithms and
     protocols for BSSs. Significant differences between these modes are highlighted.
