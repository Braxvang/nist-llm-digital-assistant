Special Publication 800-73-4      Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification – Part 1: PIV
                               Card Application Namespace, Data Model and Representation

            •    A pivSigner-DN attribute containing the subject name that appears in the PKI
                 certificate for the entity that signed the CHUID

        –   Include the digital signature.
The public key required to verify the digital signature shall be provided in the certificates field in an
X.509 digital signature certificate that has been issued in accordance with Section 4.2.1 of FIPS
201-2.

3.1.3   X.509 Certificate for PIV Authentication

The X.509 Certificate for PIV Authentication and its associated private key, as defined in FIPS 201,
is used to authenticate the card and the cardholder. The PIV Authentication private key and its
corresponding certificate are only available over the contact interface or virtual contact interface
(VCI). The read access control rule for the X.509 Certificate for PIV Authentication is “Always,”
meaning the certificate can be read without access control restrictions. The Public Key Infrastructure
(PKI) cryptographic function (see Table 4b) is protected with a Personal Identification Number (PIN)
or on-card biometric comparison (OCC) access rule. In other words, private key operations using the
PIV Authentication key require the PIN or OCC data to be submitted and verified, but a successful
submission enables multiple private key operations without additional cardholder consent.

3.1.4   X.509 Certificate for Card Authentication

FIPS 201 specifies the mandatory asymmetric Card Authentication key (CAK) as a private key that
may be used to support physical access applications. The read access control rule of the
corresponding X.509 Certificate for Card Authentication is “Always,” meaning the certificate can be
read without access control restrictions. The PKI cryptographic function (see Table 4b) is under an
“Always” access rule, and thus private key operations can performed without access control
restrictions. The asymmetric CAK is generated by the PIV Card Issuer in accordance with FIPS 140-2
requirements for key generation. An asymmetric CAK may be generated on-card or off-card. If an
asymmetric CAK is generated off-card, the result of each key generation shall be injected into at most
one PIV Card.

3.1.5   Cardholder Fingerprints

The fingerprint data object specifies the primary and secondary fingerprints for off-card matching in
accordance with FIPS 201 and [SP800-76].

3.1.6   Cardholder Facial Image

The facial image data object supports visual authentication by a guard, and may also be used for
automated facial authentication in operator-attended PIV issuance, reissuance, and verification data
reset processes. The facial image data object shall be encoded as specified in [SP800-76].

3.1.7   Security Object

The Security Object is in accordance with Appendix 3 to Section IV of Volume 2 of Part 3 of
Machine Readable Travel Documents (MRTD) [MRTD]. Tag 0xBA is used to map the ContainerIDs
in the PIV data model to the 16 Data Groups specified in the MRTD. The mapping enables the
Security Object to be fully compliant for future activities with identity documents.
