GLOSSARY
COMMON TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

Appendix B provides definitions for security terminology used within Special Publication 800-53.
Unless specifically defined in this glossary, all terms used in this publication are consistent with
the definitions contained in CNSS Instruction 4009, National Information Assurance Glossary.

 Accreditation                       The official management decision given by a senior agency
 [FIPS 200, NIST SP 800-37]          official to authorize operation of an information system and to
                                     explicitly accept the risk to agency operations (including mission,
                                     functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, or individuals,
                                     based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security
                                     controls.
 Accreditation Boundary              All components of an information system to be accredited by an
 [NIST SP 800-37]                    authorizing official and excludes separately accredited systems, to
                                     which the information system is connected. Synonymous with the
                                     term security perimeter defined in CNSS Instruction 4009 and
                                     DCID 6/3.
 Accrediting Authority               See Authorizing Official.

 Adequate Security                   Security commensurate with the risk and the magnitude of harm
 [OMB Circular A-130,                resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or
 Appendix III]                       modification of information.
 Agency                              See Executive Agency.
 Authentication                      Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a

                                     system.
 Authenticity                        The property of being genuine and being able to be verified and

                                     message originator. See authentication.
 Authorize Processing                See Accreditation.
 Authorizing Official                Official with the authority to formally assume responsibility for
 [FIPS 200, NIST SP 800-37]          operating an information system at an acceptable level of risk to
                                     agency operations (including mission, functions, image, or
                                     reputation), agency assets, or individuals. Synonymous with
