      NIST SP 800-92r1 ipd                                                    Cybersecurity Log Management
      October 2023                                                                           Planning Guide

258      How to Use This Publication
259   Sections 3 through 6 of this publication define the following high-level plays, as well as their
260   component tasks and plays:
261      •   INV, Update Logging-Related Inventories (Section 3): Characterize the current state of
262          your organization’s cybersecurity logging.
263      •   TS, Define Target State (Section 4): Define the target state for your organization’s
264          cybersecurity logging.
265      •   GRC, Document Gaps and Their Root Causes (Section 5): Document the gaps
266          between the current cybersecurity logging state and the target state, and identify the root
267          causes of each gap.
268      •   PMG, Develop a Plan to Mitigate the Gaps (Section 6): Develop a plan for addressing
269          the root causes of the identified gaps in order to reach the target state.

270   There is no “correct” way to use the playbook. An organization may choose to use it as the start
271   of its own new playbook for log management planning, integrate it with an existing log
272   management playbook, or use its information as reference material when considering its own
273   plans, policies, and processes.
274   Each play includes the following components:
275      •   Unique ID number (for example, INV-5)
276      •   Title (for example, Update the Work Role Inventory)
277      •   Summary, to include the play’s desired outcome
278      •   Tasks to perform. Each task is briefly stated and has a unique identifier based on its
279          play’s ID. Tasks that need a more detailed explanation are either defined as separate
280          plays or have additional explanatory text following them under the label supporting
281          information for tasks. Each list of tasks is assumed to typically be performed
282          sequentially unless otherwise noted by the phrase “not necessarily in order.”
283   Some plays also include examples related to the play, such as possible roles and
284   responsibilities, use cases, or sources of requirements.
285   In addition to the plays themselves, Appendix B contains crosswalks that indicate how
286   performing each play and its tasks can most significantly help an organization achieve
287   recommended outcomes, controls, and other concepts from a variety of NIST resources.
288   The plays and tasks are intentionally focused on important actions to perform for planning and,
289   thus, avoid any recommendations on the details of log management. Log management needs are
290   incredibly variable from one organization to another and frequently change, so this playbook
291   avoids specifying who is responsible for planning or performing any of the plays or tasks.
292   Rather, this playbook helps organizations identify and prioritize their needs and determine how
293   to best meet those needs.
