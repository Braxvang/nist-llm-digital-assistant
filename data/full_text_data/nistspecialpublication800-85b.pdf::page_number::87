                      2.      AS06.01.14
Precondition          1.      A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                      2.      A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and the
                              contact reader.
                      3.      The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                      4.      A valid CHUID is present on the PIV card.
Test Steps            1. Set cardHandle := <<valid card handle>>
                      2. Set OID := <<CHUID (2.16.840.1.101.3.7.2.48.0)>>
                      3. Call pivGetData w/
                         • (IN) cardHandle
                              • (IN) OID
                              • (OUT) data
                      4. Extract the expiration date value from the CHUID (i.e.
                         Tag 0x35)
                      5. Extract the SignerInfo->signatureAlgorithm field
                         contents.
Expected              1.      From Step 5: The signatureAlgorithm value is in accordance with
Result(s)                     Table 3-4 of SP80078
                      2.      From Step 4: The expiration date value is earlier than or equal to the
                              sunset date specified in Table 3-3 of SP80078 for the algorithm from
                              Step 5.


10.1.1.12 Verify digital signature

Purpose               Confirms that the signature in the SignerInfo corresponds to the signed
                      CHUID

                      3.      AS06.01.15
Precondition          1.      A valid PIV card is inserted into the contact reader.
                      2.      A valid PC/SC connection exists between the test application and the
                              contact reader.
                      3.      The test application is currently connected to the card application
                              which is accessible through card handle.
                      4.      A valid CHUID is present on the PIV card.
