CHAPTER 10                                                                         Risk Management


evaluation and assessment process to ensure that the system continues to operate in
a safe and secure manner. This goal can be partially reached by implementing a
strong configuration management program. 69 In addition, to monitoring the security
of an information system on a continuous basis, agencies must track findings from
the security control assessment to ensure they are addressed appropriately and do
not continue to pose or introduce new risks to the system.
    The process of managing risk permeates the Systems Development Life Cycle
(SDLC), beginning with the early stages of project inception through the retirement
of the system and its data. From inception forward, agencies should consider the
possible threats, vulnerabilities, and risks to the system so that they can better
prepare it to operate in its intended environment, securely and effectively, and
within a select risk threshold, as deemed acceptable by an agency senior official
during the security certification and accreditation process.
