       December 2022


1398   5.3.1. Assess Privacy, Equity, Usability and Threats
1399   When selecting and tailoring assurance levels for specific applications, it is critical that
1400   insights and inputs to the process extend beyond an initial, static impact assessment.
1401   When transitioning from an initial assurance level to the final xAL selection and
1402   implementation, organizations SHALL conduct detailed assessments of the controls
1403   defined at the assurance level to determine potential impacts in their operational
1404   environment. At a minimum, organizations SHALL assess impacts related to the
1405   following areas:
1406       • Privacy – to determine unintended consequences to the privacy of individuals that
1407         will be subject to the controls at an assessed xAL and of individuals affected by
1408         organizational or third-party practices related to the establishment, management, or
1409         federation of a digital identity.
1410       • Equity – to determine whether implementation of controls may create or maintain
1411         inequities across demographics or user groups.
1412       • Usability – to determine whether implementation of the selected controls will result
1413         in challenges to end-user experience.
1414       • Threat – to determine whether the defined assurance level will address specific
1415         threats based on environment, threat actors, and known tactics, techniques, and
1416         procedures (TTPs).
1417   Additionally, organizations SHOULD conduct additional business specific assessments
1418   as appropriate to fully represent mission and domain specific considerations not captured
1419   here. These assessments SHALL be extended to any compensating or supplemental
1420   controls as defined in Sec. 5.3.2 and Sec. 5.3.3.

1421   5.3.2. Identify Compensating Controls
1422   A compensating control is a management, operational, or technical control employed
1423   by an organization in lieu of a recommended control in the defined xALs. They are
1424   intended, to the greatest degree possible, to address the same risks as the baseline control
1425   is intended to address.
1426   Organizations SHOULD implement their identity services per the requirements in these
1427   guidelines for their tailored assurance level. However, where organizations are unable
1428   to implement a specific control associated with their baseline or tailored assurance
1429   level, they MAY select to implement a compensating control. This control MAY be a
1430   modification to a digital identity process as defined in these guidelines, but MAY also be
1431   applied elsewhere in an application, transaction, or service lifecycle. For example:
1432       • A federal agency could choose to use a federal background investigation and
1433         checks, as referenced by Personal Identity Verification [FIPS201], to compensate
1434         for the identity evidence validation with authoritative sources requirement under
1435         these guidelines.
