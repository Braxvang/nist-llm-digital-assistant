ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



4.4     Summary

An RSN is a wireless network that only allows the creation of RSNAs. An RSNA is a security
relationship based on the IEEE 802.11i 4-Way Handshake that allows for the protection of data frames
and provides enhanced security over the now-antiquated WEP. RSNAs enable the following security
features for IEEE 802.11 WLANs:

       Enhanced user authentication mechanisms
       Cryptographic key management
       Data confidentiality
       Data origin authentication and integrity
       Replay protection.
RSNAs use several cryptographic keys to support key derivation, encryption, authentication, and integrity
functions. The IEEE 802.11i specification defines two key hierarchies for RSNAs: the Pairwise Key
Hierarchy, which is designed for unicast traffic protection, and the Group Key Hierarchy, which is
intended for multicast/broadcast traffic protection. In the Pairwise Key Hierarchy, there are two ways in
which keys may be installed in RSNA devices, as follows:

       Pre-Shared Key (PSK), which is a static key delivered to the AS and the STA through an out-of-
        band mechanism. The IEEE 802.11 standard does not specify how PSKs are to be generated or
        distributed, so these decisions are left to implementers. The security of the WLAN is
        compromised if any of the PSKs does not possess sufficient cryptographic strength. As a result,
        organizations should review any PSK approach carefully for possible vulnerabilities and evaluate
        its performance implications. Distributing PSKs in a large network might be infeasible.
       Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) Key (AAAK), also known as the
        Master Session Key (MSK), which is delivered to the AP through the Extensible Authentication
        Protocol (EAP) during the process of establishing an RSNA. Each time a user authenticates to
        the WLAN, the AAA key changes; the new key is then used for the duration of the userâ€™s session.
        Decisions on the appropriate EAP authentication methods are left to the implementers of STAs or
        the AS. As a result, organizations should carefully review any EAP authentication methods and
        AAA key generation approaches for possible vulnerabilities.
The IEEE 802.11i amendment defines the following two data confidentiality and integrity protocols for
providing confidentiality and integrity for RSNAs:

       Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP). TKIP is intended as an interim solution for IEEE
        802.11 WLANs to address the numerous inadequacies of WEP expeditiously. TKIP may be
        implemented through software updates; it does not require hardware replacement of APs and
        STAs.
       Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol
        (CCMP). CCMP is considered the long-term solution for IEEE 802.11 WLANs. CCMP
        requires hardware updates and will require that organizations replace their pre-RSN IEEE 802.11
        equipment.
Table 4-2 compares the security features of WEP, TKIP, and CCMP. Support for CCMP is mandatory
for any device claiming RSNA compliance. As indicated in the table, only CCMP uses a core
cryptographic algorithm that is FIPS-compliant. For other security features, CCMP offers the same or
