GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



 Size of logs (which is directly related to the traffic of the site and the number of details logged)
 Value of mail server data and services
 Threat level.
9.1.3      Automated Log File Analysis Tools

Most mail servers receive significant amounts of traffic, and the log files quickly become voluminous.
Automated log analysis tools should be installed to ease the burden on the mail server administrator.
These tools analyze the entries in the mail server log files and identify suspicious and unusual activity.
As mentioned in Section 9.1.2, some organizations use SIEM software for centralized logging, which can
also perform automated log file analysis.

Many commercial and public domain tools are available to support regular analysis. The automated log
analyzer should forward any suspicious events to the responsible mail administrator or security incident
response team as soon as possible for follow-up investigation. Some organizations may wish to use two
or more log analyzers to reduce the risk of missing an attack or other significant events in the log files.

9.2       Backing Up Mail Servers

One of the most important functions of a mail server administrator is to maintain the integrity of the data
on the mail server. This is important because mail servers are often one of the most exposed and vital
servers on an organization’s network. The mail administrator needs to perform backups of the mail server
on a regular basis for several reasons. For example, a mail server could fail as a result of a malicious or
unintentional act or a hardware or software failure. In addition, Federal agencies and many other
organizations are governed by regulations on the backup and archiving of mail server data. Mail server
data should also be backed up on a regular basis for legal and financial reasons.

All organizations need to create a mail server backup policy. Three main factors influence the contents of
this policy:

 Legal requirements

      –    Applicable laws and regulations (Federal, state, and international)

      –    Litigation requirements
 Mission requirements

      –    Contractual

      –    Accepted practices

      –    Criticality of data to organization
 Organizational guidelines and policies.
Although each organization’s mail server backup policy will be different to reflect its particular
environment, it should address the following issues:

 The purpose of the mail server backup policy
