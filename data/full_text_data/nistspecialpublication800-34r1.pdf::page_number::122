                                                   CONTINGENCY PLANNING GUIDE FOR FEDERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS



Include a description of any alternate means (secondary processing or manual work-around) for
recovering the mission/business process(es) that rely on the system. If none exist, so state.

3.2         Identify Resource Requirements

The following table identifies the resources that compose {system name} including hardware, software,
and other resources such as data files.

                                                 Platform/OS/Version                   Description
      System Resource/Component
                                                     (as applicable)
Web Server 1                                    Optiplex GX280              Web Site Host




It is assumed that all identified resources support the mission/business processes identified in Section 3.1
unless otherwise stated.
Note: Information for this section should be available from the system’s System Security Plan (SSP) and
can be copied from the SSP, or reference the applicable section in the SSP and attach the latest version of
the SSP to this contingency plan.

3.3         Identify Recovery Priorities for System Resources

The table below lists the order of recovery for {system name} resources. The table also identifies the
expected time for recovering the resource following a “worst case” (complete rebuild/repair or
replacement) disruption.

           Recovery Time Objective (RTO) - RTO defines the maximum amount of time that a system
            resource can remain unavailable before there is an unacceptable impact on other system
            resources, supported mission/business processes, and the MTD. Determining the information
            system resource RTO is important for selecting appropriate technologies that are best suited for
            meeting the MTD.

                                      System
            Priority                                              Recovery Time Objective
                                Resource/Component
          Web Server 1            Optiplex GX280
                                                                 24 hours to rebuild or replace




A system resource can be software, data files, servers, or other hardware and should be identified
individually or as a logical group.

Identify any alternate strategies in place to meet expected RTOs. This includes backup or spare
equipment and vendor support contracts.
