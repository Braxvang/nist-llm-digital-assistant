                                                              GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



Completed                                            Action
            Test system to ensure security
            Reconnect system to network
            Monitor system and network for signs that the attacker is attempting to access the
            system or network again
            Document lessons learned
            Test security
            Periodically conduct vulnerability scans on Web server, dynamically generated
            content, and supporting network
            Update vulnerability scanner prior to testing
            Correct any deficiencies identified by the vulnerability scanner
            Conduct penetration testing on the Web server and the supporting network
            infrastructure
            Correct deficiencies identified by penetration testing
            Conduct remote administration and content updates
            Use a strong authentication mechanism (e.g., public/private key pair, two-factor
            authentication)
            Restrict hosts that can be used to remotely administer or update content on the Web
            server by IP address and to the internal network
            Use secure protocols (e.g., SSH, HTTPS)
            Enforce the concept of least privilege on remote administration and content updating
            (e.g., attempt to minimize the access rights for the remote administration/update
            accounts)
            Change any default accounts or passwords from the remote administration utility or
            application
            Do not allow remote administration from the Internet unless mechanisms such as
            VPNs are used
            Do not mount any file shares on the internal network from the Web server or vice
            versa
