The needed evidentiary basis for such judgments derives from well-formed and comprehensive
evidence-producing activities that address the requirements, design, properties, capabilities,
vulnerabilities, and effectiveness of security functions. These activities include a combination of
demonstration, inspection, analysis, testing, and other methods required to produce the needed
evidence. The evidence acquired from these activities informs reasoning by qualified subject-
matter experts to interpret the evidence to substantiate the assurance claims made while
considering other emergent properties that the system may possess.


                                                           VENEER SECURITY
              Assurance is difficult but necessary.
              “I’ve covered a lot of material in this book, some of it quite tricky. But I’ve left the
              hardest parts to the last. First, there’s the question of assurance …“ [5].
              Veneer security is security functionality provided without corresponding assurance
              so that the functionality only appears to protect resources when it does not. Veneer
              security results in a false sense of security and, in fact, increases risk due to the
              uncertainty about the behavior and outcomes produced by the security functionality
              in the presence and absence of adversity. Veneer security must be avoided [62].
              Compliance is a form of “veneer security.” While compliance may have an important
              informing role in judgments of trustworthiness, compliance-based judgments – like
              other forms of veneer security – do not suffice as the sole evidentiary basis for
              assurance and the associated judgments of trustworthiness.




F.2.1. Security Assurance Claims
From a security perspective, a top-level claim addresses freedom from the conditions that cause
asset loss and the associated consequences. Specifically, this means the system will adequately
contribute to freedom from the conditions that cause asset loss and the associated consequences.

Top-level claims decompose in a structured manner into subclaims about the desired attributes of
a trustworthy secure system. Subclaims address the requirements, design, implementation,
methods, and adversities that demonstrate that the system adequately contributes to ensuring
only authorized and intended system behaviors and outcomes. These subclaims are derived from
concerns about the completeness and accuracy of stakeholder and system requirements, 89
enforcement of the security policy, proper implementation of the design, proper maintenance of
the system, the usability of the system, 90 and the avoidance, minimization, and mitigation of



89
   Claims are not expressed solely as a restatement of the security functional and performance requirements. Doing so only provides assurance
that the security requirements are satisfied with the implicit assumption that the requirements are correct, provide adequate coverage, and
accurately reflect stakeholder needs and concerns.
90
   Most system failures have a human component. Thus, assurance must consider human frailty [5]. Operator behavior is a product of the
environment (including its systems) in which it occurs [36].
