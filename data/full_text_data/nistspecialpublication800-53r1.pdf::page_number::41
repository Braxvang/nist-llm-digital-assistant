 Commodity Service                   An information system service (e.g., telecommunications service)
                                     provided by a commercial service provider typically to a large
                                     and diverse set of consumers. The organization acquiring and/or
                                     receiving the commodity service possesses limited visibility into
                                     the management structure and operations of the provider and
                                     while the organization may be able to negotiate service-level
                                     agreements, the organization is typically not in a position to
                                     require that the provider implement specific security controls.
 Common Carrier                      In a telecommunications context, a telecommunications company
                                     that holds itself out to the public for hire to provide
                                     communications transmission services. Note: In the United
                                     States, such companies are usually subject to regulation by
                                     federal and state regulatory commissions.
 Common Security Control             Security control that can be applied to one or more agency
 [NIST SP 800-37]                    information systems and has the following properties: (i) the
                                     development, implementation, and assessment of the control can
                                     be assigned to a responsible official or organizational element
                                     (other than the information system owner); and (ii) the results
                                     from the assessment of the control can be used to support the
                                     security certification and accreditation processes of an agency
                                     information system where that control has been applied.
 Compensating Security               The management, operational, and technical controls (i.e.,
 Controls                            safeguards or countermeasures) employed by an organization in
                                     lieu of the recommended controls in the low, moderate, or high
                                     baselines described in NIST Special Publication 800-53, that
                                     provide equivalent or comparable protection for an information
                                     system.
 Confidentiality                     Preserving authorized restrictions on information access and
 [44 U.S.C., Sec. 3542]              disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and
                                     proprietary information.
 Configuration Control               Process for controlling modifications to hardware, firmware,
 [CNSS Inst. 4009]                   software, and documentation to protect the information system
                                     against improper modifications before, during, and after system
                                     implementation.
 Countermeasures                     Actions, devices, procedures, techniques, or other measures that
 [CNSS Inst. 4009]                   reduce the vulnerability of an information system. Synonymous
                                     with security controls and safeguards.
 Controlled Area                     Any area or space for which the organization has confidence that
                                     the physical and procedural protections provided are sufficient to
                                     meet the requirements established for protecting the information
                                     and/or information system.
 Executive Agency                    An executive department specified in 5 U.S.C., Sec. 101; a
 [41 U.S.C., Sec. 403]               military department specified in 5 U.S.C., Sec. 102; an
                                     independent establishment as defined in 5 U.S.C., Sec. 104(1);
                                     and a wholly owned Government corporation fully subject to the
                                     provisions of 31 U.S.C., Chapter 91.
