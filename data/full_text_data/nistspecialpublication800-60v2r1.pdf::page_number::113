Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external publication of
inventory control information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect public
confidence in the agency. However, damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
inventory control information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to inventory control information.
Functions and processes supported by most inventory control information are tolerant of
delays i.e., the data supporting the functions/processes are not time-critical. Typically,
disruption of access to inventory control information will have a limited adverse effect on
agency operations (including mission functions and public confidence in the agency), agency
assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Exceptions may include emergency
requirements to access and distribute materials necessary for disaster management. In such
cases, delays may cost lives and major property damage. Consequently, the impact level for
inventory control information needed to respond to emergencies will be high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
inventory control information is low.
C.3.4.3 Logistics Management Information Type

Logistics management involves the planning and tracking of personnel and their resources in
relation to their availability and location. The recommended security categorization for the
logistics management information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of logistics management
information on the ability of agencies to plan and track the availability and location of personnel
and their resources. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most logistics management
information are likely to have only limited adverse effects on agency operations, agency assets,
or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of logistics
information associated with homeland security, law enforcement and some transportation
activities (e.g., air transport) can facilitate terrorist or other criminal activities that may result in
serious on Federal government assets and operations and on the general public. Logistics
management information associated with a broad range of mission areas can be of material use to
criminals seeking to perpetrate fraud, theft, or other criminal enterprises. Also, this information
is a key intelligence target for those seeking information on defense or law enforcement
capabilities, dispositions and intent. In all these cases, the unauthorized disclosure of logistics
management information may result in serious adverse effects on agency operations, agency
assets, and individuals. Therefore, the confidentiality impact level for these types of criminal
                                                     88
