       NIST SP 800-63B-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
       December 2022                                       Authentication and Lifecycle Management


2408            – Facial poses affect facial recognition accuracy (e.g., looking down or away
2409              from the camera).
2410       • Iris Usability Considerations:
2411            – Wearing colored contacts may affect the iris recognition accuracy.
2412            – Users who have had eye surgery may need to re-enroll post-surgery.
2413            – Differences in environmental lighting conditions can affect iris recognition
2414              accuracy, especially for certain iris colors.
2415   Intermittent Events
2416   As biometrics are only permitted as a second factor for multi-factor authentication,
2417   usability considerations for intermittent events with the primary factor still apply.
2418   Intermittent events with biometrics use include, but are not limited to, the following,
2419   which may affect recognition accuracy:
2420       • If users injure their enrolled finger(s), fingerprint recognition may not work.
2421         Fingerprint authentication will be difficult for users with degraded fingerprints.
2422       • The time elapsed between the time of facial recognition for authentication and
2423         the time of the initial enrollment can affect recognition accuracy as a user’s face
2424         changes naturally over time. A user’s weight change may also be a factor.
2425       • Iris recognition may not work for people who had eye surgery, unless they re-enroll.
2426   Across all biometric modalities, usability considerations for intermittent events include:
2427       • An alternative authentication method must be available and functioning. In
2428         cases where biometrics do not work, allow users to use a memorized secret as an
2429         alternative second factor.
2430       • Provisions for technical assistance:
2431            – Clearly communicate information on how and where to acquire technical
2432              assistance. For example, provide users information such as a link to an
2433              online self-service feature and a phone number for help desk support. Ideally,
2434              provide sufficient information to enable users to recover from intermittent
2435              events on their own without outside intervention.
2436            – Inform users of factors that may affect the sensitivity of the biometric sensor
2437              (e.g., cleanliness of the sensor).
