servation between individuals within a specifc population or group. When there is high
variability, DNA sequences and SNPs can be used to match an individual with a historical
sample that has been analyzed and entered into a dataset. The inheritability of genetic in-
formation has also allowed researchers to determine the surnames and even the complete
identities of some individuals [74].
As the number of individuals who have their DNA and SNPs measured increases, scientists
are realizing that the characteristics of DNA and SNPs in individuals may be more com-
plicated than the preceding paragraphs imply. DNA changes as individuals age because of
senescence, transcription errors, and mutation. DNA methylation, which can impact the
functioning of DNA, also changes over time [19]. Individuals who are made up of DNA
from multiple individuals – typically the result of the fusion of twins in early pregnancy
– are known as chimera or mosaic. In 2015, a man in the United States failed a paternity
test because the genes in his saliva were different from those in his sperm [87]. A hu-
man chimera was identifed in 1953 because the person’s blood contained a mixture of two
blood types: A and O [48]. The incidence of human chimeras is unknown.
Because of the high variability inherent in DNA, complete DNA sequences may be iden-
tifable by linking with an external dataset. Likewise, biological samples for which DNA
can be extracted may be identifable. Subsections of an individual’s DNA sequence and
collections of highly variable SNPs may be identifable unless it is known that there are
many individuals who share the region of DNA or those SNPs. Furthermore, genetic infor-
mation may not only identify an individual but could also identify an individual’s ancestors,
siblings, and descendants. It is also possible to identify certain diseases and whether an in-
dividual is at risk for certain hereditary conditions. For example, the presence of the HER2
gene code is a marker for breast cancer risk.

4.3.7.     De-Identifying Text Narratives and Qualitative Information
Researchers must devote specifc attention when they de-identify text narratives and other
kinds of qualitative information. Many approaches developed in the 1980s and 1990s that
provided reasonable privacy assurances at the time may no longer provide adequate protec-
tion in an era with high-quality internet search and social media [126, 127, 125]. This is an
area of active research.

4.3.8.     Challenges Posed by Aggregation Techniques
Aggregation does not necessarily provide privacy protection, especially when data are pre-
sented in multiple data releases.

4.3.8.1.    Example

Consider a hypothetical example of a school that reports on its website the number of
students performing below, at, and above grade level at the start of the school year (Table 1).
