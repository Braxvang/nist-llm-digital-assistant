5.3.7. Additional Security Considerations for IIoT
The introduction of IIoT to OT environments can increase connectivity and information
exchanges with enterprise systems and cloud-based systems, which may require additional
considerations for the security architecture. For example, the introduction of IIoT devices in OT
environments may require altering boundaries or exposing more interfaces and services.
Additionally, the security capabilities of IIoT devices may need to be considered when
developing the security architecture.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations may need to consider the impacts of supporting IIoT on
            policy management, enforcement, and governance. Additionally, the
            integration of IIoT into OT environments may require a tighter
            collaboration between IT and OT security teams to manage the security
            operations. For example, real-time situational awareness should be
            shared between IT and OT security teams.

5.3.7.1.       Application and Infrastructure
Organizations should consider the IIoT data flow use cases, including those that share data
externally, to determine whether additional access control mechanisms are necessary.
Organizations should also consider that the attack vectors for IIoT may be different from those
managed for OT environments (e.g., due to increased communications requirements or the use of
additional services, such as cloud systems, to support operational requirements).
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should consider the following endpoint security
            capabilities of the IIoT devices being deployed:
                   •   Endpoint tamper resistance capabilities
                   •   Endpoint root of trust
                   •   Endpoint identity
                   •   Endpoint access control
                   •   Endpoint integrity protection
                   •   Endpoint data protection
                   •   Endpoint monitoring and analysis
                   •   Endpoint configuration and management
                   •   Cryptographic techniques
                   •   Capability to harden endpoints
