      NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                      Cloud Computing Forensic
      February 2023                                                                      Reference Architecture

685       3. Question 3 (Q3-a and Q3-b) – These questions relate only to the capabilities and not the
686          challenges. The purpose of these questions is to determine whether the capability deals
687          primarily with technical or non-technical issues.
688   Questions 2 and 3 ask about the issues that a challenge or capability deals with, which are
689   determined as follows. As discussed in Section 2, the NCC FSWG labeled each of the 62
690   challenges according to the following nine categories: architecture, data collection, analysis, anti-
691   forensics, incident first responders, role management, legal, standards, and training. The labels
692   for each challenge may be found in [1], Annex A, Table 2, in the columns labeled “Primary
693   Category” and “Related Category.” These categories and the challenge descriptions are used to
694   determine the type of issue each challenge deals with. If the primary issues are standards, legal
695   issues, contracts, service-level agreements, jurisdiction issues, privacy, ethical issues, training,
696   qualification, or certification, then the challenge is considered non-technical. Otherwise, it is
697   considered technical.
698   Similarly, if a capability deals primarily with standards, legal issues, contracts, service level
699   agreements, jurisdiction issues, privacy, ethical issues, training, qualification, or certification,
700   then the capability is considered non-technical. Otherwise, it is considered technical.
701   The NCC FSWG developed consensus answers for all of the questions related to Question 2 and
702   Question 3 in the flowchart. Therefore, when a particular challenge and capability pair was
703   considered, all questions – except for Question 1 – were already answered. This resulted in much
704   more consistent mappings across all challenges and capabilities.
705   When traversing the flowchart starting at the box labeled “Q2-a,” if a NO node is not reached,
706   then the box labeled “Q1” is eventually reached. For any challenge and capability pair, it may lie
707   in one of two groups when Q1 is reached (see Figure 2). As discussed above, Group 1 is the
708   “Technical Group,” and Group 2 is the “Non-technical Group.” They are defined as follows:

709   •   Group 1 (Technical Group) –

       [The challenge is technical, OR the
                                                         AND      [The functional capability is technical.]
       challenge is non-technical but requires
       technology (at least partially) to overcome
       the challenge.]
710

711   •   Group 2 (Non-Technical Group) –
712
       [The challenge is non-technical, OR the
       challenge is technical but requires non-                   [The functional capability is non-
       technical solutions (at least partially) to       AND
                                                                 technical.]
       overcome the challenge.]

713
714   The reason for these groups – to map technical challenges to technical capabilities and non-
715   technical challenges to non-technical capabilities – was explained above. Once a challenge and
716   capability pair is assigned to the appropriate group, the question of whether overcoming the
