                                                              GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



Completed                                              Action
            Reconfigure HTTP service banner (and others as required) NOT to report Web server
            and OS type and version
            Configure OS and Web server access controls
            Configure the Web server process to run as a user with a strictly limited set of privileges
            Configure the Web server so that Web content files can be read but not written by
            service processes
            Configure the Web server so that service processes cannot write to the directories
            where public Web content is stored
            Configure the Web server so that only processes authorized for Web server
            administration can write Web content files
            Configure the host OS so that the Web server can write log files but not read them
            Configure the host OS so that temporary files created by the Web server application are
            restricted to a specified and appropriately protected subdirectory
            Configure the host OS so that access to any temporary files created by the Web server
            application is limited to the service processes that created the files
            Install Web content on a different hard drive or logical partition than the OS and Web
            server application
            If uploads are allowed to the Web server, configure it so that a limit is placed on the
            amount of hard drive space that is dedicated for this purpose; uploads should be placed
            on a separate partition
            Ensure that log files are stored in a location that is sized appropriately; log files should
            be placed on a separate partition
            Configure the maximum number of Web server processes and/or network connections
            that the Web server should allow
            Ensure that any virtualized guest OSs follow this checklist
            Ensure users and administrators are able to change passwords
            Disable users after a specified period of inactivity
            Ensure each user and administrator has a unique ID
            Configure a secure Web content directory
            Dedicate a single hard drive or logical partition for Web content and establish related
            subdirectories exclusively for Web server content files, including graphics but excluding
            scripts and other programs
            Define a single directory exclusively for all external scripts or programs executed as
            part of Web server content (e.g., CGI, ASP)
            Disable the execution of scripts that are not exclusively under the control of
            administrative accounts. This action is accomplished by creating and controlling
            access to a separate directory intended to contain authorized scripts
            Disable the use of hard or symbolic links (e.g., shortcuts for Windows)
            Define a complete Web content access matrix. Identify which folders and files within
            the Web server document should be restricted and which should be accessible (and by
            whom)
            Check the organizationâ€™s password policy and set account passwords appropriately
            (e.g., length, complexity)
            Use the robots.txt file, if appropriate
            Configure anti-spambot protection, if appropriate (e.g., CAPTCHAs, nofollow, or
            keyword filtering)
