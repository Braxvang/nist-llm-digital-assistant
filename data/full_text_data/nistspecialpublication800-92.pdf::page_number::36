GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



reduction by disregarding those data fields that are not significant to computer security, potentially
reducing the SIEM software’s network bandwidth and data storage usage.

Regardless of how it receives log data (through agents or an agentless method), an SIEM server analyzes
the data from all the different log sources, correlates events among the log entries, identifies and
prioritizes significant events,37 and initiates responses to events if desired. SIEM products usually include
several features to help log monitoring staff, such as the following:

       Graphical user interfaces (GUI) that are specifically designed to assist analysts in identifying
        potential problems and reviewing all available data related to each problem
       A security knowledge base, with information on known vulnerabilities, the likely meaning of
        certain log messages, and other technical data; log analysts can often customize the knowledge
        base as needed
       Incident tracking and reporting capabilities, sometimes with robust workflow features
       Asset information storage and correlation (e.g., giving higher priority to an attack that targets a
        vulnerable OS or a more important host).
There are no standards specific to SIEM, so each SIEM product stores and transmits data in any format it
chooses. However, SIEM products usually offer capabilities to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of log data. For example, network communications between agents and the SIEM servers
typically occur over the reliable TCP protocol and are encrypted. Also, agents and SIEM servers may
need to provide credentials to each other and be authenticated successfully before they can transfer data
(e.g., agent sending logs to server, server reconfiguring agent).

3.5     Additional Types of Log Management Software

Other types of software may also be helpful for log management, including the following:

       Host-Based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). A host-based IDS monitors the characteristics
        of a single host and the events occurring within the host for suspicious activity. Many host-based
        IDS products monitor hosts’ OS, security software, and application logs. Some host-based IDS
        products use logs as only one of several sources of data in detecting suspicious activity, while
        other host-based IDS products monitor logs only. Generally, a host-based IDS that uses log data
        has signatures for known malicious activity that it matches against log entries to identify events
        of interest. However, such products often focus on the OS logs and the most common security
        software and applications, and offer little or no support for less common software.
       Visualization Tools. A visualization tool presents security event data in a graphical format. For
        example, a tool could display data grouped or sorted by the values of different event
        characteristics, such as source address. An analyst can then look for patterns in the display and
        manipulate it, such as suppressing known benign activity so that only unknown events are shown.
        Visualization tools can be very effective for analyzing certain types of log data, such as showing
        the sequence of events that occurred in an attack involving several hosts. Many SIEM products
        have built-in visualization tools. Third-party tools can also be added to log management
        infrastructures that lack them, but they may be more challenging to use than built-in tools.
        Importing data into a third-party tool and displaying it is usually relatively straightforward, but

      Some SIEM products can prioritize events based on correlating events with other sources of information, such as the result
      of vulnerability scans.
