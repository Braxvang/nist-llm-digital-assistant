agency level, several committees evaluate IT portfolios from the operating units as
referenced in Figure 5-3, culminating in a review by the IRB. The IRB then decides
on an agency-level IT portfolio and forwards recommendations to the agency head
for review. Once the agency-level IT portfolio is approved by the agency head, the
necessary Exhibit 300s and Exhibit 53 are forwarded to OMB for funding
consideration.
    Many different stakeholders, from information security, capital planning, and
executive leadership areas, have key roles and make decisions on integrating
information security into the CPIC process with the ultimate goal of forming a well-
balanced IT portfolio. Involvement at the enterprise and operating-unit levels
throughout the process allows agencies to ensure that CPIC and information security
goals and objectives are met. Figure 5-4 identifies typical leading, supporting, or
approving roles for each stakeholder as they apply to the integration of security into
the CPIC process phases.

5.4 Identify Baseline
    The first step in integrating information security and the CPIC process is to
assess the security baseline. The security baseline provides a snapshot of the
agency’s compliance with baseline security requirements (BLSRs) and is instrumental
in identifying information security strengths and weaknesses. The result of a
security baseline analysis enables agency executives to evaluate their information
security posture and identify areas for improvement. Agencies can identify their
baselines for enterprise-level and system-level investments. System-level
investments are those security investments designed to strengthen a discrete
system’s security posture, such as strengthening password controls or testing a
contingency plan for a particular system. Enterprise-level investments are those
security investments that are ubiquitous across the agency and will improve the
overall agency’s security posture, such as the acquisition of an enterprise-wide
firewall or intrusion detection system (IDS).
