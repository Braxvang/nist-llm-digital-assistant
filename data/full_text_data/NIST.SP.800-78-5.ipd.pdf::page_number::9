      NIST SP 800-78-5 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                Cryptographic Algorithms
      September 2023                                                                and Key Sizes for PIV



175       Introduction
176   Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) mandated the creation of new standards
177   for interoperable identity credentials for physical and logical access to Federal Government
178   locations and systems. Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201), Personal
179   Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors, was developed to establish
180   standards for identity credentials [FIPS201]. This document, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-
181   78-5, specifies the cryptographic algorithms and key sizes for PIV systems and is a companion
182   document to FIPS 201-3.

183           Purpose
184   FIPS 201-3 defines the requirements for PIV life cycle activities, including identity proofing,
185   registration, PIV Card issuance, and PIV Card usage. FIPS 201-3 also defines the structure of an
186   identity credential that includes cryptographic keys. This document contains the technical
187   specifications needed for the mandatory and optional cryptographic keys specified in FIPS 201-
188   3, as well as the supporting infrastructure specified in FIPS 201-3 and the related NIST SP 800-
189   73, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification [SP800-73], and SP 800-76, Biometric
190   Specifications for Personal Identity Verification [SP800-76], which rely on cryptographic
191   functions.

192           Scope
193   The scope of this Recommendation encompasses the PIV Card, infrastructure components that
194   support issuance and management of the PIV Card, and applications that rely on the credentials
195   supported by the PIV Card to provide security services. This Recommendation identifies
196   acceptable symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms, digital signature algorithms, key
197   establishment schemes, and message digest algorithms and specifies mechanisms to identify the
198   algorithms associated with PIV keys or digital signatures.
199   Algorithms and key sizes have been selected for consistency with applicable federal standards
200   and to ensure adequate cryptographic strength for PIV applications.

201           Audience and Assumptions
202   This document is intended for federal agencies and implementers of PIV systems. Readers are
203   assumed to have a working knowledge of cryptography and public key infrastructure (PKI)
204   technology.

205           Document Overview
206   The document is organized as follows:
207       â€¢   Section 1, Introduction, provides the purpose, scope, audience, and assumptions of the
208           document and outlines its structure.
