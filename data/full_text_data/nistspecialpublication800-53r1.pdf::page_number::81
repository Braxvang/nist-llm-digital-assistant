Special Publication 800-53, Revision 1              Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
________________________________________________________________________________________________

CA-5      PLAN OF ACTION AND MILESTONES

          Control: The organization develops and updates [Assignment: organization-defined frequency], a
          plan of action and milestones for the information system that documents the organizationâ€™s
          planned, implemented, and evaluated remedial actions to correct deficiencies noted during the
          assessment of the security controls and to reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities in the system.
          Supplemental Guidance: The plan of action and milestones is a key document in the security
          accreditation package developed for the authorizing official and is subject to federal reporting
          requirements established by OMB. The plan of action and milestones updates are based on the
          findings from security control assessments, security impact analyses, and continuous monitoring
          activities. OMB FISMA reporting guidance contains instructions regarding organizational plans
          of action and milestones. NIST Special Publication 800-37 provides guidance on the security
          certification and accreditation of information systems. NIST Special Publication 800-30 provides
          guidance on risk mitigation.
          Control Enhancements: None.

CA-6      SECURITY ACCREDITATION

          Control: The organization authorizes (i.e., accredits) the information system for processing before
          operations and updates the authorization [Assignment: organization-defined frequency, at least
          every three years] or when there is a significant change to the system. A senior organizational
          official signs and approves the security accreditation.
          Supplemental Guidance: OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, establishes policy for security
          accreditations of federal information systems. The organization assesses the security controls
          employed within the information system before and in support of the security accreditation.
          Security assessments conducted in support of security accreditations are called security
          certifications. The security accreditation of an information system is not a static process. Through
          the employment of a comprehensive continuous monitoring process (the fourth and final phase of
          the certification and accreditation process), the critical information contained in the accreditation
          package (i.e., the system security plan, the security assessment report, and the plan of action and
          milestones) is updated on an ongoing basis providing the authorizing official and the information
          system owner with an up-to-date status of the security state of the information system. To reduce
          the administrative burden of the three-year reaccreditation process, the authorizing official uses
          the results of the ongoing continuous monitoring process to the maximum extent possible as the
          basis for rendering a reaccreditation decision. NIST Special Publication 800-37 provides guidance
          on the security certification and accreditation of information systems. Related security controls:
          CA-2, CA-4, CA-7.
          Control Enhancements: None.
