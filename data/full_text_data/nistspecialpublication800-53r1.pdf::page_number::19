chain exchanges. The growing dependence on external service providers and new relationships
being forged with those providers present new and difficult challenges for the organization,
especially in the area of information system security. These challenges include, but are not
limited to: (i) defining the types of external services provided to the organization; 24 (ii) describing
how the external services are protected in accordance with the security requirements of the
organization; and (iii) obtaining the necessary assurances that the risk to the organization’s
operations and assets, and to individuals, arising from the use of the external services is at an
acceptable level.

The assurance or confidence that the risk to the organization’s operations, assets, and individuals
is at an acceptable level depends on the trust 25 that the authorizing official places in the external
service provider. In some cases, the level of trust is based on the amount of direct control the
authorizing official is able to exert on the external service provider with regard to the
employment of appropriate security controls necessary for the protection of the service and the
evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of those controls. The level of control is usually
established by the terms and conditions of the contract or service-level agreement with the
external service provider and can range from extensive (e.g., negotiating a contract or agreement
that specifies detailed security control requirements for the provider 26 ) to very limited (e.g., using
a contract or service-level agreement to obtain commodity services 27 such as commercial
telecommunications services). In other cases, the level of trust is derived from other factors that
convince the authorizing official that the requisite security controls have been employed and that
a credible determination of control effectiveness exists. For example, a separately accredited
external information system service provided to a federal agency through a line of business
relationship may provide a degree of trust in the external service within the tolerable risk range of
the authorizing official.



24
   Information exchanges may be required among the many possible relationships with external service providers. The
risk of exchanging information among business partners and other external entities must be assessed and appropriate
security controls employed. There may be contract language that establishes specific requirements to protect
information exchanged and/or that specifies particular remedies for failure to protect the information as prescribed. In
addition, there may be laws or regulations that protect this information from unauthorized disclosure.
25
  The level of trust that an organization places in an external service provider can vary widely ranging from those who
are highly trusted (e.g., business partners in a joint venture that share a common business model and common goals) to
those who are less trusted and represent greater sources of risk (e.g., business partners in one endeavor who are also
competitors in another market sector).
26
  In reality, the provision of services by providers external to the organization may result in some services without
explicit agreements between the organization and the external entities responsible for the services. Whenever explicit
agreements are feasible and practical (e.g., through contracts, service-level agreements, etc.), the organization should
develop such agreements and require the use of the security controls in Special Publication 800-53. When the
organization is not in a position to require explicit agreements with external service providers (e.g., when the service is
imposed on the organization or when the service is commodity service), the organization should establish explicit
assumptions about the service capabilities with regard to security. Contracts between the organization and external
service providers may also require the active participation of the organization. For example, the organization may be
required by the contract to install public key encryption-enabled client software recommended by the service provider.
27
  Normally, commercial providers of commodity-type services (e.g., telecommunications services) organize their
business models and services around the concept of shared resources and devices for a broad and diverse customer
base. Therefore, unless organizations obtain fully dedicated services from commercial service providers (including
dedicated devices and management systems), there will likely be a need for greater reliance on compensating security
controls to provide the necessary protections for the information system that relies on those external services. The
organization’s risk assessment and risk mitigation activities should reflect this situation.
