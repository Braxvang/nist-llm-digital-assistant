operational technology
A broad range of programmable systems and devices that interact with the physical environment or manage devices
that interact with the physical environment. These systems and devices detect or cause a direct change through the
monitoring and/or control of devices, processes, and events. Examples include industrial control systems, building
automation systems, transportation systems, physical access control systems, physical environment monitoring
systems, and physical environment measurement systems.

password
A string of characters (letters, numbers, and other symbols) used to authenticate an identity or to verify access
authorization. [FIPS140-2]

phishing
Tricking individuals into disclosing sensitive personal information by claiming to be a trustworthy entity in an
electronic communication (e.g., internet web sites).

plant
The physical elements necessary to support the physical process. This can include many of the static components not
controlled by the ICS. However, the operation of the ICS may impact the adequacy, strength, and durability of the
plantâ€™s components.

port
The entry or exit point from a computer for connecting communications or peripheral devices.

port scanning
Using a program to remotely determine which ports on a system are open (e.g., whether systems allow connections
through those ports).

predisposing condition
A condition that exists within an organization, a mission/business process, enterprise architecture, or information
system including its environment of operation, which contributes to (i.e., increases or decreases) the likelihood that
one or more threat events, once initiated, will result in undesirable consequences or adverse impact to organizational
operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation. [SP800-30r1]

pressure regulator
A device used to control the pressure of a gas or liquid. [IR6859]

pressure sensor
A sensor system that produces an electrical signal related to the pressure acting on it by its surrounding medium.
Pressure sensors can also use differential pressure to obtain level and flow measurements. [IR6859] (adapted)

printer
A device that converts digital data to human-readable text on a paper medium. [IR6859] (adapted)

process controller
A type of computer system, typically rack-mounted, that processes sensor input, executes control algorithms, and
computes actuator outputs. [IR6859] (adapted)

programmable logic controller
A solid-state control system that has a user-programmable memory for storing instructions for the purpose of
implementing specific functions such as I/O control, logic, timing, counting, three mode (PID) control,
communication, arithmetic, and data and file processing. [ISADICT]

protocol
A set of rules (i.e., formats and procedures) to implement and control some type of association (e.g.,
communication) between systems. [RFC4949]

protocol analyzer
A device or software application that enables the user to analyze the performance of network data so as to ensure
that the network and its associated hardware/software are operating within network specifications. [ISADICT]
