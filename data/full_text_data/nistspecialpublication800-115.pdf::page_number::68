                                              TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



2.3.    Test Site

Identifies the location or locations from which testing is authorized. If testing will occur on the
organization’s site, building and equipment access should be discussed. Physical access should cover
requirements such as badges, escorts, and security personnel that the testers may encounter. Equipment
access should address areas such as level of access (user or administrator) to the systems and/or network,
and physical access to computer rooms or specific racks that these rooms contain. Areas to which the test
team will not be given access should be identified here as well.

If testing will be conducted from a remote location such as a rented server farm or test lab, details of the
test site architecture should be included in this section.

2.4.    Test Equipment

Identifies equipment that the test team will use to conduct the information security tests. This section
should also identify the method of differentiating between the organization’s systems and the systems
conducting the testing—for example, if the test team’s systems are identified by MAC, keeping track of
test systems could be handled through use of network discovery software. In addition to hardware, tools
authorized for use on the network should be identified. It would also be appropriate to include a write-up
of each tool in an appendix.

3.      Communication Strategy

3.1.    General Communication

Discusses frequency and methods of communication. For example, identify meeting schedule, locations,
and conference call information if appropriate.

3.2.    Incident Handling and Response

This section is critical in the event that an incident occurs on the network while testing is in progress.
Criteria for halting the information security testing should be provided, as should details on the test
team’s course of action in the event that a test procedure negatively impacts the network or an adversary
attacks the organization while testing is underway. The organization’s incident response call tree/chain of
command should be provided in a quick-reference format. A process for reinstating the test team and
resuming testing should also be provided.

4.      Target System/Network

Identifies the systems and/or networks to be tested throughout the information security testing process.
Information should include authorized and unauthorized IP addresses or other distinguishing identifiers, if
appropriate, for the systems (servers, workstations, firewalls, routers, etc.), operating systems, and any
applications to be tested. It is also crucial to identify any system not authorized for testing—this is
referred to as the “exclude list.”

5.      Testing Execution

This section is specific to test type and scope, but should detail allowable and unallowable activities and
include a description of the information security testing methodology. If necessary, an assessment plan
should be developed that complements the ROE—this could be either an appendix or a separate
document.
