GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



    ! Analysts should have a forensic toolkit for data examination and analysis. The toolkit should
      contain various tools that provide the ability to perform quick reviews of data as well as in-depth

      removable media (e.g., floppy disk, CD) or a forensic workstation.
