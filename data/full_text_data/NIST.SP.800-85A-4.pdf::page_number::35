NIST SP 800-85A-4                                                PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                          INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES


Note: This assertion is not separately tested as it is being deprecated.

AS02.03: For all data objects present on the card, the object identifiers (OIDs) used by PIV
Middleware to refer to them, and associated BER-TLV tags used by PIV Card Application
command interface shall conform to the entries in Table 3, Part 1 of SP 800-73-4.

Required Vendor Information

VE02.03.01: The vendor shall state in its documentation the list of all the data objects present on
the card along with the BER-TLV tags associated with them.

VE02.03.01A: The vendor shall state in its documentation the list of all OIDs used by the PIV
Middleware to refer to PIV data objects and the associated BER-TLV tags to which they refer.

Required Test Procedures

TE02.03.01: The tester shall validate that the BER-TLV tags of all the data objects present on the
card conform to the Table 3, Part 1 of SP 800-73-4, and accurately represent the actual data objects
observed by the tester as being implemented on the card.

TE02.03.01A: The tester shall validate that all of the OIDs in Table 3, Part 1 of SP 800-73-4 can be
used to read PIV data objects from a PIV Card using the pivGetData function.

A.3        Data Types and Their Representations

A.3.1      PIV Algorithm Identifier

AS03.01: The algorithm identifiers for the cryptographic algorithms implemented on the
card shall conform to entries in Table 6-2 of SP 800-78-4.

Required Vendor Information

VE03.01.01: The vendor shall state in its documentation the identifiers associated with all the
algorithms supported by the card.

Required Test Procedures

TE03.01.01: The tester shall review the vendorâ€™s documentation and validate the algorithm
identifiers implemented on the card as being compliant with Tables 6-2 and 6-3 of SP 800-78-4.

A.3.2      Application Property Template

AS03.02: Upon selection, the PIV Card Application shall return the application property
template described in Table 3, Part 2 of SP 800-73-4.
