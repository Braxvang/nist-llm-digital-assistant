          trends with respect to project objectives.

PA-3      CONTROL THE PROJECT
          PA-3.1 Initiate the actions needed to address identified security issues.
          PA-3.2 Initiate the necessary security aspects of project replanning.
          Note: Replanning is initiated when the security aspects of project objectives or constraints have
          changed or when security-relevant planning assumptions are shown to be invalid.
          PA-3.3 Initiate necessary change actions when there is a contractual change to cost, time, or
                 quality due to the security impact of an acquirer or supplier request.
          Note: The security impact is not necessarily obvious when the request is not security-driven or
          security-oriented.
          PA-3.4 Recommend that the project proceed toward the next milestone or event, if justified,
                 based on the achievement of security-relevant milestones or event criteria.

I.3.        Decision Management
The purpose of the Decision Management process is to provide a structured, analytical
framework for objectively identifying, characterizing, and evaluating a set of alternatives for a
decision at any point in the life cycle and select the most beneficial course of action.

I.3.1. Security Purpose
-      Identify, analyze, characterize, and evaluate the security aspects of alternatives for a decision.
-      Recommend the most beneficial course of security-informed action.

I.3.2. Security Outcomes
-      Security aspects of decisions requiring alternative analysis are identified.
-      Security aspects of alternative courses of action are identified and evaluated.
-      A preferred security-informed course of action is selected.
-      Security aspects of a resolution, the decision rationale, and the assumptions are identified.

I.3.3. Security Activities and Tasks
DM-1 PREPARE FOR DECISIONS
          DM-1.1 Define the security aspects of the decision management strategy.
