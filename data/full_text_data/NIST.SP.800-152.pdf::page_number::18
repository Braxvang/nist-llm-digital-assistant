SP 800-152                                                                 A Profile for U.S. Federal CKMS


The current minimum security strength recommended for Federal applications is 112 bits;
this minimum has been required for the protection of Low impact-level information and
allows the use of a range of algorithms and key lengths commonly in use that provide at least
112 bit of security, including three-key Triple DEA for encryption and 2048-bit RSA.

For Moderate impact-level information, at least128 bits of security is required, which allows,
for example, the use of AES-128 for encryption and 3072-bit Diffie-Hellman for key
establishment.

While 128 bits of security might also be currently acceptable for most High-level
information, it is anticipated that future technology (e.g., quantum computers) will
necessitate a higher level of protection for High-impact level information (either 192 or 256
bits of security). This Recommendation requires at least 192 bits of security for the
protection of High-impact information in order to align with [Suite B].

    2.3   Keys, Metadata, Trusted Associations, and Bindings

Cryptographic keys are used when applying cryptographic protection to information 2 or
processing already-protected information3. All keys require integrity protection that should
be verified before a key is used. Secret and private keys also require confidentiality
protection. Before a key is used, the source of the key should be authenticated.

Information about a cryptographic key that specifies its characteristics, acceptable uses, and
applicable parameters must be associated with the key. This information is called the keyâ€™s
metadata, and each descriptive item is called a metadata element. A key and its metadata

2
  For example, encrypting plaintext information to protect its confidentiality, or signing the information to
protect its integrity and verify its source.
3
  For example, decrypting ciphertext to obtain the original plaintext, or verifying a signature to assure its
continued integrity.
