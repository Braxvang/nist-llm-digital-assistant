       INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING MATRIX                               — Cell     1


 Training Area: Laws & Regulations
 Functional Specialty: Implement & Operate

 Definition   —        Federal government-wide and organization-specific published documents
                       (laws, regulations, policies, guidelines, standards, and codes of conduct)
                       governing mandated requirements and standards for the management and
                       protection of information technology resources.

 Behavioral Outcome         —   Individuals responsible for the technical implementation and daily
                                operations of an automated information system are able to
                                understand IT security laws and regulations in sufficient detail to
                                ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place and enforced.

 Knowledge Levels         —
 1.   Beginning — Know,       Identify, Apply
 2.   Intermediate —    Investigate, Interpret, Decide, Analyze
 3.   Advanced —      Evaluate, Decide, Approve

 Sample Learning Objectives          —
 At the conclusion of this module, individuals will be able to:

 1.    Beginning   — Recognize     a potential security violation and take appropriate action to report
       the incident as required by Federal regulation and mitigate any adverse impact (e.g., block
       access to a communications port which has been subject to multiple invalid log-on
       attempts during non-duty hours).


 2.    Intermediate   —   Investigate a potential security violation to determine if the organization's
       policy has been breached and assess the impact of the breach (e.g., review audit trails to
       determine if inappropriate access has occurred).


 3.    Advanced    — Determine whether      a security breach is indicative of a violation of law that
       requires specific legal action (e.g., unauthorized access and alteration of data) and forward
       evidence to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for investigation.
