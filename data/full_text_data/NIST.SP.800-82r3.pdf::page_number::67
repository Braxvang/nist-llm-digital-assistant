NIST SP 800-82r3                                                Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

To support the risk assessment process, organizations should also define how the likelihood of
occurrence for cybersecurity events will be determined to maintain consistency when assessing
risks. NIST SP 800-30, Rev. 1 [SP800-30r1] provides guidance for organizations to develop
likelihood weighted risk factors. Organizations should consider weighting risk factors based on
an analysis of the probability that a given threat is capable of exploiting a given vulnerability (or
set of vulnerabilities), that the threat event will be initiated, and that the threat event will result in
adverse impacts.
For adversarial threats, an assessment of likelihood of occurrence is typically based on adversary
intent, capability, and targeting. For other-than-adversarial threat events, the likelihood of
occurrence is estimated using historical evidence, empirical data, and other factors. If
organizations find that there is minimal organizational historical data, they may want to consider
extending their analysis to consider industry-specific data describes cybersecurity events
reported for similar organizations.
The likelihood of threat occurrence can also be based on the state of the organization (e.g., its
core mission and business processes, enterprise architecture, information security architecture,
information systems, and the environments in which those systems operate) and consider
predisposing conditions and the presence and effectiveness of deployed security controls to
protect against unauthorized or undesirable behavior, detect and limit damage, and/or other
resiliency factors for the OT capabilities.
             OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
             Organizations that establish definitions for event likelihood may want to
             review Appendix G of NIST SP 800-30, Rev. 1 for more detailed
             guidance and suggestions. Based on this guidance, organizations should
             consider defining five levels of likelihood from Very Low to Very High
             based on both adversarial (i.e., intentional threat actors) and non-
             adversarial (e.g., errors, accidents, acts of nature, etc.) events.
             Additionally, organizations may want to establish definitions for the
             likelihood that an event may result in an adverse impact. Using these two
             factors, organizations can establish a heat map like the one depicted in
             Table 4 to determine the likelihood factor for supporting the risk
             analysis.
