                                                     TECHNICAL GUIDE TO INFORMATION SECURITY TESTING AND ASSESSMENT



techniques. This may be an acceptable approach if the assessment is small in scope (e.g., only uses one
tool). For more in-depth assessments, larger organizations, or assessments that use multiple tools or
approaches, a more robust and collaborative storage method—such as a spreadsheet or database—can be
developed. Although functionality is limited, a spreadsheet may be appropriate for individual
examinations or tests, as it is easy to use, usually quick to develop, and can accommodate a number of
tools that can output findings in a compatible format. For complex examinations or tests with multiple
technical approaches, assessment actions that regularly recur, or situations with a need to correlate data
easily, developing a database may be beneficial.

Organizations should ensure the secure storage of all sensitive assessment data, such as the assessment
plan or ROE, raw vulnerability data, and assessment reports. In the hands of an adversary, information
regarding network architecture, system configuration, security controls, and specific system
vulnerabilities would provide a blueprint and roadmap for exploiting the organization’s information
systems. Organizations may choose to store this data on removable media, or on an information system
that could be accessed as needed. The removable media or system designed to store this information
should be isolated physically or logically from day-to-day network resources. Access to this system and
the information it contains should be limited to those individuals whose access is needed to fulfill roles
and responsibilities. This data is also recommended to be encrypted in compliance with FIPS 140-2 to
ensure that it remains secure.

Retention requirements for security assessments data vary and may not be explicitly stated for an
organization, in which case retention requirements for the assessment should be specified in the
assessment plan or ROE. Maintaining accurate records for an assessment provides an organization with
an audit trail of its vulnerabilities and the remediation actions it has taken to mitigate identified risks. An
audit trail maintained over time may allow organizations to evaluate the effectiveness of their information
security program by conducting trend analyses of metrics involving vulnerability type, frequency of
occurrence, mean time to remediation, etc.

Assessment systems—such as servers, laptops, or other mobile devices—should not be left unattended
when storing sensitive data without the proper physical and logical security safeguards in place. For
example, mobile systems should not be left in unlocked vehicles or in plain sight in locked vehicles, and
mobile devices in hotel rooms should be secured by a cable lock, stored in a room safe, or physically
secured by other means. In addition to these physical safeguards, assessors should ensure that the system
is configured in a way that deters adversaries from compromising it. Assessors should take appropriate
measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data a system contains, and protect the system at a
minimum with a strong password—and it is suggested that organizations consider using two-factor
authentication. 33 In addition, all sensitive data on the system should be encrypted, 34 and an authentication
mechanism separate from the system authentication should be used to restrict access to the encrypted
information.

7.4.3    Data Transmission

It may be necessary to transmit assessment data, such as system configurations and vulnerabilities, over
the network or Internet, and it is important to ensure the security of the data being transmitted to protect it
from compromise. The assessment plan or ROE should address the requirements of, and process for,
transmitting sensitive system information across the network or Internet. Secure data transmission
methods include encrypting individual files containing sensitive information, encrypting communication

33
     Two-factor authentication provides additional security by requiring two of the following three factors—something you know
     (e.g., password), something you have (e.g., security token), and something you are (e.g., retinal scan).
34
     Such data should be encrypted in compliance with FIPS 140-2 to ensure that it remains secure.
