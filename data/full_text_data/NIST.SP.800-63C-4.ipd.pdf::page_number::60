1595   7.    Assertion Presentation
1596   This section is normative.
1597   Depending on the specifics of the protocol, the RP and the IdP communicate with each
1598   other in two ways, which lends to two different ways in which an assertion can be passed
1599   from the IdP to the RP:
1600         • The front channel, through redirects involving the subscriber and the subscriber’s
1601           browser; or
1602         • The back channel, through a direct connection between the RP and IdP, not
1603           involving the subscriber directly.
1604   There are tradeoffs with each model, but each requires the proper validation of the
1605   assertion. Assertions MAY also be proxied to facilitate federation between IdPs and
1606   RPs using different presentation methods, as discussed in detail in Sec. 5.1.3.

1607   7.1. Back-Channel Presentation
1608   In the back-channel presentation model, the subscriber is given an assertion reference
1609   to present to the RP, generally through the front channel. The assertion reference itself
1610   contains no information about the subscriber and SHALL be resistant to tampering and
1611   fabrication by an attacker. The RP presents the assertion reference to the IdP, usually
1612   along with authentication of the RP itself, to fetch the assertion.
1613   As shown in Figure 12, the back-channel presentation model consists of three steps:
1614        1. The IdP sends an assertion reference to the subscriber through the front channel.
1615        2. The subscriber sends the assertion reference to the RP through the front channel.
1616        3. The RP presents the assertion reference and its RP credentials to the IdP through
1617           the back channel. The IdP validates the credentials and returns the assertion.
1618   The assertion reference:
1619        1. SHALL be limited to use by a single RP.
1620        2. SHALL be single-use.
1621        3. SHALL be time limited, and SHOULD have a lifetime of no more than a small
1622           number of minutes in length.
1623        4. SHALL be presented along with authentication of the RP to the IdP.
1624        5. SHALL contain at least 128 bits of entropy.
