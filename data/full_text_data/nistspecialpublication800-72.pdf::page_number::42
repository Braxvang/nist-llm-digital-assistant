radio transmission and reception and should be used where appropriate with PDAs having
wireless capabilities. An independent external power charger may be connected and placed in
the bag with the device to keep the power level full during transit. The device may also be
packaged to allow a power adaptor to be connected to the device through a hole in the bag, as a
means for keeping the power level high. Lithium-ion devices can usually be powered through
a compatible cigarette-lighter cable to keep charge to the device while in transit. If a cable is
used with a radio frequency isolation bag, the cable must be properly shielded to prevent it
from serving as an antenna and nullifying the effect of the isolation bag.

Digital devices are fragile and easily damaged. When a device is transported, it should be
handled carefully and adequately protected from shock, breakage, and extreme temperature.
Due to the volatile state of PDAs, they should immediately be checked into a forensic
laboratory to be processed and the evidence custodian be made aware of the situation
regarding power requirements. Battery powered devices held in storage for more than a few
days risk power depletion and data loss, unless a process is in place to avoid this outcome.

Storage facilities that hold evidence should provide a cool, dry environment appropriate for
valuable electronic equipment. All evidence should be in sealed containers, in a secure area
with controlled access.
