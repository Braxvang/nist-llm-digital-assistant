MA-3      MAINTENANCE TOOLS

          Control: The organization approves, controls, and monitors the use of information system
          maintenance tools and maintains the tools on an ongoing basis.
          Supplemental Guidance: The intent of this control is to address hardware and software brought into
          the information system specifically for diagnostic/repair actions (e.g., a hardware or software
          packet sniffer that is introduced for the purpose of a particular maintenance activity). Hardware
          and/or software components that may support information system maintenance, yet are a part of
          the system (e.g., the software implementing “ping,” “ls,” “ipconfig,” or the hardware and software
          implementing the monitoring port of an Ethernet switch) are not covered by this control.
          Control Enhancements:
          (1)   The organization inspects all maintenance tools carried into a facility by maintenance personnel
                for obvious improper modifications.

                Enhancement Supplemental Guidance: Maintenance tools include, for example, diagnostic and
                test equipment used to conduct maintenance on the information system.
          (2)   The organization checks all media containing diagnostic and test programs for malicious code
                before the media are used in the information system.
          (3)   The organization checks all maintenance equipment with the capability of retaining information so
                that no organizational information is written on the equipment or the equipment is appropriately
                sanitized before release; if the equipment cannot be sanitized, the equipment remains within the
                facility or is destroyed, unless an appropriate organization official explicitly authorizes an
                exception.
          (4)   The organization employs automated mechanisms to restrict the use of maintenance tools to
                authorized personnel only.
