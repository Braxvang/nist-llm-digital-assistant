Required Vendor Information

VE05.18A-R4.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation that if the key reference is '96' or
'97' and the authentication data in the command data field is not of length 3N, where N satisfies the
requirements for minimum and maximum number of minutiae specified in the BIT, then the card
command fails, the PIV Card Application returns the status word '6A 80', and the security status and
the retry counter of the key reference remain unchanged.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.18A-R4.01: The tester shall validate that the card implements AS05.18A-R4 as specified.

AS05.19: If the key reference is '00', '80', '96', or '97' and the authentication data in the
command data field is properly formatted and does not match reference data associated with
the key reference, then the card command shall fail, the PIV Card Application shall return the
status word '63 CX', the security status of the key reference shall be set to FALSE, and the
retry counter associated with the key reference shall be decremented by one.

Required Vendor Information

VE05.19.01: The vendor shall state in its documentation that the card supports the assertion made in
AS05.19.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.19.01: The tester shall validate that when the VERIFY command fails the retry counter
associated with the key reference is decremented by one.

AS05.20: If the card command succeeds then the security status of the key reference shall be
set to TRUE. If the key reference is '00', '80', '96', or '97' then the retry counter associated
with the key reference shall be set to the reset retry value associated with the key reference.
