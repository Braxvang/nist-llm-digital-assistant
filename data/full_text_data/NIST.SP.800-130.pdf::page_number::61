private keys require confidentiality protection and access control. For confidentiality
protection, either physical security or cryptography is used. A manually distributed key
could be physically protected by a trusted courier, or a physically protected channel could
be used. Very often, the keys are sent electronically over networks that are susceptible to
data eavesdropping and modification. If cryptography is used to protect the
confidentiality of symmetric and private keys during transport, then a key establishment
technique involving either a symmetric key wrapping key or one or more asymmetric
transport key pairs is used. These wrapping and transport keys also should be protected
by the end entities involved in the transport.

All transported keys require integrity protection because a garbled key will not correctly
perform its intended function, and attacker-controlled key garbles could result in spoofing
or cryptanalytic attacks. Thus, detecting garbled keys prior to their use improves the
security and reliability of the system. Physical security can provide integrity protection
for keys, but often other methods are used, due to the lack of physical protection of
electronic data on typical networks. An error detection code can detect an unintentional
garble to a key, and an error correction code can correct certain garbles. However, if a
key could be intentionally garbled, then a cryptographic integrity check, like a MAC or
digital signature, should be used for error detection. If an uncorrectable garble is detected,
a new or corrected key should be established before use. When public keys are contained
within a certificate, they are provided integrity protection by the digital signature on the
certificate.

The receiver of a transported key desires assurance that the key came from the expected
authorized key sender. When transported using automated methods, this assurance is
typically provided by the use of a cryptographic mechanism that authenticates the identity
of the sender to the receiver. When a key is transported manually, this assurance may be
provided by the authentication of the trusted courier who transports the key.

FR: 6.80 The CKMS design shall specify the methods used to protect the confidentiality
of symmetric and private keys during their transport.

FR: 6.81 The CKMS design shall specify the methods used to protect the integrity of
transported keys and how the keys can be reconstructed or replaced after detecting errors.

FR: 6.82 The CKMS design shall specify how the identity of the key sender is
authenticated to the receiver of transported keying material.

6.6.2 Key Agreement
Two entities, working together, can create and agree on a cryptographic key without the
key being transported from one to the other. Each entity supplies some information that is
used to derive a common key, but when secure key agreement schemes are used, an
eavesdropper obtaining this information is not able to determine the agreed-upon key.
Cryptographic algorithms employing key agreement keys are used by each entity.
