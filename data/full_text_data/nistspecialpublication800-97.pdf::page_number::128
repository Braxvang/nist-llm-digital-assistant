ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



not accessing the StateConnect database over the WLAN. The course also provided several tips and
tricks regarding how to protect one’s computer when using non-agency WLANs, such as those found at
home, hotels, and coffee shops. For example, users were instructed to verify that their personal firewall
software was running and their antivirus and anti-spyware software was up-to-date whenever they used
their computers outside of the office. Without this type of protection, data stored locally on an agency
laptop could be compromised if the laptop were used on an external network. Also, users could
inadvertently download viruses, spyware, and other malware that otherwise would have been blocked by
the agency’s network-based security controls.

9.1.4    Phase 4: Operations/Maintenance

Security was also integrated into regular operations behind the scenes. Personnel in the agency’s
Network Operations Center were trained on how to respond to security alerts issued by the log analysis
tool on the audit server that received data from each of the APs. Also, on a random day of each month, a
technician would walk through the entire building using a laptop-based detection tool to identify
unauthorized wireless services (APs and clients), rogue devices, and interfering devices intruding on the
IEEE 802.11 channels. The agency was considering the procurement of a wireless intrusion detection
system that can identify such devices automatically, but the budget did not allow for such a system in the
initial deployment.

9.1.5    Summary and Evaluation

Six months after the deployment of the WLAN, the project team received a special service award from
the director of the agency. When announcing the award, the director noted the project management
approach to integrating WLANs into the agency’s existing IT services. Stakeholders were involved early
in the process, and the solution was driven by clearly defined policy and functional requirements. The
procurement process led to the selection of appropriate equipment that met all security requirements.
Both users and support staff received relevant training related to the new system. The introduction of the
IEEE 802.11 RSN at agency XYZ was a huge success.

9.2     Case Study 2: Transitioning an Existing WLAN Infrastructure to RSN Technology

A few days after the new CIO arrived at the Bureau of Advanced Research (BAR), she was confronted
with a serious security breach: an intruder had compromised a key database containing confidential
business information, and then posted sensitive records on a Web server in a country that did not
cooperate with U.S. law enforcement. The preliminary investigation traced the attack back to an
unsecured AP that the Special Projects Division had installed for the use of its staff. The AP was placed
next to a window and was clearly visible from the public parking lot below. Apparently an unauthorized
party had exploited WLAN vulnerabilities and gained access to confidential data. In this situation, little
hope existed of finding the perpetrator.

The CIO knew that the bureau’s WLAN infrastructure needed a security upgrade immediately to prevent
further breaches of bureau information systems. She read about IEEE 802.11 RSNs in the trade press and
believed that this could be the solution to the bureau’s problem. One of her biggest challenges would be
overcoming the fiercely skeptical nature of the bureau’s senior scientists, over whom she had little
authority. Many of them worried that a centralized security solution would compromise their
independence and unnecessarily restrict their scientific pursuits. The CIO had to make the transition as
smooth as possible to avoid criticism that could undermine her future success.
