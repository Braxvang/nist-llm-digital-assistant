NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1                                            Recommendation for Random Number
                                                                   Generation Using Deterministic RBGs




                         Appendix E : (Informative) Revisions
The original version of this Recommendation was completed in June, 2006. In March 2007, the
following changes were made (note that the changes are indicated in italics):
   1. Section 8.3, item 1.a originally stated the following:
           “One or more values that are derived from the seed and become part of the internal
           state; these values must usually remain secret”
        The item now reads:
           “One or more values that are derived from the seed and become part of the internal
           state; these values should remain secret”.
   2. In Section 8.4, the third sentence originally stated:
           “Any security strength may be requested, but the DRBG will only be instantiated to
           one of the four security strengths above, depending on the DRBG implementation.”
        The sentence now reads:
           “Any security strength may be requested (up to a maximum of 256 bits), but the
           DRBG will only be instantiated to one of the four security strengths above, depending
           on the DRBG implementation.”
   3. In Section 8.7.1, the list of examples of information that could appear in a personalization
      string included private keys, PINs and passwords. These items were removed from the
      list, and seedfiles were added.
   4. In Section 10.3.1.4, a step was inserted that will provide backtracking resistance (step 14
      of the pseudocode). The same change was made to the example in Appendix B.5.3 (step
      19.1). In addition, the two occurrences of block_counter (in input 1 and processing step
      1) were corrected to be reseed_counter.
This Recommendation was developed in concert with American National Standard (ANS) X9.82, a
multi-part standard on random number generation. Many of the DRBGs in this Recommendation
and the requirements for using and validating them are also provided in ANS X9.82, Part 3. Other
parts of that Standard discuss entropy sources and RBG construction. During the development of
the latter two documents, the need for additional requirements and capabilities for DRBGs were
identified. As a result, the following changes were made to this Recommendation in August 2008:
   1.    Definitions have been added in Section 4 for the following: approved entropy source,
         DRBG mechanism, fresh entropy, ideal random bitstring, ideal random sequence and
         secure channel. The following definitions have been modified: backtracking resistance,
         deterministic random bit generator (DRBG), entropy, entropy input, entropy source, full
         entropy, min-entropy, prediction resistance, reseed, security strength, seed period and
         source of entropy input.
   2.    In Section 6, a link was provided to examples for the DRBGs specified in this
         Recommendation.
