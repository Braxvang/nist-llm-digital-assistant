NIST SP 800-85A-4                                                PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                          INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

The Derived Test Requirements, and their associated required test procedures, for the
pivMiddlewareVersion client application command have been moved to Appendix A.4.1.3.

A.5         PIV Card Application Card Command Interface

AS05.01: All PIV Card Application card commands listed in Table 2, Part 2 of SP 800-73-4
shall be supported by a PIV Card Application.

Required Vendor Information

VE05.01.01: The vendor shall provide the list of all PIV Card Application card commands, along
with the interface(s) (contact or contactless, SM, VCI) they support, the security condition(s) they
are subject to and their support for command chaining as implemented by the card.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.01.01: The tester shall review the vendor’s documentation and validate that the information
presented in response to VE05.01.01 by the vendor complies with Table 2, Part 2 of SP 800-73-4.

TE05.01.02: The tester shall validate that the card implements all the commands as required in
Table 2, Part 2 of SP 800-73-4.

TE05.01.03: The tester shall validate that the commands are implemented only through the
interfaces allowed as shown in Table 2, Part 2 of SP 800-73-4.

TE05.01.04: The tester shall validate that the commands are performed only if the security
conditions associated with them are satisfied, as shown in the table, via the specified interface.

TE05.01.05: The tester shall validate that the commands as indicated in the table are allowed for
chaining via the interface supported after the security condition is satisfied.

AS05.02: Card commands indicated with a 'Yes' in the Command Chaining column of Table
2, Part 2 of SP 800-73-4 shall support command chaining for transmitting a data string too
long for a single command as defined in ISO/IEC 7816-4 [6].

Note: This assertion is tested as part of AS05.01.

AS05.03: The PIV Card Application shall return the status word of '6A 81' (Function not
supported) when it receives a card command on the contactless interface marked “No” in the
Contactless Interface column in Table 2, Part 2 of SP 800-73-4. The PIV Card Application may
return a different status word (e.g., '69 82') if the card command can be performed over the
contactless interface in support of card management. The PIV Card Application will only
perform the command in support of card management if the requirements specified in Section
2.9.2 of FIPS 201-2 are satisfied.

Note: This assertion is tested as part of AS05.01.
