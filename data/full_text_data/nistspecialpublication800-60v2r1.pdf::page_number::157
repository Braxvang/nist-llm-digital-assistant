Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of agricultural
innovation and service information on the ability of responsible agencies to create and
disseminate of better methods for farming and the development of better and healthier crops. In
most cases, unauthorized disclosure of agricultural innovation and service information will have
only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In some cases, unauthorized
disclosure of preliminary findings or policies under consideration regarding proposed
agricultural products may result in domestic or international public relations problems for the
Federal government. In such cases, serious damage can result for agricultural innovation and
service operations. Here, the confidentiality impact level may be moderate.

In other cases, unauthorized disclosure of information regarding creation, storage, and
transportation of dangerous plant disease vectors, animal disease vectors, pesticides, and
herbicides might facilitate malicious activities by terrorists or other criminals. Here, there is a
potential for loss of human life, so the confidentiality impact level may be high.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most agricultural innovation and service information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Agricultural
innovation and service activities are not generally time-critical. In most cases, the adverse
effects of unauthorized modification to or destruction of agricultural innovation and service
information on agency mission functions and public confidence in the agency can be expected to
be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
agricultural innovation and service information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to agricultural innovation and service
information. Loan assistance processes are generally tolerant of delay. In most cases,
disruption of access to agricultural innovation and service information can be expected to
have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
agricultural innovation and service information is low.
