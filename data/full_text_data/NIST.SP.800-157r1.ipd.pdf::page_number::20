      NIST SP 800-157r1 ipd                            Derived PIV Credentials (Initial Public Draft)
      January 2023


521   Updating a separate memorized secret used with a single-factor authenticator for use
522   at AAL2 SHALL be performed in a mutually authenticated protected session with the
523   home agency. The update SHALL require the entry of the current memorized secret
524   used for activation. If resetting the memorized secret is required because the subscriber
525   has forgotten the memorized secret or has reached the retry limit, it SHALL be done in
526   accordance with Sec. 3.2.3.

527   2.4. Invalidation
528   When an authenticator associated with a derived PIV credential is compromised (e.g.,
529   lost, stolen, or damaged), that derived PIV credential SHALL be invalidated as described
530   below.
531   All derived PIV credentials associated with a given PIV Card SHALL be invalidated
532   when the associated PIV identity account is terminated, typically due to the cardholder’s
533   loss of PIV Card eligibility. Issuers of derived PIV credentials SHALL continuously
534   monitor the associated PIV identity account to determine its termination status. Meeting
535   this requirement is simplified because the subject’s PIV Card, cardholder eligibility, and
536   all derived PIV credentials are maintained in one account — the PIV identity account —
537   and maintained by the home agency.
538   The issuer of the derived PIV credential SHALL NOT solely rely on tracking the
539   revocation status of the PIV authentication certificate as a means of tracking the
540   termination status of the PIV Card. This is because there are situations in which the PIV
541   authentication certificate is not revoked even though the PIV Card has been terminated
542   and subsequently replaced with a new card. This may happen, for example, when a
543   terminated PIV Card is collected and either zeroized or destroyed by an agency. In this
544   case and in accordance with [FIPS201], the corresponding PIV authentication certificate
545   does not need to be revoked.

546   2.4.1. PKI-based Derived PIV Credential Invalidation
547   If the derived PIV authentication private key was created and stored on a hardware
548   module that does not permit export of the private key and the token is collected and
549   either zeroized or destroyed, then the derived PIV authentication certificate SHOULD be
550   revoked. In all other cases, the derived PIV authentication certificate SHALL be revoked.

551   2.4.2. Non-PKI-based Derived PIV Credential Invalidation
552   Non-PKI-based derived PIV credentials are always directly verified by the home agency
553   of the associated PIV Card. Therefore, termination of a non-PKI-based derived PIV
554   credential SHALL be accomplished by invalidating the reference to the associated
555   authenticator in the PIV identity account so that the authenticator cannot be used to
556   authenticate to the home agency. Separate hardware-based authenticators MAY be
557   collected from the subscriber, but this is not required.
