       OT-Based Systems and Their Interdependencies
OT is used in many industries and infrastructures, including those identified by the Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) as critical infrastructure sectors listed below. OT can
be found in all critical infrastructures and is more prevalent in the sectors that are in bold.
   •   Chemical Sector
   •   Commercial Facilities Sector
   •   Communications Sector
   •   Critical Manufacturing Sector
   •   Dams Sector
   •   Defense Industrial Base Sector
   •   Emergency Services Sector
   •   Energy Sector
   •   Financial Services Sector
   •   Food and Agriculture Sector
   •   Government Facilities Sector
   •   Healthcare and Public Health Sector
   •   Information Technology Sector
   •   Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste Sector
   •   Transportation Systems Sector
   •   Water and Wastewater Systems Sector
OT is vital to the operation of U.S. critical infrastructures, which are often highly interconnected
and mutually dependent systems, both physically and through a host of information and
communications technologies. It is important to note that while federal agencies operate many of
the critical infrastructures mentioned above, many others are privately owned and operated.
Additionally, critical infrastructures are often referred to as a “system of systems” because of the
interdependencies that exist between various industrial sectors and the interconnections between
business partners [Peerenboom][Rinaldi]. An incident in one infrastructure can directly and
indirectly affect other infrastructures through cascading and escalating failures.
For example, both the electrical power transmission and distribution grid industries use
geographically distributed SCADA control technology to operate highly interconnected and
dynamic systems that consist of thousands of public and private utilities and rural cooperatives
for supplying electricity to end users. Some SCADA systems monitor and control electricity
distribution by collecting data from and issuing commands to geographically remote field control
stations from a centralized location. SCADA systems are also used to monitor and control water,
oil, and natural gas distribution, including pipelines, ships, trucks, rail systems, and wastewater
collection systems.
