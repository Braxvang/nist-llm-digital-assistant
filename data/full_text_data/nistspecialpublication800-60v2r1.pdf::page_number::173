Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of homeownership promotion
information would have, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
individuals. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external
communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public
confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended most
homeownership promotion information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to homeownership promotion
information. The effects of disruption of access to most homeownership promotion information
or information systems would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets,
or individuals.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
homeownership promotion information is low.

D.10.2 Community and Regional Development Information Type

The Community and Regional Development mission involves activities designed to assist
communities in preventing and eliminating blight and deterioration, assist economically
distressed communities, and encourage and foster economic development through improved
public facilities and resources. The recommended provisional categorization of the community
and regional development information type follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of community and
regional development information on the ability of responsible agencies to assist communities in
preventing and eliminating blight and deterioration, assist economically distressed communities,
and encourage and foster economic development through improved public facilities and
resources. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most community and regional
development information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Exceptions that might have a
potential for more serious consequences are based on privacy information processed in training
and employment systems (e.g., information required by the Privacy Act of 1974 or other statutes
and executive orders to receive special handling to protect the privacy of individuals). The
Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and
