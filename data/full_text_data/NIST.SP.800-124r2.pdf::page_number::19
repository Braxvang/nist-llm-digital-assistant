       Threats to the Mobile Enterprise
Mobile devices support a series of security objectives, but these can differ based on the
organization. These mobile security objectives can be accomplished via a combination of
security features built into, installed onto, or managed externally to mobile devices. Achieving an
organization’s security objectives often requires devices to be secured against a variety of
threats. General security recommendations for any IT technology are provided in NIST SP 800-
53, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations [1]. Specific
recommendations for securing mobile devices are presented in Section 4.3 of this publication and
are intended to complement the controls specified in SP 800-53. See a summary of SP 800-53
controls tailored to mobile enterprise security that can be found in the following publications:
   •   NIST SP 1800-21, Mobile Device Security: Corporate-Owned Personally-Enabled
       (COPE) [49, p.147]
   •   NIST SP 1800-22, Mobile Device Security: Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) [50,
       p.101]
Before designing and deploying mobile device solutions, organizations should develop threat
models for all facets of mobile device usage. Threat modeling involves identifying resources of
interest and the feasible threats, vulnerabilities, and security controls related to these resources;
quantifying the likelihood and impacts of successful attacks; and analyzing this information to
determine where security controls should be improved or added. Threat modeling helps
organizations identify security requirements and design the mobile device solution that
incorporates the controls needed to meet the security requirements. The threat landscape evolves
continually, and organizations can use threat intelligence to inform an updated risk assessment
and security controls. The NIST Mobile Threat Catalogue [5] – a threat modeling process such as
draft NIST SP 800-154, Guide to Data-Centric System Threat Modeling [47] – and the DHS
Study on Mobile Device Security [23] can be used as a foundation for beginning threat modeling
activities. The threats listed in the following sections are mapped to the corresponding threats
from the NIST Mobile Threat Catalogue document.

       Threats to Enterprise Use of Mobile Devices
The following threats are related to the general use of mobile devices.

3.1.1. Exploitation of Underlying Vulnerabilities in Devices
Software development is a complex discipline that creates the instruction set that powers mobile
devices and apps. In the case of typical software, errors and vulnerabilities exist at an estimated
frequency of ~25 errors per 1000 lines of code [32]. There are many definitions for
vulnerabilities, but this report leverages the following definition [1]: “Weakness in an
information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could
be exploited or triggered by a threat source.” Software vulnerabilities exist at all levels of the
mobile device stack. Due to the nature of how mobile devices are developed and manufactured,
multiple organizations will contribute software and firmware to the same device. The
contributing organizations may or may not have robust software development practices and
processes in place. A vulnerability in the code from any of these vendors could potentially
