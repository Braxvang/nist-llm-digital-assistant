2735   A.5. Summary
2736   Length and complexity requirements beyond those recommended here significantly
2737   increase the difficulty of memorized secrets and increase user frustration. As a
2738   result, users often work around these restrictions in a way that is counterproductive.
2739   Furthermore, other mitigations such as blocklists, secure hashed storage, and rate limiting
2740   are more effective at preventing modern brute-force attacks. Therefore, no additional
2741   complexity requirements are imposed.
