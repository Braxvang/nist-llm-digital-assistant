                                                                                  NIST Special Publication 800-35



    aspects of the plan. Results of the testing exercise would be documented in the contingency plan and
    discussed with management. The results will determine the effectiveness of the contingency
    procedures and present any flaws. Staff must be trained in their contingency-related duties so that
    when an unexpected event interrupts operations, recovery will be easier and people will know what to
    expect.

 Execute—the responsibility for the execution phase of contingency planning lies with the
  organization, but service providers may support certain aspects of the execution phase. For example,
  an organization may outsource data recovery because service providers can provide hot or mobile
  sites for system and data recovery. They may provide periodic training to organization personnel on
  the plan and their roles in the plan.
5.2.2   Incident Handling

An IT security incident is an adverse event in a computer system or network caused by the failure of a
security mechanism or an attempted or threatened breach of these mechanisms. An incident-handling
capability can provide the ability to react quickly and efficiently to disruptions in normal processing.
Effective incident handling can be achieved by developing and instituting effective processes and
procedures for the six phases of incident response: preparation, identification, containment, eradication,
recovery, and follow-up. The incident handling process should be consistent and compatible with any
forensic services that the organization may require to ensure that critical evidence is handled properly.

Incident-Handling Services

Incident-handling capability should be available 24 hours per day, 7 days a week. A service provider may
be able to provide one or a combination of the services listed below.

Incident-handling services may include the following:

 Developing the incident handling program
 Developing and maintaining system configuration profiles
 Providing forensics capabilities
 Testing and updating incident handling procedures
 Managing and executing the incident handling procedures
Incident-handling procedural services may include the following:

 Isolation of affected systems and platforms
 Triage
 Report assessment (interpret log files, prioritize, and analyze)
 Identification/Verification (determine nature and scope of incident)
   Categorization (determine sensitivity of compromised information, system, and incident)
 Internal and external coordination (notify and coordinate with appropriate internal and external
  parties on a need-to-know basis)
 Resolution
