 Federation             Threat Mitigation Mechanisms                         Normative
 Threat/Attack                                                               Reference(s)
 Assertion              Cryptographically sign the assertion at IdP and      4.1, 6
 Manufacture or         verify at RP
 Modification
                        Send assertion over an authenticated protected       7.1, 7.2
                        channel authenticating the IdP
                        Include a non-guessable random identifier in the     6.2.1
                        assertion
 Assertion              Send assertion over an authenticated protected       7.1, 7.2
 Disclosure             channel authenticating the RP
                        Encrypt assertion for a specific RP (may be          6.2.3
                        accomplished by use of a mutually authenticated
                        protected channel)
 Assertion              Cryptographically sign the assertion at the IdP      6.2.2
 Repudiation by         with a key that supports non-repudiation; verify
 the IdP                signature at RP
 Assertion              Issue assertions with bound authenticators; proof    6.1.2
 Repudiation by         of possession of bound authenticator verifies
 the Subscriber         subscriber’s participation to the RP
 Assertion              Include identity of the RP (“audience”) for which    6, 7.1, 7.2
 Redirect               the assertion is issued in its signed content; RP
                        verifies that they are intended recipient
 Assertion Reuse        Include an issuance timestamp with short validity    6, 7.1, 7.2
                        period in the signed content of the assertion; RP
                        verifies validity
                        RP keeps track of assertions consumed within a       6.2.1
                        configurable time window to ensure that a given
                        assertion is not used more than once.
 Assertion              Ensure that assertions contain a reference to the    6
 Substitution           assertion request or some other nonce that was
                        cryptographically bound to the request by the RP
                        Send assertions in the same authenticated            7.1
                        protected channel as the request, such as in the
                        back-channel model
