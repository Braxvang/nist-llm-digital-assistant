                Assessment
                Determine that:
                   (i) The EIMO and issuing facility managers are aware of
                       the minimum set of physical controls that need to be
                       in place at the facility (interview).
                  (ii) The minimum physical security controls are
                       implemented by the issuing facility (observe).
                 (iii) The facility has a process to report any problems with
                       the station to the issuer (review).
   FP(DC)-2     Issuer documentation (e.g., operations plan, standard                     DPCI         Commonly accepted security
                operating procedures, contracts, etc.) are maintained for                              readiness measures

                      are available for reference as needed (review,

                  (ii) The operations staff are knowledgeable about how to
                       restore/reconstitute information systems in case of
                       system failures (interview).
   FP(DC)-4     The intent of this control is covered by DP(DC)-1.                 -                   -
   FP(DC)-5     For in-person authenticator issuance and maintenance using                DPCI         Commonly accepted security
                stations, ensure that the stations are situated in an enclosed                         readiness measures
                area (e.g., wall or partition) to provide privacy for the

                Determine that:
                  (i) Issuing facility stations are situated in an enclosed
                      area (e.g., wall or partition) such that unauthorized
                      individuals cannot see applicant information
                      (observe).
   FP(DC)-6     This control is withdrawn since M-11-11 has been rescinded. -                          -
