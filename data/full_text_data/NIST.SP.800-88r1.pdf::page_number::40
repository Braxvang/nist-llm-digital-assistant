NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                             Guidelines for Media Sanitization


   Purge:          Degauss in an organizationally approved degausser rated at a minimum for the media.

   Destroy:        Incinerate disks and diskettes by burning in a licensed incinerator or Shred.


   Notes:          Degaussing magnetic disks typically renders the disk permanently unusable.

   Reel and Cassette Format Magnetic Tapes

   Clear:          Re-record (overwrite) all data on the tape using an organizationally approved pattern, using a
                   system with similar characteristics to the one that originally recorded the data. For example,
                   overwrite previously recorded sensitive VHS format video signals on a comparable VHS format
                   recorder. All portions of the magnetic tape should be overwritten one time with known non-
                   sensitive signals. Clearing a magnetic tape by re-recording (overwriting) may be impractical for
                   most applications since the process occupies the tape transport for excessive time periods.

   Purge:          Degauss the magnetic tape in an organizationally approved degausser rated at a minimum for
                   the media.

   Destroy:        Incinerate by burning the tapes in a licensed incinerator or Shred.


   Notes:          Preparatory steps for Destruction, such as removing the tape from the reel or cassette prior to
                   Destruction, are unnecessary. However, segregation of components (tape and reels or
                   cassettes) may be necessary to comply with the requirements of a Destruction facility or for
                   recycling measures.

   ATA Hard Disk Drives This includes PATA, SATA, eSATA, etc

   Clear:          Overwrite media by using organizationally approved and validated overwriting
                   technologies/methods/tools. The Clear pattern should be at least a single write pass with a fixed
                   data value, such as all zeros. Multiple write passes or more complex values may optionally be
                   used.

   Purge:          Four options are available:
                       1. Use one of the ATA Sanitize Device feature set commands, if supported, to perform a
                             Sanitize operation. One or both of the following options may be available:
                                  a. The overwrite EXT command. Apply one write pass of a fixed pattern across
                                       the media surface. Some examples of fixed patterns include all zeros or a
                                       pseudorandom pattern. A single write pass should suffice to Purge the
                                       media.
                                       Optionally: Instead of one write pass, use three total write passes of a
                                       pseudorandom pattern, leveraging the invert option so that the second write
                                       pass is the inverted version of the pattern specified.
                                  b. If the device supports encryption and the technical specifications described in
                                       this document have been satisfied, the Cryptographic Erase (also known as
                                       CRYPTO SCRAMBLE EXT) command.
                                       Optionally: After Cryptographic Erase is successfully applied to a device, use
                                       the overwrite command (if supported) to write one pass of zeros or a
                                       pseudorandom pattern across the media. If the overwrite command is not
                                       supported, the Secure Erase or the Clear procedure could alternatively be
                                       applied following Cryptographic Erase.
                       2. Use the ATA Security feature setâ€™s SECURE ERASE UNIT command, if support, in
                             Enhanced Erase mode. The ATA Sanitize Device feature set commands are preferred
                             over the over the ATA Security feature set SECURITY ERASE UNIT command when
                             supported by the ATA device.
                       3. Cryptographic Erase through the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) Opal Security
                             Subsystem Class (SSC) or Enterprise SSC interface by issuing commands as
