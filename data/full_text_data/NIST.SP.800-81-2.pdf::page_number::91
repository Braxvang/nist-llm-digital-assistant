10.       Guidelines for Minimizing Information Exposure Through DNS Data Content
          Control

The DNS security extensions provide only origin authentication and data integrity protection. This
protection does not provide confidentiality because of the design decision to keep DNS data public.
Features such as split DNS provide some means of keeping internal network information from appearing
on the global Internet, but they are not official parts of the DNS protocol specification.

It is possible that an attacker may learn valuable information about an organization’s network through
DNS and use that information to launch an attack. For some elements, such as IP addresses of public
servers, this possibility is unavoidable. There are steps a DNS administrator can take in generating a zone
file to keep network exposure to a minimum, however; these steps are given below. This process should
be done prior to signing a zone. Network information that should be kept absolutely private should not be
published in DNS at all.

10.1 Choosing Parameter Values in SOA RR

The first action a DNS administrator should undertake is to ensure that the values in the SOA resource
record data are correct. The values in this RR regulate the communication between primary and secondary
servers for the zone, such as when secondary servers should periodically perform zone transfers from the
primary server. This data also contains the minimum TTL value field, which gives client resolvers an
indication of how long to cache non-DNSSEC negative responses. Some suggested values for these fields
are as follows [RFC1912]:

      •    Serial Number. The serial number in the SOA RDATA is used to indicate to secondary name
           servers that a change to the zone has occurred and a zone transfer should be performed. It should
           always be increased whenever a change is made to the zone data.

      •    Refresh Value. The refresh value tells the secondary servers how many seconds to wait between
           zone transfers. For zones that are updated frequently, this number should be small (20 minutes to
           2 hours). For zones that are updated infrequently, a larger number can be substituted (2 to 12
           hours). For a signed zone, this value should not be more than the length of the RRSIG validity
           period, to ensure that secondary zones do not contain zones with expired RRSIGs. This value also
           may depend on bandwidth constraints on the primary server side. Note that if a primary server
           issues a NOTIFY message when it is updated, a secondary server will immediately perform a
           zone transfer and not wait until the refresh value has timed out.

      •    Retry Value. The retry value is the period a secondary server should wait before attempting to
           perform a zone transfer if the previous attempt failed. This value should be a fraction of the
           refresh value. If using a Refresh value in the range given above, the possible range of values for
           this field would be 5 minutes to 1 hour.

      •    Expire Value. The expire value is the length of time a secondary server should consider the zone
           information valid if it can no longer reach the primary server to refresh. This field allows
           secondary servers to continue to operate until network disruptions are resolved. This value
           depends on the frequency of changes to the zone and the reliability of the connection between
           name servers. It should be a multiple of the refresh value and possibly set to as long as 2 to 4
           weeks.
