•   Trustworthiness – No exploitable vulnerabilities exist, either of malicious or unintentional
    origin

•   Predictable Execution – Justifiable confidence that software, when executed, functions as
    intended.”
There are several automation specifications that can assist with continuous monitoring of
software assurance, including the emerging Software Assurance Automation Protocol (SwAAP)
that is being developed to measure and enumerate software weaknesses and assurance cases.
SwAAP uses a variety of automation specifications such as the Common Weakness Enumeration
(CWE), which is a dictionary of weaknesses that can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities (i.e.,
CVEs) and the Common Weakness Scoring System (CWSS) for assigning risk scores to
weaknesses. SwAAP also uses the Common Attack Pattern Enumeration & Classification
(CAPEC), which is a publicly available catalog of attack patterns with a comprehensive schema
and classification taxonomy, to provide descriptions of common methods for exploiting software
and the Malware Attribute Enumeration & Characterization (MAEC), which provides a
standardized language for encoding and communicating information about malware based upon
attributes such as behaviors, artifacts, and attack patterns.

There are a number of software assurance tools and technologies that are now incorporating many
of these automation specifications to provide software security throughout the software
development life cycle. The implementation and effective use of software assurance technologies
can assist organizations in automating the implementation, assessment, and continuous
monitoring of several NIST SP 800-53 security controls including CA-7, Continuous Monitoring;
SA-4, Acquisitions; SA-8, Security Engineering Principles; SA-11, Developer Security Testing;
SA-12, Supply Chain Protection; SA-13, Trustworthiness; SA-14, Critical Information System
Components; and SI-13, Predictable Failure Prevention.

D.2 TECHNOLOGIES FOR AGGREGATION AND ANALYS IS
Aggregation and analysis technologies are those that have the capability to collect raw data from
one or more security controls or other direct data gathering technologies and correlate, analyze,
and represent the raw data in a way that provides a more meaningful perspective on the
effectiveness of security control implementation across part or all of an organization than would
data from any single technology.

This section discusses common types of aggregation and analysis technologies and their role in
supporting an ISCM capability. They include SIEM and management dashboards.

D.2.1 SECURITY INFORMATION AND EVENT MANAGEMENT (SIEM)
To enhance the ability to identify inappropriate or unusual activity, organizations may integrate
the analysis of vulnerability scanning information, performance data, network monitoring, and
system audit record (log) information through the use of SIEM tools. SIEM tools are a type of
centralized logging software that can facilitate aggregation and consolidation of logs from
multiple information system components. SIEM tools can also facilitate audit record correlation
and analysis. The correlation of audit record information with vulnerability scanning information
is important in determining the veracity of the vulnerability scans and correlating attack detection
events with scanning results.
