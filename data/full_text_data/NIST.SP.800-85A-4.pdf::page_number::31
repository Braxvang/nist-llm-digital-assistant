A.1.3.2      Security Status

AS01.12: Associated with each authenticable entity shall be a set of one or more Boolean
variables, each called a security status indicator of the authenticable entity.

Note: The security status indicators are tested indirectly through the functional testing.

AS01.13: The security status indicator of an authenticable entity shall be TRUE if the
credentials associated with the security status indicator of the authenticable entity have been
authenticated and FALSE otherwise.

Note: The security status indicators are tested indirectly through the functional testing.

AS01.14: A successful execution of an authentication protocol shall set the security status
indicator associated with the credential used in the protocol to TRUE.

Note: The security status indicators are tested indirectly through the functional testing.

AS01.14A-R4: An aborted or failed execution of an authentication protocol shall set the
security status indicator associated with the credential used in the protocol to FALSE.

Note: The security status indicators are tested indirectly through the functional testing.

AS01.15: A security status indicator shall be said to be a global security status indicator if it is
not changed when the currently selected application changes from one application to another.
In essence, when changing from one application to another, the global security status
indicators shall remain unchanged.

Note: This assertion is not separately tested.

AS01.16: A security status indicator is said to be an application security status indicator if it is
set to FALSE when the currently selected application changes from one application to another.

Required Vendor Information

VE01.16.01: The vendor shall specify in its documentation that the application security status
indicators are set to FALSE when the currently selected application changes from one application to
another.

Required Test Procedures

TE01.16.01: The tester shall review the vendorâ€™s documentation and validate that it contains the
requirement stated in VE01.16.01.

AS01.16A-R4: The security status indicators associated with the PIV Card Application PIN,
the PIN Unblocking Key (PUK), OCC, pairing code, and the PIV Card Application
