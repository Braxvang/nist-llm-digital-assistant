NIST SP 800-82r3                                           Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            For example, the threat of an internet-connected system being scanned
            would have a high likelihood and a low severity consequence, but the
            threat of a nation-state actor disrupting a supply chain may have low
            likelihood and high severity consequences.
            Since security countermeasures are typically developed for IT
            environments, organizations should consider how deploying security
            technologies into OT environments may negatively impact operations or
            safety.

       Special Areas for Consideration
Supply chain risk management and risk management for safety are critical aspects of OT
cybersecurity risk management.

4.2.1. Supply Chain Risk Management
Cybersecurity risks can arise from the products or services acquired to support OT needs. These
risks can be introduced anywhere in the supply chain and at any stage in the life cycle. Whether
they are malicious, natural, or unintentional, these risks have the potential to compromise the
availability and integrity of critical OT systems and components, as well as the availability,
integrity, and confidentiality of the data utilized by the OT, thereby causing harms that range
from minor disruptions to impacts on life and safety.
With few exceptions, organizations that are responsible for OT rely upon suppliers, other third-
party providers, and their extended supply chains for a range of needs. These supply-side
organizations perform critical roles and functions, including manufacturing and provisioning
technology products, providing software upgrades and patches, performing integration services,
or otherwise supporting the day-to-day operations and maintenance of OT systems, components,
and operational environments. For this reason, OT organizations should seek to understand and
mitigate the supply chain-related risks that can be inherited from these supply-side organizations
and the products and services that they provide.
Identifying, assessing, and effectively responding to cybersecurity risks in supply chains is best
accomplished by incorporating cybersecurity supply chain risk management (C-SCRM)
considerations into organizational policies, plans, and practices. This includes extending
cybersecurity expectations and requirements to vendors and gaining better understanding,
visibility, and control over the supply chains that are associated with acquired products and
services. Organizations should vet suppliers and service providers to ascertain their capabilities,
trustworthiness, the adequacy of their internal security practices, the effectiveness of safeguards,
their supply chain relationships, and any risks that may be associated with those relationships
and dependencies. The requirements for and evaluation of products and discrete components
should extend beyond an assessment of whether functional and technical requirements are
satisfied and address applicable C-SCRM factors, such as a productâ€™s provenance, pedigree, and
composition and whether the product is taint-free and authentic. Additionally, special
consideration should be given to how difficult it may be to attain original replacement parts or
updates over the life of the product and how diverse the sources of supply are and may be in the
future.
