                          (ii) The operator advises applicants on the selection of a strong PIN
                               (observe).
                         (iii) The PIN is a minimum of six digits in length (test).


            AI-10      This control has been withdrawn as the PIV background investigation          -
                       indicator extension identified by the id-piv-NACI object identifier is
                       deprecated.
            AI-12      The organization issues electromagnetically opaque holders or other          [FIPS201], Sec. 2.11 – PIV Privacy
                       technology to protect against unauthorized contactless access to             Requirements
                       information stored on a PIV Card.

                       Assessment
                       Determine that:
                         (i) Electromagnetically opaque holders or other technology is provided
                             at the time of PIV Card issuance (review, observe).
            AI-14      If pseudonyms are required to protect an employee or contractor (e.g., from [FIPS201], Sec. 2.8.1 – Special
                       physical harm, severe distress, or harassment), the issuance of a PIV Card Rule for Pseudonyms
                       uses agency-approved pseudonyms and follows normal procedures for PIV
                       Card issuance.

                       Assessment
                       Determine that:
                          (i) The use of a pseudonym is necessary to protect employees or
                              contractors (review).
                         (ii) The organization maintains a list of pseudonyms that have been
                              issued and can link them to the employees or contractors authorized
                              to receive such pseudonyms (review).
                        (iii) Issuance procedures for pseudonyms are consistent with
                              procedures for issuing regular PIV Cards (review, observe).
                        (iv) The use of a pseudonym has been authorized by the organization
                              (review).

            MP-1       A post-issuance update applies to cases where one or more certificates,      [FIPS201], Sec. 2.9.2 – PIV Card
                       keys, biometric data records, or signed data objects are updated. Post-      Post Issuance Update
                       issuance updates do not modify the PIV Card expiration date, FASC-N,         Requirements
                       card UUID, or cardholder UUID.

                       Assessment
                       Determine that:
                          (i) Only certificates, keys, biometric data records, or signed data
                              objects are updated during a post-issuance update (review,
                              interview).
                         (ii) The PIV Card expiration date, FASC-N, card UUID, or cardholder
                              UUID are not modified post-issuance (review, interview).

                       In the case of reissuance and termination, the PIV Card is collected and     Reissuance Requirements
                       destroyed whenever possible. If the PIV Card cannot be collected and
                       destroyed, the CA is informed, and the certificates corresponding to the PIV [FIPS201], Sec. 2.9.4 - PIV Card
