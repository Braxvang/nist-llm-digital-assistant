11.        Conformance to this specification

11.1       Conformance
Conformance to this specification will be achieved if an implementation and its associated data records conform to
normative ("shall") Sections 3 through 10 but not Section 8. The following text summarizes these statements.

11.2       Conformance to PIV registration fingerprint acquisition specifications
Conformance to Section 3.2 requires the use of an [EBTS, Appendix F] certified scanner to collect a full set of
fingerprint images and the application of a segmentation algorithm and the [NFIQ]-based quality assurance
procedure. Images shall be conformant to this specification if:
       ―    The acquisition procedures of Section 3.2 are followed. This may be tested by human observation.
       ―    The images are conformant to [FINGSTD] as profiled by Table 4 and its normative notes.

11.3       Conformance of PIV Card fingerprint template records
Conformance to Section 3.2.2 is achieved by conformance to all the normative content of the Section. This includes
production of records conformant to [MINUSTD] as profiled in Section 3.2.2. Conformance shall be tested by
inspection of the records and performing the test assertions of the "PIV Conformance" column of Table 6.
Performance certification according to Section 4.5.2.1 is necessary.

11.4       Conformance of PIV registration fingerprints retained by agencies
Conformance to Section 3.3 is achieved by conformance to all the normative content of the Section. This includes
production of records conformant to [FINGSTD] as profiled in Section 3.3. Conformance shall be tested by inspection
of the records and performing the test assertions of the "PIV Conformance" column of Table 4. Quality values [NFIQ]
shall be checked against the NIST reference implementation.

11.5       Conformance of PIV background check records
Conformance to Section 3.4 is achieved by conformance to all the normative content of the Section. This necessitates
conformance to the normative requirements of the FBI for background checks. These shall be tested by inspection of
the transactions submitted to the FBI. This inspection may be performed either by capturing the transactions at the
submitting agency or at the FBI.

11.6       Conformance to PIV authentication fingerprint acquisition specifications
Conformance to Section 4.7 shall be achieved if certification according to [SINGFING] is achieved, and if the resolution
and area specifications are met. The [SINGFING] certification process entails inspection of output images.

11.7       Conformance of PIV facial image records
Conformance to Section 7 shall be achieved by conformance to all the normative content of the Section. This includes
production of records conformant to [FACESTD] as profiled in Section 7.2. Conformance shall be tested by inspection
of records and performing the test assertions of the "PIV Conformance" column of Table 12.

11.8       Conformance of CBEFF wrappers
A PIV implementation will be conformant to Section 9 if all biometric data records, whether or not mandated by this
document or [FIPS], are encapsulated in conformant CBEFF records. CBEFF records shall be conformant if:
       ―    The fields of the Table 14 header are present;
       ―    The fields of Table 14 contain the allowed values as governed by its normative notes;
       ―    A digital signature conformant to [800-78] is present;
       ―    The values are consistent with the enclosed biometric data and the trailing digital signature.
An application that tests conformance of PIV biometric data shall be provided with appropriate keys to decrypt and
check the digital signature.
