                                             GUIDE TO STORAGE ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGIES FOR END USER DEVICES



Organizations should use centralized management for all deployments of storage encryption except
for standalone deployments and very small-scale deployments.

Centralized management is recommended for most storage encryption deployments because of its
effectiveness and efficiency for policy verification and enforcement, key management, authenticator
management, data recovery, and other management tasks. Centralized management can also automate
deployment and configuration of storage encryption software to end user devices, distribution and
installation of updates, collection and review of logs, and recovery of information from local failures.

Organizations should ensure that all cryptographic keys used in a storage encryption solution are
secured and managed properly to support the security of the solution.

Storage encryption technologies use one or more cryptographic keys to encrypt and decrypt the data that
they protect. If a key is lost or damaged, it may not be possible to recover the encrypted data from the
computer. Therefore, organizations should perform extensive planning of key management processes,
procedures, and technologies before implementing storage encryption technologies. This planning should
include all aspects of key management, including key generation, use, storage, recovery, and destruction.
Organizations should carefully consider how key management practices can support the recovery of
encrypted data if a key is inadvertently destroyed or otherwise becomes unavailable. Organizations
planning on encrypting removable media also need to consider how changing keys will affect access to
encrypted storage on removable media and develop feasible solutions, such as retaining the previous keys
in case they are needed.

Organizations should select appropriate user authenticators for storage encryption solutions.

Storage encryption solutions require users to authenticate successfully before accessing the information
that has been encrypted. Common authentication mechanisms are passwords, personal identification
numbers, cryptographic tokens, biometrics, and smart cards. Organizations should consider leveraging
existing enterprise authentication solutions (e.g., Active Directory, public key infrastructure [PKI])
instead of adding another authenticator for users. Generally, this is acceptable if two-factor authentication
is being used. Using the same single-factor authenticator for multiple purposes, such as operating system
(OS) authentication and storage encryption authentication, significantly weakens the protection that
authentication provides. For example, an attacker who learns a single password could gain full access to
the device’s information. Organizations should carefully consider the security implications of using the
same single-factor authenticator for multiple purposes. In particular, organizations should not use email
passwords and other passwords sometimes transmitted in plaintext as single-factor authenticators for
storage encryption.

Organizations should implement measures that support and complement storage encryption
implementations for end user devices.

Storage encryption by itself cannot provide adequate security for stored information; additional security
controls are needed. Organizations should select and deploy the necessary controls based on FIPS 199’s
categories for the potential impact of a security breach involving a particular system and NIST Special
Publication 800-53’s recommendations for minimum management, operational, and technical security
controls. Examples of supporting controls are as follows:
