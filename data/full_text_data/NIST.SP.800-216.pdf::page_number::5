Abstract
Receiving reports on suspected security vulnerabilities in information systems is one of the best
ways for developers and services to become aware of issues. Formalizing actions to accept,
assess, and manage vulnerability disclosure reports can help reduce known security
vulnerabilities. This document recommends guidance for establishing a federal vulnerability
disclosure framework, properly handling vulnerability reports, and communicating the mitigation
and/or remediation of vulnerabilities. The framework allows for local resolution support while
providing federal oversight and should be applied to all software, hardware, and digital services
under federal control.

Reports on Computer Systems Technology
The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance
the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in
federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research,
guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities
with industry, government, and academic organizations.
