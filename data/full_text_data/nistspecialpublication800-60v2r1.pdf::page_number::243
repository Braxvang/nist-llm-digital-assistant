Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In a few cases, records associated
with grants may include information subject to privacy restrictions (e.g., the Privacy Act of
1974). The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal
Identity and Authentication information type. In many cases, premature and unauthorized
disclosure can affect the integrity of the grants process, giving an unfair competitive advantage
to one or more applicants. In such cases, punitive consequences and/or loss of public confidence
can have a seriously disruptive effect on an agencyâ€™s operations and mission. In such cases, the
confidentiality impact level would be moderate.

In some cases, federal grants information might be moderate to high impact. Also, details of
programs for which grants are awarded may be sensitive (e.g., research grants for weapons
systems project activities). Some federal grants information and some grant program details may
be classified and outside the scope of this guideline.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for federal grants information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Federal grants
activities are not generally time-critical and multiple individuals in multiple organizations are
usually involved in the grants process. Therefore, the information maintained by all the
individuals/agencies may be necessary to alter a grants decision. In most cases, the adverse
effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of federal grants information on agency
mission functions or public confidence in the agency is limited.

Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: There are significant differences between
the ability to modify a document authorizing a payment and the modification of the payment
itself. The unauthorized modification of a document authorizing a payment is less time critical
than the modification of the payment itself while the payment is in transit. Modifications to
payments in transit will result in immediate inaccurate payments. This can result in assignment
of a moderate impact level to such information.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
federal grants information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to federal grants information. Federal
grants processes are generally tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of access to federal
grants information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
federal grants information is low.
