ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



     The Public Information Resource Center, in which the GRC wanted to offer access to the
      Internet, the GRC electronic docket, and the library holdings database to all visitors.
The security requirements for each of these areas differed from the others. The simplest case was the
commission offices. The requirements there were very similar to those of most other organizations whose
WLANs served employees only; meeting areas such as conference rooms and the cafeteria should support
mobile users, but do so with RSN protections to protect the confidentiality and integrity of GRC
information resources.

The administrative law courts had special requirements, necessitating more rapid access to information.
Court proceedings often took far longer to complete than one would expect. For example, whenever
someone requested information that was not readily available, the lawyers had to request a recess so that a
courier could bring relevant data to the court from wherever it might reside. Determining when to restart
a hearing was itself a challenge; all the parties involved had to submit forms specifying their availability,
which the court’s clerk would use to schedule subsequent appearances.

Allowing authorized individuals access to IT systems from within the hearing rooms could greatly reduce
these delays. Attorneys could quickly search through the court’s archives or evidence information
repository to respond to queries. They could also use VPN technology to access information from
external sources, such as the offices of their law firms. In addition, they could enter their schedules into
the court’s calendaring system, so that when proceedings were stopped, the clerk could immediately
notify all parties when they would resume. This functionality required network support. WLAN
technology could provide that support unobtrusively, while also giving users a degree of mobility within
each room.

One possibility was to permit anyone to use the hearing room WLAN since, for the most part,
proceedings were public. This configuration was rejected for two reasons. First, proceedings were closed
when cases involved sensitive business information, and much of the court’s calendar and its evidence
information repository also were confidential. Second, the judges felt that public visitors to the court
should not be permitted to use the WLAN for anything other than official court business, which would be
difficult to control if they could easily access its network. For these reasons, an RSN solution was
deemed appropriate for the hearing rooms and the commission offices.

The final area in which a WLAN would be deployed is the GRC’s Public Information Resource Center,
which was used by the public, ranging from local university students writing term papers to commission
staff checking records related to regulatory actions. Librarians in the center noted that many visitors to
the center were frustrated by the lack of Internet access. This situation forced them to leave the center to
access information from external resources, sometimes necessitating several trips. A WLAN with
Internet access could solve this problem while also facilitating access to the center’s resources.

The IT security manager was concerned that public users would abuse their free network privileges, either
using them to attack the network or simply dominate the available bandwidth to such an extent that it
would crowd out other legitimate uses of the network. He argued for RSN protections to prevent this
abuse. However, closer examination of the problem revealed that an RSN was unlikely to solve the
potential problems he raised. If members of the public were permitted to use the WLAN on the desired
walk-in basis, they could cause problems regardless if they did so on an open system or one on which
they were given logon credentials to an RSN. Furthermore, because all the center information that would
be accessed is publicly available, confidentiality was not an issue. In the case of the Public Information
Resource Center, an RSN would add administrative complexity with little or no additional security
benefit.
