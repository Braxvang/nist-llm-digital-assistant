NIST SP 800-186                                                 Discrete Logarithm-based Cryptography:
February 2023                                                         Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters

Output: ACCEPT or REJECT Q as a point on Ba,b of order n.

Process:

   1. Perform partial public key validation on Q using the procedure of Appendix D.1.4.1.
      Output REJECT if this procedure outputs REJECT.
   2. Verify that n Q = ∅. Output REJECT if verification fails.
   3. Otherwise, output ACCEPT.

D.2.   Point Compression
Point compression allows for a shorter representation of elliptic curve points in affine
coordinates by exploiting algebraic relationships between the coordinate values based on the
defining equation of the curve in question. Point compression followed by its inverse “point
decompression” is the identity map.

D.2.1. Prime Curves in Short-Weierstrass Form
Point compression for non-binary curves in short-Weierstrass form is defined as follows:
Inputs:
   1. Weierstrass curve Wa,b defined over the prime field GF(p)
   2. Point P on Wa,b

Output: Compressed point P

Process:

   1. If P is the point at infinity ∅, set P = P.
   2. If P = (x, y), set P = (x, y), where y = y mod 2.
   3. Output P.

Point decompression of an object P with respect to this Weierstrass curve is defined as follows:

Inputs:

   1. Object P
   2. Weierstrass curve Wa,b defined over the prime field GF(p)

Output: Point P on Wa,b or INVALID

Process:

   1. If P is the point at infinity ∅, output P = P.
   2. If P is the ordered pair (x, t), where x is an element of GF(p), and t is an element of {0,
      1}:
      2.1 Compute w = x3 + a x + b.
