APPENDIX D

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
KEY PARTICIPANTS IN THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS




T       he following sections describe the roles and responsibilities66 of key participants involved
        in an organizationâ€™s risk management process.67 Recognizing that organizations have
        widely varying missions and organizational structures, there may be differences in naming
conventions for risk management-related roles and how specific responsibilities are allocated
among organizational personnel (e.g., multiple individuals filling a single role or one individual
filling multiple roles).68 However, the basic functions remain the same. The application of the risk
management process across the three risk management tiers described in this publication is
flexible, allowing organizations to effectively accomplish the intent of the specific tasks within
their respective organizational structures to best manage risk.

D.1 HEAD OF AGENCY (CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER)
The head of agency (or chief executive officer) is the highest-level senior official or executive
within an organization with the overall responsibility to provide information security protections
commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm (i.e., impact) to organizational operations and
assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation resulting from unauthorized access, use,
disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of: (i) information collected or maintained by
or on behalf of the agency; and (ii) information systems used or operated by an agency or by a
contractor of an agency or other organization on behalf of an agency. Agency heads are also
responsible for ensuring that: (i) information security management processes are integrated with
strategic and operational planning processes; (ii) senior officials within the organization provide
information security for the information and information systems that support the operations and
assets under their control; and (iii) the organization has trained personnel sufficient to assist in
complying with the information security requirements in related legislation, policies, directives,
instructions, standards, and guidelines. Through the development and implementation of strong
policies, the head of agency establishes the organizational commitment to information security
and the actions required to effectively manage risk and protect the missions/business functions
being carried out by the organization. The head of agency establishes appropriate accountability
for information security and provides active support and oversight of monitoring and
improvement for the information security program. Senior leadership commitment to information
security establishes a level of due diligence within the organization that promotes a climate for
mission and business success.

D.2 RISK EXECUTIVE (FUNCTION)
The risk executive (function) is an individual or group within an organization that provides a more
comprehensive, organization-wide approach to risk management. The risk executive (function)
serves as the common risk management resource for senior leaders/executives, mission/business

66
  The roles and responsibilities described in this appendix are consistent with the roles and responsibilities associated
with the Risk Management Framework in NIST Special Publication 800-37.
67
   Organizations may define other roles (e.g., facilities manager, human resources manager, systems administrator) to
support the risk management process.
68
  Caution is exercised when one individual fills multiples roles in the risk management process to ensure that the
individual retains an appropriate level of independence and remains free from conflicts of interest.
