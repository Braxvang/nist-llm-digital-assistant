NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                           GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


   12. The Cookie extension shall be supported by TLS 1.3 clients.
   13. The Certificate Signature Algorithms Extension shall be supported if the client supports
       TLS 1.3 and should be supported for TLS 1.2.
   14. The Post-handshake Client Authentication extension may be supported if the client
       supports TLS 1.3.

4.4.2.1 Fallback Signaling Cipher Suite Value (SCSV)

Applies to TLS versions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2

The cipher suite value described in Section 3.4.2.1 provides a mechanism to prevent unintended
protocol downgrades in TLS versions prior to TLS 1.3. Clients signal when a connection is a
fallback, and if the server supports a higher TLS version, the server returns a fatal alert. If the
client does not support TLS 1.3 and is attempting to connect with a TLS version prior to TLS
1.2, the client shall include TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV at the end of the cipher suite list in the
ClientHello message.

4.4.2.2 Supported Groups

Applies to TLS versions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3

The Supported Groups extension (supported_groups) is described in Section 3.4.2.2. Client
implementations shall send this extension in TLS 1.3 ClientHello messages and in ClientHello
messages that include ephemeral ECDH cipher suites. When elliptic curve cipher suites are
configured, at least one of the NIST-approved curves, P-256 (secp256r1) and P-384 (secp384r1),
shall be supported as described in RFC 8422 [52]. Additional NIST-recommended elliptic
curves are listed in SP 800-56A, Appendix D [6]. Finite field groups that are approved for TLS
in SP 800-56A, Appendix D may be supported.

4.4.2.3 Key Share

Applies to TLS version 1.3

The Key Share extension is used to send cryptographic parameters. Clients that support TLS 1.3
shall support this extension as described in Section 4.2.7 of RFC 8446 [57].

4.4.2.4 Supported Point Formats

Applies to TLS versions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2

The clients that support EC cipher suites with TLS 1.2 and below shall be capable of specifying
supported point formats in the ClientHello message in accordance with Section 5.1 of [52].
