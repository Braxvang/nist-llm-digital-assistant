The question of when a large-scale quantum computer will be built is a complicated one. In
the past, it was less clear that large quantum computers were a physical possibility, but many
scientists now believe it to be merely a significant engineering challenge. Some engineers even
predict that within the next 20 years, sufficiently large quantum computers will be built to break
essentially all public key schemes currently in use. Historically, it has taken decades to
deploy modern public-key cryptography infrastructures, so efforts to prepare information
security systems that are resistant to quantum computing must begin now.
Motivated by these considerations, NIST is in the process of selecting public-key (quantum-
resistant) cryptographic algorithms through a public, competition-like process. The intent is for
new public-key cryptography standards to specify one or more additional unclassified, publicly
disclosed digital signature, public-key encryption, and key-establishment algorithms that are
available worldwide and capable of protecting sensitive government information well into the
foreseeable future, including after the advent of quantum computers.
In FY 2020, based on public feedback and internal reviews of the candidates, NIST announced
the 15 algorithms that would move into the third round of analysis. NIST mathematicians
and computer scientists consider these algorithms to be the strongest candidates for
standardization. The list includes seven “finalists” for public-key encryption/key-establishment
and digital signature algorithms as well as eight “alternates,” which will likely need another
round of evaluation. (The complete list is available on the NIST website and is described in
NISTIR 8309, Status Report on the Second Round of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography
Standardization Process). At the conclusion of the third round, NIST will select some of the
finalists for standardization.
This accomplishment represents several years of intensive research and industry collaboration.
NIST appreciates all submitters and those providing comments during the evaluation process.
NIST will continue to work with the cryptographic community to analyze the performance of
these algorithms to understand how they will perform in the real world.
Lightweight Cryptography
Many elements of modern technology rely on cryptography to provide confidentiality and to
ensure the integrity of information being exchanged. While many of today’s cryptographic
methods are reliable, they require time and power that many devices (e.g., sensor networks,
healthcare products, distributed control systems, IoT, and cyber-physical systems) may not
have. The small and simple nature of the millions of electronic devices making up the IoT
renders them ill-equipped to process the current cryptographic algorithms. To address this
challenge, NIST has initiated a lightweight cryptography standardization process to
solicit, evaluate, and standardize lightweight cryptographic algorithms that are suitable for
use in constrained environments where the requirements and performance of the
currently approved NIST cryptographic algorithms are not acceptable. In FY 2019, NIST
published a call for algorithms to be considered for lightweight cryptographic standards. NIST
received 57 submissions, 56 of which were accepted for the first round of evaluation. After
four months of evaluation, 32 of the first-round candidates proceeded to the second round of
evaluation.
In FY 2020, NIST continued performing a technical review of the second-round
candidates. This review included the verification of third-party security analysis; software
benchmarking on microcontrollers, determining which candidates perform better than current
NIST standards; and investigating the constraints of a variety of use cases.
