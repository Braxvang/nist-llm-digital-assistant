                                                           CLOUD COMPUTING SYNOPSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



9.3    Security and Reliability

 Consumer-Side Vulnerabilities. Consumers should minimize the potential for web browsers or
  other client devices to be attacked by employing best practices for the security and hardening of
  consumer platforms, and should seek to minimize browser exposure to possibly malicious web sites.
 Encryption. Consumers should require that strong (FIP 140-2 compliant) encryption be used for web
  sessions and other network communication whenever a rented application requires the confidentiality
  of application interactions with other applications or data transfers. Also consumers should require
  that the same diligence is applied to stored data.
 Physical. Consumers should consider physical plant security practices and plans at provider sites as
  part of the overall risk considerations when selecting a provider. Physical attacks require backup
  plans just as cyber attacks do. Consumers should write plans for recovery from such attacks.
  Consumers should also investigate whether a candidate provider offers redundancy for the sites they
  operate, and opt for providers that are not tied to a specific geographic location in case of natural
  disasters or other disruptions.
 Authentication. Consumers should consider the use of authentication tokens or other appropriate
  form of advanced authentication, which some providers offer, to mitigate the risk of account
  hijacking and other types of exploits.
 Identity and Access Management. Consumers should have visibility into the following capabilities
  of a provider: (1) the authentication and access control mechanisms that the provider infrastructure
  supports, (2) the tools that are available for consumers to provision authentication information, and
  (3) the tools to input and maintain authorizations for consumer users and applications without the
  intervention of the provider.
 Performance Requirements. Consumers should benchmark current performance scores for an
  application, and then establish key performance score requirements before deploying that application
  to a provider’s site. Key performance scores include responsiveness for interactive user applications,
  and bulk data transfer performance for applications that must input or output large quantities of data
  on an ongoing basis.
 Visibility. Consumers should request that a provider allow visibility into the operating services that
  affect a specific consumer’s data or operations on that data, including monitoring of the system’s
  welfare.
9.4   Virtual Machines

 VM Vulnerabilities. When providers offer computing resources in the form of VMs, consumers
  should ensure that the provider has mechanisms to protect VMs from attacks by: (1) other VMs on the
  same physical host, (2) the physical host itself, and (3) the network. Typical attack detection and
  prevention mechanisms include Virtual Firewalls, Virtual IDS/IPS, and network segmentation
  techniques such as VLANs.
 VM Migration. Consumers should formulate a strategy for migration of Virtual Machines and their
  associated storage among alternative cloud providers.
9.5   Software and Applications

 Time-critical Software. Applications that require precise timing of task completion appear
  unsuitable for public and some outsourced cloud computing scenarios because of the variable
