6. Cryptographic Keys and Metadata
6.1 Key Types
In general, cryptographic keys are categorized according to their properties and uses. Key
properties may be public, private, or symmetric 4. Keys may also have static (i.e., long
term) or ephemeral (used only for a single session or key management transaction)
properties. Key uses include signature, authentication, encryption/decryption, key
wrapping, RNG (Random Number Generation), master key, key transport, key
agreement, and authorization. [SP 800-57-part1] describes twenty different key types.
Twenty-one key types are shown in Table 1 below (one compound key type in SP 800-
57-part1 is divided into two simple key types in the table). Note that the italicized items
in this paragraph are the actual terms that compose the key type names in the table. A
CKMS may use these or other key types in its design.

Key Type
1) Private Signature Key
2) Public Signature Key
3) Symmetric Authentication Key
4) Private Authentication Key
5) Public Authentication Key
6) Symmetric Data Encryption/Decryption Key
7) Symmetric Key Wrapping Key
8) Symmetric RNG Key
9) Private RNG Key
10) Public RNG Key
11) Symmetric Master Key
12) Private Key Transport Key
13) Public Key Transport Key
14) Symmetric Key Agreement Key
15) Private Static Key Agreement Key
16) Public Static Key Agreement Key
17) Private Ephemeral Key Agreement Key
18) Public Ephemeral Key Agreement Key
19) Symmetric Authorization Key
20) Private Authorization Key
21) Public Authorization Key

FR: 6.1 The CKMS design shall specify and define each key type used.

  If it is not indicated in this document whether a key is asymmetric or symmetric, then
either asymmetric or symmetric should be assumed.
