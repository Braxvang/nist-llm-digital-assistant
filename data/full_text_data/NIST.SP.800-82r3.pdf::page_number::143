NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security

            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Synchronizing the internal clocks of OT systems and devices is critical
            for cyber event correlation and other OT functions (e.g., motion control).
            If a device or system clock is inaccurate, the timestamps generated by
            the clock for event and log entries will also be inaccurate, as well as any
            other functions that utilize the clock.
            A common time should be used across all OT devices. Utilizing multiple
            time sources can benefit OT devices by reducing clock error and
            providing backup time sources if the primary time source is lost or if the
            time quality of a primary time source has degraded.
            Authenticated Network Time Protocol (NTP) and secure Precision Time
            Protocol (PTP) (i.e., PTP with an authentication TLV [type, length,
            value]) can be used if there is a risk of malicious modification to the
            network time (e.g., RF jamming, packet spoofing, denial of service).
            Non-authenticated NTP is susceptible to spoofing and should be located
            behind the firewall.
            Time sources located in the OT environment should be included in the
            system and network monitoring programs. If available, logs from each
            time source (e.g., syslog) should be forwarded to a log collection system.

       Detect (DE)
The Detect Function enables the timely discovery of cybersecurity events by ensuring that
appropriate activities are developed and implemented.

6.3.1. Anomalies and Events (DE.AE)
Organizations should understand different events, anomalies, and their potential impacts to
systems and the environment to establish an effective detection capability. Within any
environment, numerous non-malicious and potentially malicious events and anomalies occur
almost continuously. Some examples of common events include:
Information Events
   •   Multiple failed logon attempts
   •   Locked-out accounts
   •   Unauthorized creation of new accounts
   •   Unexpected remote logons (e.g., logons of individuals who are on vacation, remote logon
       when the individual is expected to be local, remote logon for maintenance support when
       no support was requested)
   •   Cleared event logs
   •   Unexpectedly full event logs
   •   Antivirus or IDS alerts
