      NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                               Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                                 Enrollment and Identity Proofing


393   2.1. Expected Outcomes of Identity Prooﬁng
394   The expected outcomes of identity proofing include:
395       • Identity resolution: determine that the claimed identity corresponds to a single,
396         unique individual within the context of the population of users the CSP serves;
397       • Evidence validation: confirm that all supplied evidence is genuine, authentic, and
398         unexpired;
399       • Attribute validation: confirm the accuracy of core attributes;
400       • Identity verification: verify that the claimed identity is associated with the real-life
401         person supplying the identity evidence; and
402       • Fraud Prevention: mitigate attempts to gain fraudulent access to benefits, services,
403         data, or assets.

404   2.2. Identity Assurance Levels
405   Assurance in a subscriber’s identity is described using one of the following Identity
406   Assurance Levels (IAL). Each successive IAL builds on the requirements of lower IALs
407   in order to achieve greater assurance.
408   No identity proofing (IAL0): There is no requirement to link the applicant to a specific,
409   real-life identity. Any attributes provided in conjunction with the subject’s activities are
410   self-asserted and are treated as self-asserted. Self-asserted attributes at IAL0 are neither
411   validated nor verified.
412   IAL1: The identity proofing process supports the real-world existence of the claimed
413   identity. Core attributes are obtained from identity evidence or asserted by the applicant.
414   All core attributes are validated against authoritative or credible sources and steps are
415   taken to link the attributes to the person undergoing the identity proofing process.
416   IAL2: IAL2 adds additional rigor to the identity proofing process by requiring the
417   collection of stronger types of evidence and a more rigorous process for validating the
418   evidence and verifying the identity.
419   IAL3: IAL3 adds the requirement for a trained CSP representative to interact directly
420   with the applicant during the entire identity proofing session, either in person or via a
421   supervised remote identity proofing session.
