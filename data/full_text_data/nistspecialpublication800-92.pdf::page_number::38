GUIDE TO COMPUTER SECURITY LOG MANAGEMENT



agents to be installed on each log generating host; the agents perform filtering, aggregation, and
normalization for a particular type of log. The agents are also responsible for transferring log data from
the individual hosts to a centralized SIEM server on a real-time or near-real-time basis. Other SIEM
products are agentless and rely on an SIEM server to pull data from the logging hosts and perform the
functions that agents normally perform.

SIEM products usually support several dozen types of log sources, including generic formats such as
syslog. Because the SIEM products typically understand the meaning of each logged field for specific log
source formats, an SIEM-based log management infrastructure is usually superior to a syslog-based
infrastructure in performing normalization, analysis, and correlation of log data from multiple log sources.
SIEM products can analyze data from many sources, identify significant events, and initiate automated
responses if desired. SIEM products may also include analysis GUIs, security knowledge bases, incident
tracking and reporting capabilities, and asset information storage and correlation capabilities. SIEM
products also usually offer capabilities to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of log data.

Although SIEM software typically offers more robust and broad log management capabilities than syslog,
SIEM software is usually much more complicated and expensive to deploy than a centralized syslog
implementation. Also, SIEM software is often more resource-intensive for individual hosts than syslog
because of the processing that agents perform.

In addition to syslog and SIEM software, there are several other types of software that may be helpful for
log management. Host-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) monitor the characteristics of a host and
the events occurring within it, which might include OS, security software, and application logs. Host-
based IDS products are often part of a log management infrastructure, but they cannot take the place of
syslog and SIEM software. Other utilities that are helpful for log management include visualization tools,
log rotation utilities, and log conversion utilities.
