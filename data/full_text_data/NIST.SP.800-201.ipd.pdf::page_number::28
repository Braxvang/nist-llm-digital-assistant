      NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                  Cloud Computing Forensic
      February 2023                                                                  Reference Architecture

836       Conclusion
837   This document presents the NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Reference Architecture (CC FRA)
838   comprised of:
839       a) A methodology for analyzing the functional capabilities of an existing architecture –
840          preferably a security architecture like the Cloud Security Alliance’s (CSA’s) Enterprise
841          Architecture (EA) [2] – through a set of cloud forensic challenges, such as the set
842          identified in NIST IR 8006 [1]
843       b) A data set that aggregates the results of the above methodology applied to the CSA’s EA
844          [2] and the NIST IR 8006 [1] set of cloud forensic challenges
845   The goal of the FRA is to enable the analysis of cloud systems to determine the extent to which a
846   system proactively supports digital forensics. More precisely, the FRA is meant to help users
847   understand how the previously identified cloud forensic challenges might impact an
848   organization’s cloud-based system. When developing a new system or analyzing an existing one,
849   the FRA helps identify those cloud forensic challenges that could affect the system’s capabilities
850   and, therefore, require at least partial mitigation strategies to support a complete forensic
851   investigation. The FRA also identifies how a forensic investigator would apply the mitigation
852   strategies to a particular investigation. While the FRA can be used by any cloud computing
853   practitioner, it is specifically designed to enable cloud system architects, cloud engineers,
854   forensic practitioners, and even cloud consumers to analyze and review their cloud computing
855   architectures for forensic readiness.
856   The FRA data provided in this document offers an initial implementation of the FRA
857   methodology and a useful starting point for all cloud forensic stakeholders to analyze how the
858   NIST cloud forensic challenges presented in NIST IR 8006 [1] affect each functional capability
859   present in the CSA’s EA [2].
860   All users are encouraged to customize this initial implementation (shown in Appendix D) for
861   their specific situations and needs. For example, if the existing functional capabilities are not
862   appropriate for the user’s situation, some or all can be removed, and new ones can be added.
863   Similarly, new forensic challenges appropriate for the user’s situation can be added, and
864   challenges that have been adequately mitigated can be removed. The FRA methodology
865   promotes analysis of how cloud forensic challenges affect particular functional capabilities and
866   helps determine whether mitigations are necessary to ensure forensic readiness related to the
867   respective capability. This means that users can replace all cloud forensics challenges or
868   functional capabilities used in the current FRA data set with their own.
869   The FRA presented here will likely evolve over time, and methods for quantifying impact will be
870   developed to enhance FRA usability.
