                                                                                                   SECTION 4: RFID RISKS



In addition, DoD regulations require HERO and HERF evaluation of RF systems. 35 It is important to
note that RFID systems may be within exposure limits when initially installed, but later exceed limits if
operators increase the emitted power of readers, perhaps to improve the performance and reliability of the
system.

Nevertheless, the critical consequences that would result from any realization of the risk suggest that
organizations exercise prudence when fielding RFID technology, especially in complex electromagnetic
environments. Electromagnetic signals and waves can reflect, interfere, and resonate in unintended ways
in complex electromagnetic environments that include metal objects such as metal doors, window frames,
and metal enclosures. This can result in unexpected or unintended signal and field cancellation,
interference, summation, or resonance. This makes it difficult to accurately predict specific localized
field levels from radiated power alone. Some factors that may warrant additional examination of
electromagnetic radiation hazards include:

 The use of RFID equipment that has not been certified by the FCC or that has been modified to
  operate outside of FCC mandated limits 36 (both of which are illegal in the US but may be legal in
  other countries), and
 Operating RFID equipment in environments in which signal reflections and other electromagnetic
  effects can focus radiation in unintended ways. 37
4.4.2    Computer Network Attacks

RFID technology represents a new attack vector on an enterprise network. Once RFID systems are
implemented, a possibility exists that attackers could reach non-RFID and enterprise subsystem
computers through a reader, although no such attack is known to have successfully occurred to date. If
the system involves wireless handheld readers, then the wireless link between the reader and the
networked middleware servers is another point of entry. Once RFID servers are compromised, they can
be used to launch attacks on other networked systems. Attack possibilities include the introduction of
malware (e.g., a worm or virus) or the exploits of a single adversary compromising one computer at a
time. Once additional systems are compromised, all types of adverse consequences to the IT
infrastructure are possible, including loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

While the risk of network compromise through an RFID interface is considered low, it is possible,
especially as the number of RFID reader, middleware, and enterprise applications increases. RFID
air-interface protocols do not support the execution of remote commands on the RFID interface, but if the
reader accepts data formats outside those expected by the protocol, then conceivably an adversary could
exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability on a reader by sending it non-compliant data. If the system is
poorly designed, the adversary may be able to insert code or commands in memory buffers read by
processes that can execute administrative functions such as disabling security controls. The potential
consequence is that the adversary could gain full control of the device and use that control to attack other
systems.

Although no known instance of this type of attack has occurred in a real-world application, RFID security
specialists have demonstrated RFID viruses in a controlled laboratory environment. 38 An RFID virus is a

     An example might be the hull of a steel ship, in which there are numerous reflective metal surfaces with a variety of
     curvatures. While everyday objects such as metal furniture or vehicle bodies can reflect and focus RF signals in ways
     difficult to predict, they are unlikely to cause electromagnetic hazards.
