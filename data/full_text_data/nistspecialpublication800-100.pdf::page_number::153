   • Scores on pre-awareness assessments indicate retention of security knowledge
     from prior year.

Q. What is the difference between “certificates” that are awarded by
   vendors, third parties, or universities?
A. There are distinct differences among training “certifications” that are offered by a
   variety of organizations. Primarily, one will encounter certificates of completion,
   certifications awarded by an industry and/or vendors, and graduate-level
   certificates awarded by academic institutions:
   • Certificates of completion are provided to individuals to verify that they
     attended a course—these certificates do not make any claims that the individual
     actually gained knowledge and/or skills.
   • Industry and vendor certification require a solid combination of training,
     education, and experience. These certifications validate knowledge and skills
     through testing—they provide varying degrees of assurance that an individual
     has a baseline level of knowledge, skills, and abilities with regard to a
     predefined body of knowledge. The preparatory work for knowledge- or skill-
     based certifications normally includes training in a prescribed body of
     knowledge or technical curriculum, and is supplemented frequently by on-the-
     job experience.
   • Graduate certificates in information assurance (IA) are awarded by an
     academic institution to individuals who successfully complete all graduation
     requirements. These graduate certificates generally require 18 to 21 credit
     hours of academic study, have at least four required courses, allow for one or
     two electives, and may require a research paper, project, or case study.

Q. What do “professionalization” and professional development have to do
   with security?

A. Professionalization supports the need for consistency and standardization of
   policy, processes, and procedures within an agency. For security professionals,
   this professionalization trend reflects the organizational change that is taking
   place in all agencies as they place more emphasis on security and realize that
   security is a full-time job. Professionalization is accomplished through
   professional development. The movement toward professional development and
   successful certification is referred to as “professionalization.”
   Professional development integrates training, education, and experience with
   some form of assessment that validates knowledge and skills and “certifies” a
   predefined level of competence. Proper blending of awareness, training,
   education, experience, and certification promotes professional development,
   which leads to a high-performance workforce.
