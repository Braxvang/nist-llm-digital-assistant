manipulative de-identifcation techniques are employed, but data accuracy and – in some
cases – the ultimate utility of the de-identifed dataset decreases as well.
Accuracy is traditionally defned as the “closeness of computations or estimates to the exact
or true values that the statistics were intended to measure” [71].5 The data accuracy of
de-identifed data, therefore, refers to the degree to which inferences drawn on the de-
identifed data will be consistent with inferences drawn on the original data. Data accuracy
can be measured by the ratio of a value computed with de-identifed data to the same value
computed using the underlying true confdential value. Because there are many potential
computations that may be performed with de-identifed data, de-identifed data that are
accurate for one purpose may not be accurate for another. As accuracy decreases, statistical
power may be lost, rendering some inferences no longer possible. Alternatively, new biases
and errors may be introduced, resulting in incorrect inferences.
In economics, utility is traditionally defned as “the satisfaction derived from consumption
of a good or service”[71]. Data utility, therefore, refers to the value that data users can de-
rive from data in general. When speaking of de-identifed data, utility comes from two pub-
lic goods: the uses of the data and the privacy protection afforded by the de-identifcation
process.
In general, data accuracy decreases as more aggressive de-identifcation techniques are
employed. Therefore, any effort that involves the release of data that contain personal
information typically involves making a trade-off between identifability and data accuracy.
However, increased privacy protections do not necessarily result in decreased data utility
for certain specifed purposes.
Some users of de-identifed data may be able to use the data to make inferences regarding
specifc individuals or establishments by virtue of their inclusion in the dataset rather than
on the basis of a statistical model based on the sampled population. Such users may even
be able to re-identify the data subjects. Both of these uses undo the privacy goals of de-
identifcation.
In general:
    • Agencies that release data should understand what data they are releasing, what other
      data may already be publicly or privately available, and the protection methods that
      they have employed to protect against the risk of re-identifcation.
    • Agencies should be aware that it is diffcult if not impossible to recall a data release,
      so de-identifed data that are published will remain in the public domain indefnitely.
      Thus, it is insuffcient to only plan and implement a solution that works today but

5 This report avoids the use of the term precision, which the Organization for Economic Cooperation and De-

 velopment (OECD) glossary defnes as “The property of the set of measurements of being very reproducible
 or of an estimate of having small random error of estimation,”[71] as the term is used to describe an aspect
 of measurement rather than the result of de-identifcation.
