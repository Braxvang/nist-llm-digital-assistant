may also raise other concerns. A distributed composition of a defense layer may provide additional
options within the coordination of layers.
Defense in depth is, in part, a form of the principle of Protective Failure. It helps satisfy the objective that
a failure of a system element should not result in an unacceptable loss. However, it does not satisfy the
objective that a failure of a system element should not invoke another loss scenario.

E.10. Distributed Privilege
Principle: Multiple authorized entities act in a coordinated manner before an operation on the
system is allowed to occur.
Note: Distributed privilege 82 is a means to require agreement and coordination from multiple entities
when performing an operation, thereby preventing a single entity from acting alone. Distributed privilege
separates, divides, or in some other manner distributes the privileges required to perform an operation
among multiple entities. This distribution includes a set of rules, conditions, and constraints that describe
how multiple entities must interact through positive actions before a requested operation can proceed and
be completed. The rules, conditions, and constraints may reflect combinations of the following:
-       Simultaneous Actions: Multiple different authorized entities execute a command within a specified
        time window.
-       Sequenced Actions: Multiple different entities interact within a linear sequence of actions where each
        successive action is enabled only by the successful completion of a prior action.
-       Parallel Actions: Multiple entities execute sequences concurrently, and success is achieved either by
        a consensus of the results of each concurrent action or by voting among the participants.
Defeating distributed privilege requires collusion to take an unauthorized or improper action. In the case
of an attack, distributed privilege forces the adversary to target all of the entities to whom privilege is
distributed.

E.11. Diversity (Dynamicity)
Principle: The system design delivers the required capability through structural, behavioral, or
data or control flow variation.
Note: A system design that incorporates diversity helps to avoid common mode failures and introduces
unpredictability to adversaries, thus complicating the planning and execution of where, when, and how to
target their attacks. While the system behaviors that result from a design may be unpredictable from the
viewpoint of the adversary, the design itself must be predictable and verifiable in achieving only the
intended outcomes. The options for diversity include variety in the system structural and architectural
design elements, the system functional and behavioral elements, the interfaces and interconnections
between interfaces, the data and control flow, and the technology and component selection. Diversity can
reside in:
-       Fixed or static characteristics of the system (e.g., multiple instances of a system element, multiple
        communication channels)
