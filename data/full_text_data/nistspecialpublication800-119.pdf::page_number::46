Error messages are used, for example, if a transmitting node sends a packet of 1500 bytes, but an
intermediary hop has an MTU of only 1300. The intermediary node then sends an ICMPv6 Packet Too
Big (Type = 2) error message to the sender with information about the problem. For ICMPv6 error
messages, the sender includes, at least, the start of the packet causing the error to allow the originator of
