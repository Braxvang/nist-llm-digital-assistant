       NIST SP 800-63-4 ipd                                                Digital Identity Guidelines

1214   required through a secure authentication protocol. Approved cryptographic techniques are
1215   required at AAL2 and above.
1216   AAL3: AAL3 provides very high confidence that the claimant controls authenticator
1217   registered to the subscriber. Authentication at AAL3 is based on proof of possession of a
1218   key through a cryptographic authentication protocol capable of resisting phishing attacks.

1219   5.2.2.3. Federation Assurance Level
1220   FAL1: FAL1 allows for the subscriber to log into the RP using an assertion from the
1221   IdP that can be verified by the RP as coming from the IdP and targeted for a specific RP.
1222   The assertion is protected from modification or construction by an attacker. The trust
1223   agreement and registration between the IdP and RP can happen dynamically.
1224   FAL2: FAL2 adds the requirement that the assertion be robust against injection at the
1225   RP. One means of this is to have the assertion presented directly to the RP from the IdP
1226   instead of passing through an intermediary like a browser. The trust agreement between
1227   the IdP and RP cannot happen dynamically, but dynamic registration of the specific IdP
1228   and RP can occur at runtime.
1229   FAL3: FAL3 adds the requirement that the subscriber authenticate directly to the RP
1230   using a bound authenticator along with presenting the authentication assertion. The
1231   presence of this additional authenticator provides a very high assurance to the RP that
1232   the party accessing the RP is the party identified in the assertion. The trust agreement and
1233   registration cannot be dynamic.

1234   5.2.3. Initial Assurance Level Selection
1235   The identification and assessment of the potential impacts of failures in identity proofing,
1236   authentication, and federation processes informs the organizationâ€™s digital identity risk
1237   management process and the initial selection of assurance levels for those areas. These
1238   initial selections are primarily based on cybersecurity risk, but will be tailored, based on
1239   mission needs and other potential impacts to the organization, users, and mission partners.
1240   Organizations SHALL develop and document a process and governance model for
1241   selecting initial assurance levels based on the potential impact of digital identity failures.
1242   This section provides guidance on the major elements to include in that process.

1243   5.2.3.1. Selecting Initial IAL
1244   The IAL reflects the level of assurance that an applicant holds the claimed real-life
1245   identity. Organizations SHALL use a risk-based approach to select the most appropriate
1246   identity proofing requirements for their RP application. The impact analysis described in
1247   Sec. 5.3.1 informs the selection of the initial IAL selection. This initial selection SHALL
1248   be tailored, as described in Sec. 5.3, based on mission needs, risk tolerance, and potential
1249   impacts to privacy, equity, and usability, before making a final IAL determination.
