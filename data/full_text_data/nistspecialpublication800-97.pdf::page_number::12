ESTABLISHING WIRELESS ROBUST SECURITY NETWORKS: A GUIDE TO IEEE 802.11I



FIPS-approved cryptographic algorithms that are contained in FIPS-validated cryptographic modules. 1
Of WEP, TKIP, and CCMP, only CCMP uses a core cryptographic algorithm that is FIPS-approved, the
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). For other security features, CCMP offers stronger assurance than
WEP and TKIP. Accordingly, NIST requires the use of CCMP for securing Federal agencies’ IEEE
802.11-based WLANs. For legacy IEEE 802.11 equipment that does not provide CCMP, auxiliary
security protection is required; one possibility is the use of an IPsec VPN, using FIPS-approved
cryptographic algorithms. NIST SP 800-48 contains specific recommendations for securing legacy IEEE
802.11 implementations.

Organizations should select IEEE 802.11 RSN authentication methods for their environment
carefully.

IEEE 802.11 RSN uses the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) for the authentication phase of
establishing an RSNA. EAP supports a wide variety of authentication methods, also called EAP methods.
They include authentication based on passwords, certificates, smart cards, and tokens. EAP methods also
can include combinations of authentication techniques, such as a certificate followed by a password, or
the option of using either a smart card or a token. This flexibility allows EAP to integrate with nearly any
environment to which a WLAN might connect. Organizations have considerable discretion in choosing
which EAP methods to employ; a poor EAP method choice or implementation could seriously weaken an
IEEE 802.11 RSN’s protections.

Because of the extensible nature of EAP, dozens of EAP methods exist, and others are being developed
continually. However, many EAP methods do not satisfy the necessary security requirements for
WLANs; for example, EAP methods that do not generate cryptographic keying material cannot be used
for WLANs. In general, the current EAP methods that can satisfy WLAN security requirements are based
on the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. A primary distinction between TLS-based EAP methods
is the level of public key infrastructure (PKI) support required; the EAP-TLS method requires an
enterprise PKI implementation and certificates deployed to each STA, while most other TLS methods
require certificates on each AS only. Organizations should use the EAP-TLS method whenever possible.

Because some EAP methods are not yet official standards and new methods are being developed,
organizations are encouraged to obtain the latest available information on EAP methods and standards
when planning an IEEE 802.11 RSN implementation. Additionally, organizations should ensure that the
cryptographic modules implementing the TLS algorithm for each product under consideration are FIPS-
validated.

Before selecting WLAN equipment, organizations should review their existing identity management
infrastructure, authentication requirements, and security policy to determine the EAP method or methods
that are most appropriate in their environments, then purchase systems that support the chosen EAP
methods, and implement and maintain them carefully. This publication provides detailed guidance on
planning EAP implementations. It discusses the most common EAP methods, explains how organizations
can select EAP methods, and examines additional EAP security considerations.
