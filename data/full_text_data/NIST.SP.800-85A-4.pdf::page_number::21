NIST SP 800-85A-4                                          PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                    INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

Some DTRs cannot be validated through the test tools provided in this document. For
example, the test tool cannot access the asymmetric private keys generated and stored on the
card. Therefore, a note is added to indicate the assertion is not separately tested for these
DTRs. The same note is added for DTRs that make general statements on the nature of the
PIV Card and are validated as a result of the validation of many other DTRs. For example,
the statement “[e]ach command that appears on the card command interface shall be
implemented by a card application that is resident on the ICC [integrated circuit card]” is
validated through the entire card command interface test and does not require an individual
test assertion.
