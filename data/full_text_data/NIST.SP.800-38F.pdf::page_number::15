LSBs (X)           The bit string consisting of the s right-most bits of the bit string X.

MSBs (X)           The bit string consisting of the s left-most bits of the bit string X.

TW(S)              The output of the wrapping function for TKW applied to the string S.

TW-1(C)            The output of the unwrapping function for TKW applied to the string C.

W(S)               The output of the wrapping function for KW and KWP applied to the bit string
                   S.

W-1(C)             The output of the unwrapping function for KW and KWP applied to the bit
                   string C.

x                The least integer that is not less than the real number x.

[x]s               The binary representation of the non-negative integer x as a string of s bits,
                   where x < 2s.

X⊕Y                The bitwise exclusive-OR of bit strings X and Y whose bit lengths are equal.

X || Y             The concatenation of bit strings X and Y.

0x                 The marker for the beginning of a hexadecimal representation of a bit string.

4.5      Examples of Basic Operations and Functions on Strings

In this publication, the new courier font indicates the ‘0’ bit, the ‘1’ bit, and any
hexadecimal symbols: 0, 1, …, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.

The beginning of a hexadecimal representation of a string is marked by ‘0x.’ For example,
0xA659 = 1010011001011001.

Given a real number x, the ceiling function, denoted x, is the least integer that is not less than x.
For example, 2.1 = 3, and 4 = 4.

Given a positive integer s, 0s denotes the string that consists of s ‘0’ bits. For example, 08 =
00000000.

The concatenation operation on bit strings is denoted ||. For example, 001 || 10111 =
00110111.

Given bit strings of equal length, the exclusive-OR (XOR) operation, denoted ⊕, specifies the
addition, modulo 2, of the bits in corresponding bit positions. For example, 10011 ⊕ 10101 =
00110.
