ITL Leadership and Participation in National and
International Standards Programs
During FY 2020, NIST staff contributed to and held leadership positions in various
standards developing organizations (SDOs), including the Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C), and the ISO/IEC. Staff actively participated in standards bodies to
raise awareness and influence the development of privacy and cybersecurity standards,
including efforts within the ISO/IEC.
In FY 2020, NIST continued to engage with government and industry organizations to
demonstrate and ensure continued alignment with voluntary international standards. NIST
discussed the Cybersecurity Framework in numerous dialogues and has continued to
identify and promote international adaptations and translations of the Framework. NIST also
continues to contribute to international standards development efforts related to
cybersecurity risk management and the development of cybersecurity frameworks, including
ISO/IEC Technical Specification 27110.
The standards community is built upon international collaboration, and NIST leverages its
foundational and applied research efforts and experience in leadership to contribute to
the development of national and international standards. Today, these standards activities
span cybersecurity, privacy, cryptography, and critical fields, such as 5G mobile and cellular
technologies, quantum information, cloud, blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, and
the Internet of Things (IoT).
About 70 NIST staff members work with other agencies and industry leaders to develop
cybersecurity and privacy standards through voluntary consensus. NIST’s standards strategy
is captured in NISTIR 8074, Interagency Report on Strategic U.S. Government Engagement in
International Standardization to Achieve U.S. Objectives or Cybersecurity.
NIST has been instrumental in promoting and participating in the development of a family of
voluntary ISO/IEC standards that align with NIST’s cryptographic module validation standard
and related specifications. NIST served as the project editor for nine of those standards. NIST
uses collaborative opportunities to highlight the role that standards play in enabling technological
innovation and interoperability among products and systems. International collaboration and
alignment on standards-based approaches to cybersecurity and privacy risk management lead
to greater innovation and a more effective and efficient utilization of resources.
NIST also shares information on standards processes, the importance of standards on the
economy and facilitating international trade, and the ability of standards to help secure systems
and infrastructure. NIST coordinates with interagency partners on strategic approaches and
communication on standards for the U.S. Government.
In FY 2021, NIST staff will continue to lead and participate in cybersecurity and privacy
standardization efforts with an increased focus on new and emerging areas, such as AI,
quantum information, 5G communications, and zero trust architectures.
