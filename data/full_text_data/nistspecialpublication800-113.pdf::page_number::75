                                                                                          GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



7.    Case Study

This section presents an SSL VPN solution planning and implementation case study. The case study
begins by describing a real-world security requirement scenario: protecting network communications
between remote users and a main office. The case study then discusses possible solutions for the security
requirement and explains why an SSL VPN architecture was selected over the alternatives. The next
section of the case study discusses the design of the solution and also provides some details of the
implementation of the solution prototype, including examples of configuring the solution using
commonly available equipment and software.

The case study is not meant to endorse the use of particular products, nor are any products being
recommended over other products. A fictional combination of several common products was chosen so
that the case study would demonstrate a variety of solutions. Organizations and individuals should not
replicate and deploy the sample entries. They are intended to illustrate the decisions and actions
involved in configuring the solutions, not to be deployed as-is into systems.

The scenario described here is connecting remote users to a single main office. A medium-sized
organization has a large population of users that work from remote locations once to several days each
week. The organization is research-oriented, and many of these users require access to a broad range of
internal IT resources to conduct their research. These resources include email, calendar, file sharing
services, and secure shell access on a variety of hosts.

The organization already offers remote access services in the form of a host-to-gateway IPsec solution.
This works successfully but has required significant IT labor resources to install and support the client
software on user hosts. The current solution also does not provide remote access for hosts based in public
locations such as hotels and kiosks. The organization is therefore looking to implement a complementary
remote access architecture.

7.1   Identifying Needs and Evaluating Options

The organization specifies its organizational requirements for remote access:

 All users should have access to all internal network resources, especially email and calendar services.
  This open policy is necessary because of the broad range of IT resources required by users to conduct
  their research. Users may also be required to authenticate themselves to specific resources such as
  file shares and databases.
 Users should only have access to a limited set of internal services such as email and calendaring if
  they are using public hosts (e.g., hosts located in environments such as hotels and Internet cafes).
 A small population of users outside of the organization, human resources (HR) staff from the parent
  organization, should have access to a limited set of internal HR applications.
After articulating these requirements, the organization considers its options for remote access:

 Network Layer Solution: IPsec VPN. As mentioned earlier, the organization has already
  established IPsec-based network layer VPN services for remote users. Many users are satisfied with
  this solution, but it can be cumbersome for IT staff to support because each host requires client
  software to be installed and supported. Moreover, hosts without the preinstalled client software
  cannot access internal resources.
