CHAPTER 8                                                                            Security Planning


8.4.2 Security Controls
    FIPS 200 provides seventeen minimum security requirements for federal
information and information systems. The requirements represent a broad-based,
balanced information security program that addresses the management, operational,
and technical aspects of protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
federal information and information systems. An agency must meet the minimum
security requirements in this standard by applying security controls selected in
accordance with NIST SP 800-53 and the designated impact levels of the information
systems. An agency has the flexibility to tailor the security control baseline in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the standard. Tailoring
activities include (1) the application of scoping guidance, (2) the specification of
compensating controls, and (3) the specification of agency-defined parameters in the
security controls, where allowed. The system security plan should document all
tailoring activities.

8.4.3 Scoping Guidance
    Subsystems typically fall under the same management authority and are included
within a single system security plan. Figure 8-1 depicted a GSS with three
subsystems. Scoping guidance provides an agency with specific terms and
conditions on the applicability and implementation of individual security controls in
the security control baselines defined in NIST SP 800-53. Several considerations
described below can potentially impact how the baseline security controls are applied
by the agency. System security plans should clearly identify which security controls
used scoping guidance and include a description of the type of considerations that
were made. The application of scoping guidance must be reviewed and approved by
the authorizing official for the information system.

         controls assigned to each subsystem component.
