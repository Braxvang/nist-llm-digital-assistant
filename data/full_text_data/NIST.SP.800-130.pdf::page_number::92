SP 800-130                                                            August 2013



FR:10.5 The CKMS design shall specify all techniques provided by the CKMS to verify
the correctness of the system software.

FR:10.6 The CKMS design shall specify all techniques provided by the CKMS to detect
alterations or garbles to the software once it is loaded into memory.

FR:10.7 The CKMS design shall specify the strategy for backup and recovery from a
major software failure.

10.6 Cryptographic Module Failure
Cryptographic modules should have built-in tests that are adequate to detect hardware,
software, or firmware failures. Cryptographic modules may have pre-operational,
conditional, and periodic self-tests. For example, when a failure is detected within a
[FIPS 140]-2 validated module, control is passed to an error state that outputs an error
indicator and determines whether the error is a non-recoverable type (i.e. one that
requires service, repair, or replacement) or a recoverable type (i.e., one that requires
initialization or resetting). In most cases, sensitive data should not be output from the
module while it is in the error state. If the error is recoverable, the module should be
rebooted and pass all power-up self-tests before continuing normal processing. If the
error recurs on repeated attempts to reboot, then the module should be replaced.

FR:10.8 The CKMS design shall specify what self-tests are used by each cryptographic
module to detect errors and verify the integrity of the module.

FR:10.9 The CKMS design shall specify how each cryptographic module responds to
detected errors.

FR:10.10 The CKMS design shall specify its strategy for the repair or replacement of
failed cryptographic modules.

10.7 Corruption of Keys and Metadata
Cryptographic keys and metadata may be corrupted in transmission or in storage.
Corrupted keys and metadata should be replaced or corrected as soon as the corruption is
detected. The replacement of corrupted keys and metadata typically involves the
establishment or storage of a new key and metadata. If a corrupted key or a key with
corrupted metadata was used to protect data, the security consequences should be
evaluated, since a loss or compromise of sensitive data could result. Key establishment
and key storage protocols are frequently designed to detect and replace corrupted keys.

A major disaster could result in large numbers of operational keys and metadata being
lost or corrupted beyond recovery in primary storage. If a key recovery, backup, or
archive system exists, then the keys and metadata can and should be restored. However,
if the keys were not backed-up or archived, then they would have to be replaced with new
keys, and the information that the original keys protected could be lost.
