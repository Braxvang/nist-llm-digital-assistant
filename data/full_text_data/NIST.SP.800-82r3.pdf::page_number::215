D.2.7. INL Cyber-Informed Engineering (CIE) and Consequence-Driven CIE (CCE)
The DOE and the Idaho National Laboratory have developed a framework to guide the
application of cybersecurity principles across the engineering design life cycle. The Cyber-
Informed Engineering (CIE) framework and body of knowledge drives the inclusion of
cybersecurity as a foundational element of risk management for engineering functions that are
aided by digital technology. Consequence-Driven Cyber-Informed Engineering (CCE) is a
rigorous process for applying CIE’s core principles to a specific organization, facility, or mission
by identifying their most critical functions and methods, as well as the means by which an
adversary would likely use to manipulate or compromise them, and determining the most
effective means of removing or mitigating those risks.
CIE emphasizes “engineering out” potential risk in key areas and ensuring resiliency and
response maturity within the design of the engineered system. CCE walks an organization
through core components of CIE in CCE’s 4-phase process to evaluate and remove or mitigate
weaknesses in their critical functions.

D.2.8. Linking the Oil and Gas Industry to Improve Cybersecurity (LOGIIC)
The Linking the Oil and Gas Industry to Improve Cybersecurity (LOGIIC) program is a
collaboration of oil and natural gas companies and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security
Science and Technology Directorate. LOGIIC undertakes collaborative research and
development projects to improve the level of cybersecurity in critical systems of interest to the
oil and natural gas sector. The objective is to promote the cybersecurity of the sector while
maintaining impartiality, the independence of the participants, and vendor neutrality.
The Automation Federation serves as the LOGIIC host organization and has entered into
agreements with LOGIIC member companies and all other LOGIIC project participants. The
U.S. Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate previously
contracted with scientific research organization SRI International to provide scientific and
technical guidance for LOGIIC.

D.2.9. NIST Cyber-Physical Systems and Internet of Things Program
The definitions of cyber-physical systems (CPS) and IoT are converging over time to include a
common emphasis on interacting digital, analog, physical, and human components in systems
engineered for function through integrated physics and logic. CPS and IoT enable innovative
applications in important economic sectors, such as smart cities, energy, manufacturing,
transportation, and emergency response. The CPS/IoT Program develops and demonstrates new
measurement science and promotes the emergence of consensus standards and protocols for
advanced cyber-physical systems and IoT that are scalable, effective, measurable, interoperable,
trustworthy, and assured. The Engineering Laboratory’s Smart Grid and Cyber-Physical Systems
Program Office also provides leadership to support NIST-wide CPS/IoT program coordination
with the Information Technology, Communications Technology, and Physical Measurement
Laboratories.
