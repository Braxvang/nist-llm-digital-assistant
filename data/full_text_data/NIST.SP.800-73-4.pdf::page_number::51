      +   matching the live fingerprint samples provided by the cardholder with the biometric
          information embedded within the PIV Card.

B.1       Authentication Mechanism Diagrams

This section describes the activities and interactions involved in interoperable usage and
authentication of the PIV Card. The authentication mechanisms represent how a relying party will
authenticate the cardholder (regardless of which agency issued the card) in order to provide access to
its systems or facilities. These activities and interactions are represented in functional authentication
mechanism diagrams. These diagrams are not intended to provide syntactical commands or API
function names.

Each of the PIV authentication mechanisms described in this section can be broken into a sequence of
one or more validation steps where Card, Credential, and Cardholder validation is performed. In the
illustrations, the validation steps are marked as CardV, CredV, and HolderV to signify Card,
Credential, and Cardholder validation respectively.

Depending on the assurance provided by the actual sequence of validation steps in a given PIV
authentication mechanism, relying parties can make appropriate decisions for granting access to
protected resources based on a risk analysis.
