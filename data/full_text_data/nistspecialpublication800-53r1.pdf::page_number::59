and testing of the control (including functional interfaces among control components). The control
developer/implementer includes as an integral part of the control, assigned responsibilities and specific
actions supporting increased confidence that when the control is implemented, it will continuously and
consistently (i.e., across the information system) meet its required function or purpose and support
improvement in the effectiveness of the control. These actions include, for example, requiring the
development of records with structure and content suitable to facilitate making this determination.
Supplemental Guidance: For security controls in the high baseline, the focus is expanded to require, within
the control, the capabilities that are needed to support ongoing consistent operation of the control and
continuous improvement in the controlâ€™s effectiveness. The developer/implementer is expected to expend
significant effort on the design, development, implementation, and component/integration testing of the
controls and to produce associated design and implementation documentation to support these activities.
This documentation is also needed by assessors to analyze and test the internal components of the control
as part of the overall assessment of the control.

Additional Requirements Enhancing the Moderate and High Baselines
Assurance Requirement: The security control is in effect and meets explicitly identified functional
requirements in the control statement. The control developer/implementer provides a description of the
functional properties and design/implementation of the control with sufficient detail to permit analysis and
testing of the control. The control developer/implementer includes as an integral part of the control, actions
supporting increased confidence that when the control is implemented, it will continuously and consistently
(i.e., across the information system) meet its required function or purpose and support improvement in the
effectiveness of the control. These actions include requiring the development of records with structure and
content suitable to facilitate making this determination. The control is developed in a manner that
supports a high degree of confidence that the control is complete, consistent, and correct.
Supplemental Guidance: The additional high assurance requirements are intended to supplement the
minimum assurance requirements for the moderate and high baselines, when appropriate, in order to protect
against threats from highly skilled, highly motivated, and well-financed threat agents. This level of
protection is necessary for those information systems where the organization is not willing to accept the
risks associated with the type of threat agents cited above.
