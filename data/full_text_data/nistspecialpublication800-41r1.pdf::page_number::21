                                                                              GUIDELINES ON FIREWALLS AND FIREWALL POLICY


In addition to traditional stateful filtering, many personal firewalls can be configured to allow
communications based on lists of authorized applications—such as web browsers contacting web servers
and email clients sending and receiving email messages—and to deny communications involving any
other applications. These are referred to as application-based firewalls. Access control is based on the
applications or services launched, and not on the ports or services.

Management of personal firewalls should be centralized if at all possible to help efficiently create,
distribute, and enforce policies for all users and groups. Doing this will ensure that the organization’s
security policy will be in effect whenever a user is accessing the organization’s computing resources. But
regardless of whether a personal firewall is managed by central administrators or individual users, any
warning messages that are generated by the firewall should be shown to the user of the PC to help them
rectify problems that are found.

2.2.2     Personal Firewall Appliances

In addition to using personal firewalls on their PCs, some teleworkers also use a small, inexpensive
device called a firewall appliance or firewall router to protect the computers on their home networks. A
personal firewall appliance performs functions similar to a personal firewall, including some of the more
advanced features listed earlier in this section—such as VPN. Even if each computer on a home network
is using a personal firewall, a firewall appliance is still a valuable added layer of security. Should a
personal firewall on a computer malfunction, be disabled, or be misconfigured, the firewall appliance can
still protect the computer from unauthorized network communications from external computers. Personal
firewall appliances are essentially like small enterprise firewalls that are deployed away from the
organization, so the ability to perform central management and administration is as important for personal
firewall appliances as it is for enterprise firewalls. 13

Some personal firewall appliances can be partially configured by Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), which
allows applications on PCs behind the firewall to automatically ask the firewall to open certain ports so
that the applications can have two-way communications with an external system. Most personal firewalls
that support dynamic reconfiguration via UPnP have this featured turned off by default because it is a
significant security risk to allow untrusted applications to alter a firewall’s security policy.

2.3     Limitations of Firewall Inspection

Firewalls can only work effectively on traffic that they can inspect. Regardless of the firewall technology
chosen, a firewall that cannot understand the traffic flowing through it will not handle that traffic
properly—for example, allowing traffic that should be blocked. Many network protocols use
cryptography to hide the contents of the traffic. Section 2.1.6 covered IPsec and TLS; other encrypting
protocols include Secure Shell (SSH) and Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP). Firewalls also
cannot read application data that is encrypted, such as email that is encrypted using the S/MIME or
OpenPGP protocols, or files that are manually encrypted. Another limitation faced by some firewalls is
understanding traffic that is tunneled, even if it is not encrypted. For example, IPv6 traffic can be tunneled
in IPv4 in many different ways. The content may still be unencrypted, but if the firewall does not
understand the particular tunneling mechanism used, the traffic cannot be interpreted.

In all these cases, the firewall’s rules will determine what to do with traffic it does not (or, in the case of
encrypted traffic, cannot) understand. An organization should have policies about how to handle traffic in
such cases, such as either permitting or blocking encrypted traffic that is not authorized to be encrypted.
