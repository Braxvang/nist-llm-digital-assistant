      NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                   Cloud Computing Forensic
      February 2023                                                                   Reference Architecture

217       Introduction
218   The NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Science Working Group (NCC FSWG) previously
219   published NIST IR 8006, NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Science Challenges [1], which was
220   the result of collaboration between volunteers from the private and public sector. That document
221   highlighted digital forensic challenges triggered by the specific characteristics and business
222   model of public cloud computing services.
223   The approach to examining digital forensics in the cloud was to first understand cloud computing
224   technology and to identify and elucidate its essential and unique characteristics, which play a
225   significant part in three aspects of operation: normal operations, adverse operations when cloud
226   computing resources are under attack, and operations during criminal exploitation.
227   The second phase of this approach was a close examination of the challenges that were identified
228   in the previous NIST report. This examination involved analyzing the Cloud Security Alliance’s
229   (CSA’s) Enterprise Architecture (EA) [2], its various functional capabilities and processes, and
230   the potential impact of each challenge on performing a forensic investigation if a specific
231   functional capability or process were involved in an attack and breach or were used during
232   criminal exploitation. The analysis presumed fictive use case scenarios that would exploit
233   potential weaknesses, vulnerabilities, exposures, or cloud technology for criminal activities. Such
234   elements are of fundamental concern in forensic analysis as they present points that adversaries
235   may seek to exploit or characteristics that can be used by criminals. In either case, there will be
236   evidence of the attack or criminal exploitation for future forensic analysis. The EA is composed
237   of a large number of specific functional capabilities that enable detailed consideration of the
238   effects of each forensic challenge on each of the capabilities.
239   The third phase of this work has been to examine the nature of each challenge (i.e., whether the
240   challenge is technological or non-technological) to determine its role and impact on the forensic
241   examination process. As each challenge was analyzed, the applicability of techniques or
242   technologies became clearer in terms of how they function and ultimately contribute to the
243   forensic processes of identification, acquisition, preservation, examination, and interpretation of
244   evidence.
245   This work brings value by clarifying how forensics in the cloud can achieve the same acceptance
246   as forensics in traditional computing models. This document, the associated research, and NIST
247   IR 8006 [1] proactively address the White House Executive Order of May 12, 2021, entitled
248   Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity [3], which points out the importance
249   of having forensic-ready information systems, including cloud systems, to improve the Nation’s
250   cybersecurity.

251           The Need for a Cloud-specific Forensic Reference Architecture
252   Digital forensics is the application of science and technology to the discovery and examination of
253   digital artifacts within information systems and networks to establish facts and evidence
254   concerning events and conditions that occur within them. Digital forensics is traditionally used
255   for judicial proceedings and regulatory issues but may also be used for other purposes as
256   described below.
257   Digital forensics continues to evolve in step with computer and information science. As these
258   technologies, their implementations, and their operations have changed, digital forensics has
