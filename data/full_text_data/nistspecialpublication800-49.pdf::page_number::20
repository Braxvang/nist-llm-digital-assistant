                                Federal S/MIME V3 Client Profile


3.3 Secure Mailing Lists
Support for Secure Mailing Lists (“Mail List Management”) is one of the four optional security
services defined in [RFC2634]. Mail list agent processing is beyond the scope of this profile but
may be added to a future profile. However, S/MIME implementations MUST be able to process
received signed messages that contain the mlExpansionHistory attribute as described in Clause
3.1 above.

3.4 Signing Certificate Attribute
Support for Signing Certificate Attributes is one of the four optional security services defined in
[RFC2634]. If an S/MIME implementation claims to conform to the Signing Certificate
Attribute requirements defined in Clause 5 of [RFC2634], then the following requirements are
imposed on the implementation:
       • S/MIME agents that originate messages MUST be able to generate messages that
            contain a signing certificate attribute as defined in [RFC2634].
       • S/MIME agents that receive messages MUST be able to properly process messages
            that contain a signing certificate attribute as defined in [RFC2634].


4 Optional Features and Notes on Testing
Since the functionality offered by these optional features may be achieved through other means,
inclusion of these options in S/MIME implementations is recommended, but not required.

4.1  Generate Application/pkcs7-signature MIME Type (Opaque) Signed
     Messages
Sending agents SHOULD have the capability to generate application/pkcs7-signature MIME
Type (i.e., “opaque”) signed messages.

4.2 Self-Signed Certificates
Sending and receiving agents SHOULD have the capability to support self-signed certificates by
accepting them as trust anchors.

4.3 Sending CRLs
Sending agents SHOULD have the capability to include appropriate CRLs with outgoing
messages (i.e., CRLs which are associated with the sender's certificates).

4.4 Selective Trust of Certificates
S/MIME agents SHOULD provide the capability to configure the set of trust anchors, (i.e., set
the root trust certificates).

4.5 Acquiring Certificates
S/MIME agents SHOULD have the capability to acquire certificates in either of the following
ways:
      1) Loading certificates (or chains of certificates) from *.p7c and *.p7m files (file
         extension types) and messages as defined in [RFC2633].
