                                                                     INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

2.       System Overview

The conceptual architecture involving the PIV Middleware and PIV Card Application for
which conformance tests are given in this document is shown in Figure 1. The conformance
tests in this document apply to the areas highlighted with dashed lines in Figure 1.

     +    PIV Middleware is a software application that is the interface between an agency’s
          PIV implementation and the PIV Card Application. It allows the agency’s
          applications to remain independent of the underlying operating system platform. The
          PIV Middleware has the following two functions:
             1. It implements the functions for the PIV Client API (Part 3 of SP 800-73-4).

             2. It generates the appropriate commands (also called application protocol data
                 units or APDUs) for the PIV Card Command Interface (card edge interface –
                 Part 2 of SP 800-73-4) and thus communicates with the PIV Card Application.
          The PIV Card Application resides on the card, implements the commands in the PIV
          Card Command Interface (Part 2 of SP 800-73-4), and provides access to objects of
          the PIV data model. The PIV data model defines the logical use of the on-card
          application space including the SP 800-73-4 Part 1 required data objects and data
          elements, along with the size and structure of each object.
