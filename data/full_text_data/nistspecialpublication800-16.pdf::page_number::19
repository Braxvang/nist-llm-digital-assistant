Information Technology Security Training Requirements


             criteria, exhibits, and appendices that will enable Federal agencies and organizations to

             ensure that their workforce keeps abreast of changes in information technology and the
             impact of such changes on the protection of information and systems.


1.4        Use of this Document

The overall goal for use of this document is to facilitate the development or strengthening of a
comprehensive, measurable, cost-effective IT security program which supports the missions of
the organization and is administered as an integral element of sound IT management and
planning. Protecting the value of an organization's information assets demands no less. This
approach allows senior officials to understand where, in what way, and to what extent IT-related
job responsibilities include IT security responsibilities, permitting the most cost-effective
allocation of limited IT security training resources.


The issuance of this document is not intended to significantly modify Federal agencies' ongoing
IT security awareness programs and activities, or to invalidate their FT security training courses
or courseware. Rather, their courses will require comprehensive review and revalidation in
accordance with this new performance-based model and requirements.            It is expected that

agencies and organizations will find training gaps and will need to establish priorities and
strategies for filling them. This process cannot be accomplished by a single organization's FT
security program office working alone.        Instead, it requires a broad, cross-organizational strategy
at the executive level to bring together various functions and organization entities that     may not
have previously worked together. The perspectives and expertise of training center personnel,
course designers, program analysts, IT security specialists, training evaluators, and specialists in
many related IT functional areas all are needed to achieve success. To assist in achieving this
goal. Exhibit 1-2, on the next page, identifies groups of individuals who will be able to use this
guidance document and suggests ways in which they may want to use it.
