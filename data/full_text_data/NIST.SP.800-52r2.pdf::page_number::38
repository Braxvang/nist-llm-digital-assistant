NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                                                 GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


3.4.3.3 Raw Public Keys

Applies to TLS versions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3

The Raw Public Keys extension, described in RFC 7250 [71], provides an alternative to
certificate-based authentication that only uses the information contained in the
SubjectPublicKeyInfo field in an X.509 version 3 certificate. While this reduces the size of the
public key structure and simplifies processing, it removes any assurances that a public key
belongs to a particular entity. To provide authentication when using this extension, an out-of-
band binding between a public key and entity must be used.

3.5      Client Authentication

Where strong cryptographic client authentication is required, TLS servers may use the TLS
protocol client authentication option to request a certificate from the client to cryptographically
authenticate the client. 26 For example, the Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Authentication
certificate [47] (and the associated private key) provides a suitable option for strong
authentication of federal employees and contractors. To ensure that agencies are positioned to
take full advantage of the PIV Card, all TLS servers that perform client authentication shall
implement certificate-based client authentication.

The client authentication option requires the server to implement the X.509 path validation
mechanism and a trust anchor store. Requirements for these mechanisms are specified in
Sections 3.5.1 and 3.5.2, respectively. To ensure that cryptographic authentication actually
results in strong authentication, client keys shall be capable of providing at least 112 bits of
security. Section 3.5.3 describes mechanisms that can contribute, albeit indirectly, to enforcing
this requirement. Section 3.5.4 describes the client’s use of the server hints list.

The TLS server shall be configurable to terminate the connection with a fatal “handshake
failure” alert when a client certificate is requested and the client does not have a suitable
certificate.

3.5.1      Path Validation

The client certificate shall be validated in accordance with the certification path validation rules
specified in Section 6 of [19]. In addition, the revocation status of each certificate in the
certification path shall be validated using the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) or a
certificate revocation list (CRL). OCSP checking shall be in compliance with RFC 6960 [63].




26 The CertificateVerify handshake message is sent to explicitly verify a client certificate that has a signing capability. In TLS 1.1

      (and TLS 1.0), this message uses SHA-1 to generate a signature on all handshake messages that came before it. SP 800-
      131A [10] states that the use of SHA-1 for digital signature generation is disallowed after 2013. Even if a collision is found,
      the client must use its private key to authenticate itself by signing the hash. Due to the client random and server random
      values, the server, the client, or a third party cannot use a colliding set of messages to masquerade as the client or server in
      future connections. Any modification to this message, preceding messages, or subsequent messages will ultimately result in
      a failed connection. Therefore, SHA-1 is allowed for generating digital signatures in the TLS CertificateVerify message.
