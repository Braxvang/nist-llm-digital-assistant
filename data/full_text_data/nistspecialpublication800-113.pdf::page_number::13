2.    Network and Transport Layer Security

This section provides a general introduction to network and transport layer security. Network layer
security protects network communications at the layer that is responsible for routing packets across
networks. Transport layer security provides security at the layer responsible for end-to-end
communications. This section first introduces the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
(TCP/IP) model and its layers and then discusses the need to use security controls at each layer to protect
communications. It provides a brief introduction to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and its successor,
Transport Layer Security (TLS), primarily focused on the types of protection that SSL can provide for
communications. This section also provides a brief introduction to virtual private networking (VPN)
services and explains what types of protection a VPN can provide. It introduces three VPN architecture
models and discusses the features and common uses of each model. This document discusses only the
most common VPN scenarios and uses of SSL.

2.1   The Need for Network and Transport Layer Security

TCP/IP is widely used throughout the world to provide network communications. TCP/IP
communications are composed of four layers that work together. When a user wants to transfer data
across networks, the data is passed from the highest layer through intermediate layers to the lowest layer,
with each layer adding information. At each layer, the logical units are typically composed of a header
and a payload. The payload consists of the information passed down from the previous layer, while the
header contains layer-specific information such as addresses. At the application layer, the payload is the
actual application data. The lowest layer sends the accumulated data through the physical network; the
data is then passed up through the layers to its destination. Essentially, the data produced by a layer is
encapsulated in a larger container by the layer below it. The four TCP/IP layers, from highest to lowest,
are shown in Figure 2-1.

                  Application Layer. This layer sends and receives data for particular
                  applications, such as Domain Name System (DNS), HyperText Transfer
                  Protocol (HTTP), and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).
                  Transport Layer. This layer provides connection-oriented or connectionless
                  services for transporting application layer services between networks. The
                  transport layer can optionally assure the reliability of communications.
                  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are
                  commonly used transport layer protocols.
                  Network Layer. This layer routes packets across networks. Internet Protocol
                  (IP) is the fundamental network layer protocol for TCP/IP. Other commonly
                  used protocols at the network layer are Internet Control Message Protocol
                  (ICMP) and Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP).
                  Data Link Layer. This layer handles communications on the physical network
                  components. The best-known data link layer protocol is Ethernet.

                                          Figure 2-1. TCP/IP Layers

Security controls exist for network communications at each layer of the TCP/IP model. As previously
explained, data is passed from the highest to the lowest layer, with each layer adding more information.
Because of this, a security control at a higher layer cannot provide protection for lower layers, because the
lower layers perform functions of which the higher layers are not aware. Security controls that are
available at each layer include:

Â„ Application Layer. Separate controls must be established for each application. For example, if an
  application needs to protect sensitive data sent across networks, the application may need to be
