8.    Biometric sensor interface specifications

8.1   Scope
This Section guides implementers of biometric enrollment and authentication applications that use biometric sensors.

8.2   Available specifications and standards
The Biometric Identity Assurance Services standard [BIAS] standardizes remotely invoked biometric services,
particularly it defines a framework for deploying and invoking biometrics-based identity assurance capabilities that
can be readily accessed using services-based frameworks (e.g., web services). Excluded from the scope is a) single
platform functionality (e.g., client-side capture) and b) integration of biometric services within an authentication
protocol.
NIST Special Publication 500-288 SpeciÔ¨Åcation for Web Services Biometric Devices [WSBD], establishes specifications
for access to, and command and control of, a target biometric sensor by enrollment or recognition clients via web
services. As such, it leverages formal standardization of web services, and the wide availability of infrastructure and
resources supporting such, to allow PIV implementers to maximize device-interface level interoperability i.e., the
ability to replace a biometric sensor with minimal specialization. PIV implementers should consider the utility of
[WSBD] and its supporting tools and documents.
PIV implementers should also note the availability of standard BioAPI Function Provider Interfaces for the sensor
[BIOAPI-SENS] and for archives [BIOAPI-ARCH], and the general BioAPI standards [BIOAPI, BIOAPI-GUI, BIOAPI-FF,
BIOAPI-SEC]. The simpler version 1 predecessor [BIOAPI-US] also exists. These have similar goals to those of [WSBD]
but take a different approach.
