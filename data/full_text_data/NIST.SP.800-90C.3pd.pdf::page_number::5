 85   Reports on Computer Systems Technology
 86   The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and
 87   Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical
 88   leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test
 89   methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the
 90   development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the
 91   development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for
 92   the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in federal
 93   information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and
 94   outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities with industry,
 95   government, and academic organizations.

 96   Abstract
 97   The NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-90 series of documents supports the generation of high-
 98   quality random bits for cryptographic and non-cryptographic use. SP 800-90A specifies several
 99   deterministic random bit generator (DRBG) mechanisms based on cryptographic algorithms. SP
100   800-90B provides guidance for the development and validation of entropy sources. This document
101   (SP 800-90C) specifies constructions for the implementation of random bit generators (RBGs) that
102   include DRBG mechanisms as specified in SP 800-90A and that use entropy sources as specified
103   in SP 800-90B. Constructions for three classes of RBGs (namely, RBG1, RBG2, and RBG3) are
104   specified in this document.

107   (RBG); randomness source; RBG1 construction; RBG2 construction; RBG3 construction;
108   subordinate DRBG (sub-DRBG).
