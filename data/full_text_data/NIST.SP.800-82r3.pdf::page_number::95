NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

            Organizations should also consider that different levels, tiers, and zones
            may have different availability requirements and, as such, may have
            different abilities to support patching. Whenever possible, organizations
            should prioritize patching components within DMZ environments and
            when vulnerabilities exist that impact availability and integrity or would
            allow unauthorized remote access to the OT environment.

5.2.5.3.       Secure Code Development
Organizations that develop in-house systems and components should incorporate policies and
procedures that support and validate secure code development practices into the cybersecurity
program. The software development life cycle (SDLC) should include security during each phase
of software development. This should include security reviews and coding techniques for each of
the following processes:
   •   Using or developing tools to audit and automate secure code techniques
   •   Testing and reviewing code to comply with secure coding practices
   •   Testing the software for security errors in programming
For organizations that procure components or services from third parties, reviewing these same
practices should be considered prior to executing contracts with vendors. Organizations can help
industries move toward more secure products by requesting these practices in their service-level
agreements and procurement actions.

5.2.5.4.       Configuration Management
Applying configuration management practices that support secure configurations and application
hardening is important to meet organizational and regulatory security requirements. These
settings may include setting access controls to restrict access or enabling encryption to protect
data at rest or in transit. Application hardening procedures may include disabling or blocking
specific network communication ports, application features, or unnecessary services that run on
the system.
Encrypting data that flows over networks (i.e., in transit) or data stored in memory and local
storage (i.e., at rest) can also be used in defending OT. Encryption prevents an attacker from
viewing or modifying cleartext data streams. Because encryption and the subsequent decryption
process use algorithms to create ciphers, encryption adds latency and may not be suitable for all
OT devices. Knowing the advantages and disadvantages of encryption can help organizations
make an informed decision on where to include encryption in the defense-in-depth strategy.
            OT-Specific Recommendations and Guidance
            Organizations should consider using encryption to support secure
            connections or conduits for OT environments when the connections must
            pass over non-OT network segments, such as the corporate network or
            the internet. Virtual private network (VPN) connections should also use
            encryption protocols, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Internet
            Protocol Security (IPsec), to secure the data.
