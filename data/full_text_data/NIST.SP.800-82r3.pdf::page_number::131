                   •   Power. Reliable power for OT is essential, so a UPS should be
                       provided for critical systems. If the site has an emergency
                       generator, the UPS battery life may only need to last for a few
                       seconds. However, if the site relies on external power, the UPS
                       battery life may need to last for hours. At a minimum, it should
                       be sized so that the system can be shut down safely.

6.2.4.5.     Response and Recovery Plans (PR.IP-9) and Response and Recovery
       Plan Testing (PR.IP-10)
Organizations should develop and maintain response plans, including incident response and
business continuity. Response plans should be measured against the service being provided, not
just the system that was compromised. Organizations should consider a systematic approach to
response planning, such as the process described in CISA’s Cybersecurity Incident and
Vulnerability Response Playbooks [CISA-CIVR]. Common planning steps include preparation,
detection and analysis, containment, recovery, post-incident activity, communication, and
coordination. Organizations should also regularly review and update their response plans.
The response plans should be documented in paper form or on an offline system (i.e., air gapped)
that cannot be compromised during a cyber attack. Individuals should be trained on where to find
the response plan and the actions to take as part of an incident response. Additionally, during the
preparation of the incident response plan, input should be obtained from the various
stakeholders, including operations, engineering, IT, system support vendors, management,
organized labor, legal, and safety. These stakeholders should also review and approve the plan.
Business continuity planning addresses the overall issue of maintaining or reestablishing
production in the case of an interruption. An outage can take days, weeks, or months to recover
from a natural disaster or minutes or hours to recover from a malware infection or a mechanical
or electrical failure. Business continuity plans (BCPs) are often written to cover many types of
incidents involving several different disciplines. The BCP for cybersecurity incidents should
broadly cover long-term outages, including disaster recovery, and short-term outages that require
operational recovery. It is important to work with physical security on developing the BCP
related to cybersecurity incidents. This collaboration with physical security should include the
identification of critical equipment and the associated countermeasures in place to prevent an
incident.
Before creating a BCP to address potential outages, it is important to specify the recovery
objectives for the various systems and subsystems involved based on typical business needs.
There are two distinct types of objectives: system recovery and data recovery. System recovery
involves the recovery of communication links and processing capabilities and is usually specified
in terms of a recovery time objective (RTO). Management should define the acceptable RTO,
and technical personnel should work to achieve that target. Data recovery involves the recovery
of data that describes production or product conditions in the past and is usually specified in
terms of a recovery point objective (RPO). This is defined as the time for which an absence of
data can be tolerated. The RTO and RPO may justify investment in spare inventory if recovery
objectives cannot be met by other means.
Once the recovery objectives are defined, a list of potential interruptions should be created, and
the recovery procedure should be developed and described. A contingency plan is then created
