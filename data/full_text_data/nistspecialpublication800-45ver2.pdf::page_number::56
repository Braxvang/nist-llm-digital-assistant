GUIDELINES ON ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY



messages not containing malware to the mail server, which is configured to listen on an unprivileged,
unused port, rather than the usual port 25. A disadvantage to this approach is that constant scanning of
the SMTP stream can reduce firewall/ mail relay/mail gateway performance. Whether this performance
hit is significant depends on mail load, including both the typical number of emails per day and the peak
rates of emails, and quality of service requirements. One remedy to improve performance is to offload
malware scanning to a dedicated server.




                           Figure 6.1: Malware Scanning Implemented on Firewall

The benefits of scanning email at the firewall, mail relay, or mail gateway appliance are as follows:

 Can scan email in both directions (inbound and outbound from the organization’s network)
 Can stop the majority of messages containing malware at the perimeter before they enter the network
  and are passed to the mail server
 Can implement scanning for inbound email with minor changes to the existing mail server
  configuration
 Can reduce the amount of email reaching the mail servers, allowing them to operate more efficiently
  with lower operational costs
 Can reduce the amount of scanning to be performed by the mail servers, thus reducing their load
 Can centrally manage scanning to ensure compliance with the organization’s security policy and
  regular application of updated malicious code signatures
 For some mail firewall appliances, can provide secure authenticated access to Web-based mail
  applications.
Scanning for malware at the firewall, mail relay, or mail gateway appliance has a number of weaknesses:

 Can require significant modification of the existing mail server configuration when scanning mail in
  the outbound direction
 Cannot scan encrypted emails
