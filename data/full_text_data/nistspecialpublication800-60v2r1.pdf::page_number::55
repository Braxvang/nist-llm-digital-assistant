Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
service recovery information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the service recovery information. The
effects of disruption of access to service recovery information or information systems depend on
the timing of the disruption. If access to service recovery information is denied because of a
power outage, recovery may be delayed and the work of government agencies disrupted.

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Service recovery planning processes are
usually tolerant of delay. In contrast, the implementation of recovery plans is not tolerant of
delays. For service recovery implementation, the consequences of access disruption depend on
the time period of the disruption and the criticality of the disrupted processes. The consequent
impact level may range from low to high.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
service recovery information is low.

C.2.5 Revenue Collection

Revenue Collection includes the collection of Government income from all sources. Note: Tax
collection is accounted for under the Taxation Management information type in the General
Government mission area.
C.2.5.1 Debt Collection Information Type

Debt Collection supports activities associated with the collection of money owed to the United
States government from both foreign and domestic sources. The recommended security
categorization for debt collection information is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Moderate), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of debt collection
information on the ability of responsible agencies to properly and efficiently collect money owed
to the United States government from both foreign and domestic sources. The consequences of
unauthorized disclosure of debt collection information are generally dependent on the identity of
the debtor and of the nature and value of the debt being collected. Typically, unauthorized
disclosure of debt collection information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency
operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where more sensitive information is
involved, it will commonly be personal information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974,
information that is proprietary to a corporation or other organization, or information that is
politically sensitive by a foreign government. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact
levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. Such
information will often be associated with debt collection processes. Where the amount of the
debt is significant, and unauthorized knowledge might imperil successful collection, then the
