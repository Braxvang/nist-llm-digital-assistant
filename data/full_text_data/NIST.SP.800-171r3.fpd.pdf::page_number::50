       NIST SP 800-171r3 fpd (Final Public Draft)                     Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information
       November 2023

1272           DISCUSSION
1273           Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are conducted by individuals who communicate
1274           through an external or internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are carried
1275           out by individuals who are physically present at the system location and not communicating
1276           across a network connection. Authentication techniques used to establish nonlocal maintenance
1277           and diagnostic sessions reflect the requirements in 03.05.01.

1281   3.7.6. Maintenance Personnel
1282           REQUIREMENT: 03.07.06
1283           a. Establish a process for maintenance personnel authorization.
1284           b. Maintain a list of authorized maintenance organizations or personnel.
1285           c.   Verify that non-escorted personnel who perform maintenance on the system possess the
1286                required access authorizations.
1287           d. Designate organizational personnel with required access authorizations and technical
1288              competence to supervise the maintenance activities of personnel who do not possess the
1289              required access authorizations.

1290           DISCUSSION
1291           Maintenance personnel refers to individuals who perform hardware or software maintenance on
1292           the system, while 03.10.01 addresses physical access for individuals whose maintenance duties
1293           place them within the physical protection perimeter of the system. The technical competence of
1294           supervising individuals relates to the maintenance performed on the system, while having
1295           required access authorizations refers to maintenance on and near the system. Individuals who
1296           have not been previously identified as authorized maintenance personnel (e.g., manufacturers,
1297           consultants, systems integrators, and vendors) may require privileged access to the system, such
1298           as when they are required to conduct maintenance with little or no notice. Organizations may
1299           choose to issue temporary credentials to these individuals based on their risk assessments.
1300           Temporary credentials may be for one-time use or for very limited time periods.

1304         Media Protection

1305   3.8.1. Media Storage
1306           REQUIREMENT: 03.08.01
1307           Physically control and securely store system media containing CUI until the media are destroyed
