NORMATIVE NOTES:
1.       The length of the entire record shall fit within the container size limits specified in [800-73]. These limits apply to
         the entire CBEFF-wrapped and signed entity, not just the [FACESTD] record. Key lengths and signing algorithms
         are specified in [800-78]. The size of the digital signature scales with the key length; it does not scale with the
         size of the biometric record.
2.       More than one image may be stored in the record. It may be appropriate to store several images if appearance
         changes over time (beard, no beard, beard) and images are gathered at re-issuance. The most recent image shall
         appear first and serve as the default provided to applications. PIV Card capacity, however, will limit the number
         of images that can be stored (usually to one).
3.       The recommendation is that only one image should be stored on the PIV Card.
4.       PIV facial images shall conform to the Full Frontal Image Type defined in Clause 8 of [FACESTD].
5.       Facial image data shall be formatted in either of the compression formats enumerated in Clause 6.2 of [FACESTD].
         Both whole-image and single-region-of-interest (ROI) compression are permitted. This document ([800-76])
         recommends that newly collected facial image should be compressed using ISO/IEC 15444 (i.e., JPEG 2000). This
         applies when images will be input to automated face recognition products for authentication, and when images
         are stored on PIV Cards. In this latter case, ROI compression should be used. The older ISO/IEC 10918 standard
         (i.e., JPEG) should be used only for legacy images.
6.       Facial images shall be compressed using a compression ratio no higher than 15:1. However, when facial images
         are stored on PIV Cards JPEG 2000 should be used with ROI compression. The innermost region should be
         centered on the face and compressed at no more than 24:1.
7.       Face recognition performance is a function of the spatial resolution of the image. [FACESTD] does not specify a
         minimum resolution for the Full Frontal Image Type. For PIV, faces shall be acquired such that a 20 centimeter
         target placed on, and normal to, a camera's optical axis at a range of 1.5 meters shall be imaged with at least 240
         pixels across it. This ensures that the width of the head (i.e., dimension CC in Figure 8 of [FACESTD]) shall have
         sufficient resolution for the printed face element of the PIV Card. This specification and Clause 8.3.4 of
         [FACESTD] implies that the image width shall exceed 420 pixels. This resolution specification shall be attained
         optically without digital interpolation. The distance from the camera to the subject should be greater than or
         equal to 1.5 meters (for distortion reasons discussed in [FACESTD, Annex A.8]). While the size specification is a
         minimum, larger sizes might be used but this would require greater compression to achieve the size mandated by
         [800-73].
8.       Facial image data shall be converted to the sRGB color space. As stated in Clause 7.4.3.3 of [FACESTD] this
         requires application of the color profile associated with the camera in use.

7.3        Performance specifications for PIV operations
[FIPS] allows automated face recognition for certain authentication purposes. Automated face recognition
implementations shall be configured according to the specifications of Section 10. This standard does not establish
qualification criteria for face recognition algorithms; Agencies should consult available test reports to select capable
algorithms, for example [FACEPERF].
