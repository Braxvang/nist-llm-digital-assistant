 I.7.3. Security Activities and Tasks
 MS-1    PREPARE FOR MEASUREMENT
         MS-1.1 Define the security aspects of the measurement strategy.
MS-1.2 Describe the characteristics of the organization that are relevant to security measurement.
         MS-1.3 Identify and prioritize security-relevant information needs.
         Note: The needs are based on protection objectives, risks, and other security-relevant items
         related to project decisions.
         MS-1.4 Select and specify measures that satisfy security-relevant information needs.
         MS-1.5 Define procedures for the collection, analysis, access, and reporting of security-
                relevant data.
         MS-1.6 Define security-relevant criteria for evaluating the information items and the
                measurement process.
         Note: All criteria for a security-relevant information item are security-relevant.
         MS-1.7 Identify the security aspects for enabling the systems or services needed to support
                measurement.
         MS-1.8 Identify and plan for enabling the systems or services needed to support the security
                aspects of measurement.
         MS-1.9 Obtain or acquire access to the security aspects of enabling systems or services to be
                used in measurement.

 MS-2    PERFORM MEASUREMENT
         MS-2.1 Integrate procedures for the generation, collection, analysis, and reporting of security-
                relevant data into the relevant processes.
         MS-2.2 Integrate procedures for the secure generation, collection, analysis, and reporting of
                data into the relevant processes.
         MS-2.3 Collect, store, and verify security-relevant data.
         MS-2.4 Securely collect, store, and verify data.
         MS-2.5 Analyze security-relevant data, and develop security-relevant information items.
         MS-2.6 Record security measurement results, and inform the measurement users.
         Note: Security measurement results are provided to stakeholders and project personnel to
         support decision-making and risk management and to initiate corrective actions and
         improvements.
