NIST SP 800-52 REV. 2                                         GUIDELINES FOR TLS IMPLEMENTATIONS


4.4.1.3 Extended Master Secret

Applies to TLS versions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2

The Extended Master Secret extension described in Section 3.4.1.3 prevents man-in-the-middle
attacks by binding the master secret to a hashed log of the full handshake. The client shall
support this extension.

4.4.1.4 Signature Algorithms

Applies to TLS versions: 1.2, 1.3

The clients shall assert acceptable hashing and signature algorithm pairs in this extension in TLS
1.2 and TLS 1.3 ClientHello messages. The extension, its syntax, and processing rules are
described in Sections 7.4.1.4.1, 7.4.4, 7.4.6 and 7.4.8 of RFC 5246 [25] and in Section 4.2.3 of
RFC 8446 [57]. Note that the extension described in RFC 8446 updates the extension described
in RFC 5246 by adding an additional signature scheme.

4.4.1.5 Certificate Status Request

Applies to TLS versions: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3

The client shall include the “status_request” extension in the ClientHello message.

4.4.2   Conditional TLS Extensions

A TLS client supports the following TLS extensions under the circumstances described:

   1. The Fallback Signaling Cipher Suite Value (SCSV) shall be supported if the client
       supports versions of TLS prior to TLS 1.2 and does not support TLS 1.3.
   2. The Supported Groups extension shall be supported if the client supports ephemeral
       ECDH cipher suites or if the client supports TLS 1.3.
   3. The Key Share extension shall be supported if the client supports TLS 1.3.
   4. The EC Point Format TLS extension shall be supported if the client supports EC cipher
       suite(s).
   5. The Multiple Certificate Status extension should be enabled if the extension is supported
       by the client implementation.
   6. The Trusted CA Indication extension should be supported by clients that run on memory-
       constrained devices where only a small number of CA root keys are stored.
   7. The Encrypt-then-MAC extension shall be supported when CBC mode cipher suites are
       configured.
   8. The Truncated HMAC extension may be supported by clients that run on constrained
       devices when variable-length padding is not supported and cipher suites that use CBC
       mode are supported.
   9. The Pre-Shared Key extension may be supported by TLS 1.3 clients.
   10. The Pre-Shared Key Exchange Modes extension shall be supported by TLS 1.3 clients
       that support the Pre-Shared Key extension.
   11. The Supported Versions extension shall be supported by TLS 1.3 clients.
