In a few cases, records associated with the grants may include information subject to privacy
restrictions (e.g., the Privacy Act of 1974). (The Privacy Act Information provisional impact
levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type.) In many
cases, premature and unauthorized disclosure can affect the integrity of the grants process, giving
an unfair competitive advantage to one or more applicants. In such cases, punitive consequences
and/or loss of public confidence can have a seriously disruptive effect on an agencyâ€™s operations
and mission. In such cases, the confidentiality impact level would be moderate.

Recommended Confidentiality Impact Level: The provisional confidentiality impact level
recommended for most project/competitive grants information is low.
Integrity
The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission,
not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information.
Project/competitive grants activities are not generally time-critical. In most cases, the adverse
effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of project/competitive grants information on
agency mission functions or public confidence in the agency will be limited.

Recommended Integrity Impact Level: The provisional integrity impact level recommended for
project/competitive grants information is low.
Availability
The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that
mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to project/competitive grants information.
Project/competitive grants processes are generally tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of
access to project/competitive grants information can be expected to have only a limited adverse
effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Recommended Availability Impact Level: The provisional availability impact level recommended for
project/competitive grants information is low.

D.25.3 Earmarked Grants Information Type

Earmarked Grants involves the distribution of money to State and Local Governments for a
named purpose or service usually specifically noted by Congress in appropriations language, or
other program authorizing language. The recommended provisional security categorization for
the earmarked grants information type is as follows:
Security Category = {(confidentiality, Low), (integrity, Low), (availability, Low)}

Confidentiality
The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of earmarked grants
information on the ability of responsible Federal government entities to distribute money to State
and Local Governments for a named purpose or service usually specifically noted by Congress in
appropriations language, or other program authorizing language. In the majority of cases,
