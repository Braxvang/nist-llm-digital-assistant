The following discussion provides a more detailed description of each level and the methods
used for data extraction.

       Manual Extraction – A manual extraction method involves viewing the data content
        stored on a mobile device. The content displayed on the LCD screen requires the
        manual manipulation of the buttons, keyboard or touchscreen to view the contents of
        the mobile device. Information discovered may be recorded using an external digital
        camera. At this level, it is impossible to recover deleted information. Some tools have
        been developed to provide the forensic examiner with the ability to document and
        categorize the information recorded more quickly. Nevertheless, if there is a large
        amount of data to be captured, a manual extraction can be very time consuming and
        the data on the device may be inadvertently modified, deleted or overwritten as a
        result of the examination. Manual extractions become increasingly difficult and
        perhaps unachievable when encountering a broken/missing LCD screen or a
        damaged/missing keyboard interface. Additional challenges occur when the device is
        configured to display a language unknown to the investigator; this may cause
        difficulty in successful menu navigation.

       Logical Extraction – Connectivity between a mobile device and the forensics
        workstation is achieved with a connection using either a wired (e.g., USB or RS-232)
        or wireless (e.g., IrDA, WiFi, or Bluetooth) connection. The examiner should be
        aware of the issues associated when selecting a specific connectivity method, as
        different connection types and associated protocols may result in data being modified
        (e.g., unread SMS) or different amounts or types of data being extracted. Logical
        extraction tools begin by sending a series of commands over the established interface
        from the computer to the mobile device. The mobile device responds based upon the
        command request. The response (mobile device data) is sent back to the workstation
        and presented to the forensics examiner for reporting purposes.

       Hex Dumping and JTAG – Hex Dumping and Joint Test Action Group (JTAG)
        extraction methods afford the forensic examiner more direct access to the raw
                                          17
