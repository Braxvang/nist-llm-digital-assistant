GUIDE TO INTEGRATING FORENSIC TECHNIQUES INTO INCIDENT RESPONSE



        By considering these three factors for each potential data source, analysts can make informed
        decisions regarding the prioritization of data source acquisition, as well as determining which
        data sources to acquire. In some cases, there are so many possible data sources that it is not
        practical to acquire them all. Organizations should carefully consider the complexities of
        prioritizing data source acquisition and develop written plans, guidelines, and procedures that can
        help analysts perform prioritization effectively.

    2. Acquire the data. If the data has not already been acquired by security tools, analysis tools, or
       other means, the general process for acquiring data involves using forensic tools to collect
       volatile data, duplicating non-volatile data sources to collect their data, and securing the original
       non-volatile data sources. Data acquisition can be performed either locally or over a network.
       Although it is generally preferable to acquire data locally because there is greater control over the
       system and data, local data collection is not always feasible (e.g., system in locked room, system
       in another location). When acquiring data over a network, decisions should be made regarding
       the type of data to be collected and the amount of effort to use. For instance, it might be
       necessary to acquire data from several systems through different network connections, or it might
       be sufficient to copy a logical volume from just one system.

    3. Verify the integrity of the data. After the data has been acquired, its integrity should be
       verified. It is particularly important for an analyst to prove that the data has not been tampered
       with if it might be needed for legal reasons. Data integrity verification typically consists of using
       tools to compute the message digest of the original and copied data, then comparing the digests to
       make sure that they are the same.

Before the analyst begins to collect any data, a decision should be made by the analyst or
management (in accordance with the organizationâ€™s policies and legal advisors) on the need to
collect and preserve evidence in a way that supports its use in future legal or internal disciplinary
proceedings. In such situations, a clearly defined chain of custody should be followed to avoid
allegations of mishandling or tampering of evidence. This involves keeping a log of every person
who had physical custody of the evidence, documenting the actions that they performed on the
evidence and at what time, storing the evidence in a secure location when it is not being used,
making a copy of the evidence and performing examination and analysis using only the copied
evidence, and verifying the integrity of the original and copied evidence. If it is unclear whether or
not evidence needs to be preserved, by default it generally should be preserved.

In addition, several other steps should be taken. Throughout the process, a detailed log should be kept of
every step that was taken to collect the data, including information about each tool used in the process.
The documentation allows other analysts to repeat the process later if needed. Additionally, evidence
should be photographed to provide visual reminders of the computer setup and peripheral devices. In
addition, before actually touching a system, the analyst should make a note or photograph of any pictures,
documents, running programs, and other relevant information displayed on the monitor. If a screen saver
is active, that should be documented as well since it may be password-protected. If possible, one person
on the scene should be designated the evidence custodian, and given the sole responsibility to photograph,
document, and label every item that is collected, and record every action that was taken along with who
performed the action, where it was performed, and at what time. Since the evidence may not be needed
for legal proceedings for an extended time, proper documentation enables an analyst to remember exactly
what was done to collect data and can be used to refute claims of mishandling.

To assist the analyst with evidence collection, the necessary resources, such as forensic workstations,
backup devices, blank media, and evidence handling supplies (e.g., hard-bound notebooks, chain of
custody forms, evidence storage bags and tags, evidence tape, digital cameras) should be prepared
