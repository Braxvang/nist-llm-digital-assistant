                                                           SECURE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE



In this subprocess, the resolver starts from a known list of trusted public keys (called trust anchors) and
establishes trust in the public key of the zone in a given response by traversing through a chain of public
keys, building the chain by using the DNS name space hierarchy. The trust anchors in a resolver ideally
consist of the root public keys (if root servers are DNSSEC-aware) or public keys of zones lower in the
hierarchy. The trust anchor list in a resolver is not built through a DNS transaction; it uses an out-of-band
mechanism.

The DNSSEC processes described above involve several name server operations and a few resolver
operations. The name server operations are as follows:

      •    DNSSEC-OP1: Generation of public key-private key pair

      •    DNSSEC-OP2: Secure storage of private keys

      •    DNSSEC-OP3: Public key distribution

      •    DNSSEC-OP4: Zone signing

      •    DNSSEC-OP5: Key rollover (changing of keys)

      •    DNSSEC-OP6: Zone re-signing.
The resolver operations are as follows:

      •    DNSSEC-OP7: Trust anchors’ configuration

      •    DNSSEC-OP8: Establishing trusted chain and signature verification.
Name server operations DNSSEC-OP1 through DNSSEC-OP4 and resolver operations DNSSEC-OP7
and DNSSEC-OP8 are performed either prior to DNSSEC deployment or for secure operation (serving
signed responses and verification of signatures) and hence are covered in this section. The remaining
name server operations (key rollovers and zone re-signing – DNSSEC-OP5 and DNSSEC-OP6
respectively) are performed on a periodic basis after a fully operational DNSSEC deployment and hence
are covered in Section 11.

9.3       Generation of Public Key-Private Key Pair (DNSSEC-OP1)

DNSSEC specifies generation and verification of digital signatures using asymmetric keys. This requires
generation of a public key-private key pair. Although the DNSSEC specification does not call for
different keys (just one key pair), experience from pilot implementations suggests that for easier routine
security administration operations such as key rollover (changing of keys) and zone re-signing, at least
two different types of keys are needed. One set is called Key Signing Key (KSK). This key (specifically,
the private part of the key pair, called KSK-private) will be used only for signing the key set (i.e.,
DNSKEY RRSet) in the zone file. The other key type is called the Zone Signing Key (ZSK) (whose
private part is called ZSK-private) and will be used to sign all RRsets in the zone (including DNSKEY
RRSet). An administrative distinction is made between the KSK and ZSK keys by setting the Secure
Entry Point (SEP) flag bit in the DNSKEY RR that represents the public part of those keys (in this case, it
would be called KSK-public).

The logic behind creation of two types of key pairs is to provide separate set of functions for each key
type and thus reduce the overall complexity of tasks involved in key rollovers and zone re-signing.
