           Vulnerability                                               Description
  Inadequate organizational           Risk assessments should be performed with acknowledgement from
  ownership of risk assessments       appropriate levels within the organization. The lack of understanding of
                                      risk could lead to under-mitigated scenarios or inadequate funding and
                                      selection of controls.
  Inadequate security policy for OT   Vulnerabilities are often introduced into the OT environment due to
                                      inadequate policies or the lack of policies specifically for OT system
                                      security. Controls and countermeasures should be derived from a risk
                                      assessment or policy to ensure uniformity and accountability.
  Inadequate OT security training     A documented formal OT security training and awareness program is
  and awareness program               designed to keep staff up to date on organizational security policies and
                                      procedures, threats, industry cybersecurity standards, and recommended
                                      practices. Without adequate ongoing training on specific OT policies and
                                      procedures, staff cannot be expected to maintain a secure OT environment.
  Lack of inventory management        Inventory policy and procedures should include installation, removal, and
  policy                              changes made to hardware, firmware, and software. An incomplete
                                      inventory could lead to unmanaged and unprotected devices within the OT
                                      environment.
  Lack of configuration               Lack of policy and procedures for OT configuration management can lead
  management policy                   to an unmanageable and highly vulnerable inventory of hardware,
                                      firmware, and software.
  Inadequate OT equipment             Equipment implementation guidelines should be kept up to date and
  implementation guidelines           readily available. These guidelines are an integral part of security
                                      procedures in the event of an OT malfunction.
  Lack of administrative              Without accountability for enforcing policy, there is limited ability to
  mechanisms for security policy      ensure that security policies are followed adequately. Administrative
  enforcement                         mechanisms should be in place to ensure accountability.
  Inadequate review of the            Procedures and schedules should exist to determine the extent to which the
  effectiveness of the OT security    security program and its constituent controls are implemented correctly,
  controls                            operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to
                                      meeting the security requirements of the OT. The examination is
                                      sometimes called an “audit,” “evaluation,” or “assessment.” Policy should
                                      address the stage of the life cycle, purpose, technical expertise,
                                      methodology, and level of independence.
  No OT-specific contingency plan     A contingency plan (e.g., business continuity plan, disaster recovery plan)
                                      should be prepared, tested, and available in the event of a major hardware
                                      or software failure or destruction of facilities. The lack of a specific plan
                                      for the OT could lead to extended downtimes and production losses.
  Lack of adequate access control     Access control enforcement depends on policy that correctly models roles,
  policy                              responsibilities, and authorizations. The policy model must enable the way
                                      the organization functions.
  Lack of adequate authentication     Authentication policies are needed to define when authentication
  policy                              mechanisms (e.g., passwords, smart cards) must be used, how strong they
                                      must be, and how they must be maintained. Without this policy, systems
                                      may not have appropriate authentication controls, making unauthorized
                                      access to systems more likely. Authentication policies should be
                                      developed as part of an overall OT security program, taking into account
                                      the capabilities of the OT and its personnel to handle more complex
                                      passwords and other mechanisms.
