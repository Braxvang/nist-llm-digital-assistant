                      Fig. 20. An example SCADA system in an OT environment

Figure 21 shows an example defense-in-depth implementation for a SCADA system that
assumes that the organization has already addressed Layer 1 and Layer 2. For Layer 3, the
organization should consider incorporating the following capabilities in the security architecture:
   •   Separate networks into different zones or regions, which is important for applying a
       defense-in-depth strategy in a SCADA environment. Additional separation should be
       considered for security systems (e.g., physical monitoring and access controls, doors,
       gates, cameras, VoIP, access card readers).
   •   Boundary devices (e.g., firewalls) are added between the different regions to control and
       monitor communications between the network segments. Industrial-class stateful
       firewalls may offer more support for OT-specific protocols and enhance protection for
       OT devices, like the PLC and controllers. Rules for inbound and outbound
       communication should be defined so that only authorized communication passes between
       regions.
   •   Use secure connections (e.g., VPN tunnel, encrypted channel, point-to-point connection)
       between network segments, such as between a regional center and primary control
       centers and between remote stations and control centers. For geographically distanced
       locations, secure connections can be connected over the internet/WAN. Devices in the
       network segments should only connect to other segments through the secure connection
       and should be restricted when accessing the internet.
