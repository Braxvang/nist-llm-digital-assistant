SAMPLE COMPONENT TEST BRIEFING FOR PARTICIPANTS

On [insert date] between [insert time] and [insert time], the [insert component] for [organization or
policy] will be tested. Participants will be expected to perform the following tasks:

     [Insert task]
     [Insert task]
Test Cancellation Procedures: [Insert test cancellation procedures]

If you have any questions, please contact [insert point of contact].



SAMPLE COMPONENT TEST INJECT OR ACTION

Initiate the Emergency Alert System, which will perform the following functions:

     Discontinue normal programming.
     Broadcast the following message: "This is a test. This station [optional—insert station call sign]
      is conducting a test of the Emergency Broadcast System. This is only a test."
     Transmit the two-tone attention signal from the EBS encoder.
     Broadcast the following message: "This is a test of the Emergency Alert System. The
      broadcasters of your area in voluntary cooperation with the Federal, state and local authorities
      have developed this system to keep you informed in the event of an emergency. If this had been
      an actual emergency, [optional—stations may mention the types of emergencies likely to occur in
      their area] the Attention Signal you just heard would have been followed by official information,
      news or instructions. This station [optional—insert station call sign] serves the [insert
      operational area name] area. This concludes this test of the Emergency Alert System."



SAMPLE COMPONENT TEST VALIDATION

A test of a component requires validation criteria to determine whether the component or system
functioned as intended. Test validation should include the metrics by which the success of the component
or system will be measured. It should also detail the expected outcome; in this case, the two-tone
attention signal and message should be heard clearly.
