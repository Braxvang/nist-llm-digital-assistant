NIST SP 800-85A-4                                             PIV CARD APPLICATION & MIDDLEWARE
                                                                       INTERFACE TEST GUIDELINES

Required Vendor Information

VE05.22D-R4.01: The vendor shall state in its documentation that the card supports the assertions
made in AS05.22D-R4

Required Test Procedures

TE05.22D-R4.01: The tester shall validate that: 1) the vendor documentation contains the
information required in VE05.22D-R4.01; and 2) the card returns status word '6A 80' or '63 CX'
based on the conditions mentioned in AS05.22D-R4.


A.5.2.2     CHANGE REFERENCE DATA Card Command

AS05.23: Only reference data associated with key references '80' and '81' specific to the PIV
Card Application (i.e., local key reference) and the Global PIN with key reference '00' may be
changed by the PIV Card Application CHANGE REFERENCE DATA command. Key
reference '80' reference data shall be changed by the PIV Card Application CHANGE
REFERENCE DATA command. The ability to change reference data associated with key
references '81' and '00' using the PIV Card Application CHANGE REFERENCE DATA
command is optional. The PIV Card Application may allow the reference data associated with
other key references to be changed by the PIV Card Application CHANGE REFERENCE
DATA, if PIV Card Application will only perform the command with other key references if
the requirements specified in Section 2.9.2 of FIPS 201-2 are satisfied.

Required Vendor Information

VE05.23.01: The vendor shall state in its documentation that the card supports the assertion made in
AS05.23.

Required Test Procedures

TE05.23.01: The tester shall validate that reference data associated with key reference '80' can be
changed by the PIV Card Applicationâ€™s CHANGE REFERENCE DATA command. If the Discovery
Object is implemented with Bit 6 of the first byte of the PIN Usage Policy set to one and the
implementation supports changing the Global PIN with the CHANGE REFERENCE DATA
command, then the tester shall also validate that key reference '00' reference data can be changed by
the CHANGE REFERENCE DATA command. If the PUK can be changed with CHANGE
REFERENCE DATA, the tester shall validate that reference data associated with key reference '81'
can be changed by the PIV Card Application CHANGE REFERENCE DATA command.

AS05.24: WITHDRAWN

AS05.24A-R4: If key reference '81' is specified and the command is submitted over the
contactless interface (including SM or VCI), then the card command shall fail. If key reference
'00' or '80' is specified and the command is not submitted over either the contact interface or
