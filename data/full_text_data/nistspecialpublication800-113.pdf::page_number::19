                                                                                         GUIDE TO SSL VPNS



           circuit between two buildings or a dial-up modem connection to an ISP. Because each
           physical link must be secured separately, data link layer controls generally are not feasible for
           protecting connections that involve several links, such as connections across the Internet.
 IPsec is a framework of open standards for ensuring private communications over IP networks which
  has become the most commonly used network layer security control. SSL is an open standards track
  protocol that provides secure communications at the transport layer. Both protocols can provide
  several types of protection, including maintaining confidentiality and integrity, authenticating the
  origin of data, preventing packet replay and traffic analysis, and providing access protection.
 A VPN is a virtual network built on top of existing networks that can provide a secure
  communications mechanism for data and IP information transmitted between networks.
 Although VPNs can reduce the risks of networking, they cannot eliminate it. For example, a VPN
  implementation may have flaws in algorithms or software that attackers can exploit. Also, VPN
  implementations often have at least a slight negative impact on availability, because they add
  components and services to existing network infrastructures.
 There are two primary models for SSL VPN architectures:

       –   SSL portal VPN. These VPNs allow remote users with almost any Web browser to connect
           to a VPN gateway and access services from a Web site provided on the gateway. SSL portal
           VPNs are more accessible to a wider range of users than SSL tunnel VPNs because they can
           be run on more Web browsers, particularly those whose security policies prevent running of
           active content that is downloaded from the Internet.

       –   SSL tunnel VPN. These VPNs allow remote users with Web browsers that allow active
           content to access the network protected by a VPN gateway. SSL tunnel VPNs have many
           more capabilities than SSL portal VPNs because more services can be provided more easily.
