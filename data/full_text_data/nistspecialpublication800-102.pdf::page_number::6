3.1      Definitions

Approved               FIPS-approved and/or NIST-recommended. An algorithm or
                       technique that is either 1) specified in a FIPS or NIST
                       Recommendation, or 2) adopted in a FIPS or NIST
                       Recommendation or 3) specified in a list of NIST-approved
                       security functions.

Digital signature      The result of a cryptographic transformation of data that, when
                       properly implemented, provides origin authentication,
                       assurance of data integrity and signatory non-repudiation.

Entity                 An individual (person), organization, device or process. Used
                       interchangeably with “party”.

Hash value             The result of applying a hash function to data.

Key                    A parameter used in conjunction with a cryptographic
                       algorithm that determines its operation. Examples applicable to
                       this Recommendation include:
                         1. The computation of a digital signature from data, and
                         2. The verification of a digital signature.

Message                The data that is signed.

Nonce                  A time-varying value that has at most a negligible chance of
                       repeating, for example, a random value that is generated anew
                       for each use, a timestamp, a sequence number, or some
                       combination of these.

Party                  An individual (person), organization, device or process. Used
                       interchangeably with “entity”.

Private key/private    A cryptographic key that is used with an asymmetric (public
signature key          key) cryptographic algorithm and is associated with a public
                       key. The private key is uniquely associated with the owner and
                       is not made public. This key is used to compute a digital
                       signature that may be verified using the corresponding public
                       key.
