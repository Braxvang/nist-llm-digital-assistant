examination of the business case will support and facilitate the Obtain Resources phase, which
involves the following activities:

      •   Respond to budget evaluation inquiries;

      •   Receive allocated budget;

      •   Prioritize available resources (if all requested resources are not allocated); and

      •   Assign resources to perform corrective actions.

6.5       Apply Corrective Actions

Phase 6 of the information security measurement program implementation process, Apply
Corrective Actions, involves implementing corrective actions in the security program, or in the
technical, management, and operational areas of security controls. The POA&M process is used
to document and monitor the corrective action status.

Iterative data collection, analysis, and reporting will track the progress of corrective actions,
measure improvement, and identify areas where further improvement is needed. The nature of
the cycle monitors progress and ensures that corrective actions are influencing information
system security control implementation in the intended way. Frequent performance
measurements will flag actions that are not implemented as planned or do not have the desired
effect, enabling quick course corrections within the organization to avoid problems that could be
uncovered during external audits, C&A efforts, or related activities.
