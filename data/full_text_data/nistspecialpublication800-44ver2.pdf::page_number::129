                                                                     GUIDELINES ON SECURING PUBLIC WEB SERVERS



Securing the Web Server Operating System

     Completed                                              Action
                 Patch and upgrade OS
                 Create, document, and implement a patching process
                 Keep the servers disconnected from networks or on an isolated network that severely
                 restricts communications until all patches have been installed
                 Identify and install all necessary patches and upgrades to the OS
                 Identify and install all necessary patches and upgrades to applications and services
                 included with the OS
                 Identify and mitigate any unpatched vulnerabilities
                 Remove or disable unnecessary services and applications
                 Disable or remove unnecessary services and applications
                 Configure OS user authentication
                 Remove or disable unneeded default accounts and groups
                 Disable non-interactive accounts
                 Create the user groups for the particular computer
                 Create the user accounts for the particular computer
                 Check the organizationâ€™s password policy and set account passwords appropriately
                 (e.g., length, complexity)
                 Prevent password guessing (e.g., increase the period between attempts, deny login
                 after a defined number of failed attempts)
                 Install and configure other security mechanisms to strengthen authentication
                 Configure resource controls appropriately
                 Deny read access to unnecessary files and directories
                 Deny write access to unnecessary files and directories
                 Limit the execution privilege of system tools to system administrators
                 Install and configure additional security controls
                 Select, install, and configure additional software to provide needed controls not
                 included in the OS, such as antivirus software, antispyware software, rootkit detectors,
                 host-based intrusion detection and prevention software, host-based firewalls, and
                 patch management software
                 Test the security of the OS
                 Identify a separate identical system
                 Test OS after initial install to determine vulnerabilities
                 Test OS periodically (e.g., quarterly) to determine new vulnerabilities



Securing the Web Server

     Completed                                              Action
                 Securely install the Web server
                 Install the Web server software on a dedicated host or a dedicated virtualized guest
                 OS
                 Apply any patches or upgrades to correct for known vulnerabilities
                 Create a dedicated physical disk or logical partition (separate from OS and Web
                 server application) for Web content
