 Training Area: Laws & Regulations
..Functional Specialty: Design           & Develop
 Definition    —          Federal government-wide and organization-specific published documents
                          (laws, regulations, policies, guidelines, standards, and codes of conduct)
                          governing mandated requirements and standards for the management and
                          protection of information technology resources.

 Behavioral Outcome           —    Individuals responsible for the design and development of
                                   automated information systems are able to translate IT laws and
                                   regulations into technical specifications which provide adequate and
                                   appropriate levels of protection.

 Sample Learning Objectives —

 At the conclusion of this module, individuals will be able to:

 1.     Beginning   —   Identify laws and regulations relevant to the specific system being designed
        (e.g., a financial management system would be subject to the requirements of the

        Accounting and Auditing Act, whereas a personnel system would be subject to the
        requirements of the Privacy Act).

 2.     Intermediate   —   Interpret applicable laws and regulations to develop security functional
        requirements (e.g., requiring encryption for Privacy Act data stored on a shared file server).

 3.     Advanced    — Evaluate     conflicting functional requirements (e.g., the level of audit trail that
        can be incorporated without adversely affecting system performance) and select for
        implementation those requirements that will provide the highest level of security at the
        minimum cost consistent with applicable laws and regulations.
