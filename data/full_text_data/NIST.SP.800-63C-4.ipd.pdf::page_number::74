       December 2022                                                      Federation and Assertions


1892   10.1. General Usability Considerations
1893   Federated identity systems should:
1894      • Minimize user burden (e.g., frustration, learning curve)
1895           – Minimize the number of user actions required.
1896           – Allow users to quickly and easily select among multiple subscriber accounts
1897              with a single IdP. For example, approaches such as Account Chooser allow
1898              users to select from a list of subscriber accounts they have accessed in the
1899              recent past, rather than start the federation process by selecting their IdP from
1900              a list of potential IdPs.
1901           – Balance minimizing user burden with the need to provide sufficient
1902              information to enable users to make informed decisions.
1903      • Minimize the use of unfamiliar technical jargon and details (e.g., users do not need
1904        to know the terms IdP and RP if the basic concepts are clearly explained).
1905      • Strive for a consistent and integrated user experience across the IdP and RP.
1906      • Help users establish an understanding of identity by providing resources to users
1907        such as graphics, illustrations, FAQs, tutorials and examples. Resources should
1908        explain how users’ information is treated and how transacting parties (e.g., RPs,
1909        IdPs, and brokers) relate to each other.
1910      • Provide clear, honest, and meaningful communications to users (i.e.,
1911        communications should be explicit and easy to understand).
1912      • Provide users online services independent of location and device.
1913      • Make trust relationships explicit to users to facilitate informed trust decisions. Trust
1914        relationships are often dynamic and context dependent. Users may be more likely to
1915        trust some IdPs and RPs with certain attributes or transactions more than others. For
1916        example, users may be more hesitant to use federated identity systems on websites
1917        that contain valuable personal information (such as financial or health). Depending
1918        on the perceived sensitivity of users’ personal data, users may be less comfortable
1919        with social network providers as IdPs since people are often concerned with the
1920        broadcasting nature of social networking implementations.
1921      • Follow the usability considerations specified in [SP800-63A], Sec. 9 for any user-
1922        facing information.
1923      • Clearly communicate how and where to acquire technical assistance. For example,
1924        provide users with information such as a link to an online self-service feature, chat
1925        sessions or a phone number for help desk support. Avoid redirecting users back and
1926        forth among transacting parties (e.g., RPs, IdPs, and brokers) to receive technical
1927        assistance.
1928      • Perform integrative and continuous usability evaluations with representative users
1929        and realistic tasks in an appropriate context to ensure success of federated identity
1930        systems from the users’ perspectives.
