assessments as inputs to Tier 1 risk assessments is shaped by such considerations as: (i) the
similarity of organizational missions/business functions and mission/business processes; and (ii)
the degree of autonomy that organizational entities or subcomponents have with respect to parent
organizations. In decentralized organizations or organizations with varied missions/business
functions and/or environments of operation, expert analysis may be needed to normalize the
results from Tier 2 risk assessments. Finally, risk assessments at Tier 1 take into consideration the
identification of mission-essential functions from Continuity of Operations Plans (COOP) 36
prepared by organizations when determining the contribution of Tier 2 risks. Risk assessment
results at Tier 1 are communicated to organizational entities at Tier 2 and Tier 3.

2.4.2       Risk Assessments at the Mission/Business Process Tier
At Tier 2, risk assessments support the determination of mission/business process protection and
resiliency requirements, and the allocation of those requirements to the enterprise architecture as
part of mission/business segments (that support mission/business processes). This allocation is
accomplished through an information security architecture embedded within the enterprise
architecture. Tier 2 risk assessments also inform and guide decisions on whether, how, and when
to use information systems for specific mission/business processes, in particular for alternative
mission/business processing in the face of compromised information systems. Risk management
and associated risk assessment activities at Tier 2 are closely aligned with the development of
Business Continuity Plans (BCPs). Tier 2 risk assessments focus on mission/business segments,
which typically include multiple information systems, with varying degrees of criticality and/or
sensitivity with regard to core organizational missions/business functions. 37 Risk assessments at
Tier 2 can also focus on information security architecture as a critical component of enterprise
architecture to help organizations select common controls inherited by organizational information
systems at Tier 3. Risk assessment results produced at Tier 2 are communicated to and shared
with organizational entities at Tier 3 to help inform and guide the allocation of security controls
to information systems and environments in which those systems operate. Tier 2 risk assessments
also provide assessments of the security and risk posture of organizational mission/business
processes, which inform assessments of organizational risks at Tier 1. Thus, risk assessment
results at Tier 2 are routinely communicated to organizational entities at Tier 1 and Tier 3.

2.4.3       Risk Assessments at the Information System Tier
The Tier 2 context and the system development life cycle determine the purpose and define the
scope of risk assessment activities at Tier 3. While initial risk assessments (i.e., risk assessments
performed for the first time, rather than updating prior risk assessments) can be performed at any
phase in the system development life cycle, ideally these assessments should be performed in the
Initiation phase.38 In the Initiation phase, risk assessments evaluate the anticipated vulnerabilities
and predisposing conditions affecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information
systems in the context of the planned environments of operation. Such assessments inform risk
response, enabling information system owners/program managers, together with mission/business
owners to make the final decisions about the security controls necessary based on the security
categorization and the environment of operation. Risk assessments are also conducted at later
phases in the system development life cycle, updating risk assessment results from earlier phases.
These risk assessment results for as-built or as-deployed information systems typically include
