NIST SP 800-82r3                                          Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security
September 2023

   •   Implementing a network topology for the OT system that has multiple layers, with the
       most critical communications occurring in the most secure and reliable layer
   •   Providing logical separation between the corporate and OT networks (e.g., stateful
       inspection firewalls between the networks, unidirectional gateways)
   •   Considering where physical separation may be required as opposed to logical separation
   •   Employing a DMZ network architecture (e.g., prevent direct traffic between the corporate
       and OT networks)
   •   Using multi-factor authentication for remote access to the OT system
   •   Ensuring that critical components are redundant and are on redundant networks
   •   Designing critical systems for graceful degradation (fault tolerant) to prevent catastrophic
       cascading events
   •   Disabling unused ports and services on OT devices after testing to ensure that this will
       not impact OT operation
   •   Restricting physical access to the OT network and devices
   •   Restricting OT user privileges to only those that are required to perform each user’s
       function (e.g., establishing role-based access control, configuring each role based on the
       principle of least privilege)
   •   Using separate authentication mechanisms and credentials for users of the OT network
       and the corporate network (i.e., OT network accounts do not use corporate network user
       accounts)
   •   Using modern technology, such as smart cards for user authentication
   •   Implementing security controls (e.g., intrusion detection software, antivirus software, file
       integrity checking software) where technically feasible to prevent, deter, detect, and
       mitigate the introduction, exposure, and propagation of malicious software to, within, and
       from the OT system
   •   Applying security techniques, such as encryption and/or cryptographic hashes, to OT data
       storage and communications where appropriate
   •   Expeditiously deploying security patches after testing all patches under field conditions
       on a test system, if possible, before installation on the OT system
   •   Tracking and monitoring audit trails on critical areas of the OT system
   •   Employing reliable and secure network protocols and services where feasible
