245          Introduction
246   Ongoing cybersecurity and privacy risks require continuous attention. An organization must
247   enlist participation from everyone to reduce and manage its risk. A key component of an
248   organization’s cybersecurity and privacy plans are the Learning Program(s), which helps to build
249   an understanding of risks and explain everyone’s role in identifying, responding to, and
250   managing those risks. While Learning Programs vary in each organization, there are fundamental
251   shared elements that can be utilized to create the Cybersecurity and Privacy Learning Program
252   (CPLP) strategy and establish support for implementation, evaluation, and reporting activities.
253   For ease of use, the remainder of this document will use the term “CPLP” to refer to all elements
254   of cybersecurity and privacy awareness activities and campaigns, including awareness training,
255   practical exercises (e.g. table-top exercises, cyber ranges, or phishing campaigns), topic-based
256   training, role-based training, and education programs.
257   The previous version of this Special Publication defined awareness, training, and education as
258   separate elements in a learning continuum. Research efforts [10] conducted with Federal
259   Government training managers have shown that these terms have different meanings and can
260   lead to confusion when describing the broader purpose of building a CPLP. While managers may
261   refer to programs as “awareness and training” or “awareness training,” the terms are applied
262   inconsistently across organizations. Regardless of what the organization calls its program, the
263   overarching goal is to provide opportunities for learning at all levels or stages of one’s career. It
264   is about creating programs where learning can take place.
265   NIST SP 800-181r1, NICE Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework) [3],
266   refers to an individual who is acquiring specialized knowledge or developing skill as a “learner.”
267   This terminology is useful here as well, so this document will refer to the program as a CPLP or
268   CPLPs, as some organizations may require multiple Programs. Additionally, some organizations
269   may have separate CPLPs.

270          Purpose
271   This document provides guidelines for building and maintaining comprehensive cybersecurity
272   and privacy learning programs (CPLPs) that include awareness activities and campaigns,
273   awareness training, practical exercises, topic-based training, role-based training, and education
274   programs. The document includes guidance on how an organization can create a strategic
275   program plan and ensure that there are appropriate resources to meet the organization’s learning
276   goals.
277   This publication is intended to serve a diverse audience, including:
278      •   Workforce and learning professionals: This group includes human resource planners,
279          training coordinators, curriculum developers, course developers, and those responsible
280          for developing, presenting, and evaluating the training. This document will assist training
281          professionals with the following: understanding cybersecurity and privacy requirements,
282          knowledge, and skills; evaluating the course quality; obtaining the appropriate courses
283          and materials; developing or customizing courses and materials; and tailoring their
284          teaching approaches to achieve the desired learning objectives. Workforce and learning
285          professionals includes:
