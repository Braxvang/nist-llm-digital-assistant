       NIST SP 800-50r1 ipd                                                      Building a Cybersecurity and

1637   The Requirements Document provides detailed and specific criteria related to the content needed
1638   to meet the learning objectives. Typical prompts or questions to review when creating the
1639   Requirements Document include:
1640      •   What specific cybersecurity or privacy risks does the organization seek to address or
1641          reduce?
1642      •   What knowledge or skills should the learner acquire or improve as a result of the CPLP
1643          element?
1644      •   What behaviors need to be addressed or reinforced?
1645      •   Does the material contribute to a positive cybersecurity and privacy culture that
1646          reinforces the role of all users in reducing organizational risk?
1647      •   Will the material engage personnel?
1648      •   What are the budget requirements and timing?
1649      •   Who in the organization will be included in reviews of content development and
1650          approvals?
1651      •   What sort of user testing will be conducted to ensure content is appropriate for the
1652          Learning Program participant; meets their needs and is appropriate to their skill level.

1653   4.1.2. Developing the All User Learning Program
1654   The All User Learning Program elements, as described in Section 2.5.1, are delivered throughout
1655   the year. However, there may be necessary updates to and iterations of the content based on
1656   events and organizational requirements. Ensure that the budget is allocated to update the content
1657   or amend the materials with other delivery methods (e.g., to video training) if making actual
1658   content changes would be cost prohibitive.
1659   The challenge of developing a dynamic and effective All User Learning Program – and
1660   particularly, the cybersecurity and privacy presentation – is that the audience is aware of the
1661   compulsory nature of the program so the materials and presenters must be engaging and hold
1662   their attention. There is much at stake given the ever-changing nature of cybersecurity and
1663   privacy risks to the organization, especially when learners arrive with an expectation that they
1664   only need to do the bare minimum to fulfill their training requirement. However, there will
1665   almost always be new and crucial content for them to understand and master in order minimize
1666   the organization’s risk.
1667   Consider how key messages will be reinforced throughout the All User Learning Program.
1668   Whether it is part of an annual event or shared on awareness materials, repeated messages
1669   become retained messages. Use the awareness program materials to keep the All User Learning
1670   Program topical without becoming repetitive or intrusive. This is a tricky balance to achieve and
1671   requires a variety of delivery formats and messages. Consider varying the awareness program
1672   techniques, such as sending out cybersecurity or privacy topic emails on a monthly basis, adding
1673   a campaign message to everyone’s official organization signature block for Cybersecurity
1674   Awareness Month in October, or Data Privacy Week in January, or place posters in the agency’s
1675   lunchroom all year round.
