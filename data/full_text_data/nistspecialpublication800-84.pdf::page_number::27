5.      Functional Exercises

Functional exercises allow personnel with operational responsibilities to validate their IT plans and their
operational readiness for emergencies by performing their duties in a simulated operational environment.
Activities for a functional exercise are scenario-driven, such as a particular building’s IT systems
becoming unavailable in the simulated environment and the participants then learning that the building is
on fire. Additional situations are often simulated during the course of the exercise. Functional exercises
are designed to exercise specific team members, procedures, and assets involved in one or more
functional aspects of an IT plan (e.g., communications, emergency notifications, IT equipment set-up).
Functional exercises vary in complexity and scope, from validating specific aspects of a plan to full-scale
exercises that address all plan elements. The duration of functional exercises typically lasts from between
several hours to several days, depending on the event’s objectives and the complexity of the plan being
exercised.

This section provides guidance on evaluating the need for a functional exercise, and designing,
developing, conducting, and evaluating a functional exercise. The section then summarizes the key
elements to consider before, during, and after the conduct of a functional exercise. Appendix B provides
functional exercises samples, including a scenario, a tracking form, and an after action report.
5.1     Evaluate the Need for a Functional Exercise and Create a Schedule

As part of the TT&E program, the program coordinator should routinely determine the need for a
functional exercise for a particular IT plan by considering the organization’s overall objectives for
conducting a functional exercise and answering questions such as the following:

       Have the personnel who would participate in the functional exercise been trained on their roles
        and responsibilities within the plan? Have tabletop exercises for the plan been held on which
        potential functional exercises could build? If the personnel have not yet been trained, or initial
        tabletop exercises have not been held, the TT&E program coordinator should consider first
        conducting a training event and a tabletop exercise before the functional exercise so that the
        personnel can participate more effectively in the functional exercise, increasing its benefits.
       When was the last time the organization conducted a functional exercise for the plan?
       Have recent organizational changes impacted the contents of the plan?
       Has new TT&E guidance been issued that could impact the contents of the plan?
Organizations should conduct functional exercises periodically; following organizational changes,
updates to an IT plan, or the issuance of new TT&E guidance; or as otherwise needed. It is usually best
to ensure adequate staff training and tabletop exercises have taken place before engaging in a functional
exercise. The functional exercise schedule should be coordinated closely with the schedules of the other
events of the TT&E program. The TT&E program coordinator usually ensures that functional exercises
are scheduled within a reasonable timeframe after a tabletop exercise event. It is important that when an
exercise is being scheduled, that managers are notified and their approval obtained. Ensuring that
management has agreed to an exercise is an essential step in the development of the exercise.

5.2     Design the Functional Exercise Event

Once the need to conduct a functional exercise has been established, the TT&E program coordinator
should work with the functional exercise design team to design the functional exercise event. The team is
comprised of personnel who are familiar with the plan’s content and can facilitate the exercise design
