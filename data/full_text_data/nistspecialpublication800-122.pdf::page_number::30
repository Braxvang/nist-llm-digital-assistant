                                  GUIDE TO PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)



controls may not be in the recommended set of security controls for the baselines identified in NIST SP
800-53 (e.g., a control might only be recommended for high-impact systems). However, organizations
may choose to provide greater protections than what is recommended; see Section 3.2 for a discussion of
factors to consider when choosing the appropriate controls. In addition to the controls listed below, NIST
SP 800-53 contains many other controls that can be used to help protect PII, such as incident response
controls.

 Access Enforcement (AC-3). Organizations can control access to PII through access control policies
  and access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists). This can be done in many ways. One
  example is implementing role-based access control and configuring it so that each user can access
  only the pieces of data necessary for the user‘s role. Another example is only permitting users to
  access PII through an application that tightly restricts their access to the PII, instead of permitting
  users to directly access the databases or files containing PII.63 Encrypting stored information is also
  an option for implementing access enforcement.64 OMB M-07-16 specifies that Federal agencies
  must ―encrypt, using only NIST certified cryptographic modules, all data on mobile
  computers/devices carrying agency data unless the data is determined not to be sensitive, in writing,
  by your Deputy Secretary or a senior-level individual he/she may designate in writing‖.
 Separation of Duties (AC-5). Organizations can enforce separation of duties for duties involving
  access to PII. For example, the users of de-identified PII data would not also be in roles that permit
  them to access the information needed to re-identify the records.
 Least Privilege (AC-6). Organizations can enforce the most restrictive set of rights/privileges or
  accesses needed by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) for the performance of specified
  tasks. Concerning PII, the organization can ensure that users who must access records containing PII
  only have access to the minimum amount of PII, along with only those privileges (e.g., read, write,
  execute) that are necessary to perform their job duties.
 Remote Access (AC-17). Organizations can choose to prohibit or strictly limit remote access to PII.
  If remote access is permitted, the organization should ensure that the communications are encrypted.
 User-Based Collaboration and Information Sharing (AC-21). Organizations can provide
  automated mechanisms to assist users in determining whether access authorizations match access
  restrictions, such as contractually-based restrictions, for PII.
 Access Control for Mobile Devices (AC-19). Organizations can choose to prohibit or strictly limit
  access to PII from portable and mobile devices, such as laptops, cell phones, and personal digital
  assistants (PDA), which are generally higher-risk than non-portable devices (e.g., desktop computers
  at the organization‘s facilities). Some organizations may choose to restrict remote access involving
  higher-impact instances of PII so that the information will not leave the organization‘s physical
  boundaries. If access is permitted, the organization can ensure that the devices are properly secured
  and regularly scan the devices to verify their security status (e.g., anti-malware software enabled and
  up-to-date, operating system fully patched).
 Auditable Events (AU-2). Organizations can monitor events that affect the confidentiality of PII,
  such as unauthorized access to PII.

     For example, suppose that an organization has a database containing thousands of records on employees‘ benefits. Instead
     of allowing a user to have full and direct access to the database, which could allow the user to save extracts of the database
     records to the user‘s computer, removable media, or other locations, the organization could permit the user to access only
     the necessary records and record fields. A user could be restricted to accessing only general demographic information and
     not any information related to the employees‘ identities.
