that will be repeated throughout the document and to help frame the upcoming
discussions:
       Mandatory-to-implement vs. optional-to-implement,
       Cryptographic negotiation,
       Single or multi-use keys, and
       Algorithm and key size transitions.

1.3.1 Mandatory-to-Implement versus Optional-to-Implement
Many of the cryptographic security services described in this document are based on
public standards (e.g., Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Requests for Comment
(RFCs), American National Standards, etc.). In these standards, algorithms are frequently
described as mandatory-to-implement or optional-to-implement. Neither of these terms
provides information about the security of the algorithm.

Mandatory-to-implement algorithms will be in any product that meets the public
standards, allowing interoperability between products.

Optional-to-implement algorithms tend to be next-generation algorithms that may
become mandatory-to-implement algorithms in a future version of the standard. There
could be considerable delay in the widespread use of these new algorithms for a variety
of reasons, ranging from a need for supporting hardware or software upgrades, to issues
of interoperability. For example, an algorithm that is optional-to-implement within an
S/MIME protocol may not currently be supported by the system’s cryptographic module.
However, these algorithms often offer improved security that could significantly increase
the longevity of the system. Therefore, one may want to consider buying products that
support the optional-to-implement algorithms, even if those algorithms will not be
available to all end users immediately.

As previously defined, the terms shall and should are used to provide information about
whether algorithms have adequate security for use on federal computer networks. As
such, there may be mandatory-to-implement algorithms that do not provide adequate
security (e.g., Data Encryption Standard (DES) or RC2), and this document will say they
shall not be used. Similarly, there may be optional-to-implement algorithms that have
greater security (e.g., Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)), and this document may say
that these algorithms should or shall be used in a given situation.

The distinction between mandatory-to-implement and optional-to-implement is important
when two users on different systems desire to communicate or when different levels of
security may be required for different applications running on the same system. This is
further discussed in the next section on cryptographic negotiation.


1.3.2    Cryptographic Negotiation
Parts 1 and 2 of this Recommendation establish a sound basis for selecting appropriate
cryptographic algorithms and managing the corresponding cryptographic keys. However,
enforcing these guidelines can be problematic for a number of reasons, including the
