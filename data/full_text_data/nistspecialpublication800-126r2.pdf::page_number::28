              The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2



See Section 4.5.1 for information on the meaning of a “pass/fail” rule result relating to each of the
identifier types in Table 15. All rules that contain CCE, CPE, or CVE entries in their <xccdf:ident>
elements MUST obey these meanings. As a result, such <xccdf:ident> elements MUST only be
included either if the recommendation is identical to these associated meanings or if they have a
@con:negate attribute (as described in Section 4.5.1) set to comply with the intended meaning (by
default, @con:negate is set to false). In SCAP, an <xccdf:ident> element is not simply a
reference to related material – it is a declaration of exact alignment with the described meanings.
An <xccdf:ident> element referencing a CVE, CCE, or CPE identifier SHALL be ordered before
other <xccdf:ident> elements referencing non-SCAP identifiers. Identifiers from previous revisions
of CCE or CPE MAY also be specified following the SCAP identifiers.

3.2.4.2 The <xccdf:check> Element
The following requirements and recommendations apply to the <xccdf:check> element:
   1. The <xccdf:check-content> element SHALL NOT be used to embed check content
      directly into XCCDF content.
   2. At least one <xccdf:check-content-ref> element MUST be provided for each
      <xccdf:check> element.
   3. When evaluating an <xccdf:check-content-ref> element within an <xccdf:check>
      element, its @href attribute either MUST contain a “#” + @id of a <ds:component-ref>
      element or MUST be resolved in the context of the XML Catalog specified as part of the
      <ds:component-ref> element that is referencing this benchmark. In either case, the @href
      attribute MUST ultimately resolve to a <ds:component-ref> element in the data stream
      referencing the benchmark containing this <xccdf:check-content-ref> element. See
      Section 3.1.1 for additional information on <ds:component-ref> resolution.
This version of SCAP supports the OVAL and OCIL check systems. Use of these check systems SHALL
be restricted as follows:
   1. OVAL check system
        i. Use of the OVAL check system SHALL be indicated by setting the <xccdf:check>
           element’s @system attribute to “http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-
           definitions-5 ”.
       ii. The @href attribute in the <xccdf:check-content-ref> element MUST reference
           an OVAL source data stream component using the <ds:component-ref> approach
           defined above.
      iii. Use of the @name attribute in the <xccdf:check-content-ref> element is
           OPTIONAL. If present, it MUST reference an OVAL Definition in the designated OVAL
           source data stream component, otherwise see Section 4.5.2 for information on use of the
           @multi-check attribute.
   2. OCIL check system
        i. OCIL questionnaires SHOULD NOT be used if OVAL can perform the same check
           correctly.
       ii. Use of the OCIL check system SHALL be indicated by setting the <xccdf:check>
           element’s @system attribute to “http://scap.nist.gov/schema/ocil/2”.
      iii. The @href attribute in the <xccdf:check-content-ref> element MUST reference
           an OCIL source data stream component using the <ds:component-ref> approach
           defined above.
