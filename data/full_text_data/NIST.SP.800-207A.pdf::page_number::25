       Comparison of Identity-Tier and Network-Tier Policies
Network-tier policies are necessary for geographically distributed application infrastructures and
for meeting the compliance requirements of regulators. However, having a combination of
network-tier and identity-tier policies allows for some relaxation of the network-tier policies as
any unauthorized traffic flow due to an overlooked network element in the path can be addressed
through flexible service identity-tier policies. In order to appreciate the need for the coexistence
of both policy tiers, it is necessary to know the characteristics of both tiers of policies. This
layering of policies, whose strictness can be tuned per organizational needs at each tier, provides
agility and operational ease over status quo perimeter-based models while enhancing the overall
security posture of the organization.

4.6.1. Approaches for Deployment and the Limitations of Network-Tier Policies
In this approach, applications and service resources with similar security requirements are
grouped into a unique segment, and firewall rules are created to block or allow communication
with each group or segment [5]. The segments are created using network layer abstractions (e.g.,
Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) IDs or some other tagging approaches), while policies are
defined using network address constructs (e.g., IP addresses and ports). Policies apply to subnets
(e.g., VLANs) rather than to individual hosts. The assignment of applications to a particular
segment can be based on different criteria, such as “all applications with similar security
requirements” or “all tiers (e.g., web front end, application logic servers, and database servers)
associated with a particular application should run in a single segment”.
Each segment is protected by gateway devices, such as intelligent switches and routers or next-
generation firewalls, that should have the capacity to react and adapt in response to the threats
and changes in the application workflows. Segmentation gateways monitor traffic, stop threats,
and enforce granular access across east-west traffic (rarely for north-south traffic) within on-
premises data centers or cloud regions. The main difficulty with this approach is in mapping the
applications’ security requirements-based segments to corresponding network segments. Another
difficulty is change management. The mapping between applications and network identities that
are being statically maintained has to be kept in sync with the operational scenario in which the
application’s network locations are continuously changing due to performance and security.
More modern cloud-native deployments that leverage techniques like container network
interface-driven network policy are good improvements because they provide identity-tier style
policies (i.e., policy in terms of identities and non-network-oriented nouns) while implementing
that policy at the network layer (e.g., via Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) policy or
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) propagation rules). These are a strong upgrade from traditional
microsegmentation because they tend to result in finer-grained policies that are easier for the
organization to manage over time. However, they typically lack the ability to apply per-request
policies in the context of the application, which is needed to achieve identity-based
segmentation.
