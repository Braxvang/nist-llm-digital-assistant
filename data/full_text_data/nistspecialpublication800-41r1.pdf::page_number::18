organization across the Internet, and sometimes to provide secure remote user access to internal
organizational networks via the Internet. Two common choices for secure VPNs are IPsec 6 and Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS). 7

The two most common VPN architectures are gateway-to-gateway and host-to-gateway. 8 Gateway-to-
gateway architectures connect multiple fixed sites over public lines through the use of VPN gateways—
for example, to connect branch offices to an organization’s headquarters. A VPN gateway is usually part
of another network device such as a firewall or router. When a VPN connection is established between the
two gateways, users at branch locations are unaware of the connection and do not require any special
settings on their computers. The second type of architecture, host-to-gateway, provides a secure
connection to the network for individual users, usually called remote users, who are located outside of the
organization (at home, in a hotel, etc.) Here, a client on the user machine negotiates the secure connection
with the organization’s VPN gateway. 9 For gateway-to-gateway and host-to-gateway VPNs, the VPN
functionality is often part of the firewall itself. Placing it behind the firewall would require VPN traffic to
be passed through the firewall while encrypted, preventing the firewall from inspecting the traffic.

All remote access (host-to-gateway) VPNs allow the firewall administrator to decide which users have
access to which network resources. This access control is normally available on a per-user and per-group
basis; that is, the VPN policy can specify which users and groups are authorized to access which
resources, should an organization need that level of granularity. VPNs generally rely on authentication
protocols such as Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS). 10 RADIUS uses several
different types of authentication credentials, with the most common examples being username and
password, digital signatures, and hardware tokens. Another authentication protocol often used by VPNs is
the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP); it is particularly useful for making access decisions
for individual users and groups.

To run VPN functionality on a firewall requires additional resources that depend on the amount of traffic
flowing across the VPN and the type of encryption being used. For some environments, the added traffic
associated with VPNs might require additional capacity planning and resources. Planning is also needed
to determine the type of VPN (gateway-to-gateway and/or host-to-gateway) that should be included in the
firewall. Many firewalls include hardware acceleration for encryption to minimize the impact of VPN
services.

2.1.7    Network Access Control

Another common requirement for firewalls at the edge of a network is to perform client checks for
incoming connections from remote users and allow or disallow access based on those checks. This
checking, commonly called network access control (NAC) or network access protection (NAP), allows
access based on the user’s credentials and the results of performing “health checks” on the user’s
computer. Health checks typically consist of verifying that one or more of the following comply with
organizational policy:

     Host-to-gateway architectures usually require some user participation, such as initiating the VPN connection or providing
     credentials to the VPN for authentication.
