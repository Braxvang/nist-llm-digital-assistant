      NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)                                      Cloud Computing Forensic
      February 2023                                                                      Reference Architecture

380   Figure 1 depicts the overlaying approach in which cloud functional capabilities comprising the
381   EA are analyzed using the NIST cloud computing forensic challenges to identify the functional
382   capabilities’ potential for supporting a cloud system’s forensic readiness.

386   The bottom layer in Figure 1 graphically represents the NIST cloud security reference
387   architecture (SRA). The middle layer represents the NIST cloud forensic challenges. The top
388   layer represents the NIST forensic reference architecture (FRA) described in the current
389   document as an overlay (subset) of the graphical representation of the CSA EA – more precisely,
390   the CSA TCI v1.1, which is the initial version of the CSA’s EA (see Appendix C).
391   In Figure 1, the FRA layer leverages the two layers graphically represented beneath it by
392   analyzing each capability of the SRA (these capabilities being derived from the CSA EA) in the
393   context of the challenges documented in NIST IR 8006 [1]. For each challenge, the analysis
394   determines whether the challenge affects the capability if implemented in a cloud environment as
395   part of a cloud service or solution. If the challenge affects the capability, then the functional
396   capability is considered to have forensic importance, and it is imported to or considered being a
397   capability of the FRA.
