NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1                                                Guidelines for Media Sanitization


Clear, Purge, and Destroy are actions that can be taken to sanitize media. The categories of
sanitization are defined as follows:

      Clear applies logical techniques to sanitize data in all user-addressable storage locations
       for protection against simple non-invasive data recovery techniques; typically applied
       through the standard Read and Write commands to the storage device, such as by
       rewriting with a new value or using a menu option to reset the device to the factory state
       (where rewriting is not supported).

      Purge applies physical or logical techniques that render Target Data recovery infeasible
       using state of the art laboratory techniques.

      Destroy renders Target Data recovery infeasible using state of the art laboratory
       techniques and results in the subsequent inability to use the media for storage of data.

A more detailed summary of sanitization techniques is provided in Section 5. Sanitization
requirements for specific media/device types are provided in Appendix A.

It is suggested that the user of this guide categorize the information, assess the nature of the
medium on which it is recorded, assess the risk to confidentiality, and determine the future plans
for the media. Then, the organization can choose the appropriate type(s) of sanitization. The
selected type(s) should be assessed as to cost, environmental impact, etc., and a decision should
be made that best mitigates the risk to confidentiality and best satisfies other constraints imposed
on the process.

 2.6 Use of Cryptography and Cryptographic Erase

Many storage manufacturers have released storage devices with integrated encryption and access
control capabilities, also known as Self-Encrypting Drives (SEDs). SEDs feature always-on
encryption that substantially reduces the likelihood that unencrypted data is inadvertently
retained on the device. The end user cannot turn off the encryption capabilitieswhich ensures that
all data in the designated areas are encrypted. A significant additional benefit of SEDs is the
opportunity to tightly couple the controller and storage media so that the device can directly
address the location where any cryptographic keys are stored, whereas solutions that depend only
on the abstracted user access interface through software may not be able to directly address those
areas.

SEDs typically encrypt all of the user-addressable area, with the potential exception of certain
clearly identified areas, such as those dedicated to the storage of pre-boot applications and
associated data.

Cryptographic Erase (CE) leverages the encryption of target data by enabling sanitization of the
target data’s encryption key. This leaves only the ciphertext remaining on the media, effectively
sanitizing the data by preventing read-access.

Without the encryption key used to encrypt the target data, the data is unrecoverable. The level
of effort needed to decrypt this information without the encryption key then is the lesser of the
