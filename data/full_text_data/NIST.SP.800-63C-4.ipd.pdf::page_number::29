726   Most federations managed through authorities have a simple membership model: parties
727   are either in the federation or they are not. More sophisticated federations MAY have
728   multiple membership tiers that federated parties can use to tell whether other parties in the
729   federation have been more thoroughly vetted. IdPs MAY decide that certain subscriber
730   attributes are only releasable to RPs in higher tiers and RPs MAY decide to accept certain
731   information only from IdPs in higher tiers.

732   5.1.3. Proxied Federation
733   In a proxied federation, all communication between the IdP and the RP is passed through
734   an intermediary party in a way that prevents direct communication between the two
735   parties. There are multiple methods to achieve this effect. Common configurations
736   include:
737       • A third party that acts as a federation proxy (or broker)
738       • A network of nodes that distributes the communications and functions as a proxy
739         between the endpoints
740   Where proxies are used, they function as an IdP on one side and an RP on the other.
741   Therefore, all normative requirements that apply to IdPs and RPs SHALL apply to
742   proxies in their respective roles.

743   A proxied federation model can provide several benefits. Federation proxies can simplify
744   technical integration between the RP and IdP by providing a common interface for
745   integration. Additionally, to the extent a proxy effectively blinds the RP and IdP from
746   each other, it can provide some business confidentiality for organizations that want to
747   guard their subscriber lists from each other. Proxies can also mitigate some of the privacy
748   risks described in Sec. 5.5 below.
749   See Sec. 9.5 for further information on blinding techniques, their uses, and limitations.
750   Federations presented through a proxy SHALL be represented by the lowest FAL used
751   during the proxied transaction. For example, if a proxy takes in an assertion from the IdP
752   at FAL2 but presents a downstream assertion to the RP at FAL1, the entire transaction is
