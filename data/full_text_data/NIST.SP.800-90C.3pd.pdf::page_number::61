       NIST SP 800-90C 3pd (Third Public Draft)                         Recommendation for RBG Constructions
       September 2022

1686   6.2.1.3.        Pseudorandom Bit Generation Using a Directly Accessible DRBG
1687   Pseudorandom bit generation by a direct access of the DRBG is accomplished as specified in
1688   Section 5.2.2 using the state handle obtained during instantiation (see Section 6.2.1.1).
1689   When directly accessing the DRBG instantiation that is also used by the RBG3(XOR)
1690   construction, the following function is used:
1691               (status, returned_bits) = Generate_function(RBG3(XOR)_state_handle,
1692        requested_number_of_bits, requested_security_strength, prediction_resistance_request,
1693                                          additional_input),
1694   where:
1695       •    RBG3(XOR)_state_handle indicates the DRBG instantiation to be used.
1696       •    requested_security_strength ≤ 256.
1697       •    prediction-resistance-request is either TRUE or FALSE; requesting prediction resistance
1698            during the Generate_function is optional.
1699       •    The use of additional input is optional.
1700   Note that when prediction resistance is requested, the Generate_function will invoke the
1701   Reseed_function (see Section 6.2.1.3). If sufficient entropy is not available for reseeding, an error
1702   indication shall be returned, and the requested bits shall not be generated.

1703   6.2.1.4.        Reseeding the DRBG Instantiations
1704   Reseeding is performed using the entropy sources in the same manner as an RBG2 construction
1705   using the appropriate state handle (e.g., RBG3(XOR)_state_handle, as specified in Section 6.2.1.1).

1706   6.2.2. RBG3(XOR) Requirements
1707   An RBG3(XOR) construction has the following requirements in addition to those provided in
1708   Section 6.2:
1709       1. Bitstrings with full entropy shall be provided to the XOR operation either directly from the
1710          concatenated output of one or more validated physical entropy sources or by an external
1711          conditioning function using the output of one or more validated entropy sources as
1712          specified in Method 1 of Section 2.3. In the latter case, the output of validated non-physical
1713          entropy sources may be used without counting any entropy that they might provide.
1714       2. The same entropy-source outputs used by the DRBG for instantiation or reseeding shall
1715          not be used as input into the RBG’s XOR operation.
1716       3. The DRBG instantiations shall be reseeded occasionally (e.g., after a predetermined period
1717          of time or number of generation requests).
