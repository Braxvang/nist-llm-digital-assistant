Digital signature     The result of applying two cryptographic functions (a hash
                      function, followed by a digital signature function; see FIPS 186-
                      3 for details). When the functions are properly implemented, the
                      digital signature provides origin authentication, data integrity
                      protection and signatory non-repudiation.
Hash algorithm        See hash function. “Hash algorithm” and “hash function” are
                      used interchangeably in this Recommendation.
Hash function         A function that maps a bit string of arbitrary length to a fixed-
                      length bit string. The function is expected to have the following
                      three properties:
                        1. Collision resistance (see Collision resistance),
                        2. Preimage resistance (see Preimage resistance) and
                        3. Second preimage resistance (see Second preimage
                           resistance).
                      Approved hash functions are specified in
                      [FIPS 180-4].
Hash output           See “message digest”.
Hash value            See “message digest”.
Key                   A parameter used with a cryptographic algorithm that
                      determines its operation in such a way that an entity with
                      knowledge of the key can reproduce or reverse the operation,
                      while an entity without knowledge of the key cannot. Examples
                      applicable to this Recommendation include:
                        1. The computation of a keyed-hash message authentication
                           code.
                        2. The verification of a keyed-hash message authentication
                           code.
                        3. The generation of a digital signature on a message.
                        4. The verification of a digital signature.
Key Derivation Key    A key used as an input to a key derivation function to derive
                      other keys.
Keying Material       A bit string, such that any non-overlapping segments of the
                      string with the required lengths can be used as symmetric
                      cryptographic keys and secret parameters, such as initialization
                      vectors.
L-bit Hash Function   A hash function for which the length of the output is L bits.
MAC algorithm         An algorithm that computes a MAC from a message and a key.
