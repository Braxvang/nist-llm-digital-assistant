 enable us to answer questions such as “Are we more secure
 now than yesterday?” or “How does the security of one network
 configuration compare with another one?” Also, having a
 standard model to measure network security will allow users,
 vendors, and researchers to evaluate methodologies and
 products for network security in a coherent and consistent
 manner.
   CSD has approached the challenge of network security
 analysis by capturing vulnerability interdependencies and
 measuring security based on how real attackers have penetrated
 networks. CSD’s methodology for security risk analysis is based
 on attack graphs. CSD analyzes attack paths through a network,
 providing a probabilistic metric of the overall system risk.                      Figure 22: Algorithms for Intrusion Measurement
 Through this metric, CSD analyzes trade-offs between security
 costs and security benefits.                                               The Algorithms for Intrusion Measurement (AIM) project, newly
