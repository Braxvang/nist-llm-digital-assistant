      NIST SP 800-63C-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                                      Federation and Assertions


374   instructive to break it down into its component interactions: the subscriber to the IdP,
375   the IdP to the RP, and the subscriber to the RP. Each party in a federation protocol bears
376   specific responsibilities and expectations that must be fulfilled in order for the federated
377   system to function as intended.
378   The IdP maintains a record for the subscriber that augments the subscriber account
379   defined in [SP800-63A] with a set of federation-specific items, including but not limited
380   to the following:
381       • One or more external subject identifiers, for use with a federation protocol
382       • A set of access rights, detailing which RPs can access which attributes of the
383         subscriber account (such as runtime decisions by the subscriber)
384       • Federated account usage information
385       • Additional attributes collected or assigned by the IdP to the subscriber
386   The RP often maintains an RP subscriber account for the subscriber, which is derived
387   from the augmented subscriber account information disclosed to the RP by the IdP. The
388   RP subscriber account also contains information local to the RP itself, as described in
389   Sec. 5.4.
390   The requirements in this document build on the requirements in the other volumes of
391   these guidelines. Authentication between the subscriber and the IdP will be based on the
392   authentication mechanisms presented in [SP800-63B], while the federation protocol will
393   convey attributes to the RP established at the IdP using procedures in [SP800-63A] (along
394   with other attributes).
