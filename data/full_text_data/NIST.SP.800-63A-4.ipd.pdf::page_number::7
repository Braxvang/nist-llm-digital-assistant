      NIST SP 800-63A-4 ipd                                              Digital Identity Guidelines
      December 2022                                                Enrollment and Identity Proofing


178             – What technologies or methods can be applied to develop a remote, unattended
179               IAL2 identity proofing process that demonstrably mitigates the same risks as
180               the current IAL2 process?
181             – Are these technologies supported by existing or emerging technical standards?
182             – Do these technologies have established metrics and testing methodologies to
183               allow for assessment of performance and understanding of impacts across user
184               populations (e.g., bias in artificial intelligence)?
185      • What methods exist for integrating digital evidence (e.g., Mobile Driver’s Licenses,
186        Verifiable Credentials) into identity proofing at various identity assurance levels?
187      • What are the impacts, benefits, and risks of specifying a set of requirements
188        for CSPs to establish and maintain fraud detection, response, and notification
189        capabilities?
190             – Are there existing fraud checks (e.g., date of death) or fraud prevention
191               techniques (e.g., device fingerprinting) that should be incorporated as baseline
192               normative requirements? If so, at what assurance levels could these be
193               applied?
194             – How might emerging methods such as fraud analytics and risk scoring be
195               further researched, standardized, measured, and integrated into the guidance in
196               the future?
197             – What accompanying privacy and equity considerations should be addressed
198               alongside these methods?
199      • Are current testing programs for liveness detection and presentation attack
200        detection sufficient for evaluating the performance of implementations and
201        technologies?
202      • What impacts would the proposed biometric performance requirements for identity
203        proofing have on real-world implementations of biometric technologies?
204   General
205      • Is there an element of this guidance that you think is missing or could be expanded?
206      • Is any language in the guidance confusing or hard to understand? Should we add
207        definitions or additional context to any language?
208      • Does the guidance sufficiently address privacy?
209      • Does the guidance sufficiently address equity?
210             – What equity assessment methods, impact evaluation models, or metrics
211               could we reference to better support organizations in preventing or detecting
212               disparate impacts that could arise as a result of identity verification
213               technologies or processes?
