NIST SP 800-160v1r1                                                                                Engineering Trustworthy Secure Systems
November 2022

•    Failure Propagation
     All systems fail at some point. When a failure occurs, another failure scenario or the creation
     of a new failure scenario should not be triggered or invoked (Protective Failure). Designing
     without single points of failure (Redundancy) – including not having common mode failures
     (Diversity) – can help isolate system element failures while providing the required system
     capabilities. Additionally, the response to failure should not lead to loss or other failures
     (Protective Recovery).
•    Anomaly Detection
     Anomaly Detection provides situational awareness that allows the system to decide and
     recommend corrective actions to account for actual and potential deviations from accepted
     norms.
•    Trades
     Not every system element has trustworthiness that is sufficient for its intended purpose. A
     deficiency in trustworthiness can result from:
     -     Technical feasibility and practicality issues
     -     Cost and schedule issues of what is feasible and practical
     -     The limits of certainty (i.e., what is not known, what cannot be known, and what is
           underappreciated [known or could be known but dismissed prematurely])
     The trade space is the rigorous application of the design principles that provide a basis for the
     necessary design decisions to maximize the trustworthiness of individual system elements
     and aggregates of elements. For example, in addressing the feasibility and practicality of cost
     and schedule issues, the design principle of minimizing the number of system elements that
     must be trusted (Minimal Trusted Elements) is applied. This reduces the size and scope of the
     effort and potentially reduces the expense of generating evidence of trustworthiness.

F.2.       Assurance
Assurance is the grounds for justified confidence that a claim or set of claims has been or will be
achieved [61]. Assurance is a complex and multi-dimensional property of the system that builds
over time. Assurance must be planned, established, and maintained in alignment with the system
throughout the system life cycle.

Adequate security judgments should be based on the level of confidence in the ability of the
system to protect itself against asset loss and the associated consequences across all forms of
adversity. 88 It cannot be based solely on individual efforts, such as demonstrating compliance,
functional testing, or adversarial penetration tests. Judgments include what the system cannot do,
will not do, or cannot be forced to do. These judgments of non-behavior must be grounded in
sufficient confidence in the system’s ability to correctly deliver its intended function in the
presence and absence of adversity and to do so when used in accordance with its design intent.


88
  The term adversity refers to those conditions that can cause a loss of assets (e.g., threats, attacks, vulnerabilities, hazards, disruptions, and
exposures).
