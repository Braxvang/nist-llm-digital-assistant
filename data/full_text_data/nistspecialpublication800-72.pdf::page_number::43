                                                                           Guidelines on PDA Forensics



6. Acquisition

     Acquisition is the process of imaging or otherwise obtaining information from a digital device
     and its peripheral equipment and media. Acquisition should occur at a forensics laboratory
     once the seized information has been safely checked in. The advantage of performing
     acquisition at the scene is that loss of information due to battery depletion, damage, etc. is
     avoided. However, finding a controlled setting in which to work, having the appropriate
     equipment, and satisfying other prerequisites may not occur at the scene, but instead be
     available within a laboratory setting. For the purpose of discussion, in this section a laboratory
     environment is assumed.

     Once the device has arrived at the forensic laboratory, the forensic examiner begins the
     acquisition with identification of the device. The type of device and operating system present
     on the device determines the route to take for the creation of a sound bit-for-bit image or
     otherwise acquiring the contents of the device. Only a few different forensic software tools
     that image PDAs currently exist and no one application presently handles the full range of
     devices on the market [Aye04]. The type of PDA and operating system, therefore, generally
     dictates which application to use in an investigation.

     Normally, the forensic toolkit used for acquisition is also the one used for examination and
     analysis. Where there is a choice among several tools, such as with Palm OS devices,
     interoperability among acquisition and examination facilities may exist, as shown in Table 4.
     The entries therein show the results of data acquired with one tool, indicated by the row
     header, analyzed by another, indicated by the column header. Interoperability is an important
     aspect for consideration, since some tools may be limited to specific operating system versions
     or may not support certain device models. Moreover, occasionally one forensic tool may fail
     to acquire information from a specific device, while another tool works without problems.
