5.2.3     Sensor Locations

Choosing sensor locations for a wireless IDPS deployment is a fundamentally different problem than
choosing locations for any other type of IDPS sensor. If the organization uses WLANs, wireless sensors
should be deployed so that they monitor the RF range of the organization’s WLANs (both APs and
STAs), which often includes mobile components such as laptops and PDAs. Many organizations also
want to deploy sensors to monitor physical regions of their facilities where there should be no WLAN
activity, as well as channels and bands that the organization’s WLANs should not use, as a way of
detecting rogue APs and ad hoc WLANs. Other considerations for selecting wireless sensor locations
include the following:

 Physical Security. Sensors are often deployed into open locations (e.g., hallway ceilings, conference
  rooms) because their range is much greater there than in closed locations (e.g., wiring closets).
  Sensors are sometimes deployed outdoors as well. 35 Generally, sensors in open interior locations and
  external locations are more susceptible to physical threats than other sensors. If the physical threats
  are significant, organizations might need to select sensors with anti-tamper features or deploy sensors
  where they are less likely to be physically accessed (e.g., within view of a security camera).

     Special sensors are available for outdoor use that offer better resistance to environmental threats than regular sensors.
